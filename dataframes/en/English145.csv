"Democratise, govern well, fight corruption or face the wrath of the people.'"
"This message is not only for the Arab world."
"Yesterday it was relayed in Diyarbakir in Turkey, and in Teheran and other Iranian cities."
"The people can do it!"
"Mr President, I am delighted that the High Representative will be the first and most senior foreign diplomat to visit Egypt, and following this debate she will take with her Parliament's support for the immediate release of political prisoners, for legal accountability for those responsible for the violent suppression of peaceful protest and for an asset freeze and other actions for the authors of past human rights abuse."
"Commissioner, this was the social media revolution, planned in an Internet cafe, with Wael Ghonim of Google one of its heroes."
"But companies like Vodafone must learn the lesson of turning off their services and we should call on them to join the global network initiative alongside human rights organisations to show that they will defend the principle of freedom of expression where it is under threat."
"Finally, this Parliament was shy of discussing Tunisia; we debated Tunisia as Egyptians took to the streets and today debate Egypt when perhaps we should be asking ourselves how we can better support democratic transition now in Yemen, Syria, Libya and elsewhere in the Arab world before people have to die in the streets of their capitals to shame Europe and the world into so doing."
"(FR) Mr President, I do not believe that history would forgive us if the events that have just occurred and are continuing to occur were to prove beyond us."
"I therefore believe that it is very important for the European Union to be able to draw conclusions quickly from its relative invisibility, to put it mildly, during the recent events."
"That is why I believe that no effort must be spared, that we must offer our full and unconditional support to the democratic transition process, both in Tunisia and in Egypt, that we must be on the side of these peoples and must tell them so, and that we must do everything in our power to ensure that the rule of law emerges, stronger, from these revolutions and these changes, particularly in the case of Egypt."
"I believe that the rule of law alone will provide an element of stability and serve to stabilise the entire region."
"In other words, this is extremely important."
"We must organise a donor conference and, above all, we should not be scared."
"These revolutions are secular revolutions on the part of Tunisians and Egyptians who simply want democracy and development, which are intrinsically linked."
"However, we should review our neighbourhood policy and explore the issue of relations between states, but also relations between different public opinions."
"This is precisely the role of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, today we are having a very different debate to the one that took place only a matter of days ago in this Chamber."
"It is essential that the people of Egypt should know that we are standing by them."
"I welcome the fact that our High Representative is currently in that part of the world."
"The people of Egypt are now reliant upon the army to come forward and deliver free and fair elections, to bring about the sort of society that they have paid for with their lives and blood."
"It is now for the international community to make sure that we step in to help them build their institutions and allow the political parties to come forward and take part in those election processes."
"I hope that the European Union will play its part in that."
"Finally, Commissioner, the siphoning-off of funds by leaders in developing countries is something we are only too well aware of."
"It is about time that Europe said that we refuse to be used as a vehicle for such people to park their funds any more."
"(asking Mr Madlener a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Mr President, the tragic outcome of the Egyptian transition to democracy has been described."
"It has been said that it was inevitable that Islamic fundamentalists would take over power democratically, and so on and so on."
"Do you not think that this picture is catastrophic, and wrong?"
"Why do we not take into account the fact that the reasons for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism in the Middle East are strongly linked to tyrannical governments, and that there is now an opportunity for democratic regimes to reduce both?"
"(NL) Mr President, I am outlining here one of the real dangers that Egypt is facing, namely that it might fall prey to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood."
"I am also calling on us and the Commission to face up to that risk and to send out an important signal to the Egyptians, and that is that they can forget our support if they opt for the Muslim Brotherhood and sharia."
"That is, I think, a very important signal to send out today and I hope that you will support me in this."
"(RO) Mr President, 18 days of riots, Hosni Mubarak's resignation and the taking of control by the Supreme Military Council basically pave the way for transition."
"We hope that this will be a transition to democracy."
"The situation is without doubt evolving, at a rate which revolutionary events basically do."
"As you are aware, the constitution was suspended and parliament dissolved recently, and the committee set up to revise the constitution is proposing to make changes in 10 days and hold legislative and presidential elections in six months."
"I believe that the European Union must use every means to support any move indicating democratic transition."
"On the other hand, I would like to warn against a certain degree of haste because all these construction processes require a certain amount of time."
"Let us not forget either that the democratic forces are in critical need of renewal and strengthening so as to avoid causing an imbalance in the political landscape."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt: from the virtual community on Facebook to the real one, with millions of people seeking fairer distribution of wealth and greater justice, and protesting against corruption."
"We must move on from the transition period of soldiers and tanks to a true democracy: a new constitution, new elections, abolition of the death penalty, more humane prisons, social rights and freedom."
"It will be difficult."
"Those who are willing to deploy any means in the name of an idea are lying in wait."
"We want to believe in the great Egyptian people, who have not, however, ever experienced democracy."
"We want a secular democracy, with a distinct separation between religious authority and political power, a democracy that integrates minorities and establishes true rights: to public healthcare, social security and work."
"Europe is supporting this approach by investing resources with the ability to promote real development in Egypt: no more dictatorships, no more misery, no more poverty."
"Mr President, colleagues will have received an e-mail from me on Monday describing my experiences during an informal visit to Cairo last weekend."
"It was a privilege to be there as Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Mr Kasoulides referred to the role of young people in the recent revolution in Egypt."
"He is absolutely right."
"They played a fundamental role."
"I spoke just a few moments ago to one of the organisers and said, 'Are you still optimistic?'"
"He said, 'Of course I am."
"Things are going in the right direction.'"
"But there are problems."
"The timetable for elections is wrong and the timetable for reforming the Constitution is far too short."
"We need much more time."
"We are talking about Egypt, but this process is spreading."
"It is like 1989 and the European Union needs special procedures - this House, the Commission, the Council, the EAS - and we welcome Cathy Ashton's down payment for democracy, but we need to do more."
"We need to reward reform."
"As I said in Cairo on Sunday - and I hope to be saying it among other peoples - 'I am not here as a Briton or as a European, I am here as an honorary Egyptian.'"
"I still am."
"(ES) Mr President, we need further clarification on the Supreme Military Council's plans in Egypt."
"One specific undertaking is the holding of democratic elections within six months, following a constitutional reform led by experts."
"However, I have also read that next week we will see a new government supposedly including opposition representatives, according to the British Foreign Secretary."
"I think we all agree, in any case, that the best way forward is to have a transitional process, supported by the widest possible political consensus, until the elections are held."
"It would also be desirable for the social forces to work together to ensure that this transition is unburdened by major tensions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must support the democratic process and contribute to its success."
"Egypt is a key country, and developments there will be felt throughout the Mediterranean and the Arab world."
"I therefore welcome Baroness Ashton's visit to Cairo next week."
"One further point: The Tunisians and the Egyptians have given us a lesson in the people's desire for freedom."
"I hope the foreign ministers will not overlook this lesson when they come to assess the common position on Cuba, which is precisely aimed at attaining a democratic transition in that country, and which defends those who defend freedom."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it can never be said often enough that what is happening in the southern Mediterranean and, more generally, in the Arab world, is historic, especially for those peoples who, half a century after their countries gained independence through decolonisation, are today gaining their individual and collective freedoms."
"It is historic, but also unexpected, as are all popular revolutions, I hear you say."
"However, this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision, our policies and our relationships with these countries."
"Proposals have been made."
"Indeed, the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability, by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears, an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration, terrorism and radical Islam, along with some economic interests, not least access to energy."
"We accepted authoritarian regimes, when their sole aim was to confirm our fears."
"The people's revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears, or, worse still, the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs."
"That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy, in places where it is possible to be Muslim, democratic and secular."
"That is the message that we are being sent."
"(EL) Mr President, the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt are already creating a political domino effect in numerous Muslim countries."
"Communities are rising up with demands and requests which have been repressed for decades."
"Beware!"
"Nothing has ended."
"It is all just starting."
"New challenges and new prospects."
"The question is what is Europe doing?"
"What can it do and what must it do?"
"Certainly not what is has being doing to date."
"It has basically been absent, with no cohesion and no reflexes."
"What will it do, for example, about the new influx of immigrants?"
"Surely not what it has been doing to date, with the lack of solidarity on the part of the North for its partners in the South?"
"That is why we and our colleagues from Cyprus, Malta, France, Spain and Italy have tabled a question to the Commission on the subject."
"Developments in our wider neighbourhood are becoming a yardstick for European foreign policy."
"Will we succeed or will we fail?"
"Time is running out."
"Lampedusa is calling us."
"(ES) Mr President, my voice will also be one of praise for Baroness Ashton's recent visit to Tunisia, and for her trip to Egypt next week."
"What can Europe do, as the previous speaker said?"
"It is crucial to give a clear indication of our support for these countries at this point in time."
"Geography and history make Europe the natural ally of the countries in the Mediterranean region."
"This is the right time to let them know how important they are to us, how radical a change they have brought to our neighbourhood policy, and what high hopes we have for this new Mediterranean region engendered by the young people of Egypt and Tunisia, much to our surprise and disbelief."
"We should now support this transformation, as other speakers have said."
"Above all, we should do this by dismantling the machinery of repression -let us not forget that the dictatorship continues even though the dictator may have stepped down-, lifting the state of emergency and helping pro-democracy forces so that Europe can make a genuine contribution to this process, so that democracy can become truly consolidated and a new partnership can be established."
"What has been said about the need to adapt instruments is by no means gratuitous."
"The truth is that one page has been wiped and we are now moving on to a new one."
"(SK) Mr President, it is quite clear from the context of what Mr Verhofstadt has been saying here that the Egyptian democratic opposition forces have failed to organise a unified body representing the revolutionary forces from the streets."
"It is one thing to get rid of a dictator, but quite another thing to introduce a democratic regime."
"One of the fundamental features of the revolutions in Central Europe in 1989 was the ability immediately to create genuine organisations to represent the democratic, secular revolutionary forces."
"There is room here for the European Union to provide assistance."
"This is possibly more important than funding and other matters."
"These will be important in future stages."
"Who will sit down at a table at this point and genuinely negotiate with the military leaders?"
"Who will genuinely come forward in elections as the representative of these democratic forces?"
"This question remains undecided and the European Union can provide assistance here."
"If this can be done, we will not have to fear that Egypt will take the path of Iran but, on the contrary, we can be sure that Iran will take the path of Egypt."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr President, I would like to say to my friend Mr Zala that I very much benefited from what he has said about his personal experience of being in a revolution."
"Mr Zala, there are two questions in this debate I would like your views on."
"To the people on the ground, if foreign countries fail to speak out for democracy, does that not help extremism, rather than hinder it?"
"If foreign countries do speak out for democracy, is that seen as interference and inappropriate?"
"I would appreciate your views."
"(SK) Thank you very much for the question."
"In my opinion, we now have sufficient experience of revolutions against dictatorial regimes to be concerned that we would be interfering in the internal affairs of other countries through our advice."
"In 1989, we undoubtedly knew and had consultations with many people from abroad."
"We should rely on our own historical experience."
"There are many, many issues we can advise these countries on, and I believe that if the advice is sensible, it is acceptable."
"Mr President, considering the enormous importance of developments in Egypt to the whole region, and EU relations with that part of the world, it is very important that we show our timely attention and interest and take a pro-active role rather than a reactive one."
"When a nation - Egyptian or any other - comes together to claim its right to democracy, the EU should offer to help its people to transform their dream into reality."
"Taking into consideration that the constitution is suspended, Parliament dissolved and presidential elections scheduled later this year, it is very important to ensure that free and fair elections are granted in this country."
"People will exercise their right to free media and freedom of expression."
"At the same time, we face a risk that if elections are held without the foundations of deep democracy being laid, then yes, it is possible that extremists will triumph."
"- (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I strongly support all the steps being taken by the High Representative to help Egypt achieve democracy and prosperity without further bloodshed."
"However, this does not mean that we should turn a blind eye to the growing violence being committed against Coptic Christians by radical Muslims."
"I am in contact with European citizens and Czechs who are helping the Copts, but in doing so they are literally risking their lives."
"The European Union must openly ask the Egyptian Army to set an example by punishing those who persecute Christians."
"At the same time, the European Union should actively help those Copts who are at risk to temporarily relocate to a safe country."
"I would like to ask you to propose that the Council initiate temporary protection measures under Directive 2001/55/EC, in order to save the lives of Copts until Egypt is a safer homeland for them."
"Commissioner, can you do this?"
"(MT) Mr President, there are three things that we will need from now on."
"Firstly, we need immediate assistance during the transition stage to be provided to Egypt, just as it needs to be provided to Tunisia, so that they can work towards a full and stable democracy."
"Secondly, we need a long-term plan - which I call a Marshall Plan - for each country that, like Tunisia and Egypt, plan to take the road to democracy."
"In this way we can show that we are there to lend a helping hand to those who opt for democracy - and demonstrate that democracy is the precursor to success."
"Finally, we need a complete revision of our policy on the Mediterranean."
"We must appreciate and admit that this lacked the necessary vision to understand what could have occurred in the Arab countries, and which did, in fact, occur."
"Mr President, last time some of us voiced our frustration over the mild tone of our public - I repeat, public - pronouncements, not activity, on the events in Egypt before Mubarak's resignation."
"Of course, in her position, Lady Ashton is caught between a rock and a hard place, but if we want the EU's voice to be heard it must be loud enough to be heard."
"Coming back to Egypt, based on my own experiences as a Romanian, I would expect the real difficulties to be only just starting."
"Far from solving their concerns, the departure of the former President will complicate and multiply the problems facing Egyptian society."
"Some of those problems, like the army not fulfilling the promise to organise free elections at the set time or the denunciation of the Treaty with Israel, will affect us directly."
"Nevertheless, I am encouraged by our willingness to try, through constant contact with the local authorities, to anticipate such problems and prepare to intervene with the most appropriate means."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from Berlin, and the whole world rejoiced with us Berliners when the border in our city fell and the borders opened everywhere in Eastern Europe."
"Now, in the case of Egypt, we reacted too late, too cautiously and, above all, too unemotionally."
"Where was our joy?"
"Every other word from us was simply about 'maintaining stability'."
"However, freedom is the most important thing for every person in the world."
"We Germans in particular know what we are talking about."
"What we had in Egypt was not stability; it was oppression."
"Freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time."
"Therefore, we should not dictate to the Egyptians who they should elect."
"Provided the elections proceed in a fair and democratic way, we will have to recognise the result and must not be so arrogant - as we were at the time in Palestine or even in Algeria - as to decide whether or not we will recognise those who are elected."
"We must recognise the choice that is made."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Füle that we really need to focus on insisting on a transition to civilian government, and on making sure that the military regime now in place will fulfil its promises."
"I think that a committee has now been set up to work on the constitution, but there is not a single woman in it."
"That it is rather a pity when we consider how many women - young women - were in the streets making sure that this democratic transition, this revolution, includes the whole of society."
"So, we need to support them, we need to demand, when you go there and when Baroness Ashton goes there, to meet with women: to meet not only those who might be called 'the usual suspects' but also those who were involved in the revolution and whose voices are not so often heard."
"We have to insist on all prisoners being released and on an investigation being conducted into the violence that has occurred."
"Lastly, I think that Baroness Ashton is right: this is a time to think big."
"This is about EU trade, about visas, about money - and it is about courage."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this debate, the Commissioner praised the courage of the young people who took to the streets in Egypt and Tunisia and created the uprising."
"Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Teheran and other cities in Iran on Monday and were brutally suppressed."
"They were crushed."
"One young student was killed."
"Others have been tortured and taken to prison where they will no doubt be executed for trying to rise up against that fascist regime."
"Why do we never say anything to encourage them?"
"Why are we like rabbits caught in the headlights when it comes to dealing with the Mullahs in Teheran?"
"Why do we say nothing to condemn the brutal psychological torture and siege of the 3 400 opposition Iranians in Camp Ashraf?"
"It is time we took action and showed that we support the Iranian opposition."
"(EL) Mr President, the recent popular uprisings and all the others which are looming on the African rim of the Mediterranean should be a deep cause for concern to us."
"We need to identify the cause of these uprisings; is it poverty, religion, injustice, corruption or the lack of democracy and freedom?"
"What exactly do these people want, who are rebelling against regimes which they have voted for, as their guide and governor, for the past 30 or 40 years?"
"It seems to me that we here in this House think we are the be all and end all of full democracy."
"The first solution we propose is money."
"They had money and a few shrewd people socked it away."
"However, we need to understand that the important issue is geopolitical instability, the changes which it may bring to the area, the impact of popular reaction and the new balances that will emerge."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their valuable comments and questions."
"I have very much appreciated today the opportunity to exchange views on the events in Egypt and on the best response to them."
"I have heard a lot of constructive remarks and proposals and I will pass on your messages to the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"We will reflect together on how best to address these issues and we will keep them high on the priority list as our response to Egypt develops."
"Let me assure you that, through the ongoing review process, we will address comprehensively both important elements: firstly the transition and reform needs of the countries concerned, but also, secondly, the strategic reflection of these tremendous and historic transformations in our neighbourhood area and our neighbourhood policy."
"This House has an important role to play to play in that."
"The Egyptians have proven their ability to take their future into their own hands."
"They ask for democracy, they ask for socio-economic reforms, and the European Union must be able to lend its full support to the democratic reform process."
"As I have said, these are still early days, but the European Union is fully mobilised to listen and react to the demands coming from the Egyptians themselves."
"Mr President, I would like to compliment you on the way you handled catch-the-eye today."
"It was the first time I have heard the names being called out in advance, when the number of speakers was limited, so that other Members who would not be able to speak could go about their business."
"I did not ask to be included in catch-the-eye in this debate, but I did note what you did and I hope other Presidents will emulate it."
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"The Egyptian authorities made plans to have their country's constitution revised."
"A group of lawyers has been briefed and will have 10 days to table its proposed amendments."
"This is very good news."
"The most controversial articles, in particular regarding the unlimited number of presidential terms, the restrictive conditions concerning who can stand in presidential elections, the methods for supervising elections and the limited opportunities to appeal after legislative elections, will have to be revised."
"The democratic transition is therefore under way."
"However, the revision of the constitution is not the only issue which must be tackled."
"Economic well-being and social cohesion are essential conditions for the emancipation of a people and the smooth running of a country."
"The European Union, for its part, cannot stand by and do nothing while these changes take place."
"Once she has welcomed the democratic transition, Baroness Ashton will have to upgrade the partnership agreements and place the rule of law, justice and human rights at the heart of her concerns."
"These values cannot be allowed to sink into oblivion on the pretext of stabilising our relations."
"in writing. - It is essential to define the role of the EU in the turmoil taking place in many Arab countries in general and Egypt in particular."
"The turmoil has taken everyone by surprise and it does not seem that any contingency plan was made for such an eventuality, which is not localised but widespread."
"The socio-political base provoking the changes in the Arab world is not dissimilar across those countries which are now in transition to what we hope will be a democratic environment."
"Baroness Ashton is on record as stating that the EU has a 'democratic calling' to listen to people who want change - and we are witnessing a changing world because what will happen in the Arab countries will have an effect on political, social and economic issues worldwide."
"One particularly important issue is that of security and stability, and there is no doubt that the 'democratic calling' concerns countries mostly considered as being allied with others that currently have democratic political systems."
"At this point, it is not known where the democratic transitional process will lead or what position will be taken by the traditional democracies and especially the EU."
"Media law in Hungary (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on media law in Hungary."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to inform you that, when the plane was touching down this morning in Strasbourg, I got the good news that the Hungarian Prime Minister has agreed to amend the media law so that it complies with all aspects of EU law that we, the European Commission have raised, including the concerns raised regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"They assure me that the amendments will be adopted by the Hungarian Government at its next session."
"The body language of the representatives of the Hungarian Government gives me the feeling that this is correct and that it will be tabled in the Hungarian Parliament within the coming days."
"The four areas where the Hungarian authorities agreed to amend their law are the following."
"Number one: balanced coverage."
"The amendments agreed would limit the balanced reporting requirements to broadcasting, as in other Member States, and would no longer apply those requirements to on-demand audiovisual media services or the written press."
"Moreover, any restrictions on broadcasters would need to respect the principle of proportionality."
"Of course the Commission will monitor the way that principle is translated into secondary law."
"I mentioned four areas."
"The second one is the country-of-origin principle."
"The amendments agreed would mean that foreign broadcasters could no longer be fined for breaching the Hungarian media law's provisions on protection of minors or incitement to hatred."
"Instead the Hungarian authorities could suspend transmission of such services on Hungarian territory, which is in line with the AVMS Directive."
"What does that mean?"
"It means that broadcasters legally established and authorised in other Member States, and compliant with the laws of those countries, would be free to broadcast to Hungary without running the risk of being subject to fines by Hungarian authorities."
"Number three: media registration."
"The amendments agreed would mean that audiovisual media service providers would have to register only after they begin offering their services, and that is in line with the directive."
"It means that audiovisual media service providers and publishers would no longer be subject to prior authorisation by the Hungarian authorities."
"Number four: offensive content."
"Additionally, the Hungarian Government agreed to amend another provision of its media law that raised concerns with respect to the freedom of expression."
"A provision of the media law specified very broadly that media content may not cause offence, even by implication, to individuals, minorities or majorities."
"The amendments agreed would limit the prohibition to discriminatory treatment."
"Moreover those provisions would no longer apply to media service providers established in other EU countries."
"We will work closely with the Hungarian authorities to make sure that the agreed changes are now adopted into Hungarian law and applied in practice."
"We will continue to monitor the situation, but that is quite clear."
"Needless to say, the Commission is also verifying the national rules implementing the AVMS Directive in other Member States and will raise similar concerns where necessary."
"The Commission does not shy away from using its powers."
"It does not shy away from defending media freedom and pluralism when it is needed, and the present case hopefully pre-empts and proves that."
"I can assure you that the Commission acknowledges and shares the concerns that many of you and parts of civil society have about the general state of the media in Europe."
"I am ready to go further and take action in the matter of media pluralism within the EU competences, of course respecting subsidiarity."
"The Commission not only has a duty, but also a sincere interest, in facilitating the dialogue amongst stakeholders and policymakers at a European level."
"The changing structure of the media landscape in Europe causes concern for the future."
"It brings opportunities but also wider risks for media pluralism beyond the ownership use."
"It is quite clear that we need an approach to measuring media pluralism in a broad sense; one that will bring together legal, economic and social aspects, rather than treating them quite separately, as has often been the case up until now."
"Therefore, I intend to establish a multi-stakeholder group and ask them to address the challenges for the media at present and in the future, including the situation of media pluralism in Europe."
"Since you know that I value your input very much, the European Parliament will be represented in the group of experts, if you will accept that invitation."
"I will announce details quite soon."
"The group will be asked to advise me on the next steps to be taken concerning the media landscape and I am fully committed to taking concrete action within all the competences that I have."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking part in the discussion a little shamefacedly, because the Commissioner has more or less told us that it is pointless to conduct this debate because there is nothing to argue about."
"We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions - in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber - we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission's views - and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union."
"Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps - no, definitely - because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place."
"Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow."
"More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus."
"Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens."
"I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for her work."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the Socialist and Democrat Group of course welcome the advance in the four key areas of balanced information, the country-of-origin principle, and so on."
"Commissioner, of course we welcome it."
"That was the text of our resolution; that was the pressure we were placing on you and the Hungarian authorities to deliver."
"First of all, I have to ask you about the timing."
"Was it purely coincidence, as you were waiting in the airport as you said, or was it the fact that pressure by this Parliament has brought forward four key amendments in the four key areas we asked for?"
"Please let us know those concessions have been secured."
"Of course Parliament has still not been able to see the text of the negotiations between the Commission and the Hungarian authorities; therefore we require more time to fully state our position on the matter."
"However, it seems clear that negotiations have not fully addressed many other serious concerns of this Parliament and, of course, of our Socialist and Democrat Group."
"Crucial issues still unanswered include the composition and time frame of the media authority and of the Media Council, which are politically homogenous and still exert pervasive and centralised governmental, judicial and political control on all media."
"We need answers on where we go on this crucial issue."
"Furthermore, it is regrettable that the Commission has not acted upon the recommendations of Parliament, the Council of Europe, the Commissioner, and the OSCE for example, on the violation of the principle of confidentiality of journalistic sources, extremely disproportionate sanctions, and abolishing the political and financial independence of public service broadcast media."
"There is a list, Commissioner, which you know of, which still needs to be answered and we need these questions to be answered, preferably in this debate."
"Obviously we commend the Hungarian authority's willingness to amend the legislation."
"We also encourage the implementation of amendments to address the outstanding areas of concern for all of us in this Parliament, whilst fully embracing the spirit of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and, in particular, Article 11, which protects the freedom of expression."
"We would like further answers on whether you believe Article 11 has been fulfilled."
"We must involve civil society and stakeholders to uphold principles of transparency and accountability and to ensure best practice."
"Commissioner, we tabled a resolution for our group because we wanted the concessions that you have already announced, but we want more."
"Democracies are built upon the principle of a free and independent media."
"We make no apologies within our group for firmly defending this principle and we will do everything in our power to protect it, for Hungarians and all EU citizens."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in the past in this Parliament we have discussed cases when different governments have shown their desire to control the media, but the attempts never went as far as in the case of the Hungarian media law, where from television to radio, to the written press, to on-demand media, bloggers, everything is controlled, from registration to performance and suspension."
"When we, the Liberals and the Democrats, the ALDE Group in this Parliament, first raised our voice against this law, we were accused of being politically motivated."
"However, experience has shown that we were right and today even the Hungarian Government admits that something is very wrong with this law."
"Therefore several amendments are envisaged."
"We trust the Commission that this is indeed the Hungarian position, hoping to receive it in writing, and we will closely follow the changes."
"Nevertheless, the four areas requested by the Commission are only a part of a much bigger picture."
"Other aspects must be changed as well: the enormous control powers vested in the hands of a politically appointed person who has been heading two media control authorities for nine years, the lack of protection of journalists' sources and the lack of effective judicial remedy, to name just a few."
"After all, not only our critics, but also the European Commission itself, will have to answer to the Hungarian and European civil society and journalists to say why the OSCE and the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe have also harshly criticised the aspects I have just mentioned."
"We cannot all be politically motivated."
"Quite the opposite, we are motivated by a genuine interest to see that media freedom is a reality for the benefit of our citizens."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my first questions are for Commissioner Kroes."
"Mrs Kroes, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive refers to an independent regulatory body."
"Yet, positions in the new Hungarian media authority and the Media Council, who have powers to impose heavy penalties on vague grounds, are being taken up exclusively by supporters of the ruling party."
"That is taking place in an already highly polarised political environment."
"Why has the Commission not objected to this lack of independence?"
"Why have you failed fully to assess the powers of the media authority and the Media Council, which, in my view, fall within the scope of European law, against the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"You, Mrs Kroes, have said that the Hungarian Government has so far made four amendments."
"For the foreign press, for the audiovisual media, but not for domestic newspapers."
"You would also like to see Mr Orban and his people triumphantly waving the stamp of approval, your Brussels flag, and then continue, uninterrupted, preaching intolerance, slandering philosophers and banning gay pride."
"All of that, too, while Hungary is holding the presidency of the Council."
"You must be deeply unhappy about that."
"Moving next to my fellow members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), who said in their resolution that there was nothing to be concerned about and who have accused critics of the media law of making manipulative and politically motivated comments."
"That is quite an accusation, and one which is also directed at the OSCE and the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe."
"It is quite an accusation, given that we know that even Mr Orban himself has, in the mean time, realised that a few amendments need to be made to his media law."
"This reminds me of the Stalinist days, where people were airbrushed out of photographs."
"Together with us and the OSCE, you ought to be protecting European values, not becoming a mechanism for imposing your power at home."
"(The Member agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(HU) Mr President, well, the Fidesz government deserves what is happening right now, namely that the left wing, from Mr Martin Schulz to Mr Cohn-Bendit to all the others, is now applauding them, and our dear fellow Members on the left are giving them lectures on democracy."
"Let me ask you, what is your message to left wing parties, such as MSZP, which had people shot in the eye in Hungary in 2006?"
"What guarantee does the nation of Hungary have that such incidents cannot happen under the government of your left-wing party, and that you will not have protests dispersed by force as you did between 2002 and 2010 ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I do not think that the independent media creates violence and I do not see the relevance of this question, but I thank the asker of the question for her question."
"Mr President, freedom of speech is of great value."
"We all know this, which is why we should have a serious debate."
"Unfortunately, it seems that today's debate cannot be described as such."
"It seems to be a pretext for the centre-left to attack the right-wing, conservative government of Prime Minister Orban."
"The fact is that we could point to many European countries where freedom of speech is not respected."
"Just look at Poland's experience."
"In Poland, where it could be said that the ruling party has an overall majority in every governing body, a monopoly of power, where it controls government, the Senate, the President, the National Broadcasting Authority, the body which oversees the media, and finally has control over public broadcasting and the support of the largest electronic media corporations, journalists are being thrown out of their jobs for the simple reason that they hold conservative, right-wing views."
"Right wing or conservative programmes have been withdrawn, such as the programme Warto rozmawiać directed by Mr Pospieszalski or Misja specjalna directed by Mr Gargas."
"It begs the question: where is Mr Schulz, where are you, ladies and gentlemen, when these violations are being perpetrated in Poland?"
"Let us discuss actual violations, those that have already occurred."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(DE) If I have understood you correctly, you said that there are restrictions on the freedom of expression and freedom of the press in many countries in Europe."
"I would be interested to know to which countries you are referring and what you personally intend to do about it."
"(PL) Thank you for your question."
"I wanted to draw attention to the fact that freedom of the media is a fundamental problem."
"If we are to address it, we should separate it from political sympathies, independently of whether we have socialist or right-wing and conservative views."
"In short, if journalists are dismissed only because they have left-wing views or only because they have conservative views, we should protest."
"For example, in Poland today, journalists are dismissed purely because they have conservative views."
"I would expect support and protests from Mr Schulz and from other socialist and left-wing members, because this would show that we are concerned with standards and not political point-scoring."
"We are concerned with protecting the freedom of the media."
"We protest against situations like this anywhere they may occur, even if they are taking place now, for instance, in Poland."
"Commissioner, I have listened to you carefully and frankly I do not know whether I am disappointed or shocked at the Commission's efforts because I still do not understand whether the Commission fell intentionally or unintentionally into the Hungarian Government's trap."
"The Hungarian Government has decided to discuss concessions on some trivial details, but to make no fundamental changes to this law."
"The highly disproportionate and biased composition of the Media Council, the exceptionally steep fines for newspapers, and all the factors that led to censorship and self-censorship of the media are still in place."
"However, what is utterly disgraceful, as previous speakers have said, is that as soon as the Commission extracted the concession that foreign newspapers and publications would be exempt from the fines, everything else was forgotten about."
"It seems to me that the principles of post-1989 Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, have been undermined."
"What the Commission actually meant to say was that we would not abandon our fellow Europeans from any country to censorship and restrictions on freedom of expression."
"Apparently, the Commission has done this, but Parliament shall continue to keep an eye not only on the Hungarian Government but also on the Commission now, because it is our duty and our responsibility not to let this issue drop, as the Commission has disgracefully done."
"Mr President, this will certainly not be remembered as an exhilarating chapter in Parliament's history."
"The criticisms and attacks rained down on the Hungarian Government, in conjunction with the EU Presidency, with regard to the Hungarian media law's alleged total failure to comply with European legislation, have been reduced to what they really are: an instrumental and specious attempt that, apart from anything else, is based entirely on ideological bias, which is even more shameful when it is used against a country that today has the struggle for freedom encoded in its DNA - and this has indeed been the case throughout its history, which we all remember very well."
"The political forces that have promoted this far from exhilarating debate are still heavily weighed down by the responsibility for what is certainly not a high level political manoeuvre."
"Rather, it is seriously invalidated by these purely ideological overtones, and it also has the failing of casting an undeserved shadow on the European Union Presidency, which is being held for the first time - and this is certainly a great political and historical fact - by a former communist country, joined with us today in freedom."
"Mr President, in the light of the announcement made by the Commission today, it is clear that this debate has been overtaken by events and that there is no longer any reason whatsoever to proceed with the vote on the resolutions tomorrow."
"I believe that those who expressed genuine concern about the media law in Hungary were entitled to a response."
"What I find worrying is that this Chamber is increasingly engaging in crusades against individual Member States - that coincidentally happen to have EPP governments - before the Commission has fully investigated the matter, let alone reached its conclusions."
"Worse than that: in this case, this was done despite the fact that we had a clear undertaking from the Hungarian authorities at the highest level that, should the Commission raise any concerns about this law, they would be prepared to change it, as they did."
"What exactly was the point of this debate?"
"What is the point of the resolutions tomorrow, if not political instrumentalisation?"
"The EPP stands firm in its commitment to respect for human rights and the rule of law, regardless of the Member State concerned."
"There is no question about that."
"However, it is not willing to single out individual Member States and condemn them summarily before the due process of law has been completed."
"Once it has been completed, we should respect it."
"When this issue first came up last month, I said that politicising this issue was not just attacking a Member State, but was also undermining the EU Presidency."
"Today, I feel that we have also undermined our own institution."
"That cannot be right."
"I sincerely appeal to all groups to withdraw the resolutions that are up for vote tomorrow - not suspend them, not postpone them, but withdraw them - because there is no longer any basis for proceeding with this vote."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Council representatives, please allow me to begin by stating the obvious."
"Sometimes it is necessary to repeat the obvious: the free circulation of news and independent opinion is the most important safeguard of any democratic society."
"This is the reason that brings us here today."
"The insistence with which the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, several Member States and an ample majority of the Members of this Parliament have voiced their concerns is justified by the fact that the most basic principles of our European project are at stake."
"When this law was hastily passed by Mr Orbán's Government in Hungary, we considered that there had not been sufficient reflection during its preparation and that the law should be amended to ensure its consistency with European regulations and with the essential spirit embodied in the treaties."
"We are pleased and grateful to the Commissioner, who has stood here today and told us that the Hungarian Government is prepared to amend the law."
"However, the creation of an information monitoring authority, whose council would be politically controlled exclusively by members of the ruling party, runs the risk of exercising a biased, centralised political control that would inevitably lead to censorship and, even worse, self-censorship."
"So the question is, will this authority be reviewed?"
"We have shared with the Commission and with you, Commissioner, our concerns on the issue of information pluralism, the principle of proportionality and the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and information, enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Hungarian Government's answers accepting the amendment of this law must be supervised to ensure that the changes implemented are sufficiently far-reaching to hold back the threat posed by these laws to our fundamental rights and values."
"For instance, by reviewing the monitoring authority, as I said before."
"We urge the Commission to continue with its investigations, particularly into matters affecting fundamental rights."
"May I also stress, Commissioner and Council representatives, that this is not a political issue, as some people would have us believe."
"What is at issue here is the defence of the values of our European Union and respect for its laws."
"Have no doubt about it: this is our sole objective and our task here today."
"(DA) Mr President, well, it is a little strange to stand here as a Conservative-Liberal through and through and be accused of being left-leaning."
"However, that is something that remains to be seen."
"This is not, in fact, about being left- or right-leaning; it is about freedom of the press."
"I cannot understand why my fellow Member from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is choosing to pursue the debate in this way."
"That is, I think, a touch pathetic."
"This is not about Hungary, either; it is about freedom of the press."
"I am pleased - and I will gladly acknowledge - that the Hungarian Government has answered the questions that have been put to it extremely well."
"Having said that, problems still exist, and we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have also pointed that out all along."
"We still have the problem of a government-appointed Media Council that is to assess whether the coverage is balanced."
"We still have problems with regard to the fact that we have a Commission that is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaty and take a stand with regard to the problems with Hungary's media law."
"Of course, I hope that the Commissioner will indeed do that."
"I will focus on what we are to do now and on the fact that the Commissioner has raised the question of an independent council."
"That is something I would like to welcome on our behalf, and I wonder if the Commissioner would perhaps give us a little more detail about what this council is to concern itself with."
"Colleagues, for those of you who do not know the procedure, a blue card is at the discretion of the President."
"If I feel we do not have enough time for the debate then I do not give the floor."
"If I see later that we have cut down on speaking time then I may give the floor again."
"So, when you raise a blue card, unfortunately I cannot always give the floor to you."
"It will have to be at the discretion of myself and of the secretariat."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are absolutely no grounds for self-righteousness on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"The fact that changes have now been made to the Hungarian media law is primarily down to those who took action in this regard."
"Mr Orbán was not involved in this at the beginning."
"I would like to make this very clear: the changes that have now been made are not enough."
"We still have a supervisory authority that for nine years has only been composed of members of Fidesz."
"That is not compatible with the legislation at EU level."
"There is still no source protection."
"Therefore, this really is not a democratic media law."
"Mrs Kroes, you did not go far enough in my view."
"You were clearly more interested in a quiet life and in not disturbing the Hungarian Presidency than in a truly democratic media law."
"May I remind you that anti-communist liberal democratic intellectuals like György Konrad, Agnes Heller and Michael Woida called on the European institutions for support."
"We have not yet managed to provide this."
"I really do believe that this law really needs to be revised to make it democratic."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Hungarian Government has shown great sensitivity towards Europe and towards the principles upon which it is based in this affair."
"In fact, immediately after the approval of the Hungarian media law, a campaign was waged by the left, which used the phrase 'gagging law'."
"In reality, only those who have experienced communism, fascism and Nazism know what a gagging law is, while democratic states know that freedom and pluralism of information are part and parcel of democracy."
"However, they should be harmonised with all other powers of the rule of law and must not harm, in particular, the foundation of democracy, which is human dignity."
"For example, Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does in fact guarantee freedom of information, but it also directly prohibits publications that are contrary to public morality."
"The 1948 law on the freedom of the press in Italy, which no one has ever challenged, lays down an obligation not for authorisation but for registration of any publication, as does the Hungarian law."
"The reservations that the European Commission itself has rightly expressed do not devalue the stated aim of the Hungarian law, and that aim of ensuring respect for human dignity is demonstrated precisely by the attitude that the Hungarian Government has taken by opening itself up immediately to the acceptance of criticism and taking responsibility for changing the law according to the guidelines provided to it."
"The statement that the fundamental rights of the European Union will be written into the Hungarian Constitution is also proof of Hungary's fundamental desire to be part of European culture."
"In conclusion, I no longer understand the point of this discussion, except to 'blame' Hungary for having supported its government and parliament democratically by a two-thirds majority."
"Yet this gives Europe reason for hope, not reason for criticism."
"I am therefore grateful to the Commission and to the Hungarian Government."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, efforts to reduce the freedom of the media are a general European phenomenon."
"As a patriot, I am particularly saddened by the fact that it was the Hungarian media law that sparked heated debates in the European Parliament and other European institutions."
"It is not a pleasant feeling."
"The strong criticism voiced by the European Commission forced the Orbán government - which had, back in December, still adamantly refused to amend the law in any way - to give way."
"Now the Commission is forcing the Orbán government to amend the scandalous laws."
"The main point is that, according to the Commission's evaluation, Hungarian media legislation is in conflict with EU law."
"It is not only in violation of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, but also the EU Treaties and the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The EU's criticism marks a political defeat for the Hungarian right wing."
"However, the majority of the objections made by four groups within the European Parliament continue to apply unchanged."
"Both the Commission and the European Parliament must intently monitor the effects the amended Hungarian laws will have on freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in Hungary."
"A question to Mr Martonyi: what was the Orbán government's justification for abolishing the parity-based composition of the media board, as stipulated by the previous media law, which consisted of a 50-50% ratio of members delegated by the government party and the opposition?"
"What does Commissioner Neelie Kroes think about this?"
"I firmly request the Hungarian Government to not create the nationalist impression that the criticism is directed against Hungary."
"I ask the Orbán government now, after the strong criticism received from the European Commission, to exercise introspection and cease the antidemocratic government practices it has been following up to now."
"'He who conceals trouble only makes it worse,' warned the illustrious Hungarian poet Gyula Illyés."
"Dear colleagues, what I said before may have caused some confusion."
"There will be no more blue card questions in this debate."
"We do not have the time."
"(Interjection from Mrs Morvai: 'Shame on you!')"
"What a life!"
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, as you announced at the beginning of today's debate, an agreement has been reached between the Hungarian Government and the European Commission concerning the amendment of several points of the Hungarian media law."
"I agree with my colleagues, in that the debate we are witnessing here now, one motivated by political impulses, bias and, listening to the socialist and liberal Members, occasionally hatred, has become meaningless."
"One European socialist speaker referred to the protection of common European values, and elaborated on his position to that end."
"To quote a Hungarian socialist classic: 'fiddlesticks!'"
"This is not at all the case here, my fellow Members."
"The case here is simply that the European socialists, liberals, communists and greens are once again using double standards."
"Mr Martin Schulz did not say a word when a minister of the socialist government in Hungary gave the order, through his direct political associates, to defame a journalist who had become a nuisance to him by having drugs placed in his car."
"Mr Martin Schulz did not say a word when one of the secretaries of state of the Hungarian Government filed a criminal report against a Hungarian journalist for writing an article exposing legislative fraud, which resulted in the imprisonment of that Hungarian journalist."
"Liberal Chair Guy Verhofstadt did not say a word when Hungarian journalists exposed electoral fraud at the leadership election congress of the Hungarian liberal party, which was followed by the party boycotting the TV station of those journalists for a long time."
"Since you did not mention or raise your voices for the protection of common European values at that time, there is no credibility to your statements today."
"(SL) Mr President, I welcome the Hungarian Government's intention to amend controversial sections of the media law, as well as the fact that you, Commissioner Kroes, are pleased with the announced amendments."
"However, I am greatly concerned that, one day before the resolution on the Hungarian media law is due to be adopted, we in this House have only very vague messages to rely upon and that we have not received any detailed assurances from the Hungarian authorities as to the actual amendments to be made."
"Therefore, I would like to know how it is that you were able to come up with those findings within a few hours and whether or not any external experts were involved in the process."
"In addition, the speed with which the amendments were announced seems to suggest that these will not be substantive revisions, but only cosmetic changes, and that is not acceptable by any standard."
"Why is it that we have been informed as late as today, on the day the debate is actually taking place, that the Hungarian Government will amend the law within a fortnight and that the Commission is happy with that."
"It appears that somebody is seriously bent on silencing the concerns of the European Parliament that the technical work announced by Hungary will not lead to democratic amendments of the law in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, we too have serious concerns about the composition and powers of the Media Council, as this is obviously a case of a major extension of state control over journalists."
"While I welcome the readiness for dialogue, I must reiterate that this is not an attack on Hungary."
"I used to be a journalist myself - and this is about protecting journalists throughout Europe."
"Moreover, I am disappointed that Commissioner Reding, who is responsible for fundamental rights, has not been involved in the issue of this controversial law."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to know one more thing: what is the European Commission's vision for the future of journalism in Europe?"
"We need in the Union some minimum criteria which guarantee the freedom and independence of the media and media pluralism."
"I call on you to get to work on this as soon as possible because media freedom, and consequently the quality of media reporting, is already under serious threat in other parts of Europe, too."
"(NL) Mr President, it seems to me that we are all agreed that the Hungarian Government has done the right thing in removing all doubts today and made it clear that there is a free press in Budapest and no lack of media pluralism."
"Fortunately, with Hungary's formal pledge to the European Commission that the new media law will be adjusted and explicitly brought in line with European fundamental rights, that ambiguity has been removed."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, my only regret is that every debate on media pluralism always seems to get bogged down in national party political games."
"In my opinion, we definitely need to put a stop to that."
"Having said that, Commissioner, I think that your new initiative to start a working group on media pluralism is an excellent one and we, in Parliament, will obviously be extremely happy to discuss that initiative and work with you on it."
"This is an excellent opportunity to finally look into this in depth, to go to the heart of the matter, media pluralism, without the discussion being coloured by emotions generated at a national level."
"It is the perfect initiative for exploring the media landscape in the European Union in an objective way."
"Finally, allow me to make one more thing clear: in my opinion, a European legislative initiative to regulate the media, which is what some of you in this House will be demanding tomorrow, is totally the wrong approach and I believe, Commissioner, that you agree with us on that point."
"(SL) Mr President, I, too, welcome the decision of the Hungarian Government to improve the media law, but I think that this multiple attack on the Government concerning the media law is unfair and unfounded."
"This law is a product of specific circumstances, which are not always well understood in Western Europe."
"In all transition countries, the media environment has been rather asymmetrical or unbalanced in terms of ownership and political affiliation."
"It was dominated by the left, which is why the call for greater balance in media reporting in transitional societies is perfectly normal."
"The concept of balanced reporting has long been used in scientific and political discourse, and initially it was associated specifically with the media."
"In addition, the objection about the political bias of the composition of the Media Council under this law is totally unfair."
"Under this law, members are elected to the Council with a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament, while such a democratic mechanism is unknown to the vast majority of European countries."
"I will be brief, Commissioner."
"We will take you at your word that you will ensure the media landscape in the European Union is even more regulated."
"However, you will not be able to achieve that just by reviewing the laws of Member States."
"You need a more thorough analysis of the real situation, particularly in the new Member States, including Slovenia."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I want to put a question to you."
"Regardless of what you say, I am fighting for Members to be able to say what they want."
"However, in this House so far, only the extreme right and the left have had the right to blue card interventions."
"I think this is a one-sided way to conduct the sitting and would like to ask that the centre and the centre-right should also have the right to put questions to the other speakers, because otherwise Members are not being treated equally."
"Mr Szájer, I do not give a blue-card question to people according to which political group they belong."
"I give them on the basis of who raised their blue card first."
"As it turns out, in this debate, the first blue cards were raised by certain people, but then the time ran out, so I said that for no-one - be they from the centre, right or left - would there be time for more blue-card questions."
"There are the one-minute interventions, for which we probably will not be able to take everyone either."
"I wish there was the time."
"I wish there was the time for me to give everyone the floor, but I cannot."
"I apologise to you and the others, but I assure you that this was not a political choice."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, President-in-Office of the Council, I would first like to thank you, Mrs Kroes, for having taken up this debate so promptly and for entering into negotiations with the Hungarian Government."
"However, above all I would like to thank the Hungarian Government for keeping the promise it made in all of the hearings and prior discussions and at the start of the debate, namely that if there was a need for amendments to be made, it would also adequately implement these amendments."
"Freedom of the press and media pluralism are important fundamental values in the European Union."
"The media also have a very special responsibility in our society."
"They are to respect personal rights, they must not practice discrimination and, above all, they are obliged to report the truth."
"They do not operate in a legal vacuum."
"That, too, is major progress in the new media law in Hungary."
"The media enjoy very special protection, particularly through the current legal framework of the European Union."
"The Commission, as guardian of this legislation, has done its job very well in the past."
"The debate that we are having today would not have been necessary if there had been more trust in the work of the Commission as guardian of the legislation, because the fact that the system works can be seen by the results that we have been informed of today, namely that adjustments have been made in the areas in which the law was not completely in line with EU legislation."
"That is a major success."
"Ideological debates that arise time and again, especially in this context, are in my view completely out of place."
"On the contrary, it is clear that the factual and cooperative debating of the contentious issues on the basis of current law in the context of the talks and negotiations that were held has helped to provide clarification and has led to positive results."
"I hope that the various political groups will also stop their political games and withdraw the resolutions in question."
"(HU) Mr President, I would like to express my deep regret that this debate took place today, because we all know that the objective clarification of all misunderstandings and questions pertaining to the Hungarian media law is the task of the European Commission, and this is currently in progress."
"I believe that it is meaningless for Parliament to take a position on an issue which could come to a positive conclusion in a matter of days."
"I am aware, however, that we are players in a hysteria-mongering left-liberal political campaign, and what form the law itself will eventually take is perhaps no longer of any significance."
"What is important is that our political opponents are attacking, with the disgraceful methods we are used to seeing from them, a country where last year centre-right political forces achieved a landslide victory after the eight-year depredations of the socialist government, and can finally complete the clear-out of the remaining ruins of the deplorable communist regime."
"This includes a rearrangement of the framework of journalist ethics and media culture."
"I must ask; where were these critics, who fancy themselves progressive democrats, when the left-wing nationalist government of Robert Fico in Slovakia adopted a controversial media law, replete with sanctions, in 2008?"
"Yes, they were here at that time, too, and ferociously protected the aforementioned law, which, thanks to them, is still in effect to this day."
"I deeply condemn and reject this double standard and call upon my colleagues not to let themselves be influenced by political instigation, and to entrust those in charge, the Commission and the Hungarian Government, with the professional evaluation and conclusion of the problem."
"Let us please finally be aware that repeated attacks against the government of the country holding the presidency in an already crisis-laden period could represent a serious risk to the evaluation of the unity and international prestige of the EU."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this is such a serious matter that one must rise above the dreadful arguments that I have just heard in this House, because when we talk about the media we are talking about the health of a democracy."
"President-in-Office of the Council, I am one of those people who admire and feel affection for your country and for the Hungarian people."
"I fully understand that your government and some members of the public wanted information to be handled in a more balance way, and, objectively speaking, they were right."
"However, replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right."
"Consequently I am pleased this evening, but I am vigilant."
"I am pleased to see that your government has decided to return to several fundamental points and to change the December 2001 law on the media."
"This needed to be done and you did well to address this matter."
"I am also pleased that you are once more showing greater respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights which your people have always craved in the course of recent history."
"I would like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Kroes, and I support the composition of her group of monitoring experts."
"However, we will be vigilant, because we also feel that a number of points have not been dealt with, and we shall also pay attention to the details of the legislative amendments."
"In conclusion, I should like to tell you, President-in-Office of the Council, that you are the heirs to the fatherland of Liszt, of Kossuth, of the 1940 hero, Joël Brand, of Sándor Kopácsi and Colonel Maléter of 1956."
"You are the heirs of Sándor Márai."
"You are the heirs of Imre Kertész."
"So do not let us down!"
"It was a Hungarian who invented the magical game that is Rubik's cube."
"Do not teach us, in Europe, to play with the media in the style of a 'Jobbik's Cube' because that is a dreadful game."
"(HU) Mr President, today the specific text of the agreement between the Hungarian Government and the European Commission has been formulated."
"The Hungarian Government has read - which is a big thing these days, my fellow Members - and understood the comments of the Commission and, true to its word, will amend the media law."
"This means that the Hungarian Government and the Commission acted lawfully and in a democratic manner, whereas you have been putting on a political flea circus here today."
"Unfortunately this is not the first time you have done so, even though the cause of the problem has clearly been eliminated."
"The Hungarian socialist Members here are making baseless accusations, and are even inciting others."
"At home, on the other hand, their billion-forint scandals are coming to light one after another."
"Dear furious fellow Members, you have been deliberately misled."
"There is democracy in Hungary, and the media law is in compliance with all EU directives and requirements."
"Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, we should be addressing issues the resolution of which is far more urgent than the current political flea circus."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while I accept that those who so strongly criticised the Hungarian law want only freedom for the media and nothing else, I think we also need to show respect for the work of the Commission and the content of the debate in Parliament."
"In other words, I believe that, in order to avoid an unpleasant chapter in our Parliament's history, we must take responsibility for not voting tomorrow and simply scrap a resolution of which the contents have no foundation in reality, as the Commissioner's speech showed."
"I therefore call on both the Council and the Commission to make informal contact with the Conference of Presidents, so as to allow for the necessary and essential exchange of information that will enable Parliament to vote tomorrow, even before the resolutions, on a decision not to proceed with a vote, thus putting an end to ideological debates."
"(RO) Mr President, the assertions that you have made, Commissioner, confirm that the European Parliament was right when it levelled harsh criticism against Hungary's press law."
"Indeed, the Hungarian Government acknowledges by its willingness to amend the law, albeit in only four chapters, the failure of an anti-democratic measure."
"In your letter you finally acknowledge that you will examine this law and its compatibility, including with EU law in general."
"I wanted to hear you say that you would refer to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I have two questions for you, Commissioner, which I would ask you to answer."
"How can you think that the standards of the OSCE and Council of Europe are too high for the European Union?"
"Secondly, if an accession candidate country had an identical law to the unmodified version of the Hungarian law, could it conclude the relevant negotiation chapter?"
"- (SK) Mr President, we have a saying in Slovakia that the road to Hell is often paved with good intentions."
"I do not wish to doubt the good intentions of our Hungarian friends to make up-to-date modifications to media laws, but the current discussion confirms that some of the provisions of the new law might perhaps be formulated in a more sensitive way."
"The fact that the Hungarian Government decided to implement such a large number of changes and reforms in such a short space of time probably meant that insufficient attention was paid to the possible consequences of some of the provisions of the law."
"The same clearly applies to the Hungarian national law on dual citizenship, which will clearly create many unnecessary problems not only for us Europeans, but also for our foreign partners."
"How will our American or Canadian friends feel about it when hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians or Serbs turn up with European passports issued in Hungary to distant relatives, the descendants of inhabitants of the former Hungary?"
"I do not know whether this law was passed with good intentions."
"Mr President, one of the accounts of the Hungarian press law, says that it prescribes 'balanced coverage', which sounds all right on the face of it."
"Another account says that it fines publications for violating 'public interest, public morals or order'."
"Now these concepts do sound very vague, meaningless and therefore dangerous; almost as dangerous as concepts like xenophobia and racism, and whoever would think of legislating against them?"
"However, before we cast stones at Hungary, let us look at the standards and broadcasting media in our own countries."
"The BBC, also known as the British Brainwashing Corporation, acts in contempt of its charter's obligations of impartiality, and it excludes representatives of our own party, whilst giving gratuitously excessive publicity to the Establishment Safety Valve Party."
"Our party is significant enough to be attacked routinely, but not significant enough to be invited on the programmes."
"In 2006 it colluded with the government to trap our chairman into a jail."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, a couple of the honourable Members asked an intriguing question: is it a coincidence that today's debate should coincide with the Hungarian Government's decision?"
"Well, sometimes, Mr President, you need a small angel at your shoulder."
"For my own part, I prefer, when you invite me to come, to make clear what is at stake, to be able to come armed with facts and figures."
"Is what has happened today a coincidence?"
"The answer I will give to that comes, in a way, straight from my heart."
"We are talking about an entire procedure: it started at the end of December and we are now half way through February - so it has taken a bit more than seven weeks."
"Well, in the light of the six years I have been in office in the European institutions, that is quite speedy."
"My experience so far has been that things are rarely so speedy that I feel we can solve a problem within seven weeks."
"Having said that, the background to today's outcome is fascinating."
"We have a combination of factors."
"Firstly, we are not talking about this issue for the first time."
"You have invited me to discuss it before."
"You have been quite clear, so there has been no doubt about what is at stake - no doubt about what every party in this House thinks on this question."
"Secondly, we are talking about a very important issue."
"I do not need to explain to you that the issue of freedom of expression and freedom of the press is what is at stake for the Commission; and that it would be ridiculous if we did not make that a top priority with regard to defending democracy."
"Was it a coincidence that the previous item on the agenda this afternoon was the situation in Egypt?"
"You have been talking about creating democracy, so there is a clear thread here, and you can be absolutely certain that the Commission is aware of that and is, indeed, doing its utmost to defend democracy and to repair it where it may have been attacked."
"The third issue is, of course, the Hungarian Presidency."
"Let us not be naive."
"Of course our friends in this Member State within the family of Europe are aware that, for those in the chair, noblesse oblige."
"So from their side too there has been an approach of doing their utmost to solve the problem."
"The final point I would make in this explanation, in so far as I can offer one, is that the European Parliament has been crystal clear: you have been fighting and you have been keeping the outside world informed via the press - via a free press, I would add."
"So do not underestimate your own role."
"Having said that, for me the whole combination of factors is, at the end of the day, the explanation of why we have this result at this point of time."
"Fundamental rights are the issue that has been at stake: there is no doubt about that."
"Anyone who thinks that I am interested only in peace and quiet does not know me in the least, because I am fighting for democracy."
"I do have a fair bit of experience and I have had a longer life in politics than most of you."
"Let me touch, also, on a couple of the specific issues about which I was asked."
"What about the independence of the media regulator?"
"Our preliminary analysis of the Hungarian law concludes that the procedures for nominating and electing the president and members of the media council are no different from those that are commonly accepted in Europe."
"We have to acknowledge - whether it furthers our case or not - that the governing party holds a two-thirds majority, and that, in a democracy, is a simple fact."
"(Applause)"
"On the question of the application of Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we are applying the directive - the AVMS Directive - and the Treaty, and that implies of course applying Article 11 of the Charter."
"So there is no doubt about that."
"Mr Moraes said there was no judicial review of decisions by the media authority."
"A decision by the Media Council, passed in its capacity as an authority of the first instance, cannot be appealed via an administrative procedure."
"However, as provided for in Article 163, an official decision of the Media Council may be challenged in court in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure."
"The lodging of the appeal does not have suspensory effect but the code may be invoked to suspend the execution of the decision."
"Ms Weber said that the protection of sources under the Hungarian media law is insufficient."
"If we take press freedom as a basic European principle, that should be the starting point and the ultimate end in all our thinking on this subject."
"I have always defended press freedom at European level and I will continue - and I promise you the Commission will continue - to promote it untiringly."
"The right of journalists to protect their sources is one of the main principles guaranteeing the effective exercise of press freedom."
"Journalists should never be required to reveal their sources unless it is necessary for them to do so for the purposes of a criminal investigation, and that principle is valid whatever the political climate."
"In fact, it needs to be defended with more passion whenever the press and the media generally are in a weaker position, as is the case nowadays."
"The Directive on privacy and electronic communications currently in force requires the Member States to ensure the confidentiality of communications."
"However, the directive does not apply to activities which fall outside the scope of the EU treaties."
"That is to say that EU law does not apply to matters relating to public security, defence, state security or the enforcement of criminal law and, moreover, under the principle of subsidiarity, Member States have the possibility of taking measures that could restrict an individual's right to privacy, in accordance with their own rules and with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Any such restriction must be necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, and a Commissioner is not in a position to judge or condemn such national doings, nor do I wish to do so."
"On the matter of the absence of reference to Article 30 - and a number of Members have asked about that - I know that many of you have complained that the Commission has not taken Article 30 fully into account when assessing the media law."
"I should like to say loudly and clearly: that is simply not true."
"Although in its original proposal for the AVMS Directive the Commission had included an obligation on the Member States to guarantee the independence of the national regulatory authorities - and I know full well that your memory on such matters is excellent - that provision was not supported by the Council and, despite strong support from the European Parliament, it was changed into the current Article 30 of the AVMS Directive."
"The final wording of the AVMS Directive does not directly establish an obligation to create independent bodies."
"It is not what we would have wished but it is what was written down in the text and we have to accept it, albeit with regret."
"The Hungarian authorities have agreed to delete the provision in question and add the following declaratory text to Article 10 of the Media Constitution, and I quote: 'It is the task for the entirety of the media system to provide authentic, rapid and accurate information on such affairs and events'."
"So that will be the text after the changes."
"I have to apologise that you did not receive the text, but I myself did not receive it or, at least, I had only the text that we were negotiating and I could not distribute that to you."
"However, as soon as it is possible, I will supply you with the text."
"Of course - while I hope you believe what I am saying and I would appreciate that - I imagine that, at the end of the day, you want to see it in writing and have the opportunity to read it."
"One of the issues that will make sense for you when you are making up your minds is that of the balanced reporting requirements: as I said in my opening remarks, these will no longer apply to the written press or to on-demand audiovisual media services."
"On the question, which Mr Løkkegaard asked, of whether I am ready to propose legislation on media pluralism, I said in my opening remarks that I am ready to take action in the matter of media pluralism within the existing EU competences."
"There is no one-size-fits-all approach: that is clear to me, and the Hungarian case has made it even clearer."
"I will set up the working group to which I referred, and I thank you for your willingness to join it, in order to discuss the challenges we are facing, to make sure we have a comprehensive overview of the situation in Europe and, of course, to act accordingly - including on the question of media independence."
"That should be one of the main priorities."
"With regard to the position of the OSCE on the Hungarian media legislation, in relation to our own analysis, there is a difference of legal bases, but the OSCE was quite clear and quite right in its conclusions."
"The main issues raised by the OSCE concern the new Media Authority, in particular the long duration of the term of office of its members and the regulation of the public service broadcaster."
"I have explained the Commission's point of view here, and I think that the terms of office of members of other broadcasting councils, for example in other Member States, range in some cases from five to nine years."
"One example but it is not the only one, is the Rundfunkräte (public broadcasting boards)."
"The crucial thing - and this is my final remark - is the message from the Deputy Prime Minister that I received this morning when I touched down, and I am certain that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will repeat the message that the Hungarian Government wrote down for me, and for the Commission, stating what the position is."
"During the seven weeks in which we closely cooperated, I had already been impressed by the input of my own staff who had been working like hell. But I can assure you that both sides worked like hell and that they did their jobs not just in the proper way but in a constructive way, in order to find a solution, because this is a very important matter, and we have to find a solution."
"(IT) Mr President, I urge the Commissioner, as a procedural matter, to have the texts she referred to sent out tonight, at least to the group chairs, so that tomorrow we can be as confident as possible before expressing our vote."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as far as I am concerned the answer is a clear yes."
"The Hungarian minister's body language is also saying yes."
"That will be done as soon as possible."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, please appreciate that I do not have to use my body when I express myself."
"A couple of brief points on behalf of Hungary: given the fact that Commissioner Kroes' answer was extensive and exhaustive, and also concerned the composition of the media council, this was a specific question addressed to me which I think has been answered correctly, so I can limit myself to a couple of points."
"First and foremost, I would like to underline that Hungary is fully committed to the values, principles and the rules enshrined in the Treaty, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in all other instruments of international law, be they European or universal, on human rights."
"The first harsh criticism of the media law was made prior to the adoption of the law."
"I make particular reference to the comments made by the OSCE media representative."
"My simple wish was for the text to be read, studied and analysed, and then for us to be told what could be wrong, what kind of doubts or concerns might arise with respect to the text, or indeed with respect to the interpretation of the implementation of the law."
"This was the reason why we immediately welcomed and supported the Commission, being the Guardian of the Treaty, in its analysis of the text, and invited it to express its doubts or concerns."
"Now that is exactly what happened."
"The Commission scrutinised carefully the law, made some proposals and all these proposals were adopted."
"I can only confirm that the day after tomorrow there will be a cabinet meeting."
"We will adopt the text and we will submit it immediately to the Hungarian Parliament and the amendments will be adopted as soon as is procedurally possible and will immediately enter into force."
"I would like to thank the Commission for its hard work, help and assistance, but I would also like to thank all of you who made fair and reasonable comments and assisted us in this exercise, which I am convinced has been extremely important, not only for ourselves, but also for the European Union as a whole."
"I would just like to offer our help and full support to the working group the Commission is about to establish."
"This is in the interests of Europe as a whole and we all want to participate in it and to help it as much as we can."
"The only thing I regret is the excessive language which appeared in some of the political statements."
"As I said already before, the law would have been adopted."
"Sometimes we had the feeling that we were being subjected to what the French call 'un procès d'intention', a kind of 'Schuldvermutung.'"
"I had the feeling that it was the presumption of guilt which was being applied instead of the presumption of innocence which is, of course, a basic rule of any fair trial."
"So sometimes these statements went beyond the limits of reasonable and fair political debate - a political debate which we otherwise fully support, both domestically and at a European or universal level."
"In fact, it was harmful to the interests of Europe as a whole - it was harmful to European integration."
"Now I believe that we are hopefully over that."
"I just would like to confirm again our full respect and to testify to this I would just like to let you know that it is our firm intention to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the new Hungarian Constitution."
"Hungary will thus be the first country where the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be an integral part of the Hungarian legal system."
"It will be applicable not only in the areas covered by Union law, but it will be at the top of the hierarchy of the overall legal system and it will prevail over any other legislation or regulation, be it criminal law, be it about the media or be it about any other subject."
"That should give an assurance to all of you that the basic rules, the basic values and the basic principles which we all share are, and will be, fully respected by my country."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place at 12:00 tomorrow."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) In their motion for a resolution, my fellow Members request that the European Commission also take into account the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights when scrutinising the Hungarian media law, and if the government fails to amend the law as desired within a fixed deadline, launch an infringement procedure against Hungary."
"Similarly, my fellow Members also request that the Commission initiate, still in this year, a European regulatory framework to ensure the assertion of the freedom of the media in the Member States."
"I am very pleased to note that increasing attention is being accorded to the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I therefore propose that the Commission also examine the application of the Charter, and in particular Articles 21 and 22 thereof, in the case of the Slovak language law."
"Furthermore, I welcome the fact that there is a demand for initiating a draft European directive to ensure the inviolability of the freedom of the media."
"I believe that the creation of a similar regulatory framework would definitely be justified with regard to the problems of indigenous national minorities."
"This is because there are countries within the European Union where it is not the requirement of balanced reporting that results in infringements of the rights of European citizens who have been living in the same areas for centuries, but penalties that are imposed on them for the use of their mother tongue."
"Freedom and pluralism of the media is one of the fundamental freedoms which underpins the European Union."
"This is why I am overjoyed that the European Commission has reacted emphatically to information concerning the Hungarian media law and has taken real action."
"As someone who has worked in the media for many years, I will be watching with interest the work of the expert group announced by Commissioner Kroes which is to advise the Commission on further action."
"At the same time, I would like to point out that the legal analysis of the compliance of the Hungarian media law with European law carried out by the Commission has, unfortunately, illustrated the weakness of European law, specifically the Audiovisual Media Services Directive."
"Paradoxically, the Directive does not give the Commission much room for manoeuvre."
"So when the Hungarian law was being analysed, the Commission had to 'stretch' certain arguments and base them on the actual Treaty (freedom of enterprise) rather than the Directive."
"I realise that the European Union has limited jurisdiction in the field of audiovisual policy, but on the other hand I believe that the media, which is one of the fundamentals of democracy, must have certain minimum rights and must be subject to common standards."
"This is why I share the view of my political group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the need for a review of the EU legal framework in order to introduce minimum requirements for the freedom and pluralism of the media, and I trust we shall soon begin a substantive discussion on the subject."
"Free trade agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation by Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Republic of Korea [08505/2010 - C7-0320/2010 - 2010/0075(NLE)]."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this FTA is the first of a new generation of trade agreements launched in 2007 as part of the global Europe initiative."
"Global economy, instability and a stagnated mutlilateral system have strengthened the need and pursuit for increased bilateral relations."
"It is the first FTA in which Parliament will exercise its new enhanced powers given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The FTA is designed to provide EU businesses, in a wide variety of economic sectors, with extensive and comprehensive access to the South Korean market through a series of unprecedented tariff liberalisations."
"It guarantees WTO-plus disciplines in the case of, for example, geographical indicators, government procurement, greater transparency of state aid and strong enforcement of intellectual property rights, and contains an all-important chapter on sustainable development."
"However, while the many advantages are both immediate and conspicuous, I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism - a safeguard that allows the EU to restore MFN duty rates, should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry."
"It is a safeguard that specifically addresses the concerns of Europe's sensitive sectors, including the auto industry, consumer electronics and textiles, and guarantees the protection they deserve."
"On this note I would like to thank Pablo Zalba Bidegain for the work that he did on this specific part of the agreement."
"The South Korea market offers significant new opportunities for EU goods and services. It is a market that until now has remained relatively closed off, due to high tariff levies and costly non-tariff barriers."
"The FTA will quickly remove EUR 1.6 billion worth of EU export duties levied annually."
"There will be benefits for EU exporters of industrial and agricultural products, immediate savings on chemicals - approximately EUR 175 million -pharmaceuticals, auto parts, industrial machinery, and the list goes on. It is also worth noting that these figures quoted will probably be even higher, because of the increased trade."
"Korea is currently among those more globally valuable export markets for EU farmers, with annual sales of over EUR 1 billion to Korea."
"The FTA fully liberalises nearly all the EU's agricultural exports."
"Exports are thus an important source of growth for the EU."
"They contribute to wealth and employment for European businesses and their employees and will act as one of the most important factors in stimulating the EU economic recovery."
"The Commission and the European Car Association have worked closely together to get this agreement."
"The world is watching as Europe leads the way in improving trade and economic relations, with partners in every corner of the world looking at it."
"I have always said that trade is the real means of development."
"By removing barriers to trade and building new bridges we create new opportunities."
"This particular FTA offers a new approach."
"Complementary, of course, to Doha, it will drive Europe's recovery and growth and the European Parliament will be instrumental in determining the future of global trade policy."
"At this stage I would like to thank Ignacio from the Commission."
"One of the economists said, Ignacio, that this is probably the best trade agreement that both parties could ever have agreed."
"I urge all groups to put aside protectionism and support this agreement."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for all the efforts which Parliament in general, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) in particular, has put into securing prompt assessment - and, I hope, ratification - of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA)."
"This will permit its entry into force."
"This complex task comprised two major processes: finalisation of negotiations on the Korea Safeguard Regulation, implementing the bilateral safeguard clause of the EU-Korea FTA, and the preparation of consent to this treaty."
"I welcome the first-reading agreement between the Council and Parliament on the Safeguard Regulation."
"The work that was done has not only secured legislation which will provide necessary protection for EU industry, but it has also confirmed the joint commitment of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to efficient law making."
"This was also the first trade dossier on which Parliament acted as co-legislator under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The outcome of its involvement is indeed impressive."
"I will not repeat the list of benefits which the EU-Korea FTA is expected to bring to the EU economy: we have thoroughly debated them here in the past, and Mr Sturdy has just summed them up."
"Let me instead open a brief parenthesis to place the agreement with Korea in the wider perspective of the future of EU trade policy, as sketched out by the Commission in its communication of 9 November 2010, and to recap the basic tenets of our policy line."
"First of all, we continue to favour the multilateral channel of the WTO as the first-best way to liberalise trade and lay down the rules to govern global commerce."
"Despite the setbacks and the deadlock since mid-2008, we continue to push actively for the conclusion of the Doha development round, 10 years now after its inception."
"It is still well worth clinching a deal, both for the economic gains and in the interests of furthering the WTO."
"That is why I took the initiative of bringing together in Davos the trade ministers of the world's seven most important trading countries to discuss, in concrete terms, how we can now proceed and enter the end-game, following the impetus given by the G20 in Seoul."
"I believe our meeting was a success, and senior officials are now working intensively in an attempt to stage a political breakthrough in the summer."
"However, as we said back in November, the bilateral and the multilateral are not enemies."
"Indeed, it may well be the case that liberalisation fuels liberalisation."
"We have pursued bilateral trade deals that generate genuine value added compared with what can be achieved through the WTO, and we will keep on doing so because the pace of multilateral progress is unavoidably slow."
"This has been, and is, our fundamental motivation for pursuing the FTA with Korea."
"I will reiterate today the Commission's commitments to the European Parliament, which it made in relation to the implementation of the Korea Safeguard Regulation and the EU-Korea FTA."
"As provided for in the Safeguard Regulation, 'the Commission will present a yearly report to the European Parliament and Council on the implementation of the EU-Korea FTA and will be ready to discuss with the INTA Committee any issues arising from the implementation of the Agreement."
"'The Commission will closely monitor the implementation by Korea of its commitments on regulatory issues, including in particular the commitments relating to technical regulations in the car sector."
"The monitoring shall include all aspects of non-tariff barriers and its results shall be documented and reported to the European Parliament and the Council."
"'Particular importance will be attached to the effective implementation of commitments on labour and environment of Chapter 13: Trade and Sustainable Development of the FTA."
"In this connection, the Commission will seek the advice of the Domestic Advisory Group, which will include representatives of business organisations, trade unions and non-governmental organisations."
"The implementation of Chapter 13 of the FTA shall be duly documented and reported to the European Parliament and the Council."
"'The Commission also agrees on the importance of providing effective protection in the case of sudden surges of imports in sensitive sectors, including small cars."
"Monitoring of sensitive sectors shall include cars, textiles and consumer electronics."
"In this connection, the Commission notes that the small-car sector can be considered a relevant market for the purpose of a safeguard investigation."
"'The Commission notes that the designation of outward processing zones in the Korean Peninsula, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Protocol on Rules of Origin, would require an international agreement between the parties to which the European Parliament would have to give its consent."
"The Commission will keep Parliament fully informed of the deliberations by the Committee on Outward Processing Zones in the Korean Peninsula."
"'The Commission also notes that if, due to exceptional circumstances, it decides to extend the duration of an investigation pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Korea Safeguard Regulation, it will ensure that such an extended timing does not go beyond the expiry date of any provisional measures introduced pursuant to Article 5."
"'Moreover, the Commission and the European Parliament agree on the importance of close cooperation in monitoring the implementation of the EU-Korea FTA and the Safeguard Regulation."
"'To this end, in case the EP adopts a recommendation to initiate a safeguard investigation, the Commission will carefully examine whether the conditions under the regulation for ex-officio initiation are fulfilled."
"In case the Commission considers that the conditions are not fulfilled, it will present a report to the INTA Committee including an explanation of all factors relevant to the initiation of such an investigation."
"'Upon request by the INTA Committee, the Commission shall report to the committee on any specific concerns relating to the implementation by Korea of its commitments on non-tariff measures or on Chapter 13 of the FTA.'"
"That is the end of the quotation."
"Finally, let me elaborate on two issues which are of interest to you: the Korean CO2 legislation on car emissions, and the supplementary agreement on the draft Korea-US FTA (KORUS), which was finalised in December 2010."
"On 24 January 2011, Korea confirmed that certain changes will be introduced to its previous draft CO2 legislation, which satisfactorily address a number of concerns expressed by European car makers, while retaining Korea's ambitious emission reduction objectives."
"The changes, which the Commission welcomes, will not alter overall emissions, but will provide for fairer burden sharing between Korean and EU car makers."
"Rest assured that the EU position on the Korea CO2 legislation was closely coordinated at all stages within the Commission and, in particular, with my colleague Connie Hedegaard and DG CLIMA, to avoid undermining Korea's environmental protection efforts."
"As for the supplementary agreement to the draft Korea-US FTA reached in December 2010, the Commission has not identified elements therein that could have a negative impact on the EU."
"I will, however, contact my Korean counterpart to ensure that no competitive disadvantage arises in future for the EU automotive sector insofar as non-harmonised automotive safety standards will not be applied in a more restrictive manner than was the case at the time of the negotiations."
"The Commission will be closely monitoring the implementation of this provision."
"In particular, the Working Group on Motor Vehicles and Parts established by the FTA will examine practical aspects of implementation to ensure that market access problems are addressed in an effective and speedy manner."
"To conclude, I wish to emphasise that the EU-Korea FTA will not only provide important benefits for European exporters to the Korean market, but will also be a clear signal of our determination to pursue new opportunities in key Asian economies."
"We are also addressing the concerns of some stakeholders by means of an efficient and effective safeguard regulation."
"As this is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, both the Council and this House have been able to introduce mechanisms for responding to perceived risks should they materialise."
"With this FTA and the Safeguard Regulation we have an excellent package that I hope you will support tomorrow."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international trade and exports are an important source of growth and employment in Europe."
"The Free Trade Agreement that we are debating today will strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union and will provide our enterprises with significantly better access to a highly dynamic region of growth."
"Both the European and the Korean economy will benefit considerably."
"Our gross domestic product will increase."
"That could lead to the creation of new jobs."
"Our exports to Korea will double in the next few years according to all the forecasts because duties and non-tariff barriers to trade will be abolished; the relief in terms of duties alone will amount to EUR 1.6 billion per year."
"For the European Union there will be a substantial new trade in goods and services with a value of up to EUR 19 billion."
"I am particularly pleased that, in the negotiations, the Commission took full account of the negotiation recommendations expressed by the European Parliament in the Martin Report from 2008."
"I am also pleased that the European Commission took account both of the concerns expressed by Parliament and also of those coming from industry and it was also able to dispel some concerns just in the last few weeks."
"Something that I have never experienced before in the area of foreign trade is positive feedback even coming from the agricultural sector, which is usually more likely to be a problem for us in the area of trade negotiations."
"In the area of agriculture, the agreement will facilitate access to South Korea for European agricultural products from 1 July 2011."
"Up to now, only 2% of our agricultural products reach the South Korean market duty free."
"For pork, annual duties amounting to EUR 240 million are paid, and for milk and milk products the figure is around EUR 100 million."
"All of these barriers to market access for our domestic agriculture will now be removed."
"I would be pleased if, for this area in particular, the European Commission would consider how we could set up some kind of market access programme, not only for small and medium-sized enterprises, but also for agriculture in the countries that will profit from the Free Trade Agreement."
"Above all, I would be pleased if we were also to ensure that our partners in South Korea now actually implement the trade facilitation measures promised in the agreement."
"I call for it to be clearly monitored whether new barriers to trade are introduced, and I would, in particular, like to congratulate the Commission."
"What the Commission has achieved and what Parliament's rapporteurs have achieved, particularly in the trialogue negotiations, is an example to us all."
"I hope that we will have a broad majority in favour of this agreement in this House tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, early in this parliamentary term, which is my first, one of the matters I first heard discussed was precisely the Free Trade Agreement with Korea."
"Certain sectors of European industry, especially the automotive industry, were unanimous in opposing this agreement."
"As a citizen of Navarre and Spain, where the automotive industry represents a substantial part of our economy, I felt the duty to become involved in order to improve, if not the agreement as this was no longer possible, the safeguard clause, which was where Parliament could introduce improvements."
"Thus, we set out to achieve two objectives."
"Firstly, to protect the industry and its jobs, and secondly, to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned, particularly the automotive industry."
"Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection, but to gain their support for the agreement."
"I believe that here today, we can say 'mission accomplished'."
"This is all thanks to Parliament's hard work and expertise."
"I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work."
"Thank you Robert."
"And thank you also for your words."
"Recognition is also due to the members of the Committee on International Trade, led by its Chair, Mr Moreira."
"¡Muito obrigado!, Vital."
"I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the European Union for their excellent work."
"Their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in December."
"Lastly, I would like to highlight the work of the European Commission, and particularly Ignacio Bercero's contribution, for which I am most grateful."
"Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a clause which will be more effective, easier to apply and will genuinely protect European industry."
"Today, concerns on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea have hugely diminished."
"Indeed, we might say that they have all but vanished."
"Today, the opportunities this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainties."
"The European Parliament should be proud of a job well done."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has in fact put trade policy on a new footing."
"The EU is solely responsible for trade policy and Parliament gives or withholds its consent."
"In that respect, we have gained a new responsibility."
"We can only enable this new responsibility to take shape if we act together."
"We have proven that very clearly in this matter."
"In this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"Trade policy is not an end in itself."
"Its purpose is, firstly, to strengthen jobs and industrial development in the European Union and, secondly, to improve conditions for people in other countries of the world."
"The aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goals."
"We therefore need to assess this agreement from this viewpoint."
"Overall, this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling these two requirements."
"However, we certainly do have a few points of criticism, for example the question of duty drawback in South Korea, which will bring one-sided competitive advantages for certain sectors of industry in South Korea, particularly in sensitive areas such as the automotive industry."
"It was therefore right for us to have very intensive talks about a safeguard clause and also to have jointly implemented such a clause, which provides for the close monitoring of precisely these points, so that we can be certain that the possibilities provided by duty drawback in South Korea do not lead to a distortion of competition in Europe."
"Parliament has rightly established safeguards here."
"Secondly, this agreement also has the purpose of improving the situation in South Korea for our colleagues there."
"South Korea still has improvements to make with regard to Chapter 13, in particular the question of the core labour standards laid down by the ILO."
"Two absolutely crucial core labour standards - No 87 and No 98, relating to collective bargaining - have not be implemented or ratified."
"Section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business."
"Neither of these things is in line with the nature and the provisions of this agreement."
"Thus, Commissioner, I am relying on you, and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause, to change this situation in South Korea so that this agreement will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently witnessing a historic situation, because the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea that we are debating and that we intend to adopt is the first Free Trade Agreement that has been debated under the new Lisbon system, which grants Parliament full power of codecision."
"This makes an important area of policy - trade policy - more democratic."
"We, as Parliament, consider this to be important."
"The debate here in Parliament has also shown that, as regards safeguard clauses, we were able to include important concerns expressed to us by workers, companies and associations in an improved safeguard clause that is intended to protect the interests of industry and, above all, jobs in the future by creating a level playing field and fair conditions for competition and avoiding asymmetries."
"That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on."
"As shadow rapporteur for our group, I am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard."
"The duty drawback mechanism, which caused us concern to start with, has now been explicitly included in the safeguard clause and there is the option for industry, and also for Parliament, to call on the Commission to carry out an investigation."
"A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry."
"Mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission, particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports, are also provided for. We can start with this and focus on the advantages associated with the South Korea agreement, such as the considerable reduction in duties - the Commission expects enterprises in Europe to be able to save EUR 1.6 billion."
"I would therefore like to thank Commissioner De Gucht, who has personally worked hard to enable us to reach a compromise, including with the Council."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain, for their excellent work."
"We have achieved something really good here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact the first major Free Trade Agreement that Europe has passed for some years, and when it comes to free trade agreements, it must be said that you do not lack ambition - South Korea, Canada, India, Mercosur."
"There is not a single country or area that escapes the European Commission's ambitions where free trade agreements are concerned."
"In the case of this agreement, we have seen that there will only be winners, but I still wonder who the winners will be when I am told that they will be in the agricultural sector."
"As the elected representative of Brittany, I can tell you that in in that region which produces more than 60% of French pigmeat, the few benefits to be had by the agri-food product firms do not compensate for reductions in tourism, degradation of the environment and the health of workers, and farmers' losses."
"There are, indeed, also a great number of losers, and do we, here, have a vision of what economic and social Europe will be like after all these free trade agreements have been signed?"
"No we do not, and nor do we know, at the end of the day, whether there will be any industrial or economic sector left to benefit from these free trade agreements."
"Moreover, and most importantly, Commissioner, try as you might to tell us that we are not questioning South Korea's environmental and climate policy, that is not true."
"We are going to be able to export enormous saloon cars, those cars of which the manufacturers who make the least amount of effort to combat climate change are rewarded by this agreement."
"For the first time, the European Union is questioning the climate policy of one of its trading partners."
"Has the European Commission started to change, under pressure from Canada, its directive on fuel quality?"
"We believe that we are putting Europe's ambitions in the wrong order: the environment and the climate must come before trade."
"That is why our group will vote against this agreement."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, with the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement signed in October 2010, which has been assigned the attribute by the Commission and the Council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the EU and a highly industrialised state, the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98% in the next five years."
"The trade exchange between the EU and Korea is supposed to double in the medium term and that - so it is said - will speed up economic growth and the creation of jobs and prosperity."
"My group and I have justified doubts about this prediction."
"Quite apart from the mantra of the role of free trade as a kind of saviour of the global economy that is currently in a precarious state, which is also reflected in the Free Trade Agreement itself, it is not clear from this agreement whether it will, or will able to, help us deal with the global challenges arising as a result of climate change and the necessary fundamental economic restructuring."
"What are the efficiency criteria and what are the free trade criteria?"
"At the same time, Commissioner, the Free Trade Agreement that has been concluded hardly contains any references to sustainability for the future, oriented change or international economic cooperation."
"An agreement is being concluded in which the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation are still being contravened."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Mr President, tomorrow we will vote on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea, and this has been a long time coming."
"Most of us will agree that this is a win-win situation."
"It will be particularly beneficial for Europe's farmers and economic operators."
"However, we must not ignore the fact that the agreement does not only bring advantages for European companies and Korean farmers."
"Some sectors will benefit from the agreement, whereas others will inevitably lose out."
"Thus, in future, EU citizens will be able to buy cheaper technology products and cars from Korea."
"In return, Korea will get badly needed food from Europe as well as medicines and luxury goods."
"The agreement may also lead to better environmental and working conditions in Korea - that is something worth mentioning and to be pleased about."
"I hope that the agreement can enter into force quickly, especially as the EU wants a first-mover advantage over the United States, which is also in negotiations with Korea in respect of a similar agreement."
"Finally, I would like to thank all of the rapporteurs involved for their untiring and highly competent work."
". - (NL) Mr President, tomorrow we will be voting on the free-trade agreement with South Korea."
"I must say that it looks good at first glance."
"The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is a strong supporter of free trade."
"Unfortunately, the European Union could not resist adding a safeguard clause to the trade agreement."
"This means that non-competitive companies will be protected when unable to hold their own when faced with competition from Korean products."
"In other words, should the European consumer choose to buy Korean products, rather than European ones, for the simple reason that the former may be better quality or cheaper, then trade barriers will once again be erected."
"Look how the vicious European reflex towards protectionism and market intervention is rearing its head again."
"Mr President, free trade that does not entail any disadvantage for European industry is, of course, an illusion."
"Therefore, trying to overcome this by including a safeguard clause and offering compensation to disadvantaged industries is a totally misguided solution."
"This will allow industries that are competing poorly to carry on doing what they have always done, instead of adapting to the competition."
"Worse still, who will ultimately be footing this bill?"
"Exactly: our citizens, unfortunately."
"As consumers, they will be forced to pay over the odds for their purchases and, on top of that, as taxpayers, they will even have to cough up the required compensation."
"How am I supposed to explain to my constituents that they will soon have to foot the bill if, for example, Fiat loses some of its market share to Kia?"
"These rules have no place in a free trade agreement."
"In practice, this is nothing other than subsidising inefficient companies on the backs of European citizens."
"Free trade?"
"What a great idea, but please let us drop this safeguard clause."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, South Korea is indeed a very important market for products from European industry - that has been emphasised and cars have been highlighted - but also for farmers."
"I would emphasise that we need it to be a win-win situation."
"There is a new generation coming up, which is a good thing."
"The agreement with South Korea contains a chapter on sustainable development, which covers labour standards, environmental policy and a monitoring mechanism that is to involve civil society."
"That is also good."
"The Free Trade Agreement is a step in the right direction, and I would like to thank everyone involved and emphasise that some excellent work has been done."
"Nevertheless, I would also call for clear rules for the production chain as a whole, particularly with regard to food."
"We should not only consider the end product, and it should not only be the agricultural industry that benefits; farmers should benefit, too."
"In the interests of European consumers and our farmers, when trade flows are liberalised it absolutely must be ensured that agricultural products that are imported into the European Union meet our high standards in respect of environmental, animal and consumer protection, including at their point of origin and throughout the production chain."
"I will support the position of the Committee on International Trade tomorrow, but where further liberalisation efforts are concerned I would call strongly for the food sector and farmers also to be taken into account."
"(PT) Mr President, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on International Trade, I should like, first and foremost, to express my satisfaction that we are about to successfully conclude our first major test in exercising the codecision powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has granted us in the area of trade agreements."
"I feel that we exercised our powers with a great sense of responsibility, and I believe that it is only right that I should thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, and also express my gratitude for the spirit of cooperation on the part of the Commission and the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, during the negotiations on the safeguard regulation."
"It should be noted that in the vote that took place in the Committee on International Trade, there was an overwhelming majority in favour of recommending approval of the trade agreement and adopting the regulation on the safeguard mechanism."
"This demonstrates that Parliament is capable of forming a broad-based political coalition for more openness in international trade, in line with one of the principles laid down in the trade agreement itself, in fact."
"The trade agreement is, to my mind, mutually beneficial."
"With the mutual opening of both markets, each economy can profit from their competitive advantages."
"The trade agreement will not only remove tariff and non-tariff barriers, but will also encompass the opening up of the public procurement market, safeguard intellectual property rights, and protect employment rights and environmental standards."
"Once the agreement has been ratified, which will be tomorrow, I hope, we must move resolutely to the next stage, which is its implementation."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us."
"I am talking about the refund of customs duties that Korea will receive for imports of products from China or other countries."
"We have already discussed this, but as a liberal democrat I consider this measure to be deeply flawed."
"It is a kind of export subsidy, and I would like it if, when voting on this agreement, we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements."
"Tomorrow's vote will conclude one leg of the journey we have undertaken together, but only one leg, because the relationship between Parliament and the Commission must continue, not least with regard to the actual implementation of the safeguard clause."
"For the sake of European industry and European workers, we cannot make any mistakes when implementing it, or else we will face great problems in future agreements."
"This is the Year of the Rabbit in the Far East, so I hope European industry will run like a rabbit, taking advantage of what this agreement can offer it."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I still remember very well how - as is happening now in Egypt and Tunisia - the people in Korea, particularly the young people, took to the streets and, in the face of police truncheons and weapon, fought for freedom, democracy and self-determination."
"What has happened since then is unbelievable."
"It is unbelievable how much has been achieved in Korea in respect of democracy, self-determination and freedom, but also with regard to the economy and now increasingly also the environment."
"This makes Korea a good example for many other Asian countries, and it is also a country our ever closer cooperation with which I very much welcome, along with our work to break down customs barriers and to establish fairer trade."
"Nevertheless, we are rejecting this agreement today and there are a number of specific reasons for this, some of which have been mentioned by my colleague Mr Jadot."
"In addition to what has been said, I would also like to mention the regulation in the area of the financial sector, which we consider to be a step in the wrong direction."
"However, there are also fundamental reasons for this."
"We are concluding more and more free trade agreements, each one giving rise to another one."
"What we need is not a patchwork of more new individual agreements, but just and fair rules for world trade as a whole."
"Mr President, a free trade agreement cannot only be about tariffs."
"It also has to be about intellectual property rights."
"A business in my constituency, Avon Protection, is a world leader in the manufacture of gas masks."
"Avon believes that its patents have been infringed by a South Korean firm making what are quite simply copies."
"There is meant to be patent protection in South Korea, but will a Korean court really find in favour of a British company against a Korean business?"
"For free trade to work, there has to be a level playing field and, yes, a safeguard clause such as Pablo Zalba Bidegain's is useful, but the other signatory must also ensure that the agreement is indeed a two-way street, otherwise the Free Trade Agreement which should benefit both parties simply becomes completely one-sided."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is wrong to have turned the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea into a stand-off between supposed neo-protectionists and die-hard free-traders."
"I also think it is wrong for the Commission to have acted more like a service economy development agency than the political government of 500 million Europeans, which should strike a balance between considerations relating to growth on the one hand, and to employment and distribution of wealth on the other."
"What differentiates us from the United States, which has not yet ratified this agreement - and we know why - and this also applies to relations with Korea, is the very fact that no world economic power exposes its quality - and I stress the word 'quality' - manufacturing industry to inevitable dismantling processes, sacrificing it on the altar of financial interests, setting white-collar workers from the City of London against the white-coated workers of modern European factories, which is exactly what Europe does not need in the wake of the crisis."
"All this, Mr Sturdy, Commissioner, has nothing whatsoever to do with neo-protectionism."
"Otherwise we would have to include in this category the Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, French and Italian Industry Ministers who, in the 10 February edition of Le Monde, reiterated the need to make Community interest central to the work of the European institutions, stating that in this case it definitely could not be protected by the safeguard clause, however worthy it may be."
"An excellent academic exercise in the field of international trade relations has taken place, but we have failed to act in Europe's interests."
"For that reason ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, this Free Trade Agreement is the first to have been examined since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force and that is why we MEPs believe that it really cannot come into force until we have obtained robust guarantees, guarantees that must, furthermore, act as a model for future trade agreements."
"It will therefore be up to us - to you and to us - to ensure the proper implementation of these mechanisms in order to protect the European economy in the event of distortions of competition."
"However, that should not in any case exonerate us from strategic thinking in two areas."
"Firstly, in order to guarantee that competition is genuinely fair, it is essential for social, health and environmental standards to be taken into account in trade agreements."
"That is an essential requirement."
"My second point is that Europe must finally provide itself with the instruments necessary to retain or recover production capacity, for example industrial or agricultural production capacity, and to retain - and this is absolutely vital for its future - its technological progress."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I only hope that what we are discussing right now does not end up being an additional and perhaps final death blow to our economies."
"We are already flooded with goods produced at low or very low cost, arriving mainly from east and south-east Asia."
"Many Italian companies, especially SMEs, have been brought to their knees due to unfair competition."
"This means that they cannot compete on the market, with tragic consequences as far as the economy and especially employment is concerned."
"This agreement provides for various safeguard and protection clauses, but who can assure us that these rules will really be applied later on?"
"There are still too many unknowns, and the possible benefit to be had by a few large producers cannot always rebound on the smallest producers alone."
"In my region, Tuscany, our textile industry - historically a driving force - is already in a serious condition due to Asian competition: I only hope that Europe itself does not deal the death blow to this sector, and probably many others besides, with this agreement."
"We will not vote for this agreement."
"- (SK) Mr President, since the start of negotiations in May 2007, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea has had a long and difficult journey."
"Despite the clear benefits to both sides, some key sectors of European industry were exposed to serious risks."
"I also expressed my reservations on the floor of this Parliament, and I called for fair and balanced rules of the game."
"The solution was the bilateral safeguard clause."
"I would like to thank Robert Sturdy and Pablo Zalba Bidegain for their leadership as rapporteurs, as well as everyone else involved."
"Thanks to their combined efforts, the economies of the EU and South Korea will be billions of euros better off."
"From July 2011, the real victors in this agreement will be the consumers and citizens of both sides."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everybody has said that the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea is an institutional and strategic innovation on the part of the Union."
"On the contrary, it is an unbalanced agreement that will have a negative impact on the European manufacturing industry."
"The elimination of duties on Korean products in return for a rise in environmental and social standards in Korea cannot be considered fair."
"The Korean shipbuilding industry benefits from substantial state aid, which has enabled it to attain a 30% share of the world market."
"This means that European industry, be it automotive, textile, chemical or any other, must defend itself against competition that if not unfair in form, is unfair in fact."
"The introduction of the safeguard clause is an appropriate measure, but it is not sufficient to patch up the many weaknesses in the agreement."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to be more prudent if it really wishes to defend European economic interests."
"(PT) Mr President, this is the pinnacle of a vision of trade that is geared solely towards competition instead of towards harmonisation and reciprocity; that is to say competition between countries, producers and workers."
"Large economic groups and transnational companies are, as always, expected to see a profit worth millions of euros with this Free Trade Agreement."
"However, as always, the other side of the coin is missing: the sacrifice of millions of small producers and small and medium-sized enterprises, environmental sacrifices, the destruction of production capacity and jobs, and the onslaught on wages and workers' rights."
"This agreement will primarily affect countries like Portugal and the regions that are most dependent on the sectors concerned: textiles, automobiles related components, and electronics."
"It is significant that the rapporteur himself has already predicted the inevitable redundancies throughout Europe, but we also know that trade unions and rural organisations in the Republic of Korea are against this agreement."
"It is therefore clear who the winners and who the losers will be when it is eventually concluded."
"(NL) Mr President, this trade agreement with South Korea is ambitious and comprehensive."
"It will help remove major trade barriers and European companies will be able to benefit from that."
"Increased access to the South Korean market will improve European companies' market position."
"Given the fact that other major players, such as the United States, Chile and the EFTA countries, aspire to or have already entered into trade agreements with South Korea, this is a very important step."
"With this agreement, the European Union has shown that it is not cutting itself off from open and sustainable trade, at a time when some other nations are showing protectionist tendencies."
"Trade offers a way out of the economic crisis."
"However, free trade must not be allowed to lead to freebooting."
"The steel and car industries are worried about this, and not entirely without reason."
"Therefore, when implementing the agreement, we must closely monitor whether all the conditions are being met and we must ensure that we are able to deploy bilateral safeguard clauses, quickly and effectively, if necessary."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will try to be extremely brief."
"First, regarding the question asked by the Earl of Dartmouth, in a case involving the infringement of intellectual property rights, including patents in third countries, it is appropriate that the operators concerned have recourse to the available enforcement means, including legal proceedings if necessary, as this is a case between two private firms."
"In the specific case of Avon Protection, it would be appropriate for your constituent first to seek redress for the alleged infringement of the patent via the existing legal framework in Korea."
"Should the available enforcement in Korea not be fair or expeditious enough, then the Commission could look into the matter."
"Regarding the remarks made by Mr Jadot, the initial draft of the Korean legislation would have forced EU car makers to reduce the CO2 emissions of their cars twice as much as Korean car makers."
"This was mainly because the proposed emission cuts were not proportional, but highly progressive, depending on the level of emissions of the respective cars."
"Consequently, despite being responsible for only a small share of car sales in Korea - 3% in 2009 - and therefore of total CO2 car emissions in Korea, EU car makers would have been asked to contribute disproportionately."
"Their average emissions reduction between 2009 and 2015 would have been 23%, compared with just 10% for their Korean counterparts, which account for 95% of total car sales in Korea."
"Such burden sharing would not have been fair, and that is why we discussed it with the Korean counterpart."
"Finally, I would like to thank everybody involved in this legislative process - the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the Commission rapporteurs, the Chair of the INTA Committee, the Council and my own staff at the Commission - for what, I would say, is a very good example of what the ratification procedure should be under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner also."
"The whole process has been excellent."
"Over the years I have worked on a number of codecision procedures and I have to say this has been one of the best."
"The debate among my shadow rapporteurs has been phenomenal."
"We have had extremely good input from virtually everybody."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Moreira, the Chair."
"Without his expertise, I do not think we would have got a satisfactory conclusion on the comitology issue - a particularly difficult sticking point towards the end of the negotiations."
"There have been a number of issues raised today."
"I would just like to say to Mr Jadot: I think your pig producers in Brittany may well benefit significantly hopefully, Yannick, because pig producers across Europe are having a bad time."
"I only pick on that because I am involved in agriculture."
"As I said, the quality of the debate has been excellent."
"There always will be two views and Mr Susta is absolutely right: there is always a split between the protectionist and the free marketeer."
"I would just say that we cannot stick our head in the sand and close the door and expect the world not to move on without us, because it will move on without us."
"We live in a global market, whether we like it or not."
"There are problems with that but it is a fact."
"I believe quite strongly that this offers huge opportunities for the European Union to move out of its problems with the financial crisis."
"We have set a standard for future agreements."
"However, they will not be as easy as this one."
"I am sure that we will move onto other far more difficult ones and we look forward to working with the Commission on that."
"I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate tonight."
"It has been excellent and it shows how comprehensive this House can be."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday tomorrow (Thursday, 17 February 2011)."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"I think that the entry into force of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement would have a positive impact on the European Union's economy."
"Firstly, it would help achieve customs duty savings estimated at EUR 1.6 billion a year."
"We would also see an increase in trade, especially in the services sector where the future growth in trade is estimated at 70%, and in the agricultural sector where, just at the moment, European Union exports to Korea have an annual value of EUR 1 billion."
"At the same time, this is an ambitious and innovative agreement."
"It is the first in a new generation of free trade agreements which contain both a chapter on sustainable development and compliance with labour standards and a monitoring mechanism in which civil society will be involved."
"The fears about the difficulties which Korean competition could cause the Union's more sensitive industries, such as the car industry, are dispelled by the inclusion of the Safeguard Clause in the agreement."
"This will be used to impose measures for monitoring imports and exports and evaluating the impact of the agreement on the various sectors."
"Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0009/2011)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Rule of law in Serbia"
"How does the Council view the development of the rule of law in Serbia, particularly in the light of the questionable court case against alleged guerrillas belonging to the Albanian minority in the Preševo valley in southern Serbia?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) The opinion of the Council on the development of the rule of law in Serbia is presented in the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010."
"In these conclusions, the Council welcomes the fact that Serbia is continuing the implementation of its reform schedule and has shown further progress in implementing the provisions set out in the interim agreement signed with the European Union."
"In its conclusions, the Council also established that Serbia continues to achieve good results in the performance of its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"However, the country needs to make further efforts, particularly in the following areas: the reform of public administration, the rule of law, including the reform of the justice system, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and the improvement of its business environment."
"The Council did not discuss the development of the rule of law in Serbia with regard to the specific procedure referred to by Mr Posselt."
"(DE) Since I submitted the question, a group of Serbian citizens of Albanian nationality have been given the maximum sentences in a show trial by a special court where they stood accused of crimes in Kosovo."
"Should this not have been dealt with by the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) instead of Serbia?"
"Could you please look into this and find out about the specific case that I have asked about?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Thank you very much, Mr Posselt."
"Please note that the so-called accession criteria laid down in 1993 by the European Council in Copenhagen are decisive considerations with regard to the position of the Council on any enlargements and stabilisation and association agreements."
"These criteria also include respect for human and minority rights, and nothing can be more important to the Council during the negotiations than this principle."
"What I can tell you is that the Hungarian Presidency, representing the Council, will naturally acknowledge your request and the issue, is aware of the gravity of these events, and, as in all accession and association agreement procedures, is paying special attention to these matters in this case as well."
"(DE) Mr President, I have another supplementary question for the Council with regard to the Mr Posselt's question."
"My colleague has already asked whether the Council can envisage, in this specific case in particular, contacting the government and those responsible on the ground once again."
"Therefore, I would again like to ask the Presidency of the Council: Can the Presidency envisage, in this specific case, entering into contact with the people responsible on the ground?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, of course, as you have mentioned the broader context and the spirit in which the Council approaches similar issues, what I can tell you is that Serbia's accession is in progress, since it has submitted its accession application, and I believe that we have now entered into a new phase, as Serbia has replied to the questionnaire presented by the European Commission."
"These replies were submitted on 31 January."
"As in the case of all important matters pertaining to the accession procedure, both the European Commission and the Council will, of course, pay particular attention to such issues."
"Subject: SMEs and the Hungarian Presidency"
"One of the stated aims of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council is to improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"Could the Council elaborate a little on this point and give practical details as to how it will improve things for SMEs which are struggling to survive?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Small and medium-sized enterprises are vital actors in the European economy."
"The improvement of the framework conditions for their operation represents one of the special priorities of the Hungarian Presidency."
"Over the next months the focus of the Presidency will be on the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the flagship initiatives for innovation and industrial policy laid down therein, as well as the full establishment of the internal market, since at present only 8% of European SMEs are engaged in cross-border activities."
"Based on the report by former Commissioner Mario Monti, this accomplishment must include the elimination of all barriers that still impede the operation of the internal market."
"We can achieve this by implementing and enforcing all directives, especially the Services Directive - this matter has also been addressed by Parliament in this part-session - precisely and in due time by providing consumer-friendly solutions within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), by facilitating compliance with taxation rules for enterprises conducting cross-border business activities, and by promoting the adoption of an SME-friendly EU patent - and Parliament took a very important decision on this subject on Tuesday, after the Monday debate."
"The prerequisite for all this is what I have been talking about so far, that we must inspire SMEs to undertake as many innovative investments as possible."
"Additionally, the Hungarian Presidency will undertake the mid-term review of the European Small Business Act."
"This Act should be a veritable Magna Carta for SMEs."
"Furthermore, the Presidency intends to promote a comprehensive approach with regard to the new, integrated industrial policy, in the framework of which we endeavour to eliminate all informational, financial and technical support barriers that prevent SMEs from becoming the true backbone of the green economy."
"In addition, we intend to reduce administrative burdens and the risk of state operation through a better and more intelligent regulatory framework, as well as institutional changes."
"We are convinced that it is vital to strengthen the innovative capacity of SMEs, and this requires a new approach to innovation, one that does not focus on the promotion of technological innovation."
"I would like to remind you that the European Council also took very important decisions with regard to innovation on 4 February."
"Concerning the key issue of how SMEs can obtain financing, it can be said that we are committed to supporting healthy SMEs in obtaining credits and loans through guarantees, innovative financial instruments and banks offering favourable terms."
"Lastly, I would like to add that the Hungarian Presidency will submit proposals to the Council with regard to the mid-term evaluation of high-budget, multi-year EU expenditure programmes in the field of research and development, which will also include important aid instruments targeted at SMEs, such as the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF)."
"(GA) Madam President, I want to congratulate the Presidency for being where it is tonight, and I welcome what the Minister has said."
"One of the biggest problems of small industry is too much bureaucracy - or red tape as we say in English."
"President Barroso promised in 2004 that he would do something significant to deal with this difficulty, but it has not happened yet."
"Having heard what has been said by the President-in-Office from Hungary, may I say that I am extremely optimistic."
"It is extremely important that we do everything to deal with this problem, because it causes great difficulty for people who are going into this kind of industry."
"(LT) Mr President, back in 2008, the Council approved the allocation of a EUR 15 billion package from the European Investment Bank, which was supposed to be the main instrument for saving small and medium-sized enterprises during the crisis."
"The report published shows that there was a low uptake of funds and these were allotted mainly to big business, while small business did not receive the required funding."
"How does the Hungarian Presidency plan to ensure that instruments already adopted to support small and medium-sized enterprises are used and implemented fairly?"
"I just wonder whether my colleagues would agree with me how disappointing it is that there has not been much support for a written declaration which is being sponsored by my colleague from the West Midlands, Malcolm Harbour, who is the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"Today he sent out an email saying that only 184 of the 736 colleagues have signed this."
"Does this show that, when it comes to small businesses throughout the European Union, cooperation is not possible and in effect it is up to the Member States to take care of their own small businesses?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - First let me answer Mr Higgins' question concerning the regulatory environment."
"This is really very important for the existence and working conditions of SMEs."
"Applying the 'Think Small First' principle when preparing laws and policies is a cornerstone of the new framework we are trying to establish."
"This is important at all levels, not only at EU level, but - and I think you share my view - also at national, regional and municipality level."
"The Commission has revised its state aid rules to encourage Member States to direct more support for SMEs to key areas such as training, R&D and environmental protection and to overcome the current focus on large businesses."
"The agreement by Member States to allow for the application of reduced VAT rates for locally supplied services, including labour-intensive services such as hairdressing, catering and repair services, will further stimulate economic activity and create jobs, and the Commission warmly welcomes this decision."
"In the area of better regulation, the Commission has tabled important legislative initiatives already."
"It has adopted a proposal for revisiting the VAT directive to remove barriers to electronic invoicing, with cost-saving potential amounting to billions of euros in the medium term."
"The Commission also came forward in February with a proposal to allow Member States to adopt less burdensome accounting requirements for micro-businesses, thus fulfilling its commitment in the action plan for small businesses."
"It has the capacity to reduce the burden by up to EUR 6 billion."
"The Commission encourages Member States to reach an agreement as soon as possible to allow Member States who wish to take advantage of this opportunity to do so, so we in the Council definitely have to move along those lines."
"The Commission will also carefully assess the likely burden of any new legislative proposals, not only for SMEs."
"We have quite a number of good proposals on the table, and in the Competitiveness Council we are following this item and trying to address as many of these issues as quickly as possible."
"Turning to the second question, on improving access to finance, even in my introductory remark I tried to make a reference to that."
"To loosen the supply of much-needed credit, the EIB lent EUR 1 billion to SMEs in 2008, an increase of 60% compared to 2007."
"The aim is to lend more money on these issues later on."
"I remember very well that, when I was still an MEP, I was responsible for an opinion on the EIB."
"In my opinion for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I made an evaluation."
"I have to tell you that the EIB reacted very quickly to the changed circumstances and reorganised its priorities."
"So we welcomed those moves by the EIB."
"I agree with you that sometimes money does not get to the intended recipients, and there should be better organisation."
"My view on that is that we really have to pay attention to the counterparts of the EIB in the Member States, because in most cases they are the partners."
"We should not always blame the EIB for the implementation, which is not directly done by the EIB."
"So I agree, on the second question, that it is extremely important that Community money and EIB loans get to the intended recipients, that is, the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I believe the Council cannot give opinions on written declarations, so if you do not mind, Mr President, I will not comment."
"Subject: Initiatives on the management of water and drinking water"
"In its publicity material setting out its priorities, the Hungarian Presidency has expressed the desire to give special attention to issues of water and drinking water management, as well as extreme events related to water resources."
"Since the programme does not specify which policies it will follow in this connection, would the Presidency inform the EP precisely which steps it intends to take in this area?"
"Does it consider that over the next few years a specific problem will arise as regards the management and security of supply of water resources and drinking water in European Member States?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) I would like to answer the question of Mr Georgios Papanikolaou concerning water resources."
"This subject is of special significance to the presidency trio, of Spain, Belgium and Hungary."
"It was an important aspect of the common programme we developed more than two years ago, and each country added to it during its six-month presidency in order to contribute to the common programme being realised with regard to an integrated approach to water policy."
"We are therefore continuing the work started by Spain and Belgium, and would like to add our own contribution by submitting conclusions concerning water policy at the Council meeting in June 2011."
"These conclusions will cover three main topics."
"The first is the integrated management of extreme water events, such as floods, water shortage, excess surface water and irregular distribution of rainfall."
"The second topic is the role of ecological services provided by water."
"This is a very exciting subject which I believe we do not talk about enough these days."
"We take it for granted that we have water and we are using the so-called ecological services provided to us by wetlands habitats, yet we should show much appreciation for these."
"The third topic will be the intensification of cooperation in the field of water management, both at international level and among EU Member States."
"The Council conclusions intend to contribute to the European Commission's communication on the concept of European waters, which is foreseen to be adopted in 2012, and which will highlight the importance of the sustainable management of the water resources of EU Member States and of maintaining the security of water resources and water supply."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there will also be conferences and events on the subject of water during the term of the Hungarian Presidency, such as the conference on the future of European freshwater resources, which will be held between 23 and 25 March in Budapest, in conjunction with the informal meeting of ministers for the environment."
"Please allow me one final comment."
"It is a priority objective for the Hungarian Presidency to ensure the creation of a Danube strategy for the EU and, in this context as well, water, the protection of our drinking water base and an integrated water policy will naturally have special significance."
"(EL) Mr President, Minister, thank you very much for your reply."
"I would add that, in 2007, the Commission noted in its communication entitled 'Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union' that it considered that the European Union could provide funds to help create additional water supply infrastructures."
"I also recall that numerous remote areas of Europe, especially small archipelagos in the South such as the Aegean Islands, face serious water supply and drinking water problems and that methods such as desalination are extremely costly."
"The question is therefore clear: do you intend and are you favourably disposed towards the idea of promoting a debate on direct Community support for water supply schemes in remote areas?"
"(RO) Given that on 3 February Hungary and Romania were appointed Priority Area Coordinators for environmental protection in the Danube region, specifically for restoring and maintaining water quality, I would like to ask you when these coordinators are going to implement this priority action, because this will enable us to guarantee the quality of drinking water."
"Thanks to the projects given as examples, we have investments not only for building wastewater treatment plants but also for developing methods and tools for protecting drinking water sources."
"It is therefore important for us to discuss the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region."
"(DE) My question also relates to the Strategy for the Danube Region."
"We, of course, want to dramatically improve the quality of the water in the Danube."
"Do all Member States plan to draw up an action plan in this regard that will gradually also take into account the sewerage works coming from the tributaries, so that we will also have cleaner tributaries and there will be an improvement in water quality in the Danube right down to the estuary?"
"Do all the Member States concerned intend to draw up action plans?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Thank you very much for the questions, and the questions, too, indicate that this is a very important subject for the European Union, and I believe that we do not spend anywhere near as much time discussing these issues as they deserve."
"By the very act of submitting conclusions and directing attention to, for example, the water problems caused by extreme weather conditions, the Hungarian Presidency intends to pave the way for the European Commission to be able to submit the best possible proposals in this 2012 'water blueprint' to the then presidency and to the Council."
"Mr Papanikolaou mentioned the problems of the islands in the Aegean Sea."
"I believe that this is very important to the people living there, and it is just as important in Southern Italy or Barcelona - we may all remember that there was such a shortage of drinking water in Barcelona that fresh water needed to be transported there by tankers -, and therefore, these all demonstrate that it is vital for us to address these issues."
"By formulating Council conclusions we provide inspiration to the Commission, and I trust that when, for example, the debate about the multiannual financial framework begins, we will need to formulate them in such a way as to enable us to direct funds in the best way possible to the common problems of the European Union."
"Mrs Ticau and Mr Rubiks both asked their questions about the Danube strategy."
"If you will allow me, I would like to answer them together."
"It was to our great satisfaction that Commissioner Hahn presented the action plans in early February in Hungary."
"There are 13 action plans, and as regards the questions you raised here concerning both the drinking water base and sewage treatment, there are so-called action plans for the issues of all kinds of floods and droughts, and each of these is led by two countries."
"I believe that this is a very good way to also strengthen regional cooperation along the Danube strategy."
"What is more, the participants include eight EU Member States and six third countries, and it is very inspiring that we have such a comprehensive strategy that allows us to take concrete steps in all these matters."
"True, there are no new funds allocated to this purpose, but I am convinced that, within this framework, existing projects can be reorganised, and through the reinforcement of cross-border cooperation we will be able to achieve a far more effective outcome than if all countries were making attempts on their own."
"It is impossible to engage in individual measures over a river that connects us all."
"We may, of course, still have excellent plans, if we do not implement these, and I therefore very much hope that we can discuss these in Council configurations now, while still in the term of the Hungarian Presidency."
"We did give the process the initial push at the General Affairs Council on 31 June and are intently monitoring how the work is coming along."
"The work is progressing quite well, also at working group level, and towards the end of the Hungarian Presidency we will be able to adopt the strategy at the General Affairs Council; the European Council will be able to assure us of its support in this regard, and then it will be up to us to implement it as fully as possible, from sewage treatment to the preservation of our drinking water base."
"Subject: Participation by disabled persons and their representative organisations in decision-making affecting disabled persons"
"The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, published by the Commission, will affect the lives of 80 million disabled people in the EU."
"The Commission has identified eight key areas: accessibility, participation, equality, work and training, social protection, health and external action."
"The EU institutions and Member States are to implement this strategy together."
"In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Member States which adopt decisions affecting disabled persons are required to closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities, through their representative organisations."
"Unfortunately, there is no provision for such consultation in the new disability strategy."
"Has the Council taken any specific measures to ensure that the principle of 'no action on disability without the disabled' enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is observed?"
"Furthermore, how does the Council view the proposal to establish a disability committee, answerable to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) and chaired by the country holding the Presidency of the European Union?"
"Does the Council agree that this would make for closer involvement by the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, I too am very happy that we could still find time for this question."
"The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an appropriate and effective means of promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities in the European Union, and is accorded great significance by both the Community and its Member States."
"The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that it has already affirmed on multiple occasions that, if we intend to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and wish to ensure their equal participation in society, it is important for us to involve them in forming the decisions and policies that apply to them."
"In its resolutions adopted in 2008 and 2010, the Council consistently urged that persons with disabilities and their organisations be involved in policy-making."
"We recall that the Council also adopted a directive which stipulates the prohibition of discrimination based on disability in employment and at work."
"The aforementioned directive also provides for membership and participation in employees' and employers' organisations, meaning that it is a specific measure adopted by the Council with a view to ensuring that persons with disabilities are actually able to participate in decision making."
"The Commission also has a new disability strategy."
"To our great satisfaction, it was published in the autumn, and focuses primarily on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"The Hungarian Presidency intends to submit draft conclusions to the Council in connection with this strategy, with a view to adopting it in the final stage of the Hungarian Presidency in June."
"As regards the creation of a separate disability committee, to this date the Council has not received any proposals to be examined in this respect."
"In this context we recall that the Council can only act in its legislative capacity upon proposals submitted by the Commission, however, we of course always keep an eye on Parliament, but this is how legislation works in the EU."
"(LT) Mr President, in January of this year at a meeting in the European Parliament initiated by the European Disability Forum, the Vice-President of the European Commission Viviane Reding stated that some European Union Member States do not support the Council Directive on equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"Therefore the anti-discrimination Directive is one of the most important issues in the field of human rights, especially in terms of guaranteeing the rights of the disabled."
"Does Hungary, the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, plan to take any specific actions as regards adopting and reviewing this directive, and what specific measures will you take to clear the way for this directive?"
"(HU) Minister, thank you very much for your answer."
"I would like to encourage the Council to pay attention to the importance of the involvement of people with disabilities."
"This issue also has a bearing on the work of Parliament, as regards the ability of the Members to become involved in this process, since it is we who represent the people, so to speak."
"I would like to congratulate the Presidency on addressing the issue of disabilities at a high level until the end of the trio."
"My question is whether subsequent presidencies also intend to address this, the matter of disabilities, at the same level."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Thank you very much for the supplementary questions."
"As regards the first question by Mrs Blinkevičiūtė, which concerns the developments related to the anti-discrimination directive, well, I could tell you things like 'now we will solve it,' because, for what it is worth, I could say that, but I will not say such things."
"We all know how painfully slow the progress of this draft legislation has been over the past three years."
"We, too, are planning to make progress, of course."
"In order to be able to do so and retain our credibility, we are trying to focus on the very part of this directive that concerns disabilities."
"We are therefore planning to discuss the disability aspects in two rounds and hope that we can convince the Member States to make progress at least in this respect."
"As such, we are not aiming in every direction, but instead wish to focus our attention on this issue."
"I have to say that this is very difficult."
"Member States often refer to financial issues and financial difficulties."
"The former government of my home country was also forced to request an extension in order to be able to implement EU and domestic policies, for example in the field of removing barriers, and in times of crisis and austerity all this is difficult for the Member States."
"However, I believe, especially considering that we committed ourselves to making this a human-centred presidency, that we indeed have to make progress in this very important issue - because as Mr Kósa is always saying, this does not only concern persons with disabilities, but many others, from young mothers to the elderly, many more than those we call people with disabilities - that is to say, it is very much the responsibility of the Council to achieve progress in this matter."
"Mr Kósa asked how we can better involve Parliament, or how can we work together."
"I believe that Mr Kósa, as the President of the Disability Intergroup, is doing an excellent job and maintains very good relations, not only with the Council and the Presidency-in-Office, but also with the Commission."
"As we can see in several issues, if Parliament is playing a guiding role - and I am convinced that Parliament is playing a guiding role in disability matters - then the Commission and the Council can do nothing but follow its guidance."
"These can therefore indeed be incorporated into Commission proposals, which are then submitted to the Council."
"Thinking of the Roma strategy, the report by Mrs Lívia Járóka, which was adopted this Monday in the LIBE committee, has a good chance of being incorporated into the Commission's proposal, and be then submitted to the Council."
"I would therefore recommend this route, and I would welcome it if this excellent cooperation could continue."
"We will send answers in written form to the questions we had no time to answer."
"That is right, but I am going to allow Mr Chountis a supplementary on this question."
"(EL) Mr President, I do not want the question I tabled to be debated."
"I appreciate the effort you are making and I do not want to upset the order."
"I just have one comment, which does not concern or affect the President specifically and I shall be brief."
"I just want to say that, because we have a problem with the question of parliamentary control, as you know full well, there have been three occasions in plenary when we did not have questions to the Council and the procedures ultimately reduce the time available."
"Please could you therefore discuss with the Bureau how this time can be ring fenced."
"Thank you very much for the effort you have made."
"I do not wish to run over time, nor do I wish my question to be debated and I thank the Minister who was ready and waiting."
"Mr Chountis, I am aware of your complaint, which I completely support."
"However, it is not the Bureau that makes the decisions about the timing of debates, the content of debates or speaking time - it is the Conference of Presidents, bizarrely, which always tries to put too much on the agenda."
"It is the Bureau Members, including myself, who have to deal with the problems this creates and clean up the mess."
"I apologise to everyone who was not called."
"As Mrs Győri quite rightly says, any questions she has not had time to answer tonight - and those which she has answered she has answered very ably - will be answered in writing."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."

"EU guarantee to the EIB against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the EU (debate)"
"The first item is the report by Mr Kalfin, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union - C7-0110/2010-."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the current mandate of the European Investment Bank for its operations outside of the European Union expires at the end of October."
"The European Parliament and the Council have to agree on the conditions for its extension beyond that date."
"Parliament has discussed the issue very thoroughly over several months."
"During that period we discussed many ideas and tried to listen to the opinions of many stakeholders."
"We held dozens of meetings, both outside and within Parliament, between the political groups working on the text."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank very much all my colleagues from the political groups, and the administration, for their dedication, their work based on the highest professional standards, and their endeavouring to achieve a broad consensus on a mandate for the European Investment Bank that will make a difference in fulfilling the EU's objectives."
"I also thank very much the European Investment Bank and the Commission for their constant support and advice, which was very valuable for our work."
"Now we have a draft decision to be voted by Parliament which provides for more coordination between the European Investment Bank and the other EU bodies, for more transparency and stakeholder participation, and for a better monitoring and reporting system: a decision that will improve the visibility of the impact of the bank's activities."
"With this decision, we shall start elaborating the common EU position with the Council."
"The draft decision preserves the very successful profile of the European Investment Bank as a top-rated financial institution and investment bank."
"At the same time, being an EU institution, the European Investment Bank is expected to contribute better to the goals of the Union through its specific means and tools."
"The changes proposed are based on accumulated experience and on the understanding that the profile of the European Investment Bank as a top-rated investment bank should not be jeopardised."
"Parliament proposes much better coordination between the External Action Service, the Commission and the Bank in implementing the EU's external policy objectives."
"The European Investment Bank will have to devise development and environment impact parameters and report on their completion."
"It will indirectly contribute to the eradication of poverty and to climate change mitigation in the developing countries, and stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of local communities."
"The monitoring and reporting systems guarantee more transparency, better access to information and increased possibilities for the stakeholders to give their opinion at an early stage of the consideration of the projects."
"An additional sum of EUR 2 billion will be released for use in environment-related projects."
"This should contribute to the efforts of the European Union partner countries to finance efforts to implement climate-related policies."
"Let us hope that this new instrument will create incentives for the potential recipient countries to commit more to the climate-related goals of the European Union."
"Parliament suggests, also, an increase in the ceilings of the EU guarantees to be used by the Bank."
"At first glance this is a very difficult decision, because it is extremely sensitive for the Member States."
"Any increase in the ceilings means effectively a 9% contribution to the Guarantee Fund, but on the other hand this is an extremely good instrument creating leverage and attracting more funding institutions to the EIB projects."
"The proposed increase in ceilings amounts to about EUR 1.7 billion, and would allow the bank to at least maintain the intensity of its activities in the pre-accession countries, and especially in the Mediterranean region."
"In recent years, at the request of the Council, this financing has been intensified."
"Therefore, the EU has to make an additional effort to support the economies of the countries of the Western Balkans and North Africa, especially in these times."
"This would not involve substantial costs, whereas the benefits of achieving the EU's objectives in these regions would be very high."
"We ask the European Investment Bank to develop a stronger capacity for assessing and reporting on development, environment, and the human rights aspects of their projects."
"It will have to ask loan promoters to consult local stakeholders before deciding on projects."
"We reconfirm the good practices of the bank in avoiding working with partners incorporated in non-cooperative jurisdictions and using tax havens."
"We propose to establish a working group that will suggest better cooperation and blending of the funds from different donors by the middle of 2012."
"A working party will analyse current practices as regards the disbursement of development assistance by the EU and the Member States, in order to increase its efficiency and the visibility of Europe as the major development assistance provider in the world. (debate)"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, and other Members of this Parliament for their constructive approach to the proposal, which highlights the significant interest Parliament shows in the European Investment Bank's activities."
"I believe that Parliament has now achieved a balanced report which will provide a solid basis for the upcoming negotiations with the Commission and the Council."
"Last April, the Commission issued a legislative proposal to amend Decision 633/2009/EC following a mid-term review of the application of the EIB external mandate."
"It is now essential to make a timely decision allowing the EIB to pursue its external work until 2013, while at the same time enhancing the mandate to ensure that EIB investments outside the EU are increasingly aligned with EU policy objectives, in particular in the areas of climate change and development."
"As regards today's vote, several amendments put forward are acceptable to the Commission."
"Those amendments relate to, firstly, the request to enhance the development aspects of EIB activity and, secondly, the call for an increase in the regional ceilings of the general mandate."
"This could, inter alia, allow the EIB to maintain a reasonable level of activity in certain regions, notably pre-accession."
"It should also be instrumental in helping the EIB to take part in our joint efforts to provide support to Tunisia and Egypt in the democratic transition process."
"Thirdly, the general request for more transparency, better reporting and better efficiency."
"On the other hand, additional negotiation will be needed in the context of the trialogue for other amendments."
"Those points relate to, firstly, the restriction from eligibility under the climate change mandate of countries deemed by the Council not to have committed to meeting appropriate climate-change-related targets."
"Secondly, there are some amendments aimed at establishing the regional operational guidelines as delegated acts, which would not allow them to be operational and flexible general orientations as we initially foresaw them in the Commission proposal."
"Thirdly and finally, there are some amendments which relate to longer-term issues such as the creation of an EU platform for cooperation and development, or the reflections on longer-term perspectives for cooperation and development financing, that are not strictly related to the implementation of the current mandate."
"We should be careful, because the negotiation on these amendments might delay the adoption of the decision, and we might consider not engaging in lengthy and complicated negotiations in the framework of this decision."
"Trialogue between the institutions will start on the basis of the report adopted today."
"The common aim is to have the decision adopted before the summer in order to pre-empt any risk of non-decision by October 2011, which would cause the suspension of EIB external activities after that date."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Kalfin for the excellent work we have been able to carry out together and, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I was the rapporteur, to thank my colleagues Mrs Hautala, Mr Lambsdorff and Mrs Giannakou."
"As he has done so himself, I am not going to review the positive points of the report and the proposal defended by Mr Kalfin on the climate change mandate, the increase in human resources, the attention paid to social and development aspects, the environment, human rights, the shift in focus of the guarantee towards countries that need it most, and a stronger link with EU policies."
"Parliament is united on all these points - let me make that clear - and it must remain so during the difficult negotiations that, as I have just heard, await us with the Council."
"I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings at this stage."
"I regret that neither the need to now prepare the EIB for microcredit nor the need to already begin the debate on the post-2013 ceilings has been taken on board, even though the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted for both of these things in the consensus reached by all the political groups."
"That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament decided, with the consent of Mr Kalfin and of the other rapporteurs, to table amendments in plenary on these two subjects."
"Lastly, there is one crucial point to which I should like, politically speaking, to draw your attention and which has been the subject of debate for years."
"When the Berlin Wall fell, we were able to react not only with the enlargement project, the practical arrangements of which some may question, but which is undeniably necessary, but before that, we established the EBRD so as to be able to support the necessary economic and democratic transition."
"The European Union, and also the EIB, as the power behind it, is the largest provider of funds to the other side of the Mediterranean."
"At the same time, however, we know that the payment of those funds will not continue beyond one programming period - in other words, beyond 2013, as I mentioned just now - and that the discussions that we are having today show that there may be difficulties in the future."
"There is a project - already adopted by the European Parliament and endorsed in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean - which is referred to in the Kalfin report being debated today, and it is the creation of a Euro-Mediterreanean codevelopment and investment bank."
"This would be a practical way, beyond rhetorical statements, of acknowledging the European Union's will to support the major democratic movement taking place on the other side of the Mediterranean, and I hope that this will be seriously addressed and that steps will be taken, in the coming months, to promote the creation of that bank."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (NL) Mr President, the rapid rate of economic growth in developing countries is passing huge swathes of people by."
"Even in African countries, economic growth sometimes hits double figures, as is evident in major cities, such as Addis Ababa."
"However, inequality is growing just as rapidly."
"It is women and farmers, especially, who are not being given enough opportunities to develop their livelihoods."
"One of the major barriers is access to financial services."
"Private banks simply have more confidence in traders making quick profits than they do in women and farmers."
"Public banks have an irreplaceable role to play here."
"With this legislative resolution, the EIB is therefore taking an essential step."
"The bank is no longer granting funds for just dams and roads, for large infrastructure projects of European companies."
"That arm of the bank's operations needs to continue but, of course, with procedures which will allow all local stakeholders to be heard, according to the clear criteria of sustainability and social justice."
"Tax havens should not be given any chance in these projects."
"What is new is that the EIB will now also work to help small business owners in developing countries by opening the door for loans."
"That can be done via local banks, via microfinance institutions, although we need an additional amendment there, and via cooperation with Member States' development banks."
"The EIB should be given further scope to develop its expertise internally, with sufficient staff."
"However, with this new dimension to its operations, the EIB is an indispensable tool for the European Union's development policy, with a clear commitment to equal opportunities in developing countries and to sustainable economic growth."
"I would like to thank the EIB, my colleague, Mr Ivailo Kalfin and all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Mr President, up to now the professionals who run the European Investment Bank have operated the Bank with a culture of financial probity."
"Loans have been made, and guarantees provided, on a prudent basis, and that is why the European Investment Bank has had very few bad loans on its books."
"However, what this report aims to do is to dilute the professional culture of the European Investment Bank and expand its remit to encompass a series of policy objectives."
"The Commissioner made this very clear."
"A relaxation of the commercial criteria on which the Bank has operated up to now will inevitably result in the guarantee being called on."
"Now this will cost the taxpayer, and I have to question, once again, whether the hard-pressed taxpayers of Europe and the UK really want their money to be used to advance purely political objectives outside the EU?"
"Mr President, the purpose of the guarantee offered to the European Investment Bank, based on this report, is to develop social and economic structures and reduce climate change in third countries, while also promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"This is why I regard as positive the suggestion to increase the general mandate offered to the bank, given as well that the countries which this guarantee is intended for include accession candidate countries and those which have signed partnership agreements with the European Union."
"However, to be able to meet its responsibilities better in third countries, the bank needs substantial resources and more specialist staff."
"In this context the EIB must consider promoting certain projects of strategic importance to the European Union, such as the Nabucco pipeline and other major road, maritime and energy infrastructure projects."
"Finally, I would like to stress the need for the bank to carry out some monitoring of the financed projects, both during their execution and at completion so as to verify compliance with social and environmental criteria."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, for the work he has done."
"Today's vote renews the EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses on loans for investment in projects outside the European Union."
"This measure is of even greater significance in the current economic context, which is characterised by profound changes not only in the markets but also in production methods and approaches to the economy."
"While on the one hand the EIB is playing a crucial role for the European Union, on the other the Union is strengthening its political and economic presence beyond the borders of the 27 Member States."
"A compromise has been reached with the other political groups to amend the Commission's original text."
"The discussions, which took a range of opinions on board, were constructive both within the Committee on Budgets and during the preparations for today's sitting."
"The topics characterising the negotiations and political debate were: support for local small and medium-sized enterprises; maximisation of synergies in the field of development cooperation, so as to avoid duplicating our efforts in southern countries and wasting resources; the nature of the EIB, which remains an investment bank that provides loans, competes on the international markets and does not provide unsecured funding; the geographical range of the EIB's investments, which have been extended to countries such as Libya and Iraq, but not to countries such as Belarus, in which respect for human rights as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights must be a minimum requirement for action to be planned."
"It looks very likely that the work done in Parliament will very quickly succeed in getting the Council's and the Commission's agreement."
"With regard to the work done, the rapporteur will table an oral amendment to increase the appropriations guaranteeing the EIB's investments in the Mediterranean region."
"Such investments may help to stabilise the Mediterranean, not least in view of the problems associated with the streams of migrants in recent weeks."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Member. - Mr President, I would ask the speaker to consider how much all this costs the taxpayer."
"(IT) Mr President, what specifically is the questioner referring to, the whole operation or one particular point?"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, who has done a sterling job."
"He worked together with both the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the shadow rapporteurs from the five different committees in Parliament that were involved."
"I really think they have achieved an excellent result."
"The financial crisis shows how very important it is to have stable public institutions responsible for granting credit in crucial investment areas when the private financial market is fluctuating."
"Therefore, we are now discussing the creation of new financial instruments in many different contexts, but also the development of the instruments that we already have, in this case the EIB's activities outside Europe."
"I would very much like to highlight three points that I hope will gain a hearing both in this Chamber and in the Council."
"The first concerns a greater degree of consistency between the EIB's activities and the guidelines for the EU's development and foreign policy."
"The second relates to an increase in the ceiling for projects to combat climate change, and my third point concerns increased loan ceilings which require increased guarantees from the Member States."
"The majority of the EIB's activities are directed towards Europe, but if we count the number of countries receiving loans, most of them are actually developing countries."
"Therefore, we are voting today, among other things, on the demand for a more stringent evaluation of projects and the demand for the EIB to carry out, in advance, a thorough assessment of whether the investment really will contribute to the achievement of our development goals."
"I really do call on everyone to support these demands."
"In order to achieve this, we also need to increase the transparency of the EIB's activities in those countries covered by the external mandate."
"As things stand, we often have long, complicated chains of financial transactions that make transparency very difficult."
"We are also pressing for even greater attention to be paid to the EIB's own rules against activities in tax havens."
"A sound financial system is a prerequisite for a functional economy in vulnerable parts of the world."
"I am therefore pleased that we can now also give our support to the oral amendment, which I hope will gain the support of everyone and which will give us more resources to be able to provide to countries like Egypt and Tunisia."
"This report represents an important step in a direction that I hope even the Council will support in the forthcoming negotiations."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and professional work on this report."
"There was good cooperation between the groups, and I think the result is a very good one."
"My fellow Members on the other side of the Chamber have expressed fears that we are about to jeopardise the good work that the European Investment Bank (EIB) has done up to now."
"I think these fears are completely unfounded."
"The fact is that we are now evaluating the mid-term mandate that we have and we will take the bank in a better direction."
"While it is good to remember the new and sound ideas, of which there are quite a few and which it is good to make use of at this stage, it is also good to remember, on the other hand, that sooner or later we will have to start negotiations on the EIB's mandate for the next financial framework, in other words the one that will start in 2014."
"At that stage we will have to decide in what direction we want to take the bank, what new tasks we can envisage assigning to it and in what way the new tasks are to be fulfilled by means of the possible provision of new financial resources for the bank."
"That is important to remember."
"In this context, I would like to mention two details."
"The first is something that Mr Färm mentioned, namely the fact that it looks as though we will be able to agree to increase the resources that the EIB can use in North Africa, which I think is very positive in view of the political situation that exists there."
"That is precisely why the EIB should have an external mandate, namely to enable us to act in line with the Union's objectives."
"I would also like to emphasise something that I am sure Mr Graf Lambsdorff will also mention, namely that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe was eager for us to be able to use the EIB's external mandate to lend money to Belarus."
"This is part of the policy we want to pursue and the principles we uphold in the European Union and which must in principle be respected by our important instrument, the EIB."
"In summary, I think that we worked well with the political groups and that the rapporteur has done a splendid job in finding solutions that mean we will most likely receive very broad support for the report when we vote on it in just over an hour's time."
"I think that is a good basis for our negotiations with the Council."
"I hope that the European Council is willing to view the European Parliament's good ideas for amendments in a positive light."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to add my thanks to Mr Kalfin for his ambitious report and I would like to remind you once more that it was the European Court of Justice that demanded that the external mandate be approved under the codecision procedure."
"In other words, this is about greater rights for Parliament - and as self-confident Members of the European Parliament, of course we welcome that."
"The European Union has set itself a whole range of praiseworthy aims in the Treaty of Lisbon: to conserve natural resources, to fight poverty and to work for democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"It is therefore only right that the EIB acts as an instrument that works towards these aims, that it does not work against them but that instead everything is put in place to ensure that these aims are achieved with the assistance of the EIB."
"In particular, we are talking about environmental infrastructure, better water supply and sanitation, and more funds for health and training, because we know for sure that these things contribute to securing the future in third countries and make a very important contribution to combating poverty."
"From a green point of view, the optional mandate in the area of climate change is also very positive."
"An additional two billion is to be mobilised and, if we take our own objectives in the area of climate policy seriously, then naturally we must work with the EIB in this area."
"I find it equally pleasing that Mr Kalfin has now proposed that the EIB should also assist with economic development and democratic change in the Mediterranean area - particularly now in Tunisia and Egypt."
"We therefore consider these amendments, which we will shortly be voting on, to be right."
"We have a great interest in seeing greater transparency at the European Investment Bank."
"The Commission must now submit a report every year."
"That alone, however, is not enough; what we want is real transparency."
"We would also like to see NGOs and other qualified bodies being involved in decisions before they are taken."
"We believe that this transparency will contribute to acceptance of the EIB and does not undermine it."
"With all the good ideas that have been put forward here in this House we also hope that the Council will not lag behind, but that it will support this ambitious political stance of the EIB and of Parliament."
"We therefore hope that the procedure will be completed quickly, so that we can make policies together for the benefit of citizens of third countries too."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, when guaranteeing loans of this kind for projects inside or, indeed, outside the EU, we need to remember that they are not without financial consequences."
"While it may seem like a good way of making EU money go further, we must be very careful to ensure that the appropriate risk-management controls are in place to manage these kinds of loans and the balance-sheet implications they pose."
"As parliamentarians we need to be fully aware of the liabilities to which we are exposing the EU budget and, therefore, Member States' budgets."
"Oversight systems and transparency will be crucial when using the balance sheet for leverage, as has been shown by the financial crisis, where banks were not always fully aware of the extent of their liabilities."
"We must learn the lessons from the finance industry and be sure that we know precisely what the EU is guaranteeing and what appropriate levels of democratic oversight are being maintained."
"Fundamentally, we must be sure that those individuals at the EIB and the Commission who are tasked with managing these financial products and making such wide-ranging decisions have the appropriate expertise to manage what they are dealing with."
"This is taxpayers' money."
"We need to spend it carefully."
"Mr President, I believe that what we are discussing here today is both the extension and clarification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB) linked to a system of guarantees that are required for its financing operations."
"I believe that the extension or clarification of the mandate that is being proposed is along the right lines."
"It will enable the EIB better to meet its own goals regarding cooperation and development aid."
"As long as the EIB and the European Union wish to remain in thrall to credit rating agencies there will be a problem with guarantees; that much is clear."
"There are those who say that perhaps this increases the risk and that we should therefore be careful when we invest in health, in education, in combating poverty, and in the Millennium Development Goals, because none of those are particularly lucrative; something else needs to be said instead."
"What needs to be said is, let us discuss our relationship with credit rating agencies."
"Let us also discuss something else, right now: how is it possible to be so careful regarding the guarantees that the taxpayer would have to give for combating poverty, and so forgetful of the way in which the European Union did not try to regulate the private banks or prevent the financial crimes in which they have been involved for all these years, and which are now being paid for with millions of unemployed?"
"That is actually how this question should be put."
"In any case, there is a problem, about which I have reservations."
"My reservations are very straightforward: firstly, we have a European Union that has been employing double standards in international politics."
"In fact, there is no reason, from a human rights point of view, why the EIB should be financing projects in Libya but not in Belarus."
"When it comes down to it, what are the criteria?"
"We must be very clear about this because I also have reservations about a second issue: the European External Action Service has a very broad mandate, which includes military operations."
"My question is, do these aspects overlap, and how is it that the EIB cannot be easily diverted from its own goals and from the mandate for which it was created?"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the European Investment Bank uses public funds from the nations of Europe to guarantee loans, either to financial intermediaries or to the ultimate recipients in 74 countries."
"When compared to other international institutions performing similar functions, the EIB's reputation is not one of transparency, and the public disclosure policy still does not cover appraisal reports."
"In particular, in the case of EIB lending which is meant to go to SMEs via intermediary banks, the public still does not know where the money is going."
"This report fails to demand disclosure by those intermediary banks."
"Bearing in mind that the EIB is making loans that are guaranteed by the EU, whose budget is financed by the European taxpayers, I encourage you all to vote against this report, which fails to adequately protect taxpayers' interests."
"(NL) Mr President, the EIB supports the foreign policy of the European Union, in particular the development policy."
"So reads the report of Mr Kalfin, my fellow member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"However, the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) does not want the EU to have any foreign policy whatsoever and definitely no bank performing the role of politician."
"The EIB is active outside the EU, no idea why, but the EIB budget is guaranteed by the EU budget and funded by the taxpayer."
"There are some really wonderful countries that are receiving these EIB funds, such as the Palestinian territories, Gaza, Libya, Cuba, Venezuela, Turkmenistan and the Maldives."
"Not one of these countries is exactly a shining example of democracy."
"Now, however, the Commission wants to increase the EIB' s financial ceiling."
"Of course, that also means that we will be investing in climate change in these countries."
"Can you imagine?"
"In Gaza, in Cuba?"
"This is material for a new Mr. Bean film, but it is actually happening!"
"The PVV will fight this proposal tooth and nail and will, therefore, also be wholeheartedly voting against it."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))."
"(NL) Mr President, while the Earl of Dartmore does not understand the difference between loans and subsidies, while Mrs Andreasen should give the EIB's annual report another read, what Mr Hartong has not understood is that Europe is not an island in the world and that, if we want peace and stability, on our continent too, we have to invest in other countries."
"This is not only funded through subsidies, but primarily, and this is a better solution, through loans."
"I am sure you will back me up on that, Mr Hartong, will you not?"
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Berman is undoubtedly aware that politics is about political choices."
"We therefore choose to invest our taxpayers' money in a much cleverer way, in the foreign policy of the Member States, rather than in the foreign policy of the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done regarding the external mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"The Union's financial arm today plays a very important role in terms of the political commitment that Europe wants to put across concerning the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"Creating lasting democratic institutions requires a great effort from the people, and Europe, which has been working with the EIB in these regions for many years, can give them valuable support during this transition period in setting up infrastructure and strengthening local businesses."
"The report on which we are voting today proposes raising the ceilings with which the bank operates outside the Union by almost EUR 2 billion."
"This decision will enable the bank to see through some important projects that are threatened by a lack of funds but which are also strategic for the stabilisation of the Mediterranean region, as well as for the countries preparing to join the Union."
"A high level of coordination between the European Commission, the new External Action Service and the EIB is needed, however, in order to achieve these aims."
"I believe it is very important to develop joint governance for these three players in the countries of the Union in which it operates, and I am therefore looking forward to the creation by the Commission and the EIB of a platform to examine - together with Parliament and the Council - how best to address the challenges of the Union's external policy with financial instruments and innovative methods."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the shadow rapporteur of the European Investment Bank's discharge, I and my fellow Member, Mr Audy, treat the European Union guarantees provided for the European Investment Bank (EIB) as a very important issue."
"The European Investment Bank is a key actor in financing projects of major significance both inside and outside the European Union, and its role will continue to grow."
"At the same time, based on the effective provisions not one European institution has the right to supervise the EIB, and we would like to change this in the future to avoid this being an obstacle to later growth."
"Loans granted to countries outside the EU require greater attention and care than projects to be realised within the EU, not only because of what has just been said but also because the degree of control that can be exercised over external developments is far less than is the case for investments within the EU."
"The solution for this is that these projects require much better preparation."
"At the same time, external projects are mainly directed at strategically important but politically not always stable regions."
"As a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I wish to shed light on the energy issue from among the projects being realised in these regions."
"More than 50% of the external investments financed by the EIB are directed at the states of the Eastern Partnership and Russia."
"The security and progress of these countries serve the interests of the EU directly, as this is where the decisive part of the natural gas imports and a significant amount of the electricity imports of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic come from."
"Thus it is indispensable for the EIB to focus on supporting projects which directly or indirectly result in an increase of security and the security of supply."
"Thus I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, - whom I wish to congratulate - that in the area of loans outside the EU closer cooperation must be encouraged between the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as the World Bank."
"Significant synergies can be achieved."
"(DE) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon makes new demands of European Union foreign policy and development policy."
"One has been mentioned here: coherence."
"In other words, our various instruments, the European External Action Service, the European Investment Bank and the Commission must act in a consistent manner."
"The Treaty of Lisbon also provides for greater parliamentary control, greater transparency and joint decisions on these matters."
"All of this will enhance the quality of the debate on foreign policy, particularly if we have greater transparency as a result of the participation of the relevant committees - primarily the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development - in this House."
"One result of this transparency is that this Parliament has resolved to remove Belarus from the list of countries in which the European Investment Act can act without first having another debate here in this House."
"Are human rights being respected?"
"Have opposition politicians been released?"
"Does the state respect the property of its citizens?"
"Is there freedom of the press?"
"Are entrepreneurs able to act freely?"
"Are there free trade unions?"
"In our relationship with such an important neighbour - one which is located directly on the border of the European Union - these are all matters which need to be debated first, before the European Investment Bank becomes active there."
"I am very pleased that the House has taken up this suggestion and I call on the Council to do the same."
"Yesterday we had a debate on Egypt."
"We debated the instruments and what we could do."
"Baroness Ashton called for the ceiling applied to the European Investment Bank to be raised."
"Parliament is happy to pursue this."
"We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa."
"That is only right."
"It is also a good example of how this Parliament can react quickly."
"The same is now required of the Council, which must act accordingly."
"I believe that our foreign policy instruments, especially if they are market-oriented, together with the loans from the European Investment Bank can do a lot to assist with development and economic growth in North Africa."
"That is precisely what is needed."
"If there is growth there, if there is democracy there, then we will also have fewer migrants arriving at our borders."
"If I may specifically address our fellow Members from the extreme right, I would like to say that your arguments are really far too rudimentary and simplistic - if not primitive."
"(FI) Mr President, the European Investment Bank has excellent aims, including poverty reduction and the notion that the bank's operations must be in harmony with the EU's external relations objectives."
"For this to be genuinely verifiable, it is very important that the bank's activities are transparent."
"With this in mind, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled Amendments 6 and 7, which emphasise that all assessment documents must be made public and, in addition, that all documents pertaining to different projects must be available to the public."
"I would like to point out that, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Investment Bank, like all other EU agencies, has been bound by the Regulation on public access to documents."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Investment Bank is de facto a European Union institution, because it is, after all, funded with money provided by the taxpayers of the European Union's Member States."
"It is imperative, therefore, that it be a bank which is completely transparent and which shows how it operates, and that it does so in absolutely every detail and particular."
"I would like to stress very strongly that as a representative of a country which borders with Belarus, I am personally in favour of the European Investment Bank blocking every possibility of extending loans or credit which supports the Lukashenko regime."
"We must show that human rights to the east of the European Union are as important to us as human rights in Africa or Asia."
"However, I do agree with the fellow Member who said that we should not apply double standards towards Libya and Belarus."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this report is to agree on Union guarantees for the external investments of the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"Many of the EIB's investments are in countries that in the last few weeks have been at the heart of historic changes, with the toppling of authoritarian regimes by popular uprisings."
"The report seeks to extend Union guarantees also to other countries about which we have misgivings because of their lack of internal democracy."
"I believe it would be contradictory to move in that direction and wonder whether it might not instead be more useful if the EIB were to increase its investments within Europe, by financing small and medium-sized enterprises to a greater extent, for example, a hope that Commissioner Tajani himself expressed in this Chamber on Monday."
"Lastly, I am very disappointed to note the inclusion of Turkey among the pre-accession countries."
"I confirm that we in the Lega Nord will never - and I mean never - agree to any concessions in that respect on this or on any other front."
"(BG) Mr President, you can see straight away that a lot of effort has gone into preparing this report, so that the European taxpayer's money can be dished out to so many different countries, including, of all places, Turkey."
"If Mr Kalfin, when he was minister, and his fellow-ministers had been so diligent in defending the rights of Bulgarian citizens, I think that their party may still have been governing Bulgaria."
"As to the essence of the report, I would like to give my wholehearted agreement with what Lord Dartmouth said."
"It turns out that an English lord has more social responsibility than the socialist Kalfin."
"We have been elected by the citizens of Europe and we must use the money raised from them through taxes, to first solve their problems and when we have solved their problems, then give money to Turkey and other countries outside the EU."
"(EL) Mr President, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, on his excellent report."
"There is no doubt that the current economic crisis has seriously highlighted the important work of the European Investment Bank in the European Union."
"The role of the European Investment Bank is also important, albeit less well known, outside the EU, in supporting the EU's external action through its external mission that we are debating today."
"The proposals contained in the report: firstly, to increase transparency; secondly, to introduce the flexibility clause for possibly reallocating regional resources; thirdly, to align EIB activities with EU external policy; fourthly, to extend the list of eligible countries and, fifthly, to increase the financing ceiling, are positive proposals which are both very useful and necessary."
"I agree with and support these proposals, because they also improve the efficacy of the work of the European Investment Bank and, at the same time, improve the positive image and the interventionism of the European Union itself in the world."
"(NL) Mr President, if things are as they seem, the role of the European Investment Bank will become more and more important."
"The most important thing, as far as I am concerned, is that this bank's triple A rating should never be put at risk by any tasks which it might have to undertake."
"If we look at the debates about financial perspectives, it appears that the amount of money Member States will make available will not be much higher than is currently the case."
"I think that we, therefore, need to consider in particular how we can use the European Investment Bank in order to achieve some of Europe's objectives."
"We have actually done that in the past, and what I always find particularly important is: what has been the multiplier effect of the guarantees we have issued to the European Investment Bank?"
"I think that it would therefore be useful if the bank produced a report indicating which have been the most successful guarantees and what it is that the multiplier factors apply to the most."
"This will enable us, when preparing financial perspectives, to make better choices as to which funds we should use as guarantees for the European Investment Bank."
"(PL) Mr President, optimism is engendered by the fact that in recent years Union policy on and support for external relations have been extended and strengthened by new financial instruments, such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"There is no doubt that in its activities the European Investment Bank should place particular emphasis on the integration of transport and energy networks, such as the Nabucco gas pipeline project, for example, and other gas pipeline projects, which are of particular interest to the European Union."
"In our work as part of the Eastern Partnership, we must not forget that the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights must be upheld in all countries of the partnership, including Belarus."
"However, until the authorities there understand that respect for human rights is something which has to be one of their most important responsibilities, finance from the European Investment Bank simply cannot be given to Belarus."
"Mr President, I have no difficulty with the European Union investing in projects outside the European Union, particularly in aspects like combating climate change."
"However, as an Irish MEP, I find it ironic that we are discussing here this morning how the EU can guarantee against losses on the loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union, while the same EU is trying to make a profit on loans to Ireland under the bailout system - a profit of almost 3%, which equates to EUR 5 billion."
"This is not sustainable, it is not fair and I do not think it is legal."
"It is also unbelievably difficult to understand how we are being charged 5.8%, when loans to other countries within the European Union were set at 3.2%."
"I just want to say that under the new government we will be demanding a renegotiation..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Mr President, the extension of the mandate of the European Investment Bank for a further period confirms that the current partnership between the European Union and the European Investment Bank (EIB) brings positive results in fulfilling the political objectives of the EU through the instruments of the EIB."
"One part of the new mandate is the increase in the EIB's budget guarantee, which covers risks of a public or political nature associated with EIB operations outside the European Union."
"For activities such as these, it is extremely important to ensure fiscal moderation and internal discipline, in order to ensure that money put into activities in support of the political objectives of the European Union brings the appropriate results in relation to the fiscal volumes."
"It is therefore necessary to have a good and transparent mechanism for continuous monitoring of the activities supported."
"Transparency in handling financial ..."
"(PL) Mr President, in my opinion, European Investment Bank activity outside the European Union should take place in accordance with the values which are held in the Union itself and with the principles established as part of the European neighbourhood policy."
"In the current situation, in my opinion, the European Union cannot allow Belarus to be included in the group of potential beneficiaries of European Investment Bank loans."
"If the regime in Minsk wants to use European Investment Bank funds, it must respect the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"The European Union should present a consistent position on this matter by introducing both political and financial sanctions."
"(FR) Mr President, the European Investment Bank is an intergovernmental instrument."
"The Member States provide a guarantee within the Union, and the European Union provides a guarantee outside the Union."
"It is absolutely vital for the Bank to retain its triple A rating; that guarantee is extremely useful."
"Moreover, one day, the Union will have to become a shareholder or partner of the Bank so that the intergovernmental and the Community aspects can be aligned."
"My proposal is to focus the discussion on the repayment of that guarantee - the 29 billion. The repayment would amount to some EUR 100 million, and at the same time we could provide a subsidy to the EIB depending on the projects it presents to us."
"With regard to guarantees, I would draw attention to the fact that, with the Stability Fund - EUR 60 billion - and the 30 billion, we have practically a year's budget pledged by the European Union as a guarantee."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kalfin, on a superb report, which in my opinion fully represents the position of the European Parliament."
"Extending the mandate for a guarantee for the European Investment Bank is very important, and I hope the conciliation procedure will achieve complete success."
"I also welcome the proposal to increase the amounts covered by the guarantee in relation to the Union for the Mediterranean."
"As regards the recent events which have taken place in the region - in Tunisia and Egypt or, for example, more recently in Libya - I am of the opinion that we should support the democracy which is coming into being there."
"On the other hand, I also think it would be a good decision not to extend loans to Belarus - previous speakers have referred to this - where, as the recent presidential election and related events have shown, democracy and human rights are not respected."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a new wave of implementation of EU funds via the EIB."
"I am therefore taking the floor because I want to sound a note of warning."
"At present, the EIB has liabilities of EUR 20 billion in the EU budget."
"If these were to become due, we would have a problem."
"I would therefore suggest that we need to verify the future implementation of EU funds via the EIB very carefully and precisely."
"The EIB does not have even 500 employees in third countries; the European Commission has 3 700."
"It remains the case that the Commission would actually be much better placed to control the EU's funds itself, rather than via the EIB."
"In my view there are numerous aspects of the true motivation for mandating the EIB that remain unclear."
"I would entreat this House to stop believing that we can allow the profits of others to be privatised and the losses to be socialised."
"We are going to have to justify this to the taxpayers and voters in our home countries."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to make some brief comments."
"First, I would like to underline the importance of following the timetable."
"The trialogue between the institutions will start on the basis of the report that will probably be adopted today."
"The common aim is to have the decision adopted before the summer in order to pre-empt any risks of non-decision by October 2011, which would lead to the suspension of EIB external activities after that date."
"So I would underline that this is an extremely important issue."
"I can also say that the EIB has been active in many countries which have become very important."
"The Egyptian portfolio is one of the largest in the EIB."
"From the start of its activities, the Bank has provided financing of more than EUR 4.3 billion, mostly to the private sector."
"I would also like to clarify that the Bank and the budget are two different things."
"The Bank is operating with shareholders' money, in this case capital paid in by the Member States."
"The Bank must be responsible for ensuring that all money lent is paid back."
"It is part of banks' culture that they are evaluated by ratings."
"It has already been mentioned twice here that the EIB has the highest rating."
"These ratings must not deteriorate."
"That is very important."
"The professionalism of the Bank must ensure that this rating, which is also a symbol of European finances, is maintained."
"Regarding how the EIB is controlled, there is a board."
"The Commission and all Member States are members of the board."
"The EIB can be investigated by OLAF and, of course, the Court of Auditors gives its opinion about the EIB."
"So there are democratic mechanisms and the Bank must operate within this framework."
"The EU guarantee only covers sovereign and political risks and it has never created a loss for the EU budget since its creation in 1960."
"The EIB is a solid institution."
"Of course there is a large variety of choice in decision-making - whom to lend to and how to lend - and so these political guidelines discussed here today, and your opinions, are highly valued."
"They will definitely be taken into account."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I have just three points."
"First, the European Investment Bank is a European institution."
"It is part of the Lisbon Treaty."
"As such, it should be one of those helping to achieve the goals of the European Union, be these inside or outside the Union."
"I would draw the attention of the people who said that the Bank should not have involvements outside the Union to the fact that the European Union has an external policy and the European Investment Bank might be helpful in achieving its goals."
"Second, the European Investment Bank is a financial institution which is top-rated."
"It is a very stable financial institution and all the amendments that we tabled were targeted at keeping its stability on the market."
"At the same time, this is not in contradiction with the possibility of reporting and assessing the development and the climate impact of European Investment Bank projects."
"Again this is not increasing the risk; this is increasing the transparency of the Bank."
"I appreciate very much what the Commissioner said."
"He is right: I expect we touched on some sensitive issues that have been discussed in the Council where no decision has been taken so far, including the blending between EU loans and the grants from the Bank, and how to make European development aid more efficient."
"The European Union is the largest donor - not only as a Union but as regards the Member States - with very low visibility."
"We have two alternatives: either not to touch this issue because it is sensitive or to try to work with the Council to work out a better option and to increase the efficiency of all the funds spent by the European Union."
"Thank you very much for your support."
"I would expect a very broad consensus and a very strong vote in Parliament, on the basis of which we can enter into negotiations with the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"This report focuses on several aspects of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"Some of its activities are directed towards meeting EU development policy goals in countries that have difficulty obtaining finance on the capital markets on reasonable terms."
"The EU is using the EIB, under this policy, to try and bridge the gap between the North and the South, as less developed countries inevitably have poorer access to financing to develop their economies."
"I firmly believe it is right for EU instruments assisting third countries to be maintained and adequately expanded, as an expression of EU solidarity with third countries, and to fulfil the EU's share of responsibility for the functioning of the global economy."
"I consider the extension of the EIB mandate to include regional operational guidelines, which will be developed by the Commission in cooperation with the EIB, following consultation with the European External Action Service, to be a step in the right direction for meeting the external policy objectives of the EU."
"I also think it would be beneficial to activate the EIB mandate for providing credit to Iceland, Belarus, Libya, Iraq and Cambodia."
"Whilst loans have been extended to Iceland to support its economy, loans to the other countries have been granted on condition that the finance is used exclusively to support the development of democracy and human rights."
"in writing. - (HU) The budget guarantee provided by the European Union to the European Investment Bank (EIB) ensures the bank's stability and covers political or country-specific risks arising during the bank's activity, primarily for countries and projects which could only access funds from the capital market with difficulty, if at all."
"The Decision is about the renewal of the guarantee's mandate."
"It sets the ceiling for financing, lists eligible countries and defines the extent of the support available to them."
"The system of regional objectives is replaced by high-level, comprehensive objectives covering all regions in accordance with the principles laid down in the Decision."
"The European Commission, in cooperation with the EIB and in consultation with the European External Action Service, is developing operational guidelines reflecting the EU's regional strategy for each region affected by the mandate."
"Among developments, greater emphasis will be laid in the future on sectors such as health, education, environmental infrastructure, water, sanitation, the development of sustainable transportation, mitigating the effects of climate change, and adapting to them."
"The special task of the Committee on Budgetary Control was to reinforce the budgetary control functions in the Decision."
"In order to enhance transparency, the future disclosure to Parliament of all reports and information related to the EIB's activity as well as the measurement of the concrete results of projects financed by the EU guarantee, and safeguarding the right of the European Court of Auditors to audit the use of funds from the EU budget are particularly important."
"Commission expert groups and balanced representation and transparency (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question by Mr de Jong, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Mr Cashman, on behalf of the S&D Group, Mr Canfin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, and Mrs Macovei, to the Commission on the revision of the framework for Commission expert groups and balanced representation and transparency (B7-0010/2011);"
"the oral question by Mrs Lepage, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Ries, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to the Commission on the revision of the framework for Commission expert groups and balanced representation and transparency (B7-0014/2011)"
"Mr President, at the end of last year, the Commission revised the rules for its expert groups."
"In the run-up to that revision, I was able to engage in good informal discussions with the Commission's representatives."
"Nonetheless, it is strange that the European Parliament has never been formally involved in this."
"After all, transparency is a common concern of both the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Can the Commissioner assure me that, in the future, we will have a formal dialogue on such questions before final decisions are made?"
"In the last week, I again contacted all kinds of civil society organisations."
"Unfortunately, they have not received any reassurances whatsoever that the composition of expert groups will be more balanced in the future."
"In fact, they have received information about the creation of new expert groups."
"I know from my own experience, from the days when I myself was working for the Secretariat-General of the Commission, that Directorates-General are small kingdoms."
"However, if there is political will, then it must be possible for the Commission to decide to post on a single website all information about the new expert groups and about the accompanying notification procedures."
"Will the Commissioner ensure this is the case or will he bow to the Commission's official bureaucracy?"
"All civil society organisations are facing a huge lack of resources."
"That applies to the unions, consumer organisations and to representatives of SMEs."
"They are having to make do with a small office in Brussels, in contrast to large companies which have the resources to hire professional lobbyists."
"This means that, in the interests of workers, consumers and SMEs, people from outside Brussels, in particular, should be enabled to take a seat on expert groups."
"However, this comes with a price tag."
"The Commission's website should indicate very clearly that travel and accommodation expenses will be reimbursed and, also, that a reimbursement scheme exists for other costs directly associated with work in expert groups."
"NGOs are often not aware of this nor do the Commission's officials bring this to their attention voluntarily."
"For a self-employed person, for example, it is impossible without reimbursement to just drop their work in order to participate in an expert group in Brussels."
"Such reimbursement should therefore be mandatory."
"Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) has a policy that experts who are recruited in a personal capacity should not be allowed to have any links to organisations which have a direct interest in the remit of a particular expert group."
"I call on the Commissioner to make DG SANCO's policy mandatory for all DGs."
"Finally, I would like to hear from the Commissioner how it is possible that the Commission's website lists Greenpeace as a participant in Implementing Geological Disposal of Waste - Technology Platform, while I am in possession of correspondence between Greenpeace and the Commission which suggests that Greenpeace's application for participation was explicitly rejected by the Commission."
"author. - Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the world of politics, where no one is interested in what the Commission gets right, but is only interested in what it gets wrong."
"This is a very good initiative, but Parliament, as Mr de Jong says, has some concerns."
"We have to ensure that expert groups are open to wider groups that can at least apply to get onto these expert working groups, and obtain information on how to do so."
"We need to instil confidence in the expert working groups."
"To do that, we must have absolute transparency and, as has been said, they must not be dominated by big business, because this leads to the accusation of there being vested interests, and that undermines the work of the Commission and the work of the expert groups."
"I say this as the rapporteur on the original regulation on public access to documents, which we implemented in this House in 2001."
"As you well know, Commissioner, the whole principle of openness and taking decisions as closely to the citizens as possible emanates from the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We put this into practice with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which is currently under revision."
"I would have thought that this would have presented a good opportunity for the framework programme on expert groups to be introduced into the regulation - the recast proposal of 2008, which interestingly Parliament does not accept."
"You will notice that Mrs Macovei is in the Chamber."
"She has a great history of challenging for greater openness and transparency."
"Most political groups attach high importance to this."
"I would like to know why Parliament was not consulted."
"Is the Commission going to open a website giving greater information as to how citizens' representatives and civil societies can become engaged?"
"If not, why not?"
"As I said at the very beginning, Commissioner, welcome to the world of politics, where everyone is obsessed with what has not been done rather than with what has been achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission, and the European Union in particular, to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned."
"As you know, Brussels is the international lobbying capital, before Washington."
"There are more lobbyists in Brussels than in Washington, and one of the ways in which they exert their influence on the Commission is through these famous expert groups."
"I am a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"You have, for example, a group of banking experts."
"Ninety-five per cent of the members of that expert group are bankers, and not just any bankers: only bankers from finance and investment banks, money market banks, and all the major US banks - J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs - are represented in it."
"On the other hand, there are no NGOs or trade unions in that expert group."
"The idea that the Commission should be advised only by investment bankers, and US investment bankers at that, with regard to changing banking rules seems totally surreal to me after the financial crisis we have gone through."
"Hence there are some very precise questions and some very precise points in this oral question being put to you: are you going to change the composition of these expert groups?"
"Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided?"
"In the European Parliament, in fact, this is a completely transpartisan issue."
"There are left-wing MEPs, right-wing MEPs, Green MEPs and liberals who are very interested in these issues."
"Why were we not involved earlier in the reforms that you have introduced?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I fully support what my fellow Members, and in particular Mr de Jong and Mr Canfin, have said."
"I can only regret that Parliament was not consulted before a final decision on the review was taken."
"The issue of transparency and expertise is one that we debate on a very regular basis, in particular within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, where my experience in my field is somewhat comparable to that which Mr Canfin has just demonstrated."
"I should like, Commissioner, to emphasise two points."
"The first concerns the balance of the groups."
"This is an extremely important issue."
"The composition is very imbalanced: there are many very large companies, very few SMEs, and above all the industrial sector but not civil society."
"The fact is, the weight of the groups clearly has an impact on the decisions that the Commission has to take, since it relies on the experts' reports."
"If those expert reports were of no interest, they obviously would not be consulted."
"Consequently, restoring the balance so that it is representative of European society is absolutely vital, and I do not see any proposals in these new rules that favour either SMEs or civil society."
"The second question concerns the selection of external experts."
"It is absolutely vital that we know, or at the very least that you know, exactly who is who and where those people who are talking to you come from."
"If experts present themselves as independent when in reality they are representing a lobby, the expertise they provide clearly cannot be regarded as a conclusive piece of information."
"Extremely strict supervision and monitoring of declarations of interest is therefore absolutely vital to ensure that, if an expert is consulted as an industrial expert, things are at least clear."
"If he is consulted as a teacher when he is actually the representative of an industry, then things are no longer clear and they are not acceptable."
"I think that the issue of conflicts of interest is crucial."
"We have another example of this in the shape of a major problem at the Medicines Agency, which I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss again."
"Therefore, I beg you, Commissioner, please restore our faith in the experts, as their opinions inform the decisions that are taken."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, of course, I do not know how much you know of the history of this issue, but I am particularly pleased to replace my colleague, Maroš Šefčovič, in replying to this question, because for the last five years it has been my domain."
"I was responsible for this area and am very pleased to tell you what has really been changed."
"It was an expert groups issue and, of course, unfortunately I have only three minutes to reply to your question. I will try to do my best."
"As we mentioned, the new framework for Commission expert group was adopted in November 2010."
"It provides that, when defining the composition of these groups, the Commission departments concerned shall aim to ensure the balanced representation of relevant areas of expertise and areas of interest, while taking into account the work to be carried out and the specific expertise required."
"The new framework for Commission expert groups provides for clearer and stronger horizontal rules on how to manage conflicts of interest."
"According to these rules, the relevant Commission services shall inform experts who are appointed in a personal capacity that, by accepting to be members of the group, they commit themselves to acting independently and in the public interest."
"These rules, which apply to all expert groups, constitute the Commission's sole policy on this matter and are requirements that all services must fulfil."
"In October 2005, in an example of good cooperation with Parliament and Jens Bonde, MEP, the Commission launched an online public register of expert groups which provided valuable information on different aspects, such as the group's mission, tasks and composition."
"Since 2007, the Commission has been gradually publishing the names of expert group members, whether formally or informally established."
"This goes beyond the commitment made by the Commission in the 2005 framework for expert groups, which applied only to members of formal groups."
"In 2009, the composition of expert groups was fully disclosed in the register."
"Thus, in principle, the names of all members of expert groups are available."
"This was a very strong requirement that Parliament imposed in 2005 and it has been complied with."
"Following the adoption of the new framework for Commission expert groups, the Commission drew up a new version of the register in December 2010."
"This new version enhances transparency by providing new and more accurate information, notably on the type of entities listed and the procedures used to select members."
"Furthermore, the new register increases transparency on the activities carried out by each group by allowing Commission departments to either publish relevant information in the register, or to provide a link from the register to a dedicated website where information can be found."
"Finally, the presentation and readability of data encoded in the register has also been improved."
"Given the huge amount of information to be treated, the transition from the old to the new version of the register is still ongoing."
"Thus, some of the data still needs to be validated."
"The transition needs to be completed over the next few months."
"Moreover, because for five and a half years I discussed these issues with various civil society organisations and Members of Parliament, I would ask you not to mystify the experts."
"There is no arithmetical link between the composition of expert groups and a decision."
"The decision is the Commission's political responsibility."
"Parliament's committees have the same political responsibility when they meet in the presence of the same lobbyists."
"Do not forget that in 2005 we also launched a transparency register, then called the 'lobbyist register' and now the 'register of interest representatives', which has now developed into a joint register with Parliament."
"That is a great step ahead."
"So something has been done."
"Things do not look so bad."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"I am glad that I am speaking after him."
"I would like to say that we would rather look to the present and the future than back to the past."
"We would rather see bigger steps being taken towards transparency."
"I join with my colleagues on this question and recall that Parliament has asked the Commission to take action to ensure the balanced representation of interest groups in the membership of expert groups."
"As the Commissioner mentioned, we have a revised framework."
"In our view, however, there are still major shortcomings which undermine people's confidence."
"I will mention some of them."
"Procedures to detect and eliminate conflicts of interest are missing."
"We need a procedure to detect and eliminate these."
"It is not enough to send a letter to the experts asking them to decide if they have a conflict of interest or not."
"Professional secrecy clauses have been extended beyond Commission staff to include members of expert groups so that, instead of moving towards more transparency, we are moving towards more secrecy."
"The lack of transparency persists with regard to the disclosure of expert groups' documents."
"Next, small and medium-sized enterprises and civil society organisations are not properly represented."
"Safeguards against industry dominance are insufficient."
"There is a risk of 'corporate capture' of expert groups."
"So we ask for all information about the existing expert groups to be placed on a website in a timely manner, including information about membership and members and all calls for applications."
"I take this opportunity to insist again on the need for transparency concerning EU fund beneficiaries."
"Finally, I would like to say that transparency ensures good governance and trust in the institutions."
"If we want people's trust, more - and full - transparency is the only way to go."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, we know that there are many clichés concerning European decision-making."
"The first one is that it is not transparent, but the EU is a tricky political system even for those who understand its functioning."
"Standard definitions hardly apply, therefore."
"Transparency and simplicity should be a basic aim for all actors in the EU."
"Our political system is sufficiently difficult on its own; we are not here to make it more difficult."
"Finding a legislative proposal somewhere on an EU website should not require special skills, so the user-friendly website the oral questions mention is not just an option - it is a must."
"Another accusation is that the role of lobbying is unclear, and the role of big business is disproportionately strong."
"I know that lobbying can be useful for the Commission, as lobby groups often think up important points and provide information or even whole, ready-made, policy solutions."
"Here again I believe that transparency is a must and I am hopeful that this will be reflected in the future lobby register."
"When it comes to expert groups, they should be seen for what they are: another playing field in which participants can put their interests forward."
"If the composition of those expert groups is biased, then expert groups merely provide one more opportunity for interest groups to succeed."
"However, these players are usually already good at putting their interests forward without the additional help of public authorities."
"I can only repeat my colleagues' question: is it obligatory or not for the Commission to obtain balanced advice?"
"Mr President, it is obvious that transparency in the work of every official body should be guaranteed in every democratic society."
"This is needed for good decisions to be made objectively and to take account of all of society or the whole country or organisation which will be affected, and not some particular interests."
"Therefore there is all the more reason why we should stress, whenever possible, that bodies connected with the European Union or the European Commission, as well as all other bodies which perform an official function, and this includes the European Parliament, should work as transparently and as openly as possible."
"This means the proposals that expert groups, too, should work in line with these requirements and with as much openness and transparency as possible are fully justified and warranted."
"This is necessary to eliminate possible conflicts of interest and to eliminate possible activity on behalf of particular interests when we do not know of this and when these actions may influence decisions which are important for the whole European Union."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, last October this Parliament introduced six new directives giving the EU powers to regulate the UK financial industry."
"On 7 February, I submitted a written question to the Commission advising it of one aspect of the UK Companies Act 1976."
"Section 27 of the Act gives a significant exemption to just one company, the Bank of England Nominees Limited."
"This exemption means that the identities of the shareholders of the Bank of England are kept secret."
"I have asked the Commission if this exemption contravenes EU law and if the new regulatory bodies will have the power to require the disclosure of the names of the Bank of England's shareholders."
"Of course, I and my party do not want any EU law, but the Commission and the British Government do."
"Presumably then, the Commission should ensure that its law is equally, consistently and transparently applied throughout its empire."
"(DE) Mr President, I am delighted that you are here today, Commissioner, because your efforts over the years for which you were responsible for this area achieved widespread recognition."
"Nonetheless, you know from your own experience that there is still a very long way to go."
"It is vitally important that people who sit on expert groups are subject to a procedure and that sanctions can be imposed on them if they make incorrect statements."
"It is outrageous that people can claim to be independent when in reality they are clearly not independent."
"There must be sanctions for this; otherwise, what we have is a paper tiger."
"My second point is the issue of who is being represented; you will be familiar with this from the business world."
"Here, in particular, it must surely be in the interests of the Commission to open up the groups at last to representatives of civil society."
"Looking at what has been achieved in respect of the financial scandals and the economic crisis it is clear that a great deal of poor advice has been given."
"This is something that we need to work on urgently."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to thank the group of Members for raising this urgent issue."
"The issue of experts does not only concern the economy."
"The Commission does not respect the principle of impartiality and balance in other fields either, and the resulting composition of expert groups is one-sided and does not represent the interests of all citizens."
"The first example I would like to give is that, according to Eurostat, 90% of EU citizens are in favour of families consisting of a wife, a husband and their children."
"The Commission, however, selects only experts from organizations such as the European Women's Lobby or the Family platform, which seek to break this family model."
"The Commission has, in contrast, long rejected those women's organizations and experts who, just like the majority of EU citizens, do not agree with one-sided feminist theory."
"Another example is the Agency for Fundamental Rights, created and financed by the Commission."
"The experts of this agency support a one-sided policy agenda, without trying to reach balance and objectivity."
"This is evidenced by the speeches of its Director in this Parliament."
"Even the European Commission has distanced itself from the attitudes to freedom of religion and conscience promulgated by the chairman of this agency's independent panel of experts, because it was drafted by lobbyists for pro-abortion organizations."
"I believe that if an official European expert agency elevates political interests above professionalism and impartiality, it should be abolished."
"I could mention many more such cases."
"I would therefore like to add my voice to the questions that have been submitted to the Commission by the Members."
"I would like to ask the Commission to throw open the windows of the cabinet of experts, because the air in there is not clean, and this applies not only to the field of economics."
"(FR) Mr President, the cooperation and consultations of experts put in place by the European Commission really must be irreproachable from the point of view of transparency, because this is a dangerous exercise."
"Indeed, members representing an interest, who are chosen according to their specific tasks and their type of expertise, may represent the same interests without, however, reflecting the general interest."
"The Commission must therefore be particularly careful to ensure that they are representative, but even more so, it should encourage contradiction."
"I find it unacceptable that these members should include numerous NGOs that have similar interests and a similar scope."
"The working papers, acts and agendas of meetings should also be made public so that they can be consulted by the general public, elected representatives and entities for which the group's work does not have immediate implications but which will be affected from time to time."
"The unclear content of the expert groups' work cannot possibly lead to reliable results, and here I am thinking in particular of the expert groups coming under the DG Sanco."
"Lastly, I believe that, in an effort to ensure the transparency of its operations, the Commission must involve Parliament in reviewing the supervision of its expert groups and similar entities."
"As Article 9 of the Treaty makes clear, transparency is not just a matter for the European Commission; it concerns the people of Europe, too."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our daily parliamentary activities we realise that added value is given by access to selected information that supports our legislative role and our work of providing political direction."
"We make use of outside human resources - although the Commission does so much more often - to supply us with analyses and guides to the current political, social, industrial and entrepreneurial situation."
"Policy, however, is made up of decisions and choices, and these remain fully in the hands of politicians."
"It is a matter of making choices that may be supported by expert groups endowed with a high degree of professionalism and specific levels of competence, who are capable of expressing their opinions objectively."
"Hence there is a need to identify effective instruments and transparent procedures that will allow the Commission to fulfil its role with the support of these autonomous or independent expert groups."
"We are aware that this is an extremely problematic aspect."
"The 2010 plan is certainly a significant step forward, but much more needs to be done."
"The experts' impartiality and authority also depend on how autonomous they are and on how able they are to support political decisions fairly and loyally."
"Publicity mechanisms, the web and other effective methods can be simplified even further in both the Commission and Parliament."
"Therefore, the right of access is good; transparency is certainly good; the balance between the right to transparency and those things that cannot be handed over or passed on or made recognisable is good; and the register of lobbyists that is to be set up soon is good."
"However, we must emphasise once again that it is policy that is paramount."
"If the policy is credible and competent, the experts' role is one of consultancy and support."
"The decision will always be made by the one who takes responsibility for it."
"(SK) Mr President, the European Commission has recently revised its framework document governing the operation of expert groups."
"Given that we are all interested not only in the best possible functioning of the institutions of the European Union, but also in the transparent and fair creation and functioning of expert and advisory bodies, we would welcome a higher degree of openness on the part of the European Commission regarding implementation of the mechanism for the selection of experts for European Commission expert groups."
"Reference was made here a few moments ago to the example of the European Medicines Agency, where the list of experts actually raises doubts as to the provision of independent expert advice."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we should work together to prevent any doubts as to the expertise, balance and independence of our advisory bodies."
"If we feel that the framework for expert groups still has certain shortcomings, despite the current revision, let us give the matter some thought and try to improve it even further."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Barnier has admitted that some of the Commission's expert groups in the financial area are unbalanced and one-sided in their composition."
"At present, 11 of the 25 expert groups in the financial area are dominated by the financial industry."
"Some groups have more representatives of the finance industry than responsible officials."
"Moreover, these representatives merely have to sign a preprinted declaration that they will act in the public interest if they see a conflict of interests."
"Such ridiculous platitudes are hardly conducive to creating transparency and neutrality."
"The situation where the reports of the European Food Safety Agency are concerned is equally concerning."
"The statements on risks posed by genetic modification cite manufacturers' reports and the involvement of genetic modification lobbyists is clear."
"The Executive Director of the most important specialist EU authority on genetically modified plants is thus working for the industry-funded International Life Sciences Institute."
"In other words, EU legislation that is primarily based on statements by banks and large groups is irresponsible and dangerous for EU citizens, and should therefore be stopped immediately."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, it really warms my heart to listen to this discussion."
"In fact, it would be good to have some kind of memo about the history of this issue."
"The Commission takes note of all these good ideas and advice on how to increase transparency."
"I should point out that in 2005 we launched a transparency initiative which included the question of expert groups."
"This was very largely my brainchild, as Mr Hans-Peter Martin has just recalled."
"There have, of course, been huge changes in relation to this question, with all the websites and information now available."
"But you should never regard the experts as some kind of decision-makers."
"They are not decision-makers and they clash with each other."
"It is the same issue as has just been raised in relation to genetically modified organisms."
"One knows that it is not just industry that is concerned."
"There are different groups of experts."
"In the last months of the last Commission I also had responsibility for security, so all information about demonstrations came to my desk."
"One of the last huge demonstrations was against the abolition of subsidies for tobacco producers."
"So there are different views, but we are the decision-makers: the Commissioners and Members of Parliament and our Institutions."
"Agencies also make decisions, as do the Council and the Member State governments."
"Experts are not the decision-makers."
"There is no arithmetical link."
"Yes, I am in favour of greater transparency."
"It is clear that some very high-level expert groups were set up only to quietly disappear because they were not able to give any advice as they held such contradictory views."
"So let us work with this transparency register, which I also consider to be a great achievement, because experts and advisers are everywhere."
"No politician survives without advisers."
"Political groups have advisers and are approached by different interests, and finally it is for political decision-makers to take one stand or another."
"There will always be subjects where the experts will say that now you must take this or that position."
"This is a matter for the political decision-makers: Commissioners, parliamentarians, political groups, in accordance with the democratic system."
"There is also the question of the composition of the expert groups."
"Many issues have been raised about composition."
"Who should assess whether their composition is balanced or not?"
"The composition of the expert groups is determined by specific cases."
"Some people may mistakenly want to enter these expert groups to be part of the decision-making process, but expert groups are not decision-makers."
"Back in 2005, as some of us remember, there really was an element of opacity and the Commission, together with Parliament, has introduced substantial changes in this regard."
"By this I mean the transparency register, which registers representatives of interest groups."
"This applies to lobbyists at Parliament and the Commission, and a lot of information is now available to assess how great their influence is and the composition of the expert groups."
"Let us develop our response in this issue, but let us also not underestimate the efforts which have been made so far."
"The debate is closed."

"Mr President, the Figaro newspaper this morning reports that last week a journalist not only entered the European Parliament with an imitation gun, but was also able to get extremely close to Prince Charles, the next British Head of State."
"Given the ongoing concerns about security in this House, can you assure us today that you are taking these matters seriously, and that the so-called review being conducted in secret by Parliament's Bureau will not merely be a tinkering exercise, but a root-and-branch reform of security?"
"Mr Karim, I can assure you that this matter is being taken very seriously."
"According to my information, it is being discussed at the Conference of Presidents, so you can be sure Parliament is paying great attention to this problem."
"It is a very serious matter."
"In the light of recent developments, the text on the media law in Hungary, the vote on which was tabled for today, will have to be revised."
"I therefore propose that this vote be postponed under Rule 177(4)."
"The decision on further action on this issue and on the necessary new deadlines will be taken at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, 3 March 2011."
"Who wishes to speak in favour?"
"Who wishes to speak against?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, after the recent developments that are on the table at the Commission but not at Parliament, I feel that we have to postpone the vote on the resolution because it needs to be adapted to suit this new development."
"So that was the proposal in favour."
"Who wants to speak against?"
"No one?"
"Then we will proceed to the vote."
"Who is in favour of postponement?"
"Against?"
"Abstentions?"
"The proposal is carried."
"The vote on this item is postponed."
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of the vote"
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to talk about the vote on the bilateral safeguard clause."
"I support the adoption of the regulation on the implementation of a safeguard clause concerning free trade between the EU and Korea."
"I also support all amendment proposals calling on the Commission to monitor the proper and timely implementation of this legal instrument in order to prevent serious damage to industries in the European Union, and to take account of the legitimate interests of Member States regarding the specific economic situation in certain sectors of manufacturing industry."
"The Free Trade Agreement will affect the industrial sectors of Member States in different ways, and we therefore need the option of applying protective measures at the regional level in exceptional cases."
"In my opinion, the regions concerned must have the option of applying measures to prevent a serious negative impact on the regional economy and employment."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight the fact that last week six important Member States of the European Union - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and Portugal - stated that Europe needs to be less ingenuous."
"The six countries are calling for a more effective and strategic defence of European foreign trade, because the very existence and development of the European economic and social model are at stake."
"The six countries point out that the European Union has opened up 80% of its market to third countries, while the other major developed economies have only opened up 20% of theirs."
"It is therefore claimed that there are asymmetries in foreign trade and the concept of reciprocity needs to be developed."
"This problem has brought many of our small and medium-sized enterprises to their knees, because they are suffering from unfair competition that stops them from being competitive in the markets."
"Mr President, I come from Prato, a town that was once considered one of the most important textile areas in Europe."
"Today, unfair competition from Asia has turned it into a ghost town, because business in Prato has been utterly devastated."
"All these reasons have led us to vote against this agreement."
"(SK) Mr President, in the framework of the revision of budgetary guarantees provided to the European Investment Bank (EIB) by the European Union, I support particularly those elements, which have been designed to boost the momentum of this institution."
"From the standpoint of future prospects, it is primarily about strengthening and making better use of the external mandate of the bank in the period between 2014 and 2020 in terms of increasing the volume of loans and their quality."
"I also support the intention of allowing the EIB to reinvest venture capital and special loan reflows from earlier operations into new operations of the same type for the benefit of partner countries."
"In order to improve access to financial resources for poorer groups in the eligible countries, an additional grant of EUR 500 million should be allocated to the EIB immediately to finance micro-credits."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted against the report, since I find it unacceptable that we should be supporting investment in third countries instead of facilitating investment for European small and medium-sized enterprises, which really form the most important economic fabric of the Union."
"I am firmly against the inclusion of Turkey among the pre-accession countries: I would point out that Turkey still illegally occupies part of the territory of Cyprus, an EU Member State."
"Moreover, there is no guarantee of transparency when the European Investment Bank (EIB) grants Union guarantees and finance to third countries."
"I would point out that European citizens contribute to EIB funds, which is why priority should be given to investment within Europe itself."
"Many of the investments supported by the EIB are in countries where clashes and uprisings against the various regimes are taking place."
"The report seeks to extend Union guarantees also to other countries, such as Cuba, that are known for their lack of democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, while we voted firmly in favour of the safeguard clause in the report by Mr Zalba Bidegain, whom I thank once again for his excellent work, we abstained on the trade agreement with Korea with some regret."
"We did so with regret because, although this agreement does indeed open up an important new market for the Union, paving the way for further trade agreements in future with other economic partner countries of the Union, it is also true that many doubts and misgivings remain."
"These doubts and misgivings affect major commercial sectors, especially the motor industry, and also textiles and agriculture."
"Although Europe has not yet defined the regulation on the indication of country of origin for products from outside the European Union, we continue to offer countries privileged status for importing products into Europe without demanding rules to ensure true equality for companies or information for people that purchase the goods."
"Our abstention confirms that we are in favour of a free market, but one that includes the necessary guarantees, whereas we are against the conclusion of trade agreements that do not sufficiently guarantee the rules of competition."
"(SK) Mr President, the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement will bring innumerable benefits to European industry, businesses, entrepreneurs and employees."
"It will contribute to overall economic growth and open up effective new opportunities for European goods and services."
"However, certain industries will be exposed to additional competition, and the EU should therefore ensure effective monitoring of the implementation of the agreement, the rapid settlement of disputes and the subsequent rapid safeguarding of the legitimate interests of European industry and European entrepreneurs."
"It is obvious that strict compliance with labour, technical and environmental standards, as well as provisions on the protection of fair competition have to be ensured by both parties."
"Goods and products placed on the European market must comply with all standards of the European Union, and I welcome the establishment of a monitoring committee for the motor industry, which should help prevent so-called hidden protectionism through new technical barriers to trade."
"I am therefore in favour of granting final approval to the agreement in question, provided that a bilateral safeguard mechanism will be created as well, in order to prevent possible serious damage to Member State industries, or even the threat of such damage."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted for this Agreement;"
"I followed it from the beginning and was glad that it was accepted today."
"At a seminar in Brussels last week, a credible economist said that this is one of the best Free Trade Agreements the European Union ever concluded."
"At the same time, he said that 90% of these agreements are not worth a pin."
"Be that as it may, I welcome the opportunity it provides for agricultural products, especially whiskey, pork and dairy products."
"I hope the opportunity will be grasped."
"It is a great thing, too, that it contains a protection clause."
"Because if things do not change as they ought, we can do a review."
"Therefore, I am very pleased that it was accepted."
"(DA) Mr President, I think it is a really splendid agreement that has been finalised here today, and I only regret that there are some people who believed that they could protect inefficient European enterprises by saying 'no' to this agreement."
"South Korea is the 15th largest economy in the world and the third largest in Asia."
"We will see better and better opportunities for exporting."
"We have a country with respectable economic growth, a population of 50 million and increasing purchasing power."
"The agreement will quite simply provide the opportunity for Europe, in some service sectors where we are extremely competitive, to now become even better: these include telecommunications, the environment, shipping and financial and legal services."
"I would also just like to point out today that the EFTA countries have had a free trade agreement since 2006, and this has resulted, among other things, in Norway tripling its exports to South Korea since 2006."
"Hence, this is a very good agreement for Europe and I have therefore voted in favour of it."
"Mr President, Europe could do many things to support Egyptian democracy, and one of the most important would be to look at the events in Egypt as part of a genuine wave of democratisation."
"In the space of a few weeks, a tyranny collapsed, and with it we have seen the collapse of a number of stereotypes such as the theory of a clash of civilisations."
"No conflict of civilisations whatsoever is occurring in the Arab World today - exactly the opposite."
"Egyptian youngsters are putting their lives at risk for the same values that we hold."
"They are showing that democracy is a universal aspiration and that there are no cultures, religions or civilisations that are against it."
"Nonetheless, an army of sceptics and doomsayers is at work today, diminishing or distorting the meaning of the Egyptian transition to democracy."
"People are engaged in raising all sorts of doubts, describing the latest development as a 'coup d'état' as though these events have simply paved the way for an Islamic Government that will end up in another autocracy."
"If we want to help the Egyptian people, we should be ready to counter these reactionary views of the unfolding of history."
"(PL) Mr President, Egypt is an important economic and commercial partner of the European Union."
"Many people from Poland go on holiday to Egypt on a regular basis."
"In recent weeks, we have witnessed a national rebellion in Egypt, which has resulted in President Mubarak stepping down after 30 years of authoritarian rule."
"It is always right when the will of the people prevails, and the Egyptians deserve recognition for their victory."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, and in doing so I expressed my hope for a rapid stabilisation of the political situation in Egypt and further development of good relations with the countries of Europe."
"Not long ago, we witnessed shameful events relating to discrimination against Coptic Christians, and this makes concentrating EU diplomatic efforts on stabilisation and law and order in Egypt an essential condition for mutual relations to develop properly."
"It is also necessary to make every effort to ensure that the coming elections are held in a way which does not attract criticism and which is in accord with democratic standards."
"(DE) Mr President, we enthusiastically support the movement for democracy in Egypt, but it is important to realise that free elections are not enough."
"We need an integrated approach in order to give the people prospects - a kind of Mediterranean Plan, a kind of Marshall Plan for North Africa and Egypt."
"This will involve giving people social prospects, strengthening education policy, strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises, ensuring that criminality and corruption are combated and above all, initiating close cooperation in the area of energy policy, where in the area of solar energy North Africa and Europe have a lot to offer each other."
"We have yet to complete the real major tasks."
"Egypt's democrats have completed the first phase of the work; now it is up to us to step up to the mark."
"Mr President, the situation in Egypt is still developing, but in what direction is it moving?"
"While we have rightly expressed our support for the popular desire for an open society, we should be aware of the complex, and yet unsolved, problems in Egypt and in the Middle East."
"The situation in Egypt could be adequately described as a revolt in waiting for a revolution."
"A new generation has brought novelty to Egypt, but social media skills are not enough."
"Egypt is still mired in backwardness, anti-Semitism and extreme practices."
"The EU has yet to formulate a proper policy towards the new developments in North Africa."
"Egypt needs our support, but we need an Egypt ruled by law and human dignity."
"Our task is just beginning."
"Let us not forget the last message to come from Iran, where the Parliament has noisily called for the execution of opposition leaders."
"This proves that we should be well prepared, and stand our ground."
"(FI) Mr President, the motion for a resolution is good, and it adopts a position in favour of democratic and peaceful forces of change."
"Perhaps, though, it is worth remembering and acknowledging that for 30 years the EU and the West have supported Mubarak."
"It is stability that has been important for the EU."
"That means equilibrium and the supply of oil, and, in addition, the fact that money has been made out of the arms trade."
"Now the EU needs to find ways, including financial measures, to boost its support for civil society actors, both in Egypt and in other undemocratic countries in Africa and the Arab world."
"I think that it is something of a setback that this resolution makes no mention of the arms trade between countries of the EU and Egypt and other undemocratic countries."
"The arms trade ought to be in line with international agreements on human rights and humanitarian treaties."
"(SK) Mr President, Egypt is at the beginning of its democratisation process."
"I believe that all of the victims who lost their lives during the revolution should be atoned for through positive progress towards democracy."
"Europe should certainly assist Egypt in this, and I believe that we will find ways of preventing Egypt from taking one direction in a totalitarian manner, for instance through an extreme step toward a militant Muslim movement which does not respect democratic rules and which would hinder democratic elections and the application of civil society."
"I believe that Egypt will uphold its international agreements with its neighbours, including Israel, even under these new conditions, and that it will be a society which treats all of its citizens fairly, including non-Muslims, and including Christians."
"(DE) Mr President, this motion for a resolution represents another important step in the right direction, but no more than that."
"However, as Commissioner Hahn proposed, people are now talking about a strategy for the Danube region rather than a Danube strategy, because this is not just about cleaning up the river - as important as that is - but is about cooperation across a major region that extends from Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg through the former Austria-Hungary and across large parts of the Balkans."
"I am pleased that, at our request, Bohemia and Slovenia are also included, even though they are not situated directly on the Danube."
"To this end I would also like to see included in the future projects such as the main railway line from Strasbourg to Bratislava and Budapest, TEN 17 and other projects that may not be located directly on the Danube, but which cross it repeatedly and are of strategic importance for the Danube region."
"I particularly welcome Articles 36 to 40, which deal with culture and the involvement of civil society, because without these the strategy for the Danube region will not be a success."
"(PL) Mr President, for many years, it has been clear that the legal system in Russia is not infrequently in conflict with the standards of international conventions and human rights."
"The majority of cases which come before the Court of Justice and here in Strasbourg are brought against Russia."
"The independence of the Russian courts is, therefore, the subject of a great deal of doubt."
"Recent events, such as the trial of Mr Khordorkovsky and the arrest of demonstrators are clear examples of this."
"Mysterious murders and beatings only serve to further reinforce the impression that Russia is a lawless country."
"I hope the motion for a resolution we have adopted today will make it easier for representatives of European Union bodies to take up these thorny issues in diplomatic relations with Russia."
"I would like to express my anxiety concerning the Russian authorities in relation to the dramatic situation on human rights and the restrictions placed on civil society there."
"I appeal to international institutions to put diplomatic pressure on the Russian authorities to bring about a restoration of the rule of law and respect for human and citizens' rights in Russia."
"Mr President, I voted for this resolution."
"However, as a result of compromises, paragraph 8 has become too ambiguous and non-committal."
"The EU must take concrete measures to show that it is serious about the need for a real improvement of the rule of law situation in Russia."
"While economic and political contacts need to be continued, a clear signal should be sent to those state officials who are considered responsible for grave breaches of law that they are not welcome in the capitals or tourist resorts of Europe."
"Against this background, I do not consider it proper to officially invite President Medvedev to address the European Parliament until he has lived up to his promises to improve the rule of law situation in Russia."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that we have finally adopted the resolution on this very important topic."
"I have been a close observer of political developments and the situation as regards the rule of law in Russia for many years now."
"Most recently, I had a chance to visit Russia with an official delegation of the Human Rights Subcommittee in September last year."
"During the visit I had a first-hand opportunity to observe how the rule of law is upheld in Russia when attending the trial of the former Yukos boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and his business associate, Platon Lebedev."
"The trial of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is only the most conspicuous of many examples of the selective application of the rule of law in Russia, which means that there is no genuine rule of law."
"If Russia wants to be a strategic partner of the EU it must follow a path of comprehensive modernisation."
"Any modernisation plan will be a failure if the rule of law is not vigorously developed in Russia."
"(DE) Mr President, the miniscule signs of the beginnings of the rule of law in Russia are disappearing and the country is not only not moving forward, but is sliding back."
"The man responsible for this is Mr Putin."
"It is Mr Putin who is bringing about this deterioration in the rule of law."
"We need to realise that he is not the solution to the problem, but rather is a major part of the problem."
"President Medvedev has yet to prove - and here I agree with Mr Kelam - that he is not simply the charming face of Mr Putin, the slightly more friendly face, but that he is actually attempting or in a position to consolidate the rule of law somewhat more in this member state of the Council of Europe, which is after all obliged to ensure the rule of law under the European Convention on Human Rights."
"To this extent we need to be highly critical; naturally we must maintain a dialogue, but we also need to ensure that the rule of law prevails."
"It is shocking that the court that sentenced Mr Khodorkovsky has now publicly stated that it was ordered by Moscow to hand down this verdict."
"That has nothing whatsoever to do with the rule of law."
"(RO) Mr President, I voted for this motion for a resolution."
"However, as the final text made no mention of the role of cohesion policy, I signed an amendment on this, along with fellow Members from the other political groups, which was also voted on today."
"The Structural Funds and the basic principles of cohesion policy, such as an integrated approach, multi-level governance and real partnership, are key elements in achieving the EU 2020 Strategy's objectives, which also means that they must be fully integrated into it."
"I agree that we need an ambitious social agenda which will include combating poverty and social exclusion."
"However, to be able to create sustainable jobs, we need to have primarily a competitive economy, which is precisely the role played by cohesion policy."
"Therefore, if we continue to deprive cohesion policy of the attention it is due, we will record the failure of the EU 2020 Strategy in the coming years."
"(IT) Mr President, we will still have to suffer the damage caused by the financial crisis for a long time."
"The brake on the real economy caused by financial malpractice must be released as quickly as possible to enable the single market to resume its development."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy does not appear to us to be the most appropriate one for delivering the growth we are hoping for."
"Structural obstacles - such as weak governance, the intergovernmental method compared to the Community method, percentage and numerical targets analogous to those used in the old Soviet five-year plans, and programme forecasts that give no assurance of ever being achieved - remind me of all the flops we have endured, of which Lisbon will not be the last, without realising that our absolute priorities should be to create jobs and tackle unemployment."
"We need impetus, effort and stimulus, which unfortunately I do not find in the proposed strategy."
"'Release' needs to become the watchword, but it is also vitally important to define rules to prevent the creation or strengthening of monopolies and to ensure that the ones benefiting are the people and the economy as a whole, and not some financial or political group that is more ruthless than the rest."
"Mr President, the rapid rise in food prices has been a burden on the poor in developing countries, who spend roughly half of their household incomes on food."
"This calls for an integrated response from the international community."
"The wholehearted involvement of the EU in issues of global food security is urgently required."
"The resolution approved today is a first step in the right direction."
"The resolution states that the right to food is a fundamental human right and makes several useful recommendations."
"However, we need to go ahead with further proposals."
"We need to change the aspects of CAP international aid policies that are not in line with the task of increasing global food production, in full respect of environmental concerns, food safety and labour standards."
"(PL) Mr President, food is also of strategic importance for the European Union."
"Food has to be produced, and so it is also important for labour markets."
"I would like to focus in particular on an industry which, alongside others, is also a source of food production - fishing."
"The fishing industry is one which supplies the EU and world market with a substantial amount of food."
"However, the European Union is the greatest importer of fish products from other parts of the world."
"Excessive liberalisation of this market may lead to its collapse, and as a consequence to the loss of this source of food in Europe."
"Therefore, attention should be paid to this aspect of common policy."
"(FI) Mr President, this is an extremely important issue."
"Right now, there are a billion starving people in the world."
"Since the EU set its target to eradicate hunger and poverty, things have in fact gone in the opposite direction."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution and I would hope that the EU High Representative, Baroness Ashton, will make food security and all its various aspects one of the priorities of the EU's foreign policy."
"Obviously, too, Parliament and the EU as a whole should support her in this."
"It is important that people should have food, that people should be able to buy food, and that, here in the EU, we should obviously also discuss the need to end the food scandals."
"(PL) Mr President, a billion of the world's people are suffering hunger."
"In 2008, rising food prices caused riots in 30 countries."
"Today, we have a similar situation."
"This situation has been caused, in addition, by the general economic crisis, and it is now even more necessary to make a concerted effort to find fair ways of distributing food products on a global scale."
"Food prices are rising, but farmers' profits are falling."
"This, too, should be stressed very strongly."
"Unfortunately, it is being forgotten in the European Union that the common agricultural policy is principally a policy intended to secure the supply of high quality food at a suitable price to all European consumers, with a guarantee of a decent return for farmers."
"We must not allow further elimination of instruments which regulate the market and maintain stocks at suitably high levels, and this includes cereal stocks."
"It is also essential to put an end to speculative activities in the market."
"It is reprehensible that capital groups are condemning millions of people across the world to suffer hunger."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted for this report because the safeguard clause provides for the possibility of re-imposing the most-favoured-mation rate when imports increase to such an extent - either in absolute terms or in relation to domestic production - that they could undermine industry in the European Union, which is in direct competition with imported products."
"I therefore agree with the introduction of this safeguard clause, and recall that following the Treaty of Lisbon the European Parliament has powers of codecision with the Council."
"An effective regulation should serve to provide an assurance if the Free Trade Agreement with the Republic of Korea should fail."
"in writing. - I voted for the Zalba Bidegain report on a bilateral safeguard clause in the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Korea because it adequately protects the increase in trade with Korea that is brought about by the Free Trade Agreement."
"The bilateral safeguard mechanism will permit the EU to revert to the prior MFN rates of duty if this agreement even threatens to damage our industry."
"This Free Trade Agreement opens up our service industry, agriculture and manufacturing industries to increased access to the large and growing Korean market."
"This is an extremely important vote for the European Union's new international trade strategy."
"In fact, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea is the first example of a new generation of agreements that aim at lowering trade and non-trade barriers and expanding investment prospects in the partner country."
"As soon as it was signed in October 2009, the agreement was received with fierce criticism from the European motor industry, which felt it was being severely penalised by certain clauses conceded to the Korean partner, duty drawback in particular."
"Those concerns have now been partly dissipated, not least due to Parliament's work on the attached regulation on the safeguard clause annexed to the agreement and to a clarification by the South Korean Government on the amendments to internal legislation on carbon emissions."
"Today, therefore, we confirmed the vote of the Committee on International Trade in order to allow the procedure to be completed, given that the Council has already agreed to it."
"in writing. - (LT) On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of Korea with a view to concluding an EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement."
"The agreement incorporates a bilateral safeguard clause that provides for the possibility of re-imposing the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate when, as a result of trade liberalisation, imports increase to such an extent and take place under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the EU industry producing a similar or directly competing product."
"For such measures to become operational, the safeguard clause must be incorporated into EU law, not least because the procedural aspects of the imposition of safeguard measures, as well as the rights of interested parties, need to be specified."
"The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council that is before us constitutes the legal instrument required for implementation of the safeguard clause in the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement."
"I would stress that legislative work on this regulation should be confined to issues relating to its implementation, without unilaterally altering fundamental provisions of the agreement and adopting measures that go against its spirit."
"For instance, no changes should be made to the type of safeguard measures applicable, to the length of time for which they may apply or to the period during which the safeguard clause may be brought to bear."
"in writing. - UKIP wants the UK to leave the European Union and retain friendly trading links through a UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, similar to that with non-EU Switzerland and Norway."
"I voted in favour of this EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement as it can be a model and a template for a future UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, and because it demonstrates that tariff-free and favourable trading access to the EU can be achieved without the UK (or South Korea) being a member of the EU."
"This is especially true in the case of the UK, which would be the EU's largest single trading partner."
"A UK-EU Free Trade Agreement would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the UK as a member of the EU, and would therefore require far less negotiation (e.g. over tariff reductions) than did the agreement with South Korea."
"in writing. - UKIP desires to leave the European Union and retain friendly trading links through a UK/EU Free Trade Agreement, similar to that of non-EU Switzerland and Norway."
"I voted in favour of this South Korea/EU Free Trade Agreement as it can be a model and a template for a future UK/EU Free Trade Agreement, and as it demonstrates tariff-free and favourable trading access to the EU can be achieved without the UK (or South Korea) being a member of the EU."
"This is especially the case for the UK, which is the largest single trading partner with the EU."
"A UK/EU Free Trade Agreement would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the UK as a member of the EU, and would need therefore far less negotiation (e.g. over tariff reductions) than those with South Korea."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the bilateral safeguard clause can guarantee that industry in the European Union, which produces a similar or directly competing products would not be damaged as a result of trade liberalisation by the Republic of Korea."
"This clause should also function as an instrument to which European industry can turn to prevent serious losses, or to enable it to adapt to unfavourable situations, resulting from the volatility of the international market."
"In relation to the conclusion of the process of adopting the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea, the European Commission has drafted a proposal for a regulation on a safeguard clause that would ensure the reintroduction of customs tariffs if increased imports of a specific product put the related industry at serious risk."
"The number of amendments of which the Commission's proposal has been the subject seems to reflect a certain lack of clarity in its wording, as well as the Members' desire to protect various interests."
"I hope that the resolution that we have adopted today will contribute to improving the original text, and that the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea will be established in a way that enables a significant increase in trade between the two markets, as is expected."
"I am hopeful that the aforementioned agreement will be fruitful and that the safeguard clause - which it is hoped will be clear and capable of functioning effectively whenever needed - will never need to be enforced."
"This report concerns a proposal for regulation of the European Parliament and the Council, which applies to the bilateral clause of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea."
"This agreement was concluded on 15 October 2009 and includes a safeguard clause guaranteeing the reinstatement of tariffs when imports increase to such an extent as to damage industry in the European Union (EU) which produces competing products."
"In order for it to be possible to apply this measure, it is necessary for it to be incorporated into EU legislation."
"I hope that it will be an effective clause, which can be implemented with minimum bureaucracy."
"I welcome the adoption of this proposal, which introduces increased guarantees for European companies, and I hope that the European Union will receive periodic reports to assess compliance with these safeguard mechanisms."
"Our position in the vote on this report should be considered in the light of the profoundly negative assessment that we have made of the signing of this Free Trade Agreement."
"The establishment of this clause represents, above all, recognition of the devastating consequences of the liberalisation and deregulation promoted by the agreement."
"Moreover, it does not remove the dangers and concerns that this agreement involves and raises regarding the future of various sectors of economic activity, particularly in some Member States, such as Portugal, and in the regions that are most dependent on those sectors."
"The particular goal of the bilateral safeguard clause is to enable the EU to re-impose most-favoured-nation (MFN) customs duties if it is proven that liberalisation resulting from the agreement could cause serious injury to EU industries."
"We have serious doubts as to whether this mechanism will be enough to protect small producers or small and medium-sized enterprises, which will find it very difficult to stay afloat in a liberalised market; to prevent the decimation of their production capacity and, consequently, the loss of many jobs."
"It is significant that the possibility is being raised of mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to alleviate the impact of this agreement."
"The solution ought to be to prevent the consequences that are currently being anticipated, not to remedy them in this way."
"in writing. - (DE) The vote by the European Parliament in favour of Mr Zalba Bidegain's report on the bilateral safeguard clauses represents an important step in the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Korea."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his involvement in the trialogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission and emphasise the importance of these safeguard clauses for the European economy."
"They allow a temporary raising of duty in order to protect the European economy from excessive growth in imports."
"I am a clear advocate of such safeguard clauses and I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"During this sitting, this House has expressed its opinion on the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement and has adopted the report on the bilateral safeguard clause of said agreement."
"My opinion and my vote on the latter are positive."
"The fact that I supported the report, however, does not prevent me from offering the advice that greater attention should be given to the farming sector."
"Korea is in fact known to be keeping in force certain laws that contain major plant-health restrictions, which severely constrain our agricultural producers."
"It would be beneficial to update these safeguard clauses in that respect as well because, although it is a fact that agricultural trade with Korea is worth approximately EUR 1 billion every year, it is also true that removing or at least limiting those barriers would enable us to defend our products and farmers in the best possible way."
"Otherwise, they could be placed in a less favourable position than their Korean counterparts."
"in writing. - I welcome this regulation, which incorporates a bilateral safeguard clause into the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement providing for the possibility of re-imposing the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate when, as a result of trade liberalisation, imports increase to such an extent - in absolute terms or in relation to domestic production - and take place under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the EU industry producing a similar or directly competing product."
"For such measures to become operational, the safeguard clause must be incorporated into EU law, not least because the procedural aspects of the imposition of safeguard measures, as well as the rights of interested parties, need to be specified."
"The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council for which I voted provided the legal instrument required for implementation of the safeguard clause in the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement."
"On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of Korea with a view to concluding a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the European Union (EU) and this country."
"The agreement was initialled on 15 October 2009."
"The bilateral safeguard clause incorporated into this agreement, which provides for the possibility of re-imposing the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate when, as a result of trade liberalisation, imports increase to such an extent - in absolute terms or in relation to domestic production - and take place under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the Union industry that produces similar or directly competing products, is very important for maintaining healthy competition that is not damaging to either party."
"However, for practical effects to be achieved, the aforementioned safeguard clause must be incorporated into European Union legislation, since not only do the procedural aspects of the application of the safeguard measures need to be specified, but also the rights of the interested parties."
"The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council under consideration constitutes the legal instrument for implementing the safeguard clause in the EU-Korea FTA."
"I think the bilateral safeguard clause of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement is insufficient, and it will not be effective in dealing with the disastrous and dramatic consequences that will arise from the signing of the Free Trade Agreement."
"Various sectors of the economy, such as textiles and agriculture, will be seriously damaged by this agreement, and the very fact that this clause needs to be included is proof of that."
"I was therefore unable to support this instrument, because although I feel that it could alleviate a small proportion of the negative consequences of the signing of the Free Trade Agreement that I am opposed to, I consider it to be insufficient and ineffective."
"in writing. - (DE) The Free Trade Agreement between the EU and North Korea contains a bilateral safeguard clause under which the most-favoured-nation duty rate can be reintroduced if, as a result of a liberalisation of trade flows, a product is imported in such increased volumes - either in absolute terms or in comparison with domestic production - and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause significant damage to a branch of the economy in the EU that produces equivalent or directly competing goods."
"The report contains important proposals for ensuring that this safeguard clause can actually be implemented in serious cases in order to avoid substantial damage to EU industry."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council implementing the bilateral safeguard clause of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement is, in my view, an important instrument designed to defend European production in sectors that are currently in danger of incurring serious difficulties because of the rise in imports from Korea."
"This situation, a consequence of the entry into force of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement, should provide for all customs barriers to be gradually and fully removed on a bilateral basis."
"I therefore voted in favour of this proposal, since its adoption is a necessary condition for the above-mentioned agreement to enter into force as planned on 1 July 2011."
"Safeguarding the free trade agreements between the two parties is essential for an increase in products made in Europe."
"I voted for this report because I consider the introduction of a bilateral safeguard clause to the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union (EU) and Korea to be very positive."
"This clause provides for the possibility of re-imposing the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate when, as a result of trade liberalisation, imports increase to such an extent - in absolute terms or in relation to domestic production - and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious damage to the Union's industry producing similar or directly competing products."
"I hope that the final draft of this mechanism will be clear and that actioning it will be easy and free of bureaucracy."
"I hope that the European Commission will monitor the implementation of this agreement and check compliance with this safeguard mechanism."
"in writing. - We seriously regret that MEPs have unquestioningly approved this problematic trade agreement."
"The far-reaching EU-Korea FTA sets a dangerous precedent for future EU trade policy, going far beyond mere tariff elimination to include sweeping market access provisions at the expense of social and environmental standards."
"Among the more odious provisions of the agreement, the EU succeeded in pushing Korea to massage its rules on CO2 emissions from vehicles in order to allow European car makers to export more big gas-guzzling cars to Korea."
"This arm-twisting by the EU, which has undermined the environmental integrity of Korea's vehicle emissions rules, is nothing short of scandalous."
"Worse, the EU is trying to spin this environmental loophole as allowing Europe's car industry laggards to 'compete fairly' in the Korean market with smaller, cleaner and more efficient Korean cars."
"I supported this report because I believe that the bilateral safeguard clause of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement is an effective tool for defending European production. In fact, it is predicted that this agreement's entry into force in July this year is liable to leave the European internal market in difficulties."
"The gradual removal of customs barriers on a bilateral basis will in fact result in a significant increase in imports from Korea."
"I am pleased to note that it will be possible to introduce specific measures even when the increase in imports into Europe is concentrated just in certain areas."
"This provision takes up the Italian request to introduce a genuine 'regional safeguard clause', applicable only in certain regions of the European Union."
"Shutting ourselves off from the international market today is a mere pipe dream: it is not only impossible but it would also be damaging."
"It assumes, however, that any opening must be balanced and gradual and takes account of the European Union's internal requirements."
"Protecting jobs remains a priority for Europe, as does the quality of the products placed on the market."
"It will only be possible to build economic relations of benefit to both parties if these fundamental criteria are respected."
"We are in favour of the bilateral safeguard clause of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement because it mitigates the damaging effects of this instrument."
"The purpose of this clause is to make it possible to suspend or reapply tariffs if it is believed that trade liberalisation has seriously damaged our industrial system."
"The safeguard clause may only be applied for a maximum of 10 years from the removal of customs tariffs."
"The introduction of this clause does not, of course, make us change our vote against the text of the Free Trade Agreement, which in any case will result in severe economic damage to our businesses."
"In the same way as I gave my support to the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement, I also voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation implementing its bilateral safeguard clause."
"In my view, it is a vital addition to the agreement, because it guarantees the reintroduction of customs duties in the event of a detrimental increase in imports of a particular product, and in this sense responds to the fears that we expressed during the debates held prior to its conclusion, in September 2009."
"The reimposition of the most-favoured-nation rate can be requested by the Member States, the European Parliament or European associations representing the industry concerned, thus ensuring that companies have a real opportunity to react."
"I am voting for this regulation because of the elements introduced in the new decision."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) can invest in projects essential to the EU: in particular, in combating climate change, in developing social, economic and environmental infrastructures, and in local business sector development."
"Another element of this regulation that I consider to be pertinent is the fact that the EIB can support EU presence in third countries through foreign direct investment, contributing to the promotion of new technology and to knowledge transfer."
"However, I consider it opportune to review the annual evaluations regarding access to loans, so as to promote transparency and speed up bureaucratic procedures."
"In short, the EIB can contribute effectively to EU development cooperation objectives."
"Fair and balanced distribution across the regions for the allocation of financing is crucial."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises should be a good way to stimulate economies to fight against unemployment."
"in writing. - I voted against the Kalfin report on granting EU guarantees to the EIB against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the EU."
"I am not satisfied with the level of transparency in lending to SMEs via intermediary financial institutions."
"It is not enough that only the EIB knows who gets these monies."
"These are very large loans that are being used ostensibly to further EU policy abroad and the taxpayer, who is the ultimate guarantor, has the right to know who the recipients are."
"Some of these loans go to worthy causes but, in this day and age, the taxpayer must know what is being done in his name and why."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this text because I think it is important for the EU to support the EIB with the aim of extending the funding of investment projects in third countries in order to achieve the European Union's foreign policy objectives."
"Activating the mandate of EUR 2 billion to fund measures to combat climate change offers significant potential support for countries in the Eastern Partnership, such as the Republic of Moldova."
"The Republic of Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and is severely affected every year by flooding disasters, which inflict significant losses on it."
"Therefore, the development of EU projects in this state coincides perfectly with the Union's priority to eradicate poverty."
"In addition, we must support the reform efforts which this country has recently undertaken."
"At the same time, one main objective of EU foreign policy, in accordance with Article 21(2) of the Treaty on European Union, is independence."
"The EU's energy independence will be guaranteed by the implementation of the Nabucco project."
"Consequently, the development of economic and political relations with the main suppliers, Iraq, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, is vital, and this decision contributes to this."
"This decision aims to keep the mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in place, specifically as regards the guarantee provided by the European Union against losses resulting from loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union."
"Under this decision, the EIB's mandate is also expanded in terms of competences, with new elements introduced that aim to direct the EIB's activities toward investment in projects that contribute to combating climate change, to developing social, economic and environmental infrastructure, and to developing the local private sector, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)."
"I want the EIB to continue with the excellent work that it has been doing, supporting numerous projects undertaken since it was set up."
"This report is on a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council granting a guarantee from the European Union (EU) to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union."
"The EIB's mandate expires in October."
"In addition to financing projects in the European Union, since 1963 the EIB has undertaken financing operations in outside regions, so contributing to the implementation of EU external objectives as regards cohesion and development policy."
"Therefore, so that there would not be a vacuum after October 2011, the parties initiated a series of meetings aimed at a consensus that would enable its adoption by the European Parliament and would not interrupt the aid granted by the EIB after that date."
"I agree with this proposal because it reflects better cooperation between the EU and EIB; it contributes to the struggle to eradicate poverty; it stimulates small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as local communities; it introduces greater transparency; it promotes sound practices at the EIB; it increases funding for projects combating climate change; and it makes countries that do not pay attention to environmental issues ineligible."
"The decision of Parliament and of the Council intends to grant a European Union (EU) guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the EU."
"The objectives of these EIB projects, currently being carried out in a number of countries on different continents, focus on development cooperation and aid."
"Where these objectives and the projects that serve them relate to genuine cooperation, taking into account the interests, priorities and specific conditions of the countries where they are taking place, we value them, naturally."
"Nevertheless, whilst this financing for local development projects is positive, we cannot fail to be very critical of the attempt - clear in Article 1 - to make them subordinate to or conditional on the guiding principles of European external policy, ascribing secondary importance to the real development needs of third countries, limiting their capacity for administration and legitimate options, interfering with and pressuring their political decisions, and threatening their sovereignty and independence."
"I am taking advantage of the vote on this report on EIB financing of projects outside the European Union to denounce a very serious matter to which European shipbuilders have drawn our attention: that a public bank is financing the construction of vessels in Korea by a shipyard which charges rock-bottom prices and which benefited from a public bail out a few years ago."
"While it may not seem all that illogical for the European Investment Bank to support, through its loans and guarantees, the Union's external policies, it is completely unacceptable for it to undermine European economic interests and contribute to the deindustrialisation of our countries."
"The Commission and the Member States must react."
"In addition to its core mission of financing investment in the European Union, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has, since 1963, undertaken financing operations outside the EU in support of the EU's external policies, particularly in the field of development cooperation."
"The aim of the proposed EU guarantee for the 2011-2013 period is to allow the EIB to finance investments outside the EU without affecting its credit rating."
"The proposal also contains a number of new elements, for example activation of the EUR 2 billion 'optional mandate' for combating climate change in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy, the introduction of new horizontal goals, and the expansion of the group of countries eligible for EIB loans."
"The proposal also calls for greater transparency, the evaluation of concrete results and the involvement of the European Court of Auditors in auditing the transactions in question."
"The proposal rightly includes arrangements for the EIB to act in such matters in accordance with the principles of aid effectiveness outlined in the European Consensus on Development and also Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Paris Declaration of 2005 and the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008."
"Overall, I believe that the report submitted by my colleague Ivailo Kalfin provides a detailed analysis of the given issues, makes reference to the relevant EU legislation and also contains relevant recommendations with respect to monitoring the effectiveness of the proposed guarantee, and I therefore recommend approving it in its proposed form."
"in writing. - I voted for the Kalfin report on the new external mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB), providing for an increase in its budget from EUR 27.8 billion to EUR 29.567 billion until the end of 2013 and expanding its fields of competence to climate change action and the advancement of development goals for countries outside the EU."
"I believe the EIB should focus much more attention on social problems and building capacity in the countries in which it operates."
"The European Union provides the European Investment Bank (EIB) with a budgetary guarantee to cover risks of a political and sovereign nature in connection with its loan and loan guarantee operations for projects carried out outside the EU."
"This EU guarantee is an effective means of combining EU budgetary funds with the EIB's own resources, while ensuring that the EIB's financial health is not affected."
"The EIB has made great progress in implementing its mandate: it has strengthened its coordination with the Commission and shifted its focus towards support for the EU's political objectives."
"The development of its external action will now have to be reflected in an increase in the volume and quality of loans and a diversification of new recipients (local authorities)."
"The EIB should immediately be given an additional EUR 500 million mandate for microcredit financing to increase access for the poorest people to bank finance in eligible countries."
"On the question of internal organisation, the EIB should gradually be encouraged to divide up all its external activities on a geographic basis so as to better adapt to the specific requirements of each area and promote the participation of partner countries."
"The EIB has not fulfilled the minimum conditions to assure us that its investments will be socially, environmentally and even ethically responsible."
"The repeated scandals concerning the financing of offshore subsidiaries do not seem to worry the Commission, any more than dictatorships do, provided that, as in Libya's case, they are financially worthwhile."
"As for environmental and social issues, they are of no interest to this report."
"It proposes that we support such harmful projects as Desertec and Invest in Med."
"I voted against this text."
"In addition to its core mission of financing investment in the European Union, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has, since 1963, undertaken financing operations outside the European Union in support of the Union's external policies, enabling the EU budget funds available to the external regions to be complemented by the financial strength of the EIB for the benefit of recipient countries."
"In so doing, the EIB contributes to the general guiding principles and policy objectives of the European Union, including the development of third countries and the prosperity of the Union in the changed global economic climate."
"The EIB operations in support of the Union's external policies must continue to be conducted in accordance with the principles of sound banking practices."
"The majority of its operations in external regions have benefited from an EU budgetary guarantee administered by the Commission with a view to supporting the EU's external action, and enabling the EIB to finance investments outside the EU without affecting its credit standing."
"This additional guarantee makes it possible for the EIB to continue with its investment policy, which is of great benefit to the world economy."
"To support the EU's foreign policy the European Investment Bank also finances projects outside the territory of the EU, such as in the area of development cooperation."
"The guarantee fund established in 2009 is intended to guarantee the liquidity of the EIB in the event of payment defaults."
"Following the assessment and evaluation, the list of countries eligible for EIB financing was expanded - with a corresponding adjustment of the financial framework."
"I am not entirely in agreement with all of the amendments proposed and I therefore abstained from voting."
"This report is about a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union."
"In fact, the EIB also finances projects in outside regions, contributing to the realisation of EU external objectives as regards cohesion and development policy."
"This proposal reflects better cooperation between the EU and EIB; it contributes to the struggle to eradicate poverty; it stimulates small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as local communities; it introduces greater transparency; it promotes sound practices at the EIB; it increases funding for projects combating climate change; and it makes countries that disregard environmental issues ineligible."
"I am voting for this report and I support the strengthening of the EIB's external mission, which I would like to see accompanied by enhanced parliamentary oversight, in order to uphold the democratic legitimacy of the EIB's operations."
"The EIB should step up its reporting back to Parliament on all aspects under its external mandate, from overall policy to practical implementation, including assessment of social, environmental and human rights criteria."
"in writing. - Article 208 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that the EU must 'take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries'."
"This is a commitment from the EU to avoid policy choices that undermine its salutary work in the field of development cooperation and, indeed, to pursue actions, across the policy spectrum, that will benefit developing countries. This applies to all EU institutions, including the EIB."
"The vast majority of eligible countries under the EIB's external mandate are developing countries."
"Consequently, it is fundamental that the underlying objectives of the EIB's external mandate should explicitly target poverty reduction."
"In addition, the EIB must align its external activities with the European consensus on development."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe it draws attention to a subject that is very seldom in the news."
"In addition to its core mission of financing investment in the European Union itself, the European Investment Bank (EIB) undertakes financing operations outside the European Union in support of the EU's external policies."
"This allows the EU budget funds available to the external regions to be complemented by the financial strength of the EIB for the benefit of beneficiary countries. In so doing, the EIB contributes to the general guiding principles and policy objectives of the European Union, including the development of third countries and the EU's prosperity in the changed global economic circumstances."
"The EIB's operations in support of the Union's external policies must continue to be conducted in accordance with the principles of sound banking practice."
"The goal of the document in question, voted on today in the European Parliament, is to ensure the granting of an European Union guarantee to the European Investment Bank (EIB) against losses under loans and guarantees for projects outside the European Union."
"The ceiling set for the EIB under this guarantee is EUR 27.8 billion for the remainder of the current period, 2007-2013."
"In addition to this aspect, Parliament's proposal seeks certain amendments to improve the EIB's work outside the EU, such as the activation of EUR 2 billion available for combating climate change."
"Improving access to EIB financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), increasing the transparency of its operations, and introducing greater flexibility in terms of risk-capital investment are other new measures proposed by Parliament."
"The intention is also to replace the current system of regional objectives with a programme of horizontal objectives, and to implement a mandate for relations with countries such as Iceland, Libya, Iraq and Cambodia."
"I support the European Parliament's position and the external activity of the EIB, although I would stress the regrettable fact that financing projects outside the European Union often harms competitiveness within the EU in cases of direct competition."
"in writing. - (DE) Through its financing outside the Union the European Investment Bank makes a contribution to the realisation of EU foreign policy."
"I voted in favour of Mr Kalfin's report, because I particularly welcome the EUR 2 billion for the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as the express promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Moreover, the report calls for comprehensive obligations in respect of information and transparency for citizens, Parliament and the Commission."
"The rights of Parliament have been taken into consideration, which is something that I also consider to be absolutely essential."
"in writing. - (SK) The European Union has a commitment to solidarity, which arises directly from our Christian heritage."
"Even those who would like to eliminate Christianity from the public space recognize that the EU must contribute to development aid."
"This solidarity, however, is directly derived from Christian teachings on the dignity of every human being and the moral imperative to help those in need."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) has become an important instrument of the Union for eradicating poverty in less developed regions."
"As such, its primary purpose is to provide assistance, and to this end it needs financial guarantees."
"On the other hand, it should remain a bank, that is, an institution, which does not spend the funds entrusted on it, but invests them effectively."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report on providing a guarantee to the EIB."
"I am voting for this recommendation as the South Korean market offers new trade opportunities, not least in the agricultural and service sectors."
"The Republic of South Korea is currently one of the most profitable export markets for EU farmers, with annual sales in excess of EUR 1 billion."
"As regards services, specifically financial and legal, telecommunications, environmental and maritime transportation services, it is estimated that the volume of transactions will increase by 70%."
"Moreover, the Free Trade Agreement stipulates an effective and clear safeguard mechanism in the interests of EU industries, contributing to the growth of European industry."
"in writing. - I voted for the Sturdy report recommendation on the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Korea because it will increase trade and is advantageous to the United Kingdom and the other twenty six European Nations."
"The most important factor in this agreement is the safeguard clause without which I could not have voted for it."
"The bilateral safeguard mechanism will permit the EU to revert to the prior MFN rates of duty if this agreement even threatens to damage our industry."
"The agreement opens up our service industry, agriculture and manufacturing industries to increased access to the large and growing Korean market."
"This is an extremely important vote for the European Union's new international trade strategy."
"In fact, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea is the first example of a new generation of agreements that aim at lowering trade and non-trade barriers and expanding investment prospects in the partner country."
"As soon as it was signed in October 2009, the agreement was received with fierce criticism from the European motor industry, which felt it was being severely penalised by certain clauses conceded to the Korean partner, duty drawback in particular."
"Those concerns have now been partly dissipated, not least due to Parliament's work on the attached regulation on the safeguard clause annexed to the agreement and to a clarification by the South Korean Government on the amendments to internal legislation on carbon emissions."
"Today, therefore, we confirmed the vote of the Committee on International Trade in order to allow the procedure to be completed, given that the Council has already agreed to it."
"The Free Trade Agreement between the EU and South Korea will yield immediate, general benefits for many economic sectors in the EU, even though it will highlight the vulnerability of some."
"Furthermore, it will establish strict dispute resolution and safeguard procedures and provide monitoring intended to ensure that European companies have an adequate degree of security."
"The Korean market obviously offers significant opportunities for EU goods and services, but has remained until now relatively closed off due to high tariffs and costly non-tariff barriers."
"The agreement will succeed in quickly removing almost EUR 2 billion worth of EU export duties levied annually on exporters of industrial and agricultural products."
"It will generate immediate, substantial savings in several economic sectors."
"The benefits will become even more evident in the agricultural and services sectors as Korea is one of the most valuable export markets in the world for EU farmers, with annual sales in excess of EUR 1 billion."
"Against this background, all that remains for me is to welcome the adoption of the EU-Korea Agreement in the European Parliament, and I hope that there will be as many such free trade agreements as possible, starting with Canada and the US and ending with the BRIC states."
"South Korea is the fourth most important market for the European Union's exports outside Europe."
"However, European exporters faced tariff barriers and regulatory obstacles when trying to take their products into the country."
"The current Free Trade Agreement is the most comprehensive one ever negotiated by the Union, lifting charges on almost all products and expanding the range of services covered by it."
"It is positive in all senses and enables both parties to make significant gains."
"European exports to South Korea are expected to increase by more than 80%."
"I hope that European companies, and those of my country in particular, will be able to take advantage of the opportunities that will emerge from the opening up of this market."
"Three years ago, the European Parliament adopted a resolution aiming to improve the European business sector's access to foreign markets."
"We are now being called on to adopt a Free Trade Agreement that, in practice, makes it possible for the European Union's companies to access the South Korean market - which, as we know, is important for Europe - by increasing exports and so creating jobs."
"As the first in a series of trade agreements to be established following the Treaty of Lisbon and the first use of codecision powers, this represents significant innovation as regards bilateral respect for International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards, compliance with legislation on public procurement, the transparency of state aid and the implementation of sustainable development."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which represents a set of new opportunities for the European Union - previously closed off due to the tariffs being applied and which defends business interests with the added value of the 'safeguard clause'; in other words, the re--imposition of customs duties."
"Having voted against it, we view the adoption of this report with concern."
"We have many times decried in Parliament the disastrous consequences of the liberalisation of world trade for many economic sectors, particularly in some Member States, such as Portugal, and the regions most dependent on these sectors."
"In this case, the following sectors are of particular concern: textiles, automobiles and related components, and electronics."
"However, the agreement also covers agricultural products, promoting intensive, environmentally unsustainable production models; models that are at odds with local production and consumption, which are needed to safeguard food sovereignty and safety."
"We are faced with the largest free trade agreement concluded by the European Union in many years, which is now intended to function as a first step in concluding a 'new generation of bilateral new business agreements'."
"The Commission's analysis of these agreements is always in terms of millions of euros earned by economic groups and multinationals."
"It is important to do the same for the number of jobs lost, which the rapporteur assumes is inevitable; for the number of small and medium-sized enterprises which have gone bankrupt; or even for the number of tonnes of CO2 emitted because of the increased flows of energy and goods that these agreements involve."
"It is interesting to see where the EU's much-vaunted environment/climate commitments stop in these cases..."
"I voted in favour of the report on the safeguard clause that accompanies the Free Trade Agreement with Korea, even though it seems inadequate and its implementation uncertain."
"On the other hand, I voted against the agreement itself."
"Opening our borders without protection to imports that are in direct competition with our products is suicidal, particularly in the automotive sector."
"The explanatory statement in the Sturdy report, which claims that this will have only a minimal effect on employment while at the same time anticipating the large-scale mobilisation of all the European Union's instruments so as to lessen the impact of job losses, is both extremely inconsistent and extremely cynical."
"in writing. - (DE) In voting through Mr Sturdy's report the Members of the European Parliament have sent out a clear signal."
"We have today approved by a large majority the most extensive Free Trade Agreement negotiated by the EU to date."
"That represents a clear YES to the European economy and a clear YES to Europe as a base for economic activity."
"With EUR 1.6 billion of duty saved and a EUR 19 billion increase in the volume of trade, the benefits are obvious."
"In particular, the agricultural sector can expect to save EUR 380 million in duty."
"This opens up new export opportunities for our domestic farmers."
"I voted in favour of the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement."
"in writing. - I warmly welcome the approval of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement."
"The deal is expected to more than double bilateral trade in the next 20 years."
"Import duties will be eliminated on 98% of all products and other non-tariff barriers will be removed over the next five years."
"The Agreement includes important social, labour and environmental standards, and I hope the implementation of these will be closely monitored."
"I would like to add some comments in respect of my own position regarding the process for drafting the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and the Republic of Korea, and the accompanying fears and expectations of the industries affected and other parties."
"This dramatically changes the long-standing trade rules between the EU and Korea."
"Only in the long term will it be possible to make a realistic assessment of the impact of the agreement."
"It is only the findings and calculations made over a longer period of time that will reveal the economic situation of the two parties, the bilateral improvement in the trade balance, or the contribution made to improvements in the social situation."
"The total volume and range of mutually-traded products must be monitored and assessed closely and in a coordinated manner, together with their certified quality and verifiable place of origin."
"Any direct application of the previously-mentioned safeguard mechanisms based on the bilateral safeguard clauses of the EU-South Korea FTA would be a very sensitive matter, and the result could contrast sharply with the euphoria surrounding the adoption of this agreement."
"This Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is designed to provide EU businesses with a wide variety of economic sectors with extensive and broader access to the South Korean market through a series of unprecedented tariff liberalisations."
"Being the first step in a new generation of bilateral FTAs, this agreement contains important innovations such as a chapter on sustainable development which obliges both parties to respect core International Labour Organization standards and creates a peer review based system to deal with complaints for non-compliance, as well as establishing several working groups and monitoring committees to ensure quality implementation and conciliation."
"I welcome this FTA because it is the most comprehensive ever negotiated by the European Union."
"I reject and regret the establishment of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Korea, as I consider that, being one of the major trade agreements signed by the EU in recent years, it deepens the negative consequences of the global liberalisation of trade by responding to the multi-millionaire interests of the big European multinationals without taking into account the serious economic, social, employment and environmental consequences of it being adopted under the terms given."
"Therefore, as the rapporteur acknowledges, this agreement will mean the irreversible destruction of numerous jobs for thousands of workers in Europe, in very sensitive economic and strategic sectors such as agriculture or the textile industry."
"This agreement is another step backwards in terms of the need to move towards food sovereignty and security, which requires the EU to promote and make a firm commitment to local markets and agricultural products."
"This agreement forces European farmers to compete with agricultural imports for which the production methods have not been required to comply with the most basic workers' rights or to comply with minimum health and quality standards."
"I took care to familiarise myself with the agreements, and I consider that many of its clauses are incomplete and superficial."
"In this context, there are parts that could be interpreted ambiguously."
"For example, the rules on public procurement let the most important questions, associated with competition and abuse, go begging."
"It is, of course, essential to increase the process of cooperation with the Far East."
"Nevertheless, superficial and imprecise wording leads one to suspect that this work has not been brought to a conclusion."
"I voted against."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Republic of Korea."
"Firstly, in order to achieve more effective cooperation between the EU and Korea it is important to remove existing trade barriers, which have hitherto isolated the Korean market."
"The entry into force of this agreement will create favourable conditions for economic growth and the creation of new jobs."
"A favourable business environment will be created for growing, competitive EU companies to access South Korea, where many new opportunities are opening up for EU trade and services, increasing companies' volume of trade and reducing export costs."
"Given the predicted future development of trade between the EU and South Korea, this will save a lot of money collected from customs duties, particularly in the chemical, industrial and pharmaceutical sectors."
"Furthermore, it will ensure fair competition in the car manufacturing, consumer electronics and textile sectors, where Korea has a comparative advantage over the EU."
"In addition, liberalising export tariffs will be of great benefit to the agricultural and services sectors."
"I welcome the fact that the agreement pays significant attention to sustainable development."
"The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) concluded between the EU-27, on the one hand, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), on the other, aims to improve European companies' access to the South Korean market through a series of unprecedented tariff liberalisations."
"I voted in favour because the agreement is overall very positive and enables both parties to make significant gains, with European exports to South Korea expected to rise by more than 80%."
"I hope that Portuguese companies too can make use of this window of opportunity, specifically in the agricultural and services sectors, areas in which the advantages are particularly impressive."
"In fact, South Korea is currently one of the most profitable export markets in the world for European Union farmers, with annual sales in excess of EUR 1 billion."
"The FTA will fully liberalise almost all the EU's agricultural exports, enabling the agricultural industry to save EUR 380 million;"
"I cannot fail to welcome this."
"in writing. - We seriously regret that MEPs have unquestioningly approved this problematic trade agreement."
"The far-reaching EU-Korea FTA sets a dangerous precedent for future EU trade policy, going far beyond mere tariff elimination to include sweeping market access provisions at the expense of social and environmental standards."
"Among the more odious provisions of the agreement, the EU succeeded in pushing Korea to massage its rules on CO2 emissions from vehicles in order to allow European car makers to export more big gas-guzzling cars to Korea."
"This arm-twisting by the EU, which has undermined the environmental integrity of Korea's vehicle emissions rules, is nothing short of scandalous."
"Worse, the EU is trying to spin this environmental loophole as allowing Europe's car industry laggards to 'compete fairly' in the Korean market with smaller, cleaner and more efficient Korean cars."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation because I feel it takes a balanced view of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement."
"Until now the South Korean market place has remained relatively closed off due to high tariff levies and costly non-tariff barriers, but it will soon be able to offer significant new opportunities for EU goods and services."
"The Free Trade Agreement will quickly remove EUR 1.6 billion worth of EU export duties levied annually on EU exporters of industrial and agricultural products, with the comparable figure for South Korean exporters standing at EUR 1.1 billion."
"It will be important, however, to carefully monitor the volume of goods coming from that country, so that we can make use of the safeguard clause in the event that it increases excessively and threatens European jobs."
"We strongly oppose this Free Trade Agreement with the Republic of Korea because it would present our Korean competitors with undue competitive advantages."
"Korea could easily export cars, for instance, and European manufacturers would find themselves at a disadvantage, since 95% of the cars purchased in Korea are manufactured there."
"The removal of tariff barriers would play against the interests of our productive sectors."
"The only clause that can be applied to mitigate the disadvantages is the one that can lead to the adoption of emergency measures."
"Temporary emergency measures, such as suspending the tariff cuts, can be adopted in the event that serious damage is caused to European producers."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Korea because it will genuinely benefit European businesses."
"Indeed, their exports to Korea should increase by almost 40%, and exports of industrial and agricultural products will be exempted from customs duties amounting to some EUR 1.6 billion per year."
"What is more, it will be possible to limit any adverse effects on the European economy thanks to the implementation of a safeguard clause."
"Lastly, this agreement crowns the new generation of free trade agreements in that it contains a chapter on sustainable development which commits the two parties to respect ILO conventions, as well as provisions laying down conditions for the genuine involvement of civil society."
"in writing. - I want to congratulate the two rapporteurs - Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain - for guiding us through the complicated adoption procedure for the Free Trade Agreement itself, as well as the important safeguard clause."
"The EU-South Korea FTA is the most comprehensive and ambitious agreement of its type that the EU has concluded so far."
"It covers many areas beneficial to EU producers and consumers, such as the elimination of tariffs on EU exports of industrial and agricultural goods, improved market access for EU services suppliers, the removal of non-tariff barriers in electronics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, enhanced access to government procurement, protection of intellectual property rights, improved market access for EU car manufacturers and, very importantly and thanks to the safeguard clause, the protection of European car manufacturers against any imbalances that may occur in the sector in the future."
"I hope this agreement will be a model for many other FTAs that are in prospect - with Canada, Singapore and MERCOSUR, for example."
"At the same time, I congratulate Parliament on the use of its new powers, this being the first FTA to which we are giving our consent under the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the European Union (EU) needs to respond rapidly since Egypt can play a key role, both in efforts for peace in the Middle East and in reshaping mentalities in this region of the world."
"In order to achieve this, I consider it essential that the EU review its neighbourhood policy."
"We also need to mobilise and review current instruments so as to assist social, political and economic reforms, and strengthen cooperation with civil society organisations, inasmuch as events in Egypt and other countries have highlighted the need for policies and instruments that are more ambitious."
"The EU's efforts should focus on strengthening the rule of law, on good governance, on combating corruption, and on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, so as to ensure the creation of the proper conditions for a stable democracy to emerge."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which I believe is fair and balanced."
"The people of Egypt are seeing their legitimate expectations met."
"Mr Mubarak's departure is an essential condition, but it is not enough to ensure that Egypt embarks on a path towards democracy and human rights."
"The transition is being overseen by the army, which has given itself six months to rise to this challenge."
"During the 18 days of demonstrations that led to this result, Egypt suffered financial losses, and they are becoming worse each day."
"The European Union must offer its support to Egypt so that the achievements of the revolution are not destroyed by a harsh economic and social crisis."
"So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results, and this has not done much for the EU's image."
"However, our role remains crucial."
"We should not criticise ourselves unfairly."
"Revolutions are peculiar in that they always seem inevitable after the fact but impossible before it."
"However, self-criticism is justifiable, and we are on the right track, since the Council and the Commission have demonstrated their desire to radically rethink the European neighbourhood policy."
"The last few weeks have been historic."
"In this sense, after Tunisia, what has just taken place in Egypt is a source of great hope, especially among young people."
"The European Union must size up the situation and support the democratic process without prevaricating."
"Furthermore, these events should be an incentive for us to overhaul our partnership agreements so that we do not remain on the fringes of the movement."
"The European Parliament must strive to ensure that our words and deeds are aligned in a comprehensible and identifiable European policy towards Egypt and the whole of the region."
"I would express my solidarity with the Egyptian people, and congratulate them on their courage and determination, especially the younger generations, in their struggle for their legitimate democratic aspirations."
"I condemn the violence and disproportionate force used against the protesters."
"I deeply regret the high numbers of dead and injured, and extend my condolences to the families of the victims."
"There needs to be a dialogue with all the political and social forces that respect democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"These are fundamental principles of the European Union and constitute a common basis for the development of the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"I call for an independent enquiry into the incidents that led to deaths, injuries and imprisonments, and for those responsible to be brought to justice."
"I call for the immediate and unconditional release of all peaceful protesters, prisoners of conscience and human rights defenders, both Egyptian and those from other countries, as well as journalists and jurists."
"I call on the EU to revise its policy to support democracy and human rights, so as to create a mechanism for implementing the human rights clause in all agreements with third countries."
"Firstly, I should like to say that I welcome the broad consensus achieved in Parliament on the joint motion for a resolution just adopted."
"It is a show of unity regarding the fundamental values that we defend as a Union of peoples and countries, which I would not like to go unmentioned."
"Secondly, I hope that the transition between Egypt's old regime and its future democracy will take place peacefully, sensitively, and with broad-based agreement between the various political, civilian, military and religious players in this important Middle Eastern country."
"Thirdly, I hope that this historic moment will serve as a positive response to the people's true desires: freedom, democracy, and the combating of corruption, unemployment and social exclusion."
"Finally, I would restate that the future of this region requires solid, tolerant democracies, which respect minorities and in which the state is pledged to all and not abused by the few."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the situation in Egypt because I believe that the European Union should express its solidarity with the Egyptian people in their legitimate democratic aspirations and support a rapid transition to true democracy."
"In order to achieve this, the EU must support Egypt in tackling the economic and social difficulties that it is experiencing, with a view to a lasting democratisation process that involves all of civil society."
"in writing. - (PT) In the same way as when the Berlin Wall came down, the international community and press, and even the leading countries' intelligence and security services, were taken by surprise by events that they were unable to predict, and which call into question many notions and theories on politics in the Middle East, as well as the region's very stability."
"Its strategic importance puts Egypt right at the heart of this change and whatever takes places there will have a decisive influence on the region's other countries."
"It is still far too early to say what direction will be taken by this force that led thousands of people onto the streets demanding the end of regimes that had been in power for decades in their respective countries."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the European Union cannot be indifferent to its development or ignore what is happening on its borders."
"We must seek to help those who are struggling to establish democracy and the rule of law, and who reject the dichotomy between militarised secular regimes or radical Islamist revolutionaries."
"Last week, following a number of days of popular unrest, we witnessed the resignation of President Mubarak of Egypt, who had governed the country for more than 30 years."
"I would join the European Union in congratulating the Egyptian people, who fought hard for democratic change."
"The EU now has a great task in monitoring the political and social transformations in Egypt, not least the revision of the Constitution, and the holding of free and fair elections without human rights violations."
"However, it also has the obligation to support the Egyptian people with funding, so as to promote the necessary economic development."
"I agree with this motion for a resolution and hope that the transition from a dictatorial to a democratic regime in Egypt takes place quickly and peacefully, as it is a nation that could play a crucial role as a mediator with a view to establishing lasting peace in the Middle East."
"Although they just relate to the circumstances, the words in this motion for a resolution that refer to 'solidarity with the Egyptian people', that welcome their 'courage and determination, especially that of the younger generations', whilst firmly supporting 'their legitimate democratic aspirations' are positive."
"The majority of the European Parliament, which until now pointed to Egypt as an example of stability in the region, is now obliged to applaud the actions of the Egyptians aimed at breaking from this 'stability'."
"The demonstrations by Egyptians that led to Hosni Mubarak's resignation are an example of the immense possibilities for democratic victories by groups alienated by capitalism, and by the forces and regimes that serve it."
"The Egyptian people have demonstrated with great tenacity and combative unity that it is possible to achieve resignations, and move forward towards winning political and democratic freedoms, even in a country profoundly dominated by imperialist interests, particularly those of the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom."
"Until it is finally overthrown, imperialism will never admit defeat or give up."
"Despite their fine words, the forces that defend their interests in Parliament are counterattacking, assuming the right to interfere and, hypocritically, wanting to give lessons on democracy through their political 'parties and foundations'."
"After Tunisia, now it is Egypt's turn, with further protests spreading throughout the Middle East."
"Now that the geopolitical map of the Mediterranean and probably the balance of world power are changing, the European Union needs to bring its foreign policy up to date by reviewing and improving its strategy for providing political and financial assistance for democratic transition in countries, including support for the organisation of free elections."
"The European Union should take action to support the Egyptian people with every financial assistance instrument as well as initiatives to promote democracy and defend human rights."
"Similarly, we need to monitor the situation that has come about in the Mediterranean, particularly on the Italian coast, where 4 000 landings were recorded in just four days."
"These figures echo the exodus that took place on a biblical scale in the 1990s, when unseaworthy boats brought hordes of dispossessed people from Albania to the Adriatic coast."
"The Italian Government's declaration of a state of emergency is, in my view, an important and necessary decision, but it is only the first step, because there is a real fear that Egypt and Algeria may be affected after Tunisia."
"This is a problem that Italy is not in a position to cope with alone: it is therefore up to Europe as a whole to examine countermeasures, to take direct action, and to provide hope at home for those who are tempted to set off on the wave of feeling that is sweeping through the Maghreb countries."
"in writing. - The EU and particularly the European Parliament took too long to respond to and address the warning signs of political and social turmoil in Egypt - leading ultimately to the geopolitical debacle of the last three weeks - and this in relation to a region that is very close to it and despite the fact that stability in the Mediterranean basin is essential for political well-being, economic strength and security in Europe itself."
"At this point there is a dire need for strong leadership from the European institutions: leadership that must be coupled with a pragmatic, integrated and holistic approach geared to restoring stability and security to the region."
"It is up to the EU to be proactive and aid in Egypt's political transition to a democratic system of governance."
"Following the unprecedented wave of revolutionary movements currently sweeping through the countries of the southern Mediterranean and which, in Tunisia and Egypt, have led to the fall of the government, the European Union must rethink its vision and its relations with those countries."
"Although it was a little late in coming, the joint motion for a resolution that we adopted today, Thursday 17 February 2011, was necessary, because it sends a strong message to the Egyptian people, by showing them that the European Union supports them in their aspirations and is ready to assist their efforts to turn their country into a democracy and to support them in their economic development."
"The events in Egypt may be termed historic, as they involve the crumbling of a particular political model that has permeated the whole country for two decades."
"This has happened, unfortunately, at the cost of a considerable number of people injured or killed during the demonstrations and clashes for the sake of the freedom they so desired."
"Through this motion for a resolution, this House wishes to extend its solidarity to the Egyptian people and to praise the courage and determination of the young protesters, who have certainly played a key role this month."
"With President Mubarak's resignation, Egypt finds itself in the position of a free country, but one that is entirely in need of reconstruction."
"The European Parliament's intention is to be able to come to their aid by appealing, for example, for talks between the political parties to be set up as soon as possible in order to find the best way to combat corruption and violations of the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of information, so as to lay the foundations for the rule of law."
"We are also calling on the High Representative to promote the setting-up of a task force, with Parliament's assistance, to help forge a new reality consistent with the principles of a democratic state."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, although I cannot quite get the strong smell of hypocrisy, on the part of the EU institutions, out of my nostrils."
"The Egyptian issue is very serious, bearing in mind the size of the country and its geographical position."
"Cyprus has always maintained good neighbourly relations with Egypt and its potential contribution to developments should not be underestimated."
"What is important is that the present crisis should result in the creation of a democratic regime and rule of law and the creation of a hardcore Muslim state that will destabilise the region should be avoided."
"Egypt has always stood out in the Middle East for its positive contributions towards resolving problems in the area."
"The European Union must continue to develop a genuine foreign policy that is consistent and effective with regard to its partners, and it is crucial that it speak decisively, with one strong voice, reiterating their call for the defence of human rights to become a reality."
"Egypt is a key partner for the European Union in the Arab world, and plays an active and crucial role in supporting the Middle East Peace Process and reconciliation between all sections of Palestinian society."
"We must therefore express our solidarity with the Egyptian people, support their legitimate democratic aspirations, and condemn all forms of violence as well as the disproportionate force used against protesters, while lamenting the high numbers of dead and injured."
"Having reached this point, the Egyptian authorities must put an immediate end to further violence, as it is not a solution for any of the problems expressed by the Egyptian people in their protests The Egyptian authorities and the security forces now have an obligation to ensure the security of all citizens and their property, as well as to protect the cultural heritage."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution in order to show my unconditional support for the peoples who are fighting for their rights, and in this particular case for the Egyptian people in their fight against authoritarianism and the deplorable political, social and economic conditions that they have been subjected to for the last 30 years by the regime led by President Mubarak."
"I also support the strong condemnation of violence and the use of force against peaceful protests."
"Despite my support, I do not agree with a large proportion of the resolution, as I deplore the European Union's interfering attitude and its desire to take charge of the transition towards democracy."
"I believe that the Egyptian people alone are responsible for defining their future, and that they should be able to do so without the intrusion of external players, who in many cases are only seeking to defend privileges acquired with and through the support of the illegitimate authoritarian regime."
"I also deplore the fact that the resolution does not include clear, firm self-criticism of the European Union, as through its current neighbourhood and trade policies it has supported and made possible the Mubarak regime in recent years."
"As Khaled Hroub wrote, the Arab spring has shown that freedom and dignity are aspirations shared by all human beings, all nations and all peoples."
"We must not forget that the initial requests made by the populations that revolted were social: the people of Egypt, like the people of Tunisia for that matter, are requesting a better distribution of wealth and a future."
"The populations are being driven to change their living conditions for economic, social and political reasons."
"They want a 'fair' and democratic State in which there is a fair distribution of wealth and they have access to healthcare and education."
"The only way to respond to this is to organise elections, more or less in a hurry, even though the (former) opposition is very unorganised."
"The people's political rights must be guaranteed, but so must their economic and social rights."
"Therefore, the European response must consist in building a democracy but also economic development, so as to help as many people as possible."
"The EU should introduce a policy for genuinely supporting the democratic process and should play a leading role in this matter."
"Before expressing solidarity with the Egyptian people, we must understand what gave rise to this process."
"According to data in my possession, radical Islamists are behind this destabilisation."
"I am decidedly against chaos in the Arab world."
"I am opposed to financial aid for any kind of extremism or disorder."
"Parliament has been overhasty in announcing financial support for the protesters, many of whom were openly displaying anti-Semitic slogans."
"Members' callous and emotional spasm could be interpreted in the Arab world as an incitement to disorder."
"The Iraq war and the dual power situation in Pakistan are enough."
"We must be considered and pragmatic when it comes to Islamic countries."
"I voted against."
"The EU needs to revise its naïve expectations of Arab efforts to achieve democracy."
"Amongst all the celebrations of the 'Arab spring', Brussels now needs to acknowledge that the changes in Tunisia and Egypt are not only devouring hundreds of millions of euros in local aid payments, but are also becoming apparent to the citizens of Europe in the form of thousands of economic migrants who have already come to Europe."
"After all, the people of Tunisia and Egypt took to the streets not just to achieve democracy and freedom of speech, but also and above all because they want greater prosperity."
"Such prosperity will not come about overnight, and therefore we can expect a further increase in the stream of economic migrants leaving North Africa."
"Some more of these will come to Europe, particularly since there has been a real explosion in the population of Arab countries over the past two to three decades."
"The EU will also be judged by whether it continues to respect democratic elections when Islamists come to power."
"In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood, which could potentially win 30% of the vote, is the only well-organised opposition force; the EU should have no illusions here, but should instead give serious consideration to how it will deal with an electoral victory by Islamists."
"Since the text essentially takes these circumstances into account, I have voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (DE) The motion for a resolution welcomes the reforms in favour of democracy, the rule of law and social equity in Egypt."
"It calls for emergency rule to be lifted, for government to lead responsibly, for corruption to be combated and human rights and basic freedoms to be respected in Egypt, including freedom of conscience, religion and thought, freedom of speech as well as freedom of the press and the media."
"The aim is a rapid transition to a peaceful, democratic and pluralistic Egypt."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"Recent events in Egypt and Tunisia have shown that the idea that society in Arab countries is not capable of accepting democracy is erroneous."
"Working on this mistaken assumption, the European Union - and almost all other global political forces - placed the stability of the region above the right of the people of the Arab world to decide their own future."
"That policy has proved mistaken."
"It is to be hoped that the effects of that mistake will not be too serious."
"We must, today, take action to mitigate these effects."
"Mistakes, unfortunately, have to be put right."
"One step resulting from this motion for a resolution should be the freezing of assets belonging to Egyptian leaders responsible for the embezzlement of state funds in Egypt."
"Therefore, I appeal to all Member States to do to everything possible to achieve this."
"The next few months will be decisive for Egypt."
"The European Parliament should give every possible assistance to Egypt's nascent civil society and democratic institutions."
"Support for free and democratic elections should be a priority."
"For the next few years, we should be guided by one objective."
"Democracy in Egypt is an excellent long-term investment, which will bring dividends both to the citizens of Egypt and to the people of Europe."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Egypt in order to give full voice to the European Parliament, which - in line with the statements by Baroness Ashton, President Van Rompuy and President Barroso - applauds the courage of the Egyptian people and extends its solidarity to them."
"The European Union will now have the task of monitoring the situation and seeking to support political dialogue through the neighbourhood policy, in order to guarantee a transition to democracy and free elections while avoiding a slide into fundamentalism."
"Egypt plays a key role in supporting the Middle East peace process, and the army has promised to continue to play this role, respecting the balance of power and the stability of the region, during Egypt's transition to democracy I also believe that the EU should take action to protect itself against any potential mass exodus from the North African coast, by helping Egypt with all the necessary resources."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution and would highlight Parliament's firm support for reforms aimed at democracy, the rule of law and social justice in Egypt."
"I hope that it will be possible to lift the state of emergency, and that good governance, the fight against corruption, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms will soon become the reality in Egypt; in particular, freedom of conscience, religion, and thought, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and mass media, freedom of association, women's rights, the protection of minorities, and the fight against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
"Egypt is a country with thousands of years of history, which deserves to open a new, democratic chapter in its history."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution, and echo its expression of solidarity with the Egyptian people, who, prompted by legitimate aspirations of democracy, freedom and better living conditions, have opened up a new phase of political transition in Egypt."
"I hope that the conditions will now be created for Egypt to make progress with the political, economic and social reforms necessary for social justice, and for the establishment of a robust and tolerant democracy that respects human rights and civil liberties;"
"I also hope that the country will be guaranteed total support in this."
"The wave of protest that has swept through Egypt in recent weeks and resulted in the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, marks an important stage in the country's political transition."
"By lending my support to the European Parliament's joint motion for a resolution, I wish to express my solidarity with the Egyptian people and to pay tribute to their courage and their determination in fighting for democracy."
"I think it is crucial for the EU and the Member States to actively support a swift transition to democratic governance, in particular by establishing a 'task force' involving the European Parliament so as to respond to the requests made by Egyptians carrying out that transition."
"Furthermore, the events that have taken place in Egypt and Tunisia, and which are still taking place at the moment in other countries, show the need for Europe to review the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) so that the assistance that it provides to its partners is strictly dependent on respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"The review of this policy must be accompanied by the introduction of a set of political criteria that neighbouring countries should meet in order to obtain a superior status in their relations with the EU."
"Today, it has to be said that everyone recognises that Mr Mubarak was a dictator, whereas only a month ago few people, including in the European Parliament, stood up to assert that fact."
"It is therefore vital for the European Commission and the Council to call into question the realpolitik they have been practising for years in these parts of the world, both in Egypt and in Tunisia, just as it is crucial to question the ambivalence of the relations that the EU maintained with the dictators who have been ruling these countries for decades."
"The financial assets not only of Mr Mubarak and his associates, but also of his family, must be frozen."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because of the exceptionally important part that the recent demonstrations in various Arab countries in North Africa and the Middle East have played in institutional, political and economic change in the area."
"The wind of change is again blowing on the groundswell of strong popular demand for freedom and real democracy, as a basis for achieving better living conditions for the whole population."
"It is a fundamental objective of the European Union to promote respect for democracy, human rights and civil liberties, and it constitutes a common ground for the development of the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"The priority will now be to establish a government chosen directly by the Egyptian people in free elections, which, with international support, can tackle the transition period towards full democracy, when the Coptic Christian communities will no longer be the victims of current events and all religious communities can live in peace and freely profess their faith throughout the country."
"in writing. - (SK) I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Egypt, because, for anyone in public governance who puts the human dignity of the individual above all else, democracy is the best possible form of government, and that applies both in Europe and in Egypt."
"However, I could not help thinking of Iran, where the overthrow of the corrupt, autocratic regime of the Shah led to the formation of a repressive Islamic Republic."
"I could not help thinking about the elections in Palestine, where the first democratic elections resulted in terrorists and thugs being voted into government."
"I also thought of Iraq, where six years after the overthrow of the dictator, members of the oldest Christian communities in the world are being harassed, expelled and killed."
"I pray that everything goes well this time."
"Egypt is at a crossroads, and I just hope that it chooses the path of freedom for all of its citizens, including the Coptic Christians."
"I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution, drawing attention to the importance of an approach that is simultaneously top-down and horizontal, whilst also involving all actors in developing a Strategy."
"Experiences such as this one demonstrate that a coordinated approach is needed in order to use the available funds efficiently."
"In this context, I would stress the importance of technical assistance for the implementation of actions and projects."
"I would also remind you that this macro-region is of particular significance to Europe, since it can improve neighbourly relations with south-east Europe and encourage political and economic cooperation with the Balkans."
"In order to evaluate this strategy's effectiveness, I agree that its implementation should be analysed; along with an analysis of the Baltic Sea Strategy, which could point to possible sources and methods of funding for pilot projects of other macro-regional strategies in Europe."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region."
"The Danube region, comprising 14 European countries and 115 million people both within and outside the EU, is an area where enhanced synergies between various EU policies - cohesion, transport, economic, energy, environment, culture, education, agriculture, fisheries, enlargement and neighbourhood policies - can be developed."
"Importantly, the strategy should contribute significantly to improving multi-level governance and involvement of partners operating in the Danube region and civil society, and would ensure prosperity, sustainable development, job creation and security in the area."
"I agree with the resolution's call for the Member States and the regions to use the Structural Funds intended for the period 2007 to 2013, in order to ensure as much support as possible for the implementation of this strategy, particularly by promoting the creation of new jobs and economic growth in the areas worst affected by the economic crisis."
"The Danube region is Europe's gate to the Western Balkans, and therefore I believe that the European Strategy for the Danube Region will not only be conducive to the improvement of neighbourhood relations in Central and South Eastern Europe, but will provide important added value in the EU's Eastern European policy."
"This will be an excellent opportunity for the entire Union to fortify its political and economic cooperation with the Balkans, and to contribute to the expansion and consolidation of European integration in the region."
"The Strategy for the Danube Region is a European Union project which third countries bordering the river are also invited to participate in, with the aim of developing the Danube region's huge economic potential."
"The River Danube links 10 European states, six of which are European Union Member States."
"All these countries are encouraged to cooperate in areas such as river transport, social protection and development, sustainable economic development, transport and energy infrastructure, environmental protection, tourism, culture and education."
"In addition, it identifies common responses to challenges such as improving quality of life, boosting the competitiveness and attractiveness of the localities on the Danube and attracting investment in strategic areas."
"I believe that better coordination is required between local and regional authorities and the organisations doing business in the Danube region in order to ensure job creation and security in this area."
"I also support the economic and social development of the Danube region as a priority community area and the promotion of deeper regional integration in this zone, which would provide dynamic impetus for a wider European economic area."
"I support the implementation of this strategy as the Danube region offers significant socio-economic potential within Europe."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of adopting the Strategy for the Danube Region."
"This is the outcome of major efforts made by Romania and Austria right from the outset."
"By promoting and supporting this project, which is now taking shape under the Hungarian Presidency, which I would like to congratulate, the Strategy will become a political, economic and financial priority."
"Romania will coordinate four priority areas: river transport, tourism, culture and the management of risks produced by extreme phenomena."
"At the same time, the new strategy will enable the new concept of territorial cohesion to be implemented, which is included in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The financial resources not used from the instruments featuring in the current EU financial framework can be used as part of the Strategy for the Danube Region for macro-regional projects."
"I wish to emphasise the importance of cooperation with other partners, including NGOs and the private sector."
"I would like to end by saying that Romania, as a coordinator, will monitor compliance with the obligations assumed by the states bordering the Danube, in accordance with the Action Plan."
"in writing. - (LT) I welcome the Strategy for the Danube Region adopted by the European Commission and agree with its action plan which devotes most attention to four areas (connecting the Danube region, protecting the environment, building prosperity and strengthening the Danube region), and takes into account the need to improve movement in the Danube region, energy security, social and economic development, cultural exchanges, security and civil protection."
"Furthermore, I welcome the fact that this Strategy was prepared following lengthy consultation with stakeholders, including national, regional and local government institutions and representatives of the academic and business community and non-governmental organisations, because this is an important factor for its success."
"It is necessary to establish a civil society forum in this region, which would bring together actors in the public and private sectors and would give them the opportunity to participate in the preparation of macro-regional strategies."
"It is necessary to enhance the Danube's cultural environment by promoting cultural dialogue, supporting university exchange programmes and youth projects based on transnational cooperation, fostering sustainable tourism, and protecting the historical and built heritage."
"Cooperation in the area of cultural projects plays a vitally important role in supporting cultural dialogue and mutual understanding between the countries of the Danube Region."
"It is important for the EU Strategy for the Danube Region to be adopted during the European Council summit in June so that its implementation can be launched as soon as possible."
"However, it is just as important to attract the existing European funds for developing this region, amounting to EUR 100 billion, through the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund."
"These funds will provide direct support to the strategy's implementation."
"If there are no definite projects which will use these funds, the strategy will become worthless."
"The purpose of the Strategy for the Danube Region is to create jobs and boost economic growth in the crisis-hit regions."
"Utilising the regions' specific features could result in a much more efficient use of the Structural Funds and in creating added value at regional level, while the financial resources which have not been used could also provide a source of funding for macro-regional projects."
"The adoption of the Strategy for the Danube Region is a natural outcome of the summit on this region which was held in Bucharest at the end of last year when a significant indication was given of the economic importance that the EU attaches to this river."
"The River Danube links ten European countries."
"The Danube also represents significant socio-economic potential, with over 200 million people living in the surrounding region."
"The Danube region is an important focal point for EU cohesion policy programmes."
"The Strategy for the Danube Region is focused on three priority areas: connectivity and communications (including transport, energy, and the information society); environmental protection and prevention of natural disasters; and boosting the potential for socio-economic development."
"In my opinion, the Strategy for the Danube Region should be implemented with a bottom-up approach by facilitating the movement of goods and upgrading infrastructure, and thereby improving general business conditions throughout the region."
"The Strategy should not be a reason for setting up new institutions."
"Its main purpose should be to strengthen coordination between the individual regional players."
"For this reason, the Strategy should not be allocated any specific funds."
"It is therefore necessary to insist that the Council-approved principle of the '3 NOs' be applied: in other words, that there is budgetary, legislative and administrative neutrality."
"In this respect, the macro-regional strategy should primarily be a tool for boosting the effectiveness of cooperation and making better use of existing resources."
"It is also necessary to respond to criticism of the Commission's intention to encourage shipping on the Danube by improving its navigability."
"Critics say that engineering changes to the riverbed will cause damage to bankside vegetation and an overall deterioration of the environment in the surrounding area."
"I welcome an integrated approach, which includes drawing up macro-regional strategies applicable to the entire European Union, in order to make regional policy more effective."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy already provides a model for coordinating European Union policies and funding in geopolitical territorial units - macro-regions - defined on the basis of specific criteria."
"I particularly welcome the adoption of the Strategy for the Danube Region and support the Action Plan that accompanies it, which satisfies the need to improve mobility, energy security, environmental protection, social and economic development, cultural exchanges, security and civil protection in the Danube region."
"Like this regional strategy, I call for the Euro-African Atlantic Space also to be created, which would enable the deepening of relations between the south-west coast of Europe, the outermost regions (OR) and the neighbouring countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States."
"This would also improve cooperation on issues such as transportation, energy security, scientific exchange, the development of tourism, security and the fight against illegal immigration."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that the EU Strategy for the Danube Region offers a means of coordinating EU policies and that it will need to respond to the challenges facing this region."
"We want a proper strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, one which, once it has been implemented, will ultimately improve the quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region."
"I voted for the resolution on the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region because it satisfies the need to improve mobility, energy security, environmental protection, social and economic development, cultural exchanges, security and civil protection in the region."
"The Danube region has its own characteristic features and a particular historical importance which, as with the Baltic, justify a specific strategy from the European Union."
"At the heart of this macro-region is its principal river, which is a waterway of particular importance in Europe."
"Mobility, energy security, environmental protection, social and economic development, cultural exchanges, security and civil protection in the surrounding area can be improved through the intended increase in interdependence."
"Given the countries that make up the Danube region, such a strategy can contribute to mending previous splits and prevent old disputes from being reignited, enabling increased European cohesion and opening the doors to future expansions of the Union."
"I hope that investment in these regions will neither compromise nor reduce the support given to the outermost regions, whose very nature makes them deserving of special assistance and incentives."
"This measure will also help European cohesion."
"As a result of the European Council's request to the Commission for a document to be drawn up setting out the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, on 8 December last year the Commission tabled a draft 'EU Strategy for the Danube Region', which included an Action Plan."
"This region's geo-strategic importance in a number of sectors - tourism, transport, the environment, energy, good neighbourliness, territorial cohesion, and so on - meant that Parliament was a key partner in setting out the strategy and must continue to be so throughout its implementation."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this motion for a resolution, in the knowledge that it will bring sustainable development to a region crossed by the European Union's largest river, where almost 160 million people live, and whose environmental and heritage resources merit classification as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)."
"Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union acknowledges territorial cohesion as an objective of the EU."
"The joint motion for a resolution, on which Parliament voted today, calls for that principle to apply also in relation to the Danube region."
"Fourteen EU Member States are included in that region, including Germany as well as Romania and Bulgaria, and it is primarily for those countries that we call for the effective application of the principle enshrined in Article 3."
"Back in 2008, Parliament urged the Council and the Council Presidency to draw up a strategic plan that would provide for and implement aid for that region, so as to give it the input it desperately needs to be able to enjoy a strong economy independent of other funding sources."
"Three years later, we are again calling for the implementation of a policy committed to achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth; we are calling for the promotion of the most disadvantaged areas, the development of which would result in improved environmental and social conditions."
"My vote in favour of the motion for a resolution is merely a small gesture towards a region in need of European aid; we cannot back away from it now."
"in writing. - I welcome this Resolution which: points out that, from an ecological point of view, Central and South-Eastern Europe is one of the richest but at the same time one of the most vulnerable areas of Europe, characterised by an ecosystem of high ecological complexity and great value, therefore requiring a high level of protection; welcomes the aim of the European Strategy for the Danube Region to create a liveable, sustainable and at the same time developed, prosperous Danube region by managing environmental risks, such as floods and industrial pollution, preserving the quality and quantity of water reserves and ensuring their sustainable use, and preserving biodiversity, landscapes and the quality of air and soils; stresses that protecting the environment in the Danube basin is an important aspect which should stimulate responsible agricultural and rural development of the region; calls for improvements to the ecological status of the Danube, and for measures to reduce pollution and to prevent further releases of oil and other toxic and harmful substances; stresses that a good ecological status of the Danube is a prerequisite for all human activity along the river and recommends that the environmental targets should be considered in particular"
"With a population of 100 million spread across 14 countries, eight of which are EU Member States, the Danube region covers some of Europe's richest and poorest regions, and can be defined as a macro-region with heterogeneous economic capacities."
"Regional policies' effectiveness equates to support for development, as well as to the application of strategies that will solve a series of local problems and will stimulate the economic growth of countries whose populations are linked to the river, so as to promote sustainable development."
"That being the case, and as this Strategy - which is based on the three interlinked objectives of socioeconomic development, improved transportation, and support for alternative energy sources and environmental protection - and the accompanying Action Plan will contribute to promoting this region and minimising existing regional differences by better coordinating the efforts of the eight Member States in the region, I welcome its adoption."
"The Strategy for the Danube Region aims to improve how this river is used as a transport route, which is likely to involve deepening the navigation channels."
"In addition, the Strategy also covers the field of energy - which in some circumstances could include an expansion of hydroelectric power."
"The Strategy is furthermore intended to be an important stimulating factor for the economy."
"We must hope that the EU's new flagship project that is the Strategy for the Danube Region will subsequently be given some observable and tangible content."
"How much life will actually be breathed into this project will certainly depend, amongst other things, on how the tension between the objectives of environmental protection and drawing the Danube region together are resolved and whether the Danube will suffice as the common denominator for the implementation of this mammoth project."
"I voted in favour of this project."
"in writing. - (BG) I was happy to sign and vote in favour of the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region."
"The Danube Strategy is a chance to unlock the potential for development and cooperation of many European regions in different fields."
"I would like to concentrate on two very important aspects for me of the Danube Strategy: the development of tourism; and maintaining security in the region."
"As regards the role of the Danube Strategy in developing tourism, it can contribute to levelling out socio-economic differences in Europe, to create jobs and to encourage cultural dialogue and knowledge of the rich European cultural, ethnic and natural heritage in the region."
"The Danube Strategy can help to maintain security in the region surrounding the Danube, and play an important role in controlling migration in and outside the Union and in the fight against crime."
"In order to achieve real results, joint operations in sensitive areas such as security and migration are of primary importance."
"That is why I welcome the strengthening of regional cooperation in these areas and ensuring a better institutional capacity in this regard."
"in writing. - (DE) The EU Strategy for the Danube Region and its 115 million inhabitants offers an opportunity to accelerate cross-border cooperation as well as sustainable economic and cultural development in this region."
"In June, the Council was supposed to establish a timetable and specific steps for its implementation."
"At the heart of the strategy lie improvements to mobility, energy supply, security, protection of the environment and disaster management."
"I hope it will bring about a new regional dynamic and that all the interest groups and stakeholders in civil society will be involved, so that the projects supported are used optimally."
"We would also wish to see an initiative at macro-regional level for greater safety as regards nuclear policy in the Danube region."
"This region in particular still has nuclear power stations that represent a risk to the environment and the population, yet in the environmental impact assessment procedure there is insufficient consultation or no consultation whatsoever with neighbouring states and regions."
"There is a need to act here."
"I very much welcome the fact that only funds that have already been made available in the Structural Funds (around EUR 1 billion for the period 2007-2013) can be used within the framework of the Strategy for the Danube Region - in other words, that no additional funding is being allocated and that neither new institutions nor new legislation are needed."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"At the vote, today, I endorsed adoption of the joint motion for a resolution on the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region."
"The idea of an integrated approach, including the creation of strategies for macro-regions that are EU-level strategies, is the best example of territorial cooperation, is a good way to increase the effectiveness of regional policy and should be supported and developed."
"The Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, which was adopted in the middle of last year, is a model of the coordination of EU policy and the financing of macro-regions - geopolitical territorial units defined on the basis of particular criteria."
"The extensive Danube region, which includes 14 European countries and numbers 115 million people both within and outside the EU, required the creation of a single plan combining economic, environmental, social and cultural aspects (these are also the four pillars of the strategy)."
"In the context of the need to carry out interim analyses of the implementation of the strategy, analogously to the report on the Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, the resolution calls on the European Commission to prepare concrete instruments and criteria for evaluating projects based on indicators that allow comparisons to be made."
"Parliament has also committed the Commission to analysing the first results and experiences in connection with the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and, using the example of the two strategies (for the Baltic and the Danube), to map out possible sources and methods of financing for macro-regional strategies."
"In light of the countless considerations on the implementation of this strategy, I personally have decided to vote in favour, particularly in view of the fact that the Danube region, comprising 14 European countries and about 115 million people, is an area where enhanced synergies between various EU policies - cohesion, transport, economic, energy, environment, enlargement and neighbourhood policies - can be developed."
"In my view, the strategy should therefore combine economic, environmental, social and cultural elements, since a macro-region such as the Danube would significantly increase the economic wealth of the whole European Union by stimulating employment and promoting integrated development."
"I therefore believe that the unifying and integrative character of the strategy expresses the conviction held by all EU Member States that it could represent a significant contribution to overcoming past divisions in Europe and to the overall success and greater efficiency of Europe."
"In 2009, the European Council asked the Commission to draw up a European Strategy for the Danube Region bearing in mind that the Danube region comprises 14 European countries and 115 million people both within and outside the European Union (EU): Germany, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Moldova and Ukraine, and is therefore an area where enhanced synergies between various EU policies can be developed."
"I cannot fail to welcome the adoption of the Strategy for the Danube Region by the European Commission or to support the accompanying Action Plan, which is based on four pillars: linking up the Danube region, protecting the environment, creating prosperity, and strengthening the Danube region."
"The strategy satisfies the need to improve mobility, energy security, environmental protection, social and economic development, cultural exchanges, security, and civil protection in the Danube region."
"I hope that the European Strategy for the Danube Region will be adopted by the European Council and that progress will be made with applying it as soon as possible."
"in writing. - (RO) The Danube's job is to provide the backbone for a macro-regional structure which features Länder, regions and Member States, along with countries which do not belong yet or at all to the EU, all in search of common prosperity."
"The Danube is no longer blue, as in the title of Strauss's waltz and, indeed, environmental protection projects are estimated at EUR 9 billion."
"All the investments which will be made in the Danube Basin must be for smart systems based on state-of-the-art scientific and technological developments, with environmental protection included right from the system design phase ('green knowledge intelligent systems')."
"These investments mean the creation of new opportunities for sustainable economic growth and an improvement in quality of life, thereby developing natural/environmental assets and promoting the EU's environmental policy, for example, creating an environmental factor management and control system, eliminating the adverse environmental impact in the event of natural disasters, protecting biodiversity, preserving and extending forested areas, parks and green belts in urban areas."
"Support from the local authorities and citizens is extremely helpful, highlighting that internal dialogue is working and effective at every level, so that the Danube Strategy is a strategy for the European citizen."
"in writing. - With this resolution, the EP: 1. welcomes the approval by the Commission of the Strategy for the Danube Region and supports the Action Plan accompanying it, focused on four pillars (connecting the Danube region, protecting the environment, building prosperity and strengthening the Danube region) and meeting the need to improve mobility, energy security, environmental protection, social and economic development, cultural exchange, security and civil protection in the Danube region; 2. recalls that the European Parliament has been calling for this strategy since 2008 and calls on the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and on the European Council to endorse the EU Strategy for the Danube Region by the June European Council and to start its implementation as quickly as possible."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because the Danube region, which comprises 14 European countries and 115 million people, needs to be managed through a joint, collective plan aimed at promoting it economically and culturally, so as to preserve its inestimable artistic and environmental beauty."
"The Member States should now take advantage of the Structural Funds available for 2007-2013 in order to ensure maximum support for the strategy."
"In particular, there should be a commitment to job creation, especially in areas most affected by the economic crisis."
"If the Danube Strategy is underpinned by strong political commitment, it could then contribute to overcoming past divisions in Europe, thus taking a further step towards the true integration of Europeans."
"If successful, the plan will have positive repercussions over a much wider geographical area, emphasising the region's strategic position as Europe's gateway to the Western Balkans."
"The Strategy for the Danube Region is a European Union project in which third countries bordering the river are also invited to participate, with the aim of developing the Danube region's huge economic potential."
"The River Danube links 10 European states, six of which are European Union Member States."
"All these countries are encouraged to cooperate in areas such as river transport, social protection and development, sustainable economic development, transport and energy infrastructure, environmental protection, tourism, culture and education."
"In addition, it identifies common responses to challenges such as improving the quality of life, boosting the competitiveness and attractiveness of the localities on the Danube and attracting investment in strategic areas."
"I believe that better coordination is required between local and regional authorities and the organisations doing business in the Danube region in order to ensure job creation and security in this area."
"I also support the economic and social development of the Danube region as a priority community area and the promotion of deeper regional integration in this zone, which would provide dynamic impetus for a wider European economic area."
"I support the implementation of this strategy as the Danube region offers significant socio-economic potential within Europe."
"The Danube region comprises 14 European Union (EU) Member States and a total of 115 million people."
"It is a very heterogeneous region where there is a great deal of mobility and a high level of interconnectivity."
"This demonstrates that it is a suitable area for strengthening synergies between several policies, such as cohesion, transport, economic, energy, environmental, and even the enlargement and neighbourhood policy."
"It is a rich region with strong economic capacities but that requires coordinated efforts in order for it to develop in a cohesive, integrated and sustainable way."
"An integrated and coordinated strategy with a view to cooperation between the Member States and their regions seems a suitable way to achieve the goal of territorial cohesion."
"In order to achieve that, it seems essential to me to involve all institutional and civil actors, specifically through participation in local and regional entities."
"Implementing the strategy must also involve more efficient use of the Structural Funds and, above all, the possibility of putting financial resources not used in macro-regional projects to use."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution on the Danube and hope that similar strategies will be developed for other European macro-regions."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution because it deals with issues relating to the stability of legislation regulating the field of business, with the Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev cases, with the way that the Russian authorities combat terrorism, particularly in the North Caucasus, and with the human rights situation."
"This resolution is important because it places an emphasis on the Partnership for Modernisation."
"I am therefore voting for this resolution because I believe that the modernisation of Russian society involves implementing the rule of law."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution because I advocate that full respect for human rights and the rule of law by the Russia Federation will improve its image and credibility in the world, in particular as regards its relations with the European Union."
"It is important for the Russian Federation to respect the international commitments it has made, not least in the context of the Council of Europe, where it has committed to respect fully European standards regarding democracy, human rights, fundamental rights and the rule of law."
"Although I share the concerns expressed by my fellow Members, I still cannot fail to note the enormous progress already made by Russia towards democracy and the rule of law."
"Any impartial observer is bound to acknowledge that respect for human rights and individual freedoms has significantly improved in the present Russian State compared with the Soviet regime that preceded it; a regime that still continues to shock us the more we find out about it."
"While we are discussing the rule of law in Russia, I cannot fail to express my regret and to condemn vehemently those who are putting it at risk by attacking, wounding and killing innocent people in order to follow radical terrorist agendas."
"I therefore express my sincerest condolences to the victims."
"I hope that Russia will continue to distance itself from its brutal Soviet heritage, will increasingly converge with the European Union on respect for the rights, freedoms and guarantees of its citizens, and will take on its role as the European power that Peter the Great dreamt of."
"Russia is an important partner of the European Union and should contribute to the establishment of sustainable cooperation based on democracy and the rule of law."
"It is therefore important that there be no doubt regarding the Russian authorities' defence of the rule of law."
"Therefore, the Russian judicial bodies and institutions responsible for applying the law must exercise their obligations in a way that is effective, impartial and independent."
"I condemn the attack on Domodedovo Airport and offer my condolences to the families of the victims."
"I would stress the need for the Russian authorities to respond to this attack using a legal and moderate means, and to allow the Russian judicial system to operate freely and independently to try and sentence those responsible for the attack."
"in writing. - (LV) With this motion for a resolution, Members wish to draw attention to the disquieting events in Russia, which, as a member of the Council of Europe, has undertaken to comply fully with European standards of democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"In truth, these standards are being ignored and crudely infringed."
"A glaring example of this is the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, the former owners of Yukos."
"This case has descended to the level of farce, and does not give the impression that there is one law and one system of justice for all in Russia."
"Whereas efforts are being made to convict the opponents of Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, nothing is being done to solve the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and other journalists who have been killed."
"The right to hold meetings is being withheld from those who think differently in Russia, and defiance of the ban can lead to imprisonment."
"All of this is unacceptable."
"We want Russia to be a democratic, economically developed and stable country that can be a reliable partner to its neighbours, the European Union and NATO countries."
"Unfortunately, Russia's leading politicians carry on a wholly different policy, which increasingly alienates Russia from other democracies."
"If Russia wishes to become a member of the World Trade Organisation, its leading politicians must greatly change their attitude towards democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"in writing. - (LV) I supported the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the rule of law in Russia, drawing attention to infringements of human rights and fundamental rights, as well as to the threat existing in that country to the development of democracy."
"I am pleased that Parliament, in adopting this resolution, recognises in principle that the rule of law and democracy do not exist in Russia."
"Nevertheless, I should like to stress that the European Union policy towards Russia will be successful only when Member States pursue a common foreign policy."
"Recent events, when France concluded an agreement to sell Mistral class warships to Russia, are evidence that Europe's common foreign and security policy is a mere fiction."
"The interests of France were more important than a common foreign policy."
"The agreement was concluded despite objections by the Baltic States and comments by Russian generals about the potential of these ships, which was lacking in the war with Georgia."
"Transactions of this sort undermine trust between European countries and testify to the success of Russia's 'divide and rule' policy."
"The European Union can promote the rule of law in Russia only if the Member States place the common interests of all European countries above their own individual interests."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which condemns the fact that, in Russia, independent journalists, civil society activists, lawyers and human rights defenders have often been the victims of threats and acts of violence and in addition that the anti-extremist legislation and the new provisions of the law on the Federal Security Service (FSB) are unclear and, as a result, are often used to harass NGOs, religious minorities and media organisations."
"I have read through the motion for a resolution on the rule of law in Russia."
"I have three short comments."
"First and foremost, I think that it is right that the European Parliament has used every opportunity to open up the issues of human rights and the quality of the rule of law."
"We should do this more often, and with more countries."
"My second comment concerns the format."
"Our comments must be businesslike."
"That means not just preaching to others in a paternalistic way, but also offering a helping hand."
"Frankly, I have no idea how the critics of the Yukos oligarchs' trial can be so certain that political pressure is being put on the trial process."
"Attacking a verdict, and ignoring evidence that has been presented on tax evasion and other offences is surely a form of political pressure."
"Why do critics automatically assume that the evidence has been falsified?"
"I have numerous other similar examples."
"Russia has two main problems associated with the rule of law."
"The first is the fact that the country is undergoing a transformation of its law and legal culture."
"That takes time and will not happen through the good will of the Kremlin alone."
"The second problem is the unstable security situation and the lack of trust in the good intentions of some advisors."
"How will the European Union help Russia in the fight against terrorism and the extradition of terrorism suspects who have found a safe haven in EU countries?"
"How will the EU act against the violation of the political rights of so-called 'non-citizens' in EU countries?"
"It is not enough just to hand out advice; we need to offer help as well."
"I am convinced that Russia remains one of the European Union's most important partners in maintaining world security and stability, and that EU-Russia cooperation must therefore be stepped up."
"We must strengthen our commitment to working with Russia to respond to shared challenges in key areas, such as combating terrorism, energy policy and world economic governance."
"The EU and Russia need to intensify negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement that is comprehensive and binding, and which covers the areas of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human and fundamental rights."
"It is necessary to develop joint initiatives with the Russian Government aimed at enhancing world security and stability and, in particular, on common neighbours, in order to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Transnistria and in Georgia, in line with international law."
"The rule of law is indeed under threat in Russia."
"One could paraphrase Marie Mendras by saying that we are witnessing the catching up of history being thwarted."
"Ever since the end of the Yeltsin era, we have witnessed a policy that consists in weakening all the public institutions."
"Things may appear legal on the surface, but respect for the law has been suffocated by too many rules and regulations."
"The Khodorkovsky and Lebedev trials are a typical example: the facade of the law is being maintained, but the law itself is being used for purposes other than its primary function."
"Economic growth will not allow for the rule of law."
"The economy for the economy's sake leads to abuses, exploitation and partisan interests."
"Wealth must make for freedom, encourage collective progress and enable every individual to flourish."
"The market economy cannot be virtuous without a fair State, by which I mean a State that fully assumes its normal tasks in a fair and just way; a State that can guarantee that its citizens have impartial access to all fundamental rights such as access to education, healthcare, justice, culture, administration and vital basic needs."
"The joint motion for a resolution on Russia covers some important points that are existential issues for any democracy: independent courts, fast and fair trials and the effective prosecution of criminal acts."
"To this extent I am in favour of the text when it talks of the need to remedy existing shortcomings in the Russian legal and justice system."
"The condemnation of the terrorist attacks on Domodedovo airport is also important and demonstrates the EU's solidarity with this important partner state."
"However, the tone adopted in respect of certain pending or current court proceedings (for example, in the Khodorkovsky case) is wrong and undiplomatic."
"If we talk of 'politically motivated trials' or 'serious judicial questions' then we are adopting the language of the Russian prime minister's political opponents."
"This becomes evident when calls are made for 'an independent judicial review' of the verdicts."
"It insinuates - based on no knowledge or prior investigation - that the whole of Russian justice is not independent and hands down 'wrong' verdicts."
"These 'judgments' from outside without knowing the true facts are not meaningful, and moreover represent interference in internal affairs."
"For this reason I abstained from voting."
"In view of the talks between the European Union and Russia on the subject of human rights, and as the EU is still committed to strengthening and further developing EU-Russia relations, with respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights, I believe that Russia remains an important partner for the EU, in line with greater development of cooperation between the countries."
"I voted in favour of the motion since I believe that intensifying the negotiations and the new partnership agreements with Russia will reinvigorate the Member States' broad agreement in favour of democracy and the proper operation of the justice system."
"I would also emphasise the fact that fully respecting human rights and the rule of law would improve Russia's image and credibility on the world stage, particularly as regards its relationship with the European Union, by virtue of a strategic partnership."
"Respect for European standards regarding democracy, human rights, fundamental rights and the rule of law is fundamental for all European peoples."
"Respect for the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights must be fundamental to a policy of people being good neighbours and moving closer together."
"I agree with this motion for a resolution's call for the Russian State to apply measures to remedy violations in individual cases, including ensuring effective investigations and holding perpetrators accountable, as well as to adopt general measures to implement any judgments that involve political and legal changes, so as to prevent human rights violations from being repeated."
"I should like the Council and Commission to offer Russia concrete assistance and specialised knowledge so as to increase the independence of the legal system and of the services responsible for applying the law, in order to improve the capacity of the country's legal system for resisting political and economic pressure."
"In particular, I should like to see the creation of a programme of judicial assistance that would contribute to the education and training of magistrates, public prosecutors and the judiciary, not least as regards human rights."
"in writing. - With this resolution the EP: 1. reaffirms its belief that Russia remains an important partner for the European Union in building sustainable cooperation based on democracy and rule of law; 2. strongly condemns the terrorist attack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport and expresses its condolences to the families of the victims and its solidarity with those wounded in the attack; underlines the need for the Russian authorities to respond to this attack in a lawful and measured way and to allow the Russian judicial system to work freely and independently to prosecute and convict those responsible for the attack; 3. expresses concern over reports of politically motivated trials, unfair procedures and failures to investigate serious crimes such as killings, harassment and other acts of violence; urges the Russian judicial and law enforcement authorities to carry out their duties in an effective, impartial and independent manner in order to bring perpetrators to justice."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because I believe it can strengthen the existing partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia."
"Eighty per cent of foreign investment in Russia comes from Europe, and therefore strengthening this partnership would help Europe to implement a more competitive policy in all spheres of activity."
"In terms of energy, over 45% of our gas and 29.9% of our oil is imported from Russia; without it, kitchens and heating systems across half of Europe would stop working."
"Given our shared interests in the economic, energy and security areas, a new partnership agreement with the Kremlin would guarantee Europe's economy greater stability following the recent financial crisis."
"Moreover, this resolution encourages Russia, as a member of the Council of Europe, to commit itself to complying fully with European standards on democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"Adopting a joint, consistent policy for promoting human rights would be a step forwards in asserting human rights worldwide."
"It is strange how, on the subject of Russia, the European Parliament has lapsed either into indulgence or into what I would call an 'anti-Russia' sentiment, motivated in the past by anti-sovietism and hence by dyed-in-the-wool anti-communism."
"It is time to realise that the Berlin Wall fell more than 20 years ago and that the current regime no longer bears any relation to its predecessors."
"Nevertheless, this is a regime that has nothing to do the rule of law and which constantly flouts the most basic human rights."
"To my mind, there is no reason why Russia should be treated any differently from the other countries in the world."
"At the very least, the attacks on freedom of expression and the poor administration of the judicial system there must be denounced."
"This resolution is too indulgent towards the Russian Government, and particularly towards Dmitry Medvedev."
"I therefore chose to abstain."
"in writing. - (SK) I supported the motion for a resolution on the rule of law in Russia, although I think that this is not the last such resolution to be discussed and voted on in the European Parliament in relation to Russia."
"It fills me with hope, however, that Parliament has found the political will to address critical words to a country on which Europe is largely dependent for the supply of raw materials."
"Europe and Russia are destined to cooperate with each other - and not just in the field of manufacturing."
"We are two facets of a single civilization; our histories are two interpretations of the same set of values."
"If this civilization is to survive, these two views of universal values have to converge."
"I would be happy if our critical resolution was understood by the Russians as an effort to find common ground, and as a warning that some of the specific steps and approaches of the state authority are in sharp conflict with this value base."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution, the main objective of which is to reconcile the World Bank's investments relating to energy with the development goals."
"I agree that energy strategy should tackle and facilitate the transition to environmentally sustainable energy development, and that the World Bank should adopt an approach to private sector development that provides the greatest benefit to the poor whilst simultaneously combating climate change."
"I find it regrettable that lending for fossil fuels continues to play a dominant role, despite the strategic objective being gradually to abolish financing for this type of project."
"I also note with concern that there is still little oversight of the majority of multilateral financing that is awarded through financial intermediaries: these should be pursuing clear development objectives."
"I call on the World Bank to reorient its current strategy from a large-scale, export-oriented energy model to small-scale, decentralised energy projects that respond more clearly to basic needs in rural areas."
"Finally, I would express my total agreement with the need for the World Bank clearly to identify and publicly disclose the development benefits before financing is committed."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the energy strategy should specifically address how access to energy can help lift people out of poverty, while facilitating the shift to an environmentally sustainable energy development path."
"The World Bank should pursue an approach to private-sector development that delivers maximum benefit to the poor while tackling climate change."
"Environmental and social factors, at both national and regional levels, must be taken into account in a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of energy options."
"It should be noted that fossil-fuel lending continues to play a dominant role in the World Bank's overall energy portfolio, despite recent increases in lending for renewable and energy efficiency initiatives."
"Fossil-fuel investments are also taking place through financial intermediaries, and this is not being accounted for by the Bank in its annual energy sector figures."
"Also of concern is the fact that the Bank is continuing to make significant investment in coal-fired power plants, locking developing countries into coal-based energy for decades to come."
"I voted against the report on the World Bank energy strategy for developing countries, mainly because a very negative amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) was adopted, which alters an important point in the initial motion for a resolution."
"To be precise, this change removes from the motion for a resolution the concern that the World Bank will include nuclear energy as a 'clean form' of energy."
"Thus, the motion for a resolution accepts the use of nuclear energy as a solution for reducing carbon emissions."
"To conclude, therefore, not only is nuclear energy accepted; the proposal is to promote it as a 'clean' form of energy to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions."
"However, promoting nuclear energy directly conflicts with the demand for a world free of nuclear energy, be it for military or for 'peaceful' purposes."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution on the World Bank's energy strategy because I think that it should support the transition to a route toward energy development that is sustainable in environmental terms in the least developed countries, whilst simultaneously contributing to European Union objectives regarding climate change and combating poverty."
"According to the data in the motion for a resolution, 1.5 billion people are currently without access to electricity, four out of five of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and nearly 2.4 billion people still use traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating, which is an unsustainable use of natural resources."
"For this very reason it is crucial that the World Bank adopt a new strategy for financing energy projects, committing to providing efficient, accessible and clean energy as a means of reducing poverty and fostering economic growth."
"In this context, when the World Bank finalises its energy strategy, given that it has previously committed to making half of its energy investments 'low-carbon', Parliament calls for clean energy projects to be prioritised and, especially, for a clear commitment to renewable energy, as a means of promoting sustainable development in underprivileged regions."
"This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament, deals with the World Bank's energy strategy for developing countries."
"We can understand the importance of this subject if we consider that more than 1.5 billion people currently do not have access to electricity, which is a fundamental right of all citizens."
"At a time when the World Bank is finalising its new energy strategy, a detailed approach becomes even more relevant."
"In truth, and despite this subject having been debated more than 20 years ago, the results are in no way satisfactory."
"We remain too dependent on fossil fuels instead of exploring alternative energy sources."
"We are speeding up climate change and harming peoples who live in extreme poverty."
"I therefore believe that the World Bank must review its policy of exploiting energy derived from fossil fuels - making aid to this sector more transparent - and encourage green energy so as to reduce, not just atmospheric pollution, but, above all, the dependence of developing countries on outside energy sources."
"in writing. - I voted for the resolution, which welcomes the World Bank's energy strategy and recalls that it should specifically address how access to energy can help lift people out of poverty, while facilitating the shift to an environmentally sustainable energy development path; urges the World Bank to pursue an approach to private-sector development that delivers maximum benefit to the poor while tackling climate change; and underlines that environmental and social factors, at both national and local community levels, must be taken into account in a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of energy options."
"Nobody doubts that access to modern energy services is a prerequisite for poverty eradication and economic development, or that in order to achieve this it is necessary that energy services be reliable, affordable, especially for the poor, and evenly distributed, so as to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas."
"Well into the 21st century, some 1.5 billion people remain without access to electricity, four out of five of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, mainly in rural areas, and nearly 2.4 billion people still use traditional biomass fuels for cooking and heating, causing severe health problems and the death of 1.9 million people per year from indoor pollution, as well as environmental damage resulting from unsustainable use of natural resources."
"The World Bank should therefore prioritise small-scale, local access to energy, particularly in the least developed countries in Africa and Asia."
"Around 1.5 million people worldwide, mainly in the developing countries of Africa and east Asia, still have no access to electricity."
"In rural areas in particular it may be observed that the population for this reason frequently makes recourse to traditional fuels made from biomass, such as charcoal ovens."
"However, it must be borne in mind that this presents a not inconsiderable risk to health."
"The World Bank, which has undertaken to promote sustainable energy, should be called on to give priority to such regional projects rather than large-scale commercial projects."
"This would firstly enable sustainable ecological energy production to be promoted, and secondly would also allow regional requirements to be taken into account."
"To achieve both ecological and economic sustainability it would be desirable to give priority to small, alternative, local energy projects, since this could prevent having to buy in energy that is often expensive."
"I am abstaining because I think we should wait to find out the strategy of the World Bank, which is expected to be announced midway through the year."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the World Bank's energy strategy for developing countries."
"Energy needs in developing countries are growing and it is therefore necessary to take into account energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy."
"Energy services must be reliable, affordable and evenly distributed throughout society in order to combat poverty effectively and bridge the gap between urban and rural areas."
"Given the needs of developing countries, the World Bank must diversify the energy portfolio and increase lending for renewable and energy efficiency initiatives."
"I agree with the proposal that the funding allocated must above all promote a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy."
"Priority must be given to small-scale decentralised energy projects and to ensuring energy access for the populations of developing countries."
"Attention is drawn to the fact that the World Bank must attach greater importance to the threat of biofuels to food supply."
"Furthermore, there must be more stringent monitoring and control of the activities of financial intermediaries."
"I share the concerns and agree with the suggestions set out by the European Parliament in this motion for a resolution on the World Bank's energy strategy, for which I voted."
"Given that access to modern energy services is a prerequisite for poverty eradication and economic development, and that the right to energy implies that energy services will be reliable, affordable and evenly distributed, so as to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, it seems crucial to me to promote an investment policy based on the sustainable use of natural resources."
"I therefore agree with the European Parliament's recommendations to the World Bank in this area."
"in writing. - We have finally voted in favour of the proposed resolution because Amendments 2, 3, and 4, which intended to remove the phrase 'low carbon', have been adopted."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because access to modern energy services is a prerequisite for poverty eradication and economic development."
"The right to energy means that energy services must be reliable, affordable, especially for the poor, and evenly distributed so as to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas."
"The World Bank's energy strategy takes that approach and must make a growing commitment to lifting people out of poverty, while facilitating the shift to an environmentally sustainable energy development path."
"The World Bank should therefore pursue an approach to private-sector development that delivers maximum benefit to the poor while tackling climate change."
"in writing. - (SV) I voted in favour of the report, which is a good one overall."
"However, I do not support the view that nuclear power is a clean energy source."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution because the current crisis underlines concerns that the present mechanisms will not allow the crisis to be overcome;, as the lack of coherence in achieving the five major objectives, not least as regards employment rates, is making this worse."
"The Annual Growth Survey and the framework of the European Semester constitute key instruments, but they should not replace nor diminish the broad economic and employment policy guidelines."
"We should commit to a series of measures that give visibility to the body of economic measures, which include a system of Eurobonds, a highly liquid public bond market, lower interest rates, and the creation of a European financial transactions tax to curb speculation."
"We should not compromise the development or creation of jobs, so I propose a stronger role for the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in supporting investments in infrastructure, technologies, and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I would also stress that the strategy for growth and jobs cannot be threatened by the current short-term vision of budgetary consolidation: due consideration must be given to public investment in its objectives."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The European Parliament expresses its conviction that the EU2020 Strategy should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through job creation and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth based on five EU headline targets as regards promoting employment, improving the conditions for innovation, research and development, meeting our climate change and energy objectives, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty."
"I believe that the Europe 2020 actions are of crucial importance to the future prospects of all European citizens, delivering sustainable jobs, long-term economic growth and social progress, but I share the fears set out in the motion for a resolution that the Europe 2020 Strategy will not be able to deliver on its promises due to its weak governance structure."
"It is important to note that for the Europe 2020 Strategy to be implemented successfully, we must close the gap between its declared ambitions, the resources available and the methodology used and must carry out reforms and ensure very substantial and early public and private investments in a wide range of projects."
"The European Commission and the Council must make a major contribution here."
"At the same time Member States should be encouraged to give the highest priority to tackling unemployment in their National Reform Programmes."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy will only be implemented successfully if the EU and the Member States combine efforts."
"The economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing has caused significant job losses in Europe."
"The priority for the Europe 2020 Strategy and the European Employment Strategy is to create more and better jobs in Europe."
"The aim is to transform Europe into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, whilst providing high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion."
"Europe must take collective action to overcome the current situation."
"This motion for a resolution is a step in this direction, calling on the Commission and the Council, along with the European Parliament, to involve national parliaments, social partners and regional and local authorities in policies designed to restore jobs and growth."
"To achieve this, the Community method needs to be reinforced and the European Semester adopted into the legislative governance package."
"We welcome the emphasis on the roles of small and medium-sized enterprises, and of the Single Market in job creation."
"Finally, we would stress the role attributed to the 'agenda for new skills and jobs' in achieving these goals."
"That is why I am voting for this resolution."
"Before the European Council in March and the presentation by the Member States of their national targets in April, we gave our verdict on the EU 2020 Strategy."
"That strategy is only a paper strategy at the moment, and the more time that goes by, the more likely it is that the failure of the Lisbon Strategy will be repeated."
"That is why we must react: we must say 'yes' to ambitious targets, but not without the budgetary resources to achieve them."
"Targets must go hand in hand with real budgetary commitments, or else how can we produce anything other than a paper strategy?"
"Whether it be during the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework or in the debate on EU own resources, Parliament will have to make itself heard to ensure that the commendable targets of the EU 2020 Strategy are matched by appropriate funding options."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the European Union Member States should be encouraged to give the highest priority to tackling unemployment and preventing long-term exclusion from the labour market in their national programmes and plans."
"This should be combined with measures to ensure more job creation, better jobs and high levels of high quality employment in the medium and longer term."
"I would like to stress that the Member States should pay more attention to tackling child poverty through appropriate measures so that children are not restricted in their personal development and are an equal and full part of society when entering professional life."
"I welcome the flagships aimed at implementing the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, such as 'An industrial policy for the globalisation era', 'An agenda for new skills and jobs', the 'European platform against poverty and social exclusion' and other initiatives."
"I agree with the proposals on the 'European platform against poverty and social exclusion', but I would encourage more specific action to be taken to ensure social inclusion."
"It is also very important to draw up a specific programme aimed at promoting decent work, guaranteeing workers' rights throughout Europe and improving working conditions, combating inequality, discrimination and in-work poverty."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy aims to ensure emergence from the crisis and to prepare the economy of the European Union for the next decade."
"It aims to promote knowledge, innovation, education and the digital society; to make our manufacturing infrastructure more resource-efficient, whilst reinforcing competitiveness; and to increase the rate of involvement in the labour market and the acquisition of qualifications, whilst combating poverty."
"In particular, I would stress the 'Innovation Union' initiative, which addresses major social challenges like energy and food security, climate change, health, and the ageing population."
"However, there is a need to enhance, stimulate and secure the financing of research, innovation and development in the EU."
"I call for increased funding for crucial instruments for research, innovation and deployment that have already been adopted, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan)."
"I would also emphasise the important contribution of the Research Framework Programme, and the contribution the Structural Funds are making in stimulating research, development and innovation at national and regional level."
"I voted against the motion for a resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy follows on from the failed Lisbon Strategy and cannot provide answers to questions such as how we are to recover from the crisis and create new jobs."
"Applying this strategy - and hence the erroneous policies that resulted in the crisis - to the letter will undermine the rights of European workers still further."
"The socio-economic governance of the EU needs an alternative policy that will reject any 'Competitiveness Pact' and help to bring about real economic convergence between the Member States."
"The European Union is in dire need of strategies that will promote values such as solidarity, social justice, gender equality and an honest effort to combat poverty."
"Together with other MEPs on the left of the House, we tabled an alternative motion for a resolution describing the measures and mechanisms needed for a Europe which targets economically, socially and environmentally viable growth with full employment and rights for its workers."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that the inclusion on the European Union's list of objectives of economic growth, the social objective and the fight against poverty is also important for Europe because achieving them will help safeguard the European Union's economic independence."
"The major challenges facing the EU and its Member States in terms of employment and unemployment should be reflected in and integrated into the political framework of the EU employment guidelines."
"At a time when the economic governance package, which aims to shore up the finances of the Member States and the Union as a whole, is under discussion, I cannot fail to underline the importance of its relationship with the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"I see the strategy's contribution to improving the consolidation of national and Union finances, innovation, and, consequently, competitiveness and growth as particularly important."
"This motion for a resolution, which is in line with some proposals on economic governance currently under discussion, sets out basic principles to be followed in future discussions, and establishes key ideas to take into account."
"In particular, I am referring to the need to follow a Community method that leads to increased unity between Member States, to the inclusion of a European Semester that enables improved coordination between national policies, and to the need for policies that encourage European competitiveness, such as support for innovation, for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the implementation of the Single Market."
"The world in general and the European Union in particular have been experiencing difficult times, of which the current economic and financial crisis is an example."
"With the goal of bringing about the end of this situation, on 17 June 2010 the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"It is a growth strategy for the next decade that boosts the European economy to achieve high standards of employment, productivity and social cohesion."
"The goals to be achieved by 2020 are ambitious: in terms of education, reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% and increasing the percentage of 30- to 34-year-olds who are graduates to 40%; in social terms, pulling 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and social exclusion."
"The intention is also to invest 3% of gross domestic product in scientific research."
"I welcome the choice for Europe 2020 of flagship initiatives aimed at education, employment, young people, innovation, the digital agenda, the environment, globalisation, resource use, and combating exclusion, which will encourage growth and competitiveness."
"I also welcome the adoption of this strategy and call on the institutions of the European Union and the governments of the Member States to spare no efforts to achieve the goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Reality is demonstrating that it is not enough to make statements of intent, however modest in social terms, in order for those goals to be achieved."
"This is particularly true when the proposed policies follow exactly the same course as those adopted before now, which are the root cause of the social crisis we are experiencing."
"That is the case with the Europe 2020 Strategy, with which they are now associating so--alled 'economic governance'."
"The leap they are attempting to make in this so-called economic governance with the creation of the 'European Semester' - the deepening of the penalties relating to compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, of the economic policy guidelines, and of any indicators that may be adopted - is not accompanied by a significant increase in the Community budget, which is always a crucial condition for moving towards economic and social cohesion, and for preventing the worsening of the current divergences."
"What they are intending is to create a veritable straightjacket for the Member States so that they will implement so-called austerity measures, which involves the deepening of the neoliberal agenda with all its serious antisocial consequences."
"If there are any doubts about this, take a look at the Franco-German project on the so-called Pact for Competitiveness, which aims to raise the retirement age, put collective bargaining at risk, and deliver yet another blow to labour and social rights, all so as to ensure increased earnings for economic and financial interest groups."
"We therefore voted against this motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (DE) Amendment 2 is intended to point out that the Commission needs to give greater consideration to the role of mobility and transport in this strategy."
"In the transport sector we need not only to contribute to CO2 reductions, but also to maintain Europe as a centre of production and development."
"Among other things, this includes increased investment in research and effective co-modality in the creation of trans-European networks."
"in writing. - (DE) In the Europe 2020 Strategy the European Union declared employment policy to be a key issue."
"It is important that all the Member States pursue the declared objectives both jointly and individually, so that a high level of employment and productivity can be achieved in Europe."
"These aims can only be achieved if we all act together in areas such as combating structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce, promoting job quality and improving the performance of education systems."
"I therefore support the motion for a resolution, which sets out economic and employment policy guidelines for the Member States."
"'Europe 2020' is nothing less than a project comprising all the measures that the European Union must adopt to bring down by at least 20 million the number of people living in or at risk of poverty. Although ambitious, that target is the guiding principle behind the European Union's economic activity."
"That, of course, includes responsible activity aimed at changing the economic strategy itself, as far as the Member States are concerned, but even before that it is necessary for all the European institutions to work together towards a single goal."
"With the motion for a resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy, Parliament has today adopted a series of proposals for the Council, so that together we can achieve the final target without crushing the hopes of every European citizen."
"These requirements pertain to the need to work with the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in drawing up a package of measures in the fields of energy, food security, climate change, health, youth policy, research and, above all, industrial policy aimed at creating strong social protection systems and cutting the unemployment rate."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which underlines that the Europe 2020 actions are of crucial importance to the future prospects of all European citizens, delivering sustainable jobs, long-term economic growth, and social progress; fears that the Europe 2020 Strategy will not be able to deliver on its promises due to its weak governance structure, and strongly urges the Council, therefore, to strengthen the Community method; reiterates the importance of integrating the EU 2020 goals into the economic governance framework and calls for the European Semester to be part of the legislative governance package, while including national parliaments and social partners at an early stage in order to foster democratic accountability, ownership and legitimacy; stresses that the achievement of Europe 2020 is essential and not optional."
"in writing. - (RO) The economic crisis has had a disproportionate impact on social groups."
"It is alarming that the youth unemployment rate is double the average European rate."
"Reform programmes are needed to mitigate the effects of the crisis, which will result in the creation of jobs."
"In this context, I can mention the measures adopted by the Romanian Government aimed at encouraging entrepreneurial initiative among young people."
"In addition to increasing the number of jobs, it is also vital to improve their quality."
"We can achieve this objective by encouraging research and innovation, by having the business sector involved more in academic life and by adapting the school curriculum to the needs of the labour market."
"In this regard, studies need to be carried out on economic development in Member States."
"In particular, they need to be coordinated at EU level and those areas need to be identified where the European Union can develop a comparative edge on the global market."
"Furthermore, recognition of diplomas at EU level would facilitate the free movement of labour and support the creation of a proper single European market."
"We will only be able to achieve the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy by devising specific proposals and allocating sufficient funds."
"Otherwise, we risk facing failure, just as happened in the case of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This motion for a resolution endorses the Lisbon 'social breakdown' Strategy of which Europe 2020 is the continuation."
"What is worse, it makes it easier to control the national budgets via the European semester and promotes free trade."
"I voted against it."
"The goal of the Europe 2020 Strategy is to lead Europe to recover from the crisis and emerge from it strengthened through job creation, and through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"This is to be based on the European Union's five major objectives, namely: promoting employment; improving conditions for research, development and innovation; meeting climate change and energy targets; increasing levels of education; and promoting social inclusion, in particular by reducing poverty."
"These objectives are ambitious and we all need to make an extra effort to achieve them for the good of the EU and its citizens."
"I reject the motion for a resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy as I think it continues along the anti-social lines of the Brussels Consensus, which does not concern itself with the European people, but is designed to consolidate the neoliberal policies that have led us to the serious economic crisis that we are suffering."
"This crisis that we are going through is not a natural disaster but rather the consequence of the way in which the conservative, liberal and social democrat political forces have moved from the Washington Consensus to the Brussels Consensus, imposing no public intervention in the economy, pay restraint, and the privatisation of public services and of the main businesses in key sectors of the economy, such as energy and telecommunications."
"We already know the consequences of these neoliberal measures and of the Brussels Consensus: crisis, widespread unemployment, poverty and cuts in workers' rights and the welfare state."
"I therefore voted against this resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy, because I consider this 'new' strategy to be more of the same: neoliberal measures that do not incorporate the necessary distribution of wealth, and improvement of the social and employment rights of the European people."
"The realisation of the Europe 2020 Strategy is of fundamental significance for strengthening the EU and should not be merely an adjunct."
"The strategy is intended to promote the future prospects of European citizens as regards secure and sustainable jobs, long-term economic growth and social progress."
"If we are to implement this, the Community method needs to be reinforced and the objectives included in our economic policies."
"In order to guarantee the financing of the strategy it is essential that we have a catalogue of political initiatives, which no doubt includes the involvement of the EIB and EBRD as well as attracting private financing."
"Rejuvenating the internal market should also enable us to advance the ambitious aims more quickly and more effectively."
"In addition, there are numerous flagship initiatives such as Innovation Union, Youth on the Move and An Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, to name but a few."
"I did not vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, mainly because the financing of the Europe 2020 Strategy was unable to be resolved."
"I should like to comment on the motion for a resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy which has been adopted by the European Parliament."
"I fully agree with the position of Parliament, and I think we should strengthen the structure of governance of the strategy, because what has been done to date has not been specific enough and so has not been very effective."
"In my opinion, gender equality is the key factor for achieving the ambitions of Europe 2020."
"Above all, we need to increase the proportion of women in work by eliminating by 2020 the current pay gap between women and men (the strategy assumes this will be done by 1% per year, in order to close the gap by 10% by 2020)."
"Another very important question is the reduction of poverty among women."
"Iit is estimated that 17% of women live in poverty, and that most of these are lone mothers and immigrants."
"The objectives of the strategy can be achieved principally by education and training."
"I am thinking, here, of financial support for young people and support for programmes related to the mobility of students and academic staff."
"Major emphasis should also be given to training and programmes which support a change of qualifications."
"The need to emerge from the economic crisis, ensure sustainability and develop a 'smart economy' are the underlying objectives of the strategy that will mark out the future context of the European Union's market economy."
"High employment levels favouring social and territorial cohesion, productivity, efficient resource use, innovation and especially stronger economic governance should be the foundations of Europe's new path."
"They will be the subjects of our work over the coming years, based on which the Council's deliberations, the Commission's assessments and proposals and Parliament's political guidance should lead to concrete conclusions."
"For all the reasons above, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"This resolution will supplement the initial proposal, highlighting the need to strengthen the strategy's governance proposals and calling on the Member States to give more careful thought to the ambitions of the strategy from a budgetary viewpoint and to focus on fighting unemployment through national programmes of reform."
"The first signs from the implementation of the EU strategy for this decade are not particularly encouraging, just as the results of the Lisbon Strategy were not encouraging."
"It is clear from economic developments in the euro area and the problems of monetary union which the debt crisis highlighted in the region, that the Europe 2020 Strategy needs to focus on budgetary stability, policies for growth and the need for European economic governance, if it wants the ambitious targets it has set, such as increasing youth employment to 75% and increasing investments in research to 3%, not to end up as simple symbolic pronouncements."
"The motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on the Europe 2020 Strategy moves in this direction and I voted for it."
"The document Europe 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sets out a series of measures that should help Europe to recover from the crisis and emerge from it strengthened through job creation, and through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"This is to be based on the EU's five great objectives: promoting employment; improving conditions for research, development and innovation; meeting climate change and energy targets; increasing levels of education; and promoting social inclusion, in particular by reducing poverty."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution because I agree with the proposals tabled by the European Parliament, specifically the need for the governance of the Europe 2020 Strategy to be strengthened."
"We cannot over-emphasise the actions taken under the banner of the 'Europe 2020' Strategy are crucial to realising the expectations of the European public."
"in writing. - Among the articles that brought us to support that text, is Article 12, which: welcomes the flagship initiative on 'Innovation Union' as a key driver to achieve Europe 2020 objectives, which addresses the major societal challenges like energy and food security, climate change, health and an ageing population; recalls that the 3% target is composed of a 2% (private expenditure) share and a 1% (public expenditure) share; notes that there are still particular shortcomings in the field of private research spending which can only be overcome by adapting the regulatory environment for companies, including SMEs and welcomes, therefore, the Commission's intention to improve framework conditions for business to innovate, in particular with respect to intellectual property rights."
"Europe is facing a difficult challenge: to cut unemployment and at the same time build a people-oriented economy."
"We realise that the Europe 2020 Strategy has high ambitions and requires us to stand firm at both national and European levels."
"The global economic crisis has unfortunately wiped out many of the results achieved so far, showing just how fragile the national economies often are."
"That is why now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts, sustained by the principle that together we are stronger."
"No Member State should or can effectively tackle global challenges by acting alone."
"To revive the challenge of sustainable growth, we have to use all the political means and financial instruments at our disposal."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because stronger coordination of the Member States' employment policies is essential, and that can only be achieved if the common goals are consistent and credible."
"We have to build a new economic model based on knowledge and high employment."
"This challenge marks the beginning of a new stage of European integration, one that pays greater attention to employment and social security and mobilises all the actors present in Europe."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy establishes European Union goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for the coming years."
"There are certain crucial aspects to achieving this goal, such as strengthening the governance and funding of the cohesion policy."
"The current European Union programme should involve increased participation by all stakeholders in setting out its policies and implementing actions, as this is suggested to be the main cause of the Lisbon Strategy's failure."
"Therefore, all institutional actors - at European, national, regional and local level - must be called on, as well as civil society, to implement this strategy."
"In this context, I would stress the need to implement the Territorial Pact of Local and Regional Authorities for Europe 2020."
"Strong cohesion policy is needed for all European regions, as an essential prerequisite for implementing the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The cohesion policy is cross-cutting in nature and is therefore a key element in the strategy's success, so its complementary nature should be made clear."
"Economic growth and an atmosphere of job creation should be incentivised as part of this programme, in order to reserve a particular role for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), which are the engine of European economic growth."
"For the above reasons, I voted for this motion for a resolution in plenary."
"in writing. - The Commission's EU 2020 Strategy is essential in order to enhance the EU's growth and competitiveness as it emerges from the economic crisis."
"However, its objectives can only be achieved with a coordinated and focused approach from all member states."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the Europe 2020 Strategy because I believe that it sets out the need for Member States to be completely committed to the strategy's targets."
"The resolution calls for the economic governance of the EU 2020 strategy to be better coordinated and I fully support this because it outlines the need for a credible funding framework to be established by national governments."
"Member States should also ensure that policies, as well as budgets, are aligned with EU 2020 targets, especially with regards to objectives such as tackling unemployment and social inclusion."
"I also welcome the resolution's proposals that the next Multiannual Financial Framework should reflect EU 2020 ambitions."
"The employment guidelines proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council present the European Union's current common priorities and Member States' objectives regarding their national employment policies."
"Some of the EU-level employment guidelines entail increasing participation in the labour market, including that of specific population sub-groups, reducing structural unemployment and promoting the quality of jobs, developing a well-qualified workforce which will meet the labour market's needs and improving the performance of education systems which will provide vocational training at every level."
"I think that Member States and the European Union must get involved in drawing up a coordinated employment strategy which will promote a skilled, qualified and adaptable workforce, as well as labour markets capable of responding quickly to the economy's development."
"I also support the initiative from the rapporteur to promote the battle against social exclusion and the reduction of poverty, key objectives in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"These are the reasons why I voted for this resolution."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because there is an urgent need to step up efforts at all levels to ensure that the European Union employment guidelines are properly implemented."
"Only by properly implementing these guidelines will it be possible to increase labour market participation, develop a skilled workforce, and improve the quality and performance of education and training systems."
"Furthermore, the goal of the guidelines for the employment policies is to ensure that, under the Europe 2020 Strategy and economic governance, the employment targets are achieved and sustainable economic growth and social progress are guaranteed."
"I believe that it is very important for the Member States to make every effort to deliver on the commitments made to increase employment levels, improve people's skills, create job opportunities, reduce poverty and enhance social inclusion."
"The European Commission and the Member States must be ready to ensure that these guidelines are implemented together with social partners and regional and local institutions, which must participate in drawing up and implementing national reform programmes."
"As a result of the economic and financial crisis, the situation in Europe's labour market is still tense and therefore combating unemployment must be one of the most important policy priorities for both the European Union and Member States."
"The European Employment Strategy and the national strategies applied by the Member States are among the main instruments designed to ensure the Europe 2020 Strategy objectives are achieved."
"It is therefore very important to work with the business sector and social partners to implement the employment policy guidelines correctly and effectively."
"I enthusiastically welcome the guidelines and concerns set out in the proposal: the need to strengthen government responsibility and create ambitious targets, in order to achieve the goals stipulated in the 2020 Strategy; the need to ensure that the employment policy guidelines are implemented; and the need to ensure that job creation is given the highest priority in the National Reform Programmes."
"The Union lacks a strong horizontal policy to combat unemployment and social exclusion, which would undeniably involve a cohesive economic governance package suited to responding to the needs of the Union and its Member States; it would also require ambitious targets such as those set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy to be achieved."
"This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States rests on a number of pillars, of which I would highlight: the current economic crisis, which is increasing unemployment and social exclusion; the need to create synergies that encourage development with a view to pursuing the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy; and the Commission's proposal that, under the terms of the Annual Growth Survey, the same employment policy guidelines should be adopted for 2011 as for 2010."
"To overcome this situation, it is crucial to make a joint effort at all levels: governments, social partners and civil society."
"The European Union is playing a crucial role here in directing the policies to be followed and in respect for the principle of subsidiarity, by encouraging social dialogue and promoting the adoption of fair and effective measures."
"I hope that these guidelines will contribute to helping to overcome the crisis, consolidate social-protection systems and relaunch the economy so that we can achieve the goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"We find it regrettable that the European Commission is maintaining the same employment policy guidelines as those adopted for 2010, so we are maintaining the same critical position as we adopted then."
"Although the European Parliament's motion for aresolution makes some criticisms of the policies that have been followed and calls for the very limited social objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy to be met, it does not get to the root of the problem of unemployment and job insecurity, it does not seek to eliminate their causes, it does not resolve to revoke these austerity programmes, and it does not make serious criticisms of the demands being made of the Member States with the most serious difficulties in blindly complying with the ridiculous criteria of the Stability Pact."
"On the contrary, it puts forward the opinion that the tools included in the European Semester are a positive response, forgetting that the European Commission's proposals on so-called 'economic governance' not only constitute an attack on the Member States' sovereignty, but will also aggravate the social situation by continuing to prioritise monetary criteria over social welfare and progress."
"Following the Commission communication on the Annual Growth Survey: advancing the EU's comprehensive response to the crisis, Parliament, myself included, has voted in favour of a resolution urging the Council and the Commission to work together to achieve our employment targets, as contained in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"In the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Berès, we need to provide the Member States with policy advice without, however, interfering too much in national policy, and to supply guidelines so that the interested parties can all work to the same plan."
"The lack of jobs, particularly in recent years, is a serious problem and must be tackled with a dash of ambition to ensure that by 2020 we can guarantee 75% of Europeans decent, secure jobs that meet the needs of the wide range of people who are preparing for the world of work."
"A particular effort is needed for certain groups, including women - especially mothers - young people and immigrants."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which stresses the importance of policies facilitating the transition of young people from school to work; stresses that it is clear that early school leavers are a group at high risk of poverty, and emphasises that any flexible or temporary forms of work used in this context should incorporate the right to training and access to social security and ensure that people make the transition into more secure employment."
"During these years in which we are recovering from the economic and financial crisis that has hit many countries in the Union, when our governments are striving to implement common policies and strategies in order to attain the goals that we have all identified and decided to pursue together, I believe it is important to acknowledge Parliament's deserved and rightful central position as the most representative institution in the European Union."
"It is a matter of acknowledging its representativeness and its function, not least with regard to the provisions of the Treaties."
"The importance of the economic and employment policy guidelines must certainly be a focus of the European Semester and must adapt to the variations in the Annual Growth Survey and to our countries' implementation times."
"The consultative function deserves the right amount of space and the time needed for analysis and adjustment to the general framework."
"I therefore declare that I voted in favour."
"The guidelines for employment are synonyms for an increased retirement age and a flexible labour market."
"Although this motion for a resolution has the virtue of reminding the EU that wage policy is a national responsibility, it still endorses the above."
"I therefore voted against it."
"The European Employment Strategy and the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are some of the main instruments aiming to guide the policy of the European Union and the Member States in achieving the objectives and targets set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Combating unemployment and creating sustainable jobs is the European Union's great challenge for the next 10 years, and we must all play our part in making it a success."
"One of the key objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy is to achieve an employment rate of 75%."
"The economic crisis faced by the EU continues to pose the challenge of how to curb increasing unemployment and social exclusion."
"The European employment strategy and its guidelines therefore represent an important instrument for curbing unemployment."
"It is also intended to steer efforts by the Member States in the right direction."
"As a result, the Member States are required to include social partners, regional and local authorities as well as civil society in their actions."
"In addition, it should be able to be guaranteed that both employment policy guidelines and the creation of new jobs will be ensured."
"To underline the seriousness of this key objective, the Member States are in future required to submit reports on their progress."
"In addition, the individual Member States are required to pay attention to national objectives, including the problems of integrating sub-groups such as women, people with disabilities and older workers, as well as the problem of the working poor."
"I did not vote in favour of the motion for a resolution because in my opinion there is too much interference with national law here, particularly in the area of the regulation of social partners."
"The implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States is crucial for the implementation of the guidelines included in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"European Parliament involvement in these policies must not be neglected."
"Debate encourages ideas, and ideas and strategies are needed to overcome the current economic crisis."
"There are a number of important concerns in this motion for a resolution that I share: ensuring that the employment guidelines are implemented; stepping up action to deliver on more and better jobs; and acting decisively to deliver on fighting poverty and social exclusion."
"In order to ensure success in all these policies, it is crucial to make a joint effort at all levels: governments, social partners and civil society."
"in writing. - In this resolution, Parliament (1) considers that, in the light of the Commission's proposal to maintain the employment policy guidelines adopted in 2010 for 2011, the recommendations on the Member States' national reform programmes (NRPs) have become the main macroeconomic surveillance and orientation tool, and deplores the failure to involve Parliament in this process and the lack of debate concerning it; and (2) considers that the major challenges faced by the EU and the Member States with regard to employment and unemployment should also be duly reflected in the future process to address macroeconomic imbalances, within the policy framework of the European Employment Guidelines;"
"I am voting for this report because I agree with the rapporteur's position on the need to keep the Employment Guidelines stable until the midterm review of the Europe 2020Sstrategy."
"The integrated economic and employment policy guidelines must be the main thrust of the European Semester, and if the key messages of the annual growth survey depart from the content of the guidelines, these should consequently be amended to ensure consistency."
"I also agree with the involvement of stakeholders in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the National Reform Programmes."
"I would also stress the recommendations of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) so that the importance of the guidelines for the economic and employment policies of the Member States should not be diminished in order to achieve ownership and democratic accountability."
"in writing. - (LT) Following the assessment of preliminary National Reform Programmes (NRPs), the European Commission presented a proposal to keep the employment guidelines adopted by the Council last year stable until 2014 in order to devote most attention to their implementation."
"This proposal by the Commission is understandable because the employment guidelines are an integral part of the Europe 2020 Strategy and they must be fully transposed into the Member States' national programmes, and therefore the Member States should focus as much as possible on their implementation."
"Although these guidelines will not be reviewed annually as a rule, the main priority of the European Union's employment strategy must continue to be full employment which would increase economic growth and competitiveness and strengthen social cohesion."
"The examination of the Member States' draft National Reform Programmes shows that Member States should continue to make every effort to address the following priority areas: increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs, promoting lifelong learning, improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education, promoting social inclusion and combating poverty."
"I would therefore like to call on the Member States to ensure the employment and social policy is implemented as effectively as possible, by drawing up, observing and assessing these national programmes."
"I would like to express my concern at the current employment situation."
"I would argue that unemployment is the real social problem of today."
"Although good signs of recovery can be glimpsed at a macro-economic level, industry cannot reabsorb all the workers that it has laid off in recent months, who now face the difficulty of re-entering the labour market."
"The same applies to young people and women."
"These problems are extremely important and pressing."
"Among the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Commission prioritised increasing employment, strengthening the single market and encouraging growth."
"The European Union and this Parliament in particular have done well in tackling the problem, but concrete action is needed to attain these goals."
"The EU must work towards channelling and rationalising its resources, while investing in transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure: in this respect, the turning point will be the creation of project companies guaranteed and financed by project bonds."
"That will both enable the Union to retain its competitive edge in the global market and provide people with new job opportunities."
"The whole system should be put into practice, albeit step by step, as soon as possible."
"I voted against the Beres report on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States."
"The report proposes that the integrated economic policy and employment guidelines for the Member States adopted for 2010 should be upheld in 2011 and thus that the Europe 2020 Strategy should be fully integrated into National Reform Programmes."
"Unfortunately, the report calls for the same economic policies and the same employment guidelines to be applied that resulted in the crisis and the failure to deal with it. It calls for the same political choices and practices to be followed that made Europeans suffer austerity measures and sovereign Member States fall prey to the speculation mafia."
"Finally, it calls for the employment policies that have resulted in a mediaeval labour market, that have increased unemployment and under-employment, that promote flexible forms of work and attack the wages and pensions and rights of European workers, especially young workers, to be continued."
"I voted for this report because I advocate an annual review of the Europe 2020 Strategy, the main focus of which should be the integrated economic and employment policy guidelines."
"It is necessary for the Commission and the Council to ensure that the integrated guidelines constitute the main thrust of the European Semester."
"The involvement of stakeholders, including the social partners and parliamentary bodies in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the National Reform Programmes, is a crucial element of effective governance of the employment and social policies by the Member States."
"As I said about the report by my colleagues Ms Gruny and Mr Ory, 'society has evolved, the world has changed, and labour relations must accompany this change'. For that very reason, I believe that the review of the employment guidelines under the umbrella of the Europe 2020 Strategy should commit to flexibility and to new ways of working as a way of fostering economic development and of combating poverty."
"Given that the crisis has meant that the number of unemployed people in Europe has increased from 16 million in 2008 to 23 million in 2010, any exit strategy has to involve the recovery of jobs."
"This is only possible if there is a clear focus on innovation, flexible working and new models for work, and training for young people in an increasingly competitive market."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy leaves the way open to these, and the Member States must make proper use of them so as to boost employment and give impetus to the European economy."
"The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union obliges the Council to produce guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States every year and to consult the European Parliament before adopting these decisions."
"These, then, are the circumstances under which we are asked to give our opinion on this matter."
"The economic and financial situation being experienced by the majority of the countries requires the attention given to the Member States' employment policies to be redoubled."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy sets out these guidelines, but it is necessary for all Member States to transpose these guidelines and turn them into concrete measures to be integrated into the National Reform Programmes that they have to submit this April."
"I agree with the rapporteur's recommendations, so I am voting in favour of this proposal for a Council decision on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States."
"We disagree that the European Commission should maintain the same employment policy guidelines for 2011 as those adopted for 2010, so we are maintaining the same critical position as we adopted then."
"In fact, the aforementioned guidelines are clearly inadequate when we look at the figures relating to the 25 million unemployed and 30 million people in precarious or poorly paid jobs."
"It is also unacceptable that the European Parliament supports the close link between these guidelines and the neoliberal economic measures that the Commission continues to develop, specifically those included in the Europe 2020 Strategy, or also in the six pieces of legislation included in the package of the so-called 'European Semester'."
"It is well known that the European Commission's proposals on so-called 'economic governance' not only constitute an attack on the Member States' sovereignty but will worsen the social situation by continuing to prioritise monetary criteria over social welfare and well-being."
"For all these reasons, we voted against this report."
"In view of the ageing of society, demographic changes indicating a movement of population from rural to urban areas and the increasing stratification of society in terms of income, it is essential to take preventative action."
"Particularly adverse phenomena are to be seen in rural areas, where the number of young people wanting to take over the running of farms continues to fall."
"They are leaving rural areas to get away from low incomes and poor access to services."
"Those who stay cannot find work outside of agriculture."
"In the worst situation, however, are the female residents of rural areas, who very rarely are the owners of farms, but despite this they work very hard on their husband's farm."
"This is why it is essential to keep young farmers in rural areas by guaranteeing them a decent income and standard of living."
"Those, however, who do not find work in rural areas, should be guaranteed education which will allow them to find employment."
"Also needed is a campaign to persuade people to join the Lifelong Learning Programme and to retrain."
"It is also essential to have programmes which support the enterprise of women and make it easier for women to run their own business, including businesses not connected with agriculture."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Following the assessment of preliminary National Reform Programmes (NRPs) presented by the Member States under the Europe 2020 strategy, and in parallel with the presentation of the first Annual Growth Survey, the Commission adopted on 12 January a proposal for a Council decision that suggested confirming the validity, for 2011, of the integrated economic policy and employment guidelines of the Member States adopted in 2010."
"This proposal takes account of the fact that the new Europe 2020 integrated guidelines are to be fully transposed into the policy measures and sequencing of the reforms of the Member States to be presented in the final NRPs due in April 2011."
"Furthermore, the Commission's proposal is based on the commitment included in the Employment Guidelines of 2010 to keep the guidelines stable, as far as possible, until 2014 so that the Member States can focus on their implementation"
"This report endorses the harmful employment guidelines of the Commission and the Council."
"It actually supports EU authoritarianism where increasing the retirement age, creating a flexible labour market and cutting budgets and wages are concerned."
"The rapporteur also endorses this."
"She is, all the same, a member of a party that claims to be socialist."
"I voted against the report."
"The European Employment Strategy and the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States are some of the main instruments aiming to guide the policy of the European Union and the Member States in realising the objectives and targets set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Combating unemployment and creating sustainable jobs is the EU's great challenge for the next 10 years, and we must all play our part in making it a success."
"We must stress the importance of focusing the annual review of the Europe 2020 Strategy on the integrated economic policy and employment guidelines."
"I am against this report on the employment policies of the Member States essentially for one reason, which is that it repeats and includes the guidelines adopted by this House last September, which sought to facilitate access to employment for the Roma people."
"I agree with facilitating access to the labour market for people with different abilities, the young, the elderly and women, but I really fail to understand on what grounds we should particularly facilitate access for a given (and rather problematic) ethnic group such as the Roma."
"I voted in favour of the Berès report because, with the adoption of this text, the Member States will, according to the Europe 2020 Strategy, have to present their 2010 employment initiatives and guidelines by April 2011."
"The Commission's proposal to maintain the guidelines for the Member States' employment policies adopted in 2010 for 2011 is perfectly in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy and is supported by Parliament through this report."
"All EU Member States are therefore called on to fight unemployment, especially youth unemployment, by means of constructive proposals with precise deadlines for providing a concrete response to the problem of employment and poverty."
"I am voting for this proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States and I agree with the rapporteur's recommendations."
"The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union obliges the Council to produce guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States every year and to consult the European Parliament beforehand."
"I believe that it is necessary for the Commission and the Council to ensure that the guidelines are the main thrust of the European Semester."
"The involvement of stakeholders, including the social partners and parliamentary bodies in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the National Reform Programmes, is a crucial element of effective governance of the employment and social policies by the Member States."
"Without the Member States' profound involvement, the Europe 2020 Strategy cannot succeed;"
"I hope that this will not come about."
"in writing. - On 12 January 2010, following assessment of preliminary national reform programmes (NRPs) presented by the Member States under the Europe 2020 strategy, and in parallel with the presentation of the first Annual Growth Survey, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision in favour of confirming the validity, for 2011, of the Member States' integrated economic policy and employment guidelines adopted in 2010."
"This proposal takes account of the fact that the new Europe 2020 integrated guidelines are to be fully transposed in the Member States' policy measures and sequencing of reforms to be presented in the final NRPs due in April 2011."
"Furthermore, the Commission's proposal is based on the commitment included in the 2010 Employment Guidelines to keep the guidelines stable, insofar as possible, until 2014 so that the Member States can focus on their implementation."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Berès because I agree with what it says about the policies that should be adopted to promote employment in the European Union."
"The new Europe 2020 integrated guidelines must be fully included in the Member States' policy measures and initiatives."
"Each individual Member State's ongoing commitment to stick to the 2014 targets will be crucial."
"Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, remains one of the targets requiring the greatest commitment from us to tackle it at its roots, because it reduces not only immediate spending power but also all future investment strategies, causing very serious social unease that goes beyond mere economic factors."
"It is not only the number of jobs that must be increased, but also their quality, and this requires action particularly by the Member States, which must also maintain their commitment to fighting poverty and promoting social inclusion."
"Unemployment is a major problem and a difficult one to solve."
"It puts a drain on public finances."
"On the expenditure side, amounts paid as benefits and other social allowances go up, increasing the cost of various kinds of programme for combating unemployment and for encouraging a return to work."
"On the income side there is no production and no tax is collected."
"The number of unemployed people in the Union has reached over 23 million, which means that in the last year half a million people have lost their jobs."
"Every effort should be made to achieve the target set in EU2020 of raising the level of employment among people in the 20-64 age bracket to 75%."
"Let us remember that unemployment is highest among citizens under 25 - over 20%."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution because I believe it is necessary to face up to the increasing volatility in food prices and commodities, with an increase of around 90% in 2010, which have led to problems in the operation of the food supply chains that make the measures proposed in this resolution necessary."
"These measures include internal action, such as: a strong common agricultural policy that is capable of compensating farmers facing increased costs; greater commitment to small, organic farms producing for local consumption; tabling adequate proposals relating to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Market Abuse Directive; giving the European Securities and Markets Authority more powers to oversee raw materials markets or even to issue a mandate to regulators and supervisory bodies to restrict speculation."
"The European Union also needs a strategy at global level to combat speculation, which includes international coordination of a mechanism to prevent excessive price fluctuation and the creation of specific regulation to be applied to the greatest possible number of countries."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on rising food prices."
"Food prices have peaked for the seventh consecutive month between 2010 and 2011, reaching the highest levels since 1990."
"Commodity price hikes have become a destabilising factor in the global economy, which have helped spark riots and unrest in a number of developing countries and most recently in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt."
"Poverty and famine still exist in the European Union, and 79 million people still live below the poverty line."
"I therefore agree with the call made in the resolution for immediate action to ensure food security for EU citizens and at global level."
"It is also very important for food to be available to consumers at reasonable prices, and, at the same time, for a fair standard of living to be ensured for farmers."
"I therefore call on the EU to support rural development, increasing investment in food security, and taking particular account of urgent hunger needs, small-scale farming and social protection programmes."
"The index of food prices on the financial markets has shown an uncontrollable rise in these prices over recent months, due to the international economic and financial crisis and also the recent environmental disasters resulting from climate change."
"The situation is aggravated even further by speculation, which has been responsible for up to 50% of the price rises, preventing many people from enjoying food security and generating political instability especially in poorer nations."
"As we know, this can have a domino effect and end up threatening peace and security in other countries."
"Food security is a fundamental human right and is included among the Millennium Development Goals, as well as being a common agricultural policy objective."
"The European Union therefore has a duty to confirm both its commitment to establish a sound agricultural and rural development policy and also its support for research and technological innovation aimed at improving productivity, while meeting energy efficiency and sustainability requirements."
"Sustainability also means promoting the production and marketing of traditional local produce, by offering suitable financial incentives and the chance for small and medium-sized enterprises to access credit."
"I believe it is equally important to adopt clear and transparent regulations to prevent speculation, which is particularly damaging to the health of many Europeans, and to make Europe's agricultural production competitive."
"The popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the mass demonstrations in a series of other countries are directly challenging poverty and unemployment."
"The angry demonstrations by people living below the poverty line highlight the dead end into which the general economic crisis and their efforts to shift the burden of it on to the workers have brought the political forces of capital and its political representatives The FAO emphasised just a few years ago that the number of people who found it difficult or impossible to obtain the food they needed in order to survive was higher than ever before in the history of mankind, having passed the 1 billion mark, and that this would inevitably cause serious social unrest."
"The problem of poverty in the world is not a matter of inadequate resources; it is the result of imperialist aggression and capitalist exploitation of natural resources based solely on the profit motive."
"Food prices did not stop rising after the 2007 food crisis; on the contrary, they continued to rise even more sharply."
"Within the context of the economic crisis, stock exchange gambling on the back of farm production and human hunger is the way to over-concentrate capital and maintain its profitability."
"In 2010, agricultural produce generated the biggest gains on the stock exchanges."
"Rising food prices in the European Union and worldwide pose a major problem in 2011."
"There are different causes for this and it is difficult to anticipate and control them."
"However, there are also causes which we can and need to control."
"A slow supply chain with too many intermediaries, natural disasters caused by climate change, low incomes earned in the agricultural sector or the volatility of the agricultural product market are just some of the reasons why the price of agricultural products has risen in an unacceptable manner across Europe."
"I think that decision makers at European level must make reducing food prices a major objective on the European and global political agenda."
"Obviously, we are not talking about interfering in the operation of the free market, but about eliminating the speculative behaviour which sponges unjustifiably off the demand and supply chain, having an illegal influence on and distorting how prices are set."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution as Europe needs measures to ensure that food prices are not increased artificially by intermediaries involved in speculation."
"The European Union needs to simplify the food supply chain so that parasitic intermediaries are removed from the trade cycle."
"This will allow both citizens and producers to benefit, while making it easier to overcome the economic crisis."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this document."
"Although, according to forecasts, global cereal, wheat and sugar stocks will be higher than in 2007 and there does not seem to be any recurrence of the situation that led to the food crisis in 2008, there is an over-reaction by the markets, causing excessive volatility, which can be explained by the actions of speculators' investments funds."
"Furthermore, whole sectors of the agricultural industry are under threat."
"I see this situation in my own country, Romania."
"Indeed, the 5% increase in the VAT rate, which has reached 24%, was reflected immediately in price rises."
"It is difficult to accept that a livestock farmer toiling day in day out is the victim of a market game which is played tens of thousands of kilometres away on the computers of companies which have nothing to do with agriculture, but have sufficient money to destabilise global markets."
"In our report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security, adopted in December, we stated that the right to food security is a fundamental human right, and that the EU has a duty to feed its citizens."
"In line with our position, it is our duty today to denounce the rise in food prices, which have soared over the last seven months."
"There are many reasons for this rise, but we should focus above all on price volatility and speculation on basic foodstuffs, since they destabilise our economies and create uncertainty."
"Stopping speculation is absolutely crucial, as is combating climate change."
"Indeed, food security and climatic and environmental conditions are closely linked; they make the coordination of environmental and agricultural policies vitally important."
"We should also turn our attention to developing countries and support them in their efforts to achieve food self-sufficiency, in contrast to everything that has been done in recent years."
"The challenge is huge: in Europe alone, almost 80 million people still live below the poverty line."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because there is a need to take specific action to ensure food security for EU citizens and at global level."
"Food prices have peaked for the seventh consecutive month between 2010 and 2011, reaching the highest levels since the Food and Agriculture Organisation started measuring food prices in 1990."
"Commodity price hikes have become a destabilising factor in a number of developing countries."
"Furthermore, the recent riots and unrest in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt have had a significant impact on this."
"Food must be available to consumers at reasonable prices, and, at the same time, a fair standard of living should be ensured for farmers."
"The European Union therefore has a duty to ensure food security for its citizens."
"Attention should be drawn to declining farm incomes in the EU, caused by rising production costs and price volatility, which impact negatively on farmers' ability to maintain production."
"There is also a need to highlight the costs that European farmers have to bear in meeting the highest food safety, environmental, animal welfare and labour standards in the world."
"Farmers should be compensated for these additional costs and for providing public goods to society."
"I abstained from the vote on rising food prices."
"The motion for a resolution contains a number of positive points, such as the priority of the agricultural sector in development policy."
"However, important points contained in the initial motion for a resolution by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left are missing from the joint motion for a resolution."
"To be precise, no link is made between the food crisis and the price rises caused by the agricultural and trade policies applied and, therefore, no proposal is made to change that framework."
"Also, the motion for a resolution calls for the food problem to be resolved by the World Trade Organisation and the G20, which is not only contrary to the demands by farmers; it also replaces the UN framework, thereby promoting decisions by the same people who caused and perpetuated the problem with their political choices."
"Also, the motion for a resolution does not make any reference whatsoever to the basic concept of food sovereignty, even though it is prerequisite to food security."
"Finally, it addresses the problem of speculation and rising food prices in a very inadequate manner, by referring simply to 'transparency' in food prices, with no mention as to how to put an end to financial mechanisms which can be used to create speculation."
"in writing. - (DA) We have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on rising food prices."
"We recognise the fact that we currently have major problems in the food sector, and in this regard we believe that we can achieve a great deal by intervening with regard to speculation on foodstuffs."
"That is why we have voted in favour of this resolution."
"However, we do not support an increase in the budget for the EU's agricultural aid, nor do we support an extension of the market management instruments."
"Furthermore, we are not in favour of the increased use of GMOs in food production."
"Global food prices have reached dramatic levels recently."
"Indeed, last December they overtook the prices recorded at the peak of the economic crisis."
"The UN stated recently that it considered improbable the scenario where excessive demand in relation to supply would be behind these price fluctuations."
"In the mid-1990s a speculative market was created which had food products at its heart and has grown during the financial crisis."
"Speculators are currently taking advantage of the lack of regulation of the markets, earning millions from this activity."
"This type of speculative behaviour has a direct impact on people's standard of living and can contribute to political instability."
"Therefore, I think that the European Union needs to combat speculation involving food prices through regulation and transparency."
"For this reason, I voted for the motion for a resolution on rising food prices."
"in writing. - (RO) The global economic crisis and the rise in food and fuel prices have caused poverty and hunger for millions of citizens, but especially for poor people living in developing countries, who are the most vulnerable to the adverse impact of price volatility and the food crisis."
"The European Union as a whole is and remains the main producer of food."
"For this reason, common skills must be developed in conducting research and providing training in sustainable farming methods and new technologies so as to ease the collapse of agricultural systems and prevent this crisis temporarily."
"I believe that the European Union and Member States have a duty to adopt a joint commercial strategy which will provide sufficient protection to food markets, and to decide together on their own agricultural and food production policies."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted against the motion for a resolution on rising food prices."
"We welcome the debate on food prices and price fluctuations, particularly with regard to speculation on food commodities and the weak competition in certain parts of the food chain, but we nevertheless do not believe that this resolution provides an adequate description of the problem."
"The claims of direct threats to Europe's food supply are grossly exaggerated."
"We are also opposed to the concern about rising food prices being used to justify a European agricultural policy based on extensive direct subsidies and regulation of the market."
"The resolution's monotonous focus on the agricultural sector means that the significance of other social factors for the ability to deal with substantial price rises is ignored - we are thinking primarily of the lack of democratic institutions in many countries, inequality when it comes to income and weak welfare systems."
"The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) warned in January of possible increases in the price of food products in 2011 after they had hit record highs in 2010 and following the increase during the 2008 food crisis."
"The FAO food price index of 55 basic foodstuffs has increased for the sixth consecutive month to 214.7 points, above the previous record high of 213.5 points that was hit in June 2008."
"As it stands, food prices increased for the seventh consecutive month between 2010 and 2011 to the highest levels since the FAO started analysing food prices in 1990."
"As I have already argued in the past, I believe that concrete measures must be taken in the context of the common agricultural policy to increase production, to better supply markets and to ensure greater price stability, as well as to ensure that production meets Europeans' consumer needs."
"As I have been arguing, agriculture must be viewed as a strategic sector that is crucial to guaranteeing the food security of populations, especially at times of crisis like the one we are experiencing."
"The right to food is a fundamental right that is achieved when all people have permanent physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their requirements for living an active and healthy life."
"I consider it to be an unacceptable failure that hunger exists in the European Union and the world."
"In fact, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that the number of undernourished people in the world reached 925 million in 2010."
"Rising food prices coupled with unpredictable shortages of supply may cause this situation to worsen."
"I therefore advocate a strong and sustainable agricultural sector across the EU and a thriving and sustainable rural environment."
"The common agricultural policy should ensure this objective."
"I would also draw attention to declining farm incomes in the EU, caused by rising production costs and price volatility, which impact negatively on the farmers' ability to maintain production."
"Moreover, European farmers have to meet the highest food safety, environmental, animal welfare and labour standards in the world."
"in writing. - (PT) The motion for a resolution includes several significant aspects, such as: the need to prioritise agriculture in development aid and acknowledge the divestment that has been taking place in this area; the need for strategic stocks and intervention; and the need for market intervention instruments to become a key aspect of the future common agricultural policy, even though these instruments are not specified later and it is true that many people are only advocating so-called 'emergency mechanisms', compatible with the liberalisation of the market that has been pursued."
"Nevertheless, the resolution misses out crucial points and includes others that are negative or even unacceptable."
"It does not mention that the food crisis is the result of current agricultural and trade policies such as the CAP and free trade, and it does not make the fair and necessary criticism of these policies or call for the change that is needed."
"It accepts the integration of agriculture into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), although it does propose measures to mitigate this inclusion; for our part, we maintain that agriculture should remain outside the WTO."
"The basic concept of food sovereignty, which cannot be dissociated from food security, is not touched on."
"The problem of speculation is touched on, but very inadequately."
"The measures suggested do not go much beyond demands for 'greater transparency' in the market, which is clearly insufficient."
"Climate change and speculation on the commodity markets are among the main factors threatening food security both within the European Union and outside."
"Based on this belief, I support the motion for a resolution calling for urgent measures to combat the manipulation of food commodity prices and to ensure that agricultural production is maintained in the EU."
"It is in fact beyond doubt that droughts, floods, fires and storms - phenomena that occur more frequently now than in the past - are reducing agricultural production capacity worldwide."
"Good soil and water management are therefore essential to prevent the loss of farmland."
"It is also necessary to curb the abusive speculation that burdens the markets for food products, agricultural raw materials and energy."
"Food security depends on having a strong policy that guarantees a future for our young farmers and encourages the introduction of more effective and sustainable farming practices in the less developed countries."
"The rise in food prices is unacceptable."
"Poor harvests in Russia and Ukraine cannot possibly explain the 91% rise for wheat, and still less the rise of 57% for maize, 33% for soybean and 32% for sugar."
"Clearly, the crazy world of finance is today speculating on the food markets, without ever wanting to touch the goods themselves, which are constantly bought and sold."
"Access to these markets should be reserved for professional buyers only."
"However, the main problem remains the need to increase world agricultural productivity."
"In order to feed 9 billion people better, agricultural production needs to increase by 60-70%."
"Only access to more efficient agriculture will enable us to conquer hunger."
"New seeds, as well as input- and water-saving techniques, will be able to produce the required yields."
"The number of farmers growing GMOs is increasing every year."
"There are more than 14 million of them, working more than 10% of the world's arable land."
"Only Europe claims to want to do without GMOs, even though European livestock is already fed on feedingstuffs of which two thirds come from genetically modified crops from the Americas."
"At a time when food security must be declared a fundamental human right, world food prices have peaked at the beginning of 2011, affecting both producers and consumers within the EU and everyone throughout the world."
"This trend, which is exacerbated by price volatility caused by speculators, is completely unacceptable, when we know that more than a billion people are suffering from poverty and hunger worldwide."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which recommends the introduction of global regulation to prevent speculation from violating the right to food; reaffirms the European Union's commitment to becoming one of the main actors in the field of food and agriculture at global level; takes account of climate change; and encourages the Member States to increase the share of official aid dedicated to agriculture."
"in writing. - (DE) I welcome the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on the current problem of rising food prices."
"The European Union is called on to speed up the progress of the global fight against poverty and hunger; in developing countries this concerns the provision of the very basics of life."
"However, the high prices are also a problem within the EU."
"This situation has come about as a result of commodity shortages, high fuel prices, dependence on harvests and exports, the world market situation and profiteering."
"The only means of guaranteeing the future food supply in Europe is through the common agricultural policy."
"The farmers themselves are equally dependent on reasonable prices; they are facing high production costs."
"Higher consumer prices are not reflected in farming incomes."
"Parliament demands of the Commission that urgent action be taken and that measures be created across all policy areas."
"The current hike in food prices, and especially in the prices of food commodities such as cereals and oilseeds, is primarily due to natural disasters in Russia and Australia."
"Even though this rise in food commodity prices could conceivably boost our European farmers' incomes, we must not forget that the livestock sector is seeing a corresponding hike in the price of animal feed."
"We are painfully aware of the European Union's extreme dependence on supplies of food commodities, which means that food security in Europe is far from being achieved."
"We do not have to go very far - the proof can be found in the countries of North Africa - to realise the dangerous consequences that such uncertainties can have."
"Our life insurance consists in maintaining a common agricultural policy worthy of the name, so as to ensure a fair income for our farmers, and in maintaining productive agriculture in every region of Europe."
"That is why I played an active part in this resolution and why I voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution on rising food prices."
"According to the resolution, food prices have reached the highest levels since the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) started recording them in 1990."
"Anger over soaring food prices has led to great unrest in a number of countries."
"A crucial cause has been speculation by traders and brokers who have no commercial interest in these markets."
"Action must be taken to fight against the excesses of speculation on commodity markets."
"I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution because I agree with all the principles set forth in it."
"I am in favour of producing healthy food in sufficient quantities to contribute effectively to the global demand for food."
"It is essential to ensure income for farmers and create mechanisms to prevent enormous volatility in terms of prices and markets."
"In order to ensure that we will have enough food globally to feed the whole of the world's population, it is essential to support farmers in developing countries."
"We have to ensure that everything is being done to combat climate change at a global level so that natural resources and income from farming do not decrease."
"It is essential to strengthen the farmers' position in the food supply chain."
"In order for the productive sector to prosper, it is essential to evaluate the issue of price increases relating to other outside costs and to speculation on basic agricultural products."
"in writing. - (HU) Food safety is a central issue for Europe and precisely for this reason it demands an unabatedly robust common agricultural policy (CAP) and, as an objective, is unattainable unless we find a solution to the two most important current problems, the volatility of markets and prices, and dwindling food stocks."
"Growing speculation related to agricultural and food commodities lies in the background of the current increase in food prices."
"Investment funds are pumping huge amounts of money into food price speculation, thus forcing consumers to pay prices that exceed the production costs several times."
"Price rises exacerbate the problem of accessibility, in particular for people with low or no income."
"Expenditure on food is one of the main components of family budgets, accounting for 60 to 80% in developing countries and 20 to 30% in the less developed Member States."
"Financial instruments must serve the economy and must help agricultural production overcome major crises and climatic events, and for this reason speculation cannot be permitted to jeopardise agricultural production."
"I condemn speculation in agricultural commodities and raw materials, which contributes to increased price volatility and the deepening of the global food crisis."
"For exactly this reason I agree, and I support, that in the future CAP effective action cannot be taken against major price fluctuations without strategic stocks and so the role of market intervention instruments must be strengthened."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because I support the measures that it contains for combating the obstacles that hamper global food security: commercial speculation, concentration in the food distribution chain, price volatility, low levels of income for farmers and climate change."
"I think that the call for immediate and sustained action to guarantee global food security is positive, and I welcome the re-affirmation of the right to food as a human right."
"I support the call for the EU to increase its rural development aid by investing in social protection programmes and small-scale agriculture, and to undertake effective measures to combat climate change."
"I welcome the fact that the resolution asks the Commission to include compliance with EU-equivalent standards in terms of the environment, animal welfare and food safety and quality in trade negotiations with EU partners."
"I also support the call for the EU to respect and promote the guarantee of a sustainable future for farmers in the context of trade agreements, and not to put European agricultural production, rural agriculture and global access to food at risk."
"Food prices have risen to a record high."
"This rise is resulting in food insecurity for millions of people, destabilising the world economy and causing riots and unrest."
"The international community made a commitment, moreover, to halve world hunger by 2015 as part of the Millennium Development Goals."
"Guaranteeing adequate and regular food for every human being is not only a moral requirement, it is also the fulfilment of a fundamental human right."
"This inalienable and universal right was confirmed during the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly held in Kinshasa in December."
"While the Commission must honour its commitments to developing countries and the least developed countries, it must also promote a strong and sustainable common agricultural policy that reflects the needs of European farmers."
"I share the latter's concerns, because their drop in income as a result of the rise in production costs and of price volatility has meant that they have not benefited from the rise in food prices."
"Effective, coordinated steps must be taken to solve these problems."
"Opulence and waste are unacceptable when the tragedy of hunger is assuming ever greater proportions."
"I agree with the motion for a resolution, but it says nothing about what is to follow."
"It is not enough to establish the single fact that foodstuffs are expensive."
"It is essential that we rapidly develop a management system for the control and optimisation of food prices."
"It is essential to develop an anti-monopolistic and anti-speculative mechanism for regulation and the elimination of abuse."
"Such a mechanism would need to establish a General European Control and Supervision Agency for Prices and Services."
"It would also need to forecast productivity and efficiency in the spheres of production."
"That would offer us the possibility of preventing overproduction and shortages, and reduce losses to a minimum."
"A serious task of analysis is essential."
"That would enable us to define the true costs and avoid destabilisation."
"The combined effect of increased commodity prices, export restrictions, poor harvests as a result of weather conditions, higher transport costs, agricultural speculation and increasing demand is pushing up prices."
"The EU should look at its own behaviour."
"When it is more lucrative to use agricultural land to produce biofuels than for food production it is scarcely any wonder that there is competition for land, with all the negative consequences that this has."
"I took these considerations into account when voting."
"in writing. - (BG) I was pleased to sign and vote in favour of the motion for a resolution on rising food prices, as special measures are needed to ensure the stability of food prices."
"My colleagues and I want a solution to be found to the problems which are at the root of the rising food prices: buyers abusing their dominant position, unfair practices in negotiating prices, lack of information on price formation, the distribution of profit along the food chain and speculation on the commodity markets."
"We want the reform of the common agricultural policy to secure a stable first pillar to maintain the incomes of farmers and to undertake measures to support the market."
"In order to reduce speculation on the commodity markets, the European Parliament wants the Commission to ensure greater transparency by exchanging good and timely information regarding developments on the market."
"In addition, we aim, with this resolution, to improve the position of agricultural producers in the food chain, so that they can get a greater share of the profits in the food industry."
"I also welcome the call for prompter action on the part of the G-20 to coordinate the mechanisms to prevent rising prices and to prepare regulation for dealing with crises which affect food and agriculture."
"The vote was held today on the motion for a resolution on rising food prices."
"Rapidly rising food prices are causing the food security of millions of people to be undermined, both in developed and in developing countries."
"In relation to the fact that the effects of the rise in food prices have been felt most by groups that are in a difficult social situation, Europe, together with third countries and international institutions, should take the following action without delay."
"It is necessary to introduce regulation and oversight at national and international level which will solve the problem of speculation in agricultural markets (dealing with food commodity derivatives restricted as far as possible to investors directly linked with agricultural production)."
"The common agricultural policy should be provided with appropriate market intervention instruments, because I think a strong common agricultural policy is the only guarantee of solving the problem of food security."
"It is very important to set up adequate risk prevention and management measures to limit the consequences of natural disasters for agricultural production."
"Attention should also be given to supporting agricultural production for local and regional consumers."
"Lack of coordination in combating major price fluctuations may contribute to a still greater disproportion in the distribution of food between wealthy countries and poor ones, and in the longer term may endanger us with a food crisis."
"Questions relating to the need to supply food to a continually growing population remain unanswered."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on rising food prices in Europe."
"The right to food is a basic and fundamental human right, and we therefore have to make every effort to ensure that food prices are regulated and accessible to all, paying particular attention to the issue of food accessibility in developing countries."
"I agree with the proposal that the Commission must adopt a new trade and development strategy which would give developing countries greater independence in solving the issue of rising food prices."
"Attention is drawn to the fact that we need to create a favourable support and business environment for farmers, in particular small-scale farmers, Export tax rates must be reduced and we must restrict industrial farming activities that may have a negative impact on food production capacities."
"We must make every effort to ensure that greater support is given to development in the agricultural sector, supporting rural development, introducing innovative production methods and providing effective humanitarian aid."
"Only by implementing measures to prevent concentration along the food supply chain and speculation in agricultural commodities and to reduce production costs, can we limit the rise in food prices."
"Given the need for food and energy security, we must develop alternative energy supply sources and minimise food waste both at EU and national levels."
"So that the measures for combating rising food prices provided for in the resolution function effectively, we must establish an independent regulatory agency and ensure that food safety systems work properly and effectively at regional and local levels."
"The hike in food commodity prices is causing difficulties for the European Union as well."
"They have risen constantly over recent months and have reached the highest levels ever recorded in the history of the Food and Agriculture Organisation."
"That is due to a whole range of factors, including the lack of a global trade agreement, the increase in certain raw material prices and the increased demand for foodstuffs, but it is also due to speculation and 'financial games' that are played out on other markets but have repercussions on the global market."
"Added to that is the opposition between developed and developing economies, in which the latter - which have been hit hard, albeit indirectly, by the crisis - use foodstuffs as the only weapon at their disposal."
"That situation has implications not only for the global market but also for small producers and for consumers, who are faced with sometimes significant price rises for essentials."
"I therefore believe that food security is a priority that must be defended and pursued, and it is both necessary and right to seek a global solution to this instability that is as widely acceptable as possible."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on food prices."
"As a global power in agricultural production, the EU needs to take account of and effectively adapt to emerging challenges, such as extreme weather conditions, limited availability of natural resources, dependence on food imports and increasing speculation in commodities."
"Moreover, the food crisis also applies to Europe."
"Seventy-nine million Europeans, 16% of the population of the EU, are in receipt of food subsidies and price inflation of staples is rising constantly; this, in conjunction with the recession, is being felt very acutely in Greece."
"Clearly Europe needs to produce more today, using fewer resources more efficiently."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution on rising food prices because in six months, the cost of the food basket prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), including 55 of the basic essentials, has increased by 34%."
"In Portugal we have an unsustainable situation for farmers with agricultural diesel approaching 2008's record price of EUR 1 per litre; electricity prices have risen almost 4% and the plan is to end agricultural electricity this year; prices for animal feed, fertiliser and pesticides have also rocketed; and interest rates for agricultural loans are around 6%."
"These are just a few examples."
"I also think that it is unacceptable, at a time when things are made worse by a widespread crisis, that consumers should pay inflated prices without farmers' incomes increasing."
"I argue that the European Commission must face up to its responsibilities and that it should consider the whole chain when it is looking at these serious problems in the agricultural sector and not, as it did with the 'Milk Package', leave out one of the key players: the large retailers."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on rising food prices, because no one can be content with the situation that has prevailed for months and which is primarily affecting small-scale farmers and consumers."
"Cereal prices have even surpassed the highs of 2008, when soaring food prices already caused unrest in Haiti and Egypt."
"While the responses must, first and foremost, be on a global scale and coordinated together with the Food and Agriculture Organisation, they must be extended to Europe, where the objective of price stability must be attained."
"That is why I welcome the adoption of proposals, such as reducing food waste, that are full of common sense, and the request made to the Commission to ensure that dealing with food commodity derivatives is restricted to investors directly linked to agricultural markets."
"These are all measures that make for strong and sustainable European agriculture."
"Commissioner Cioloş rightly reminded us yesterday that Europe is not there to subsidise biofuels, but to promote the use of arable land for food production purposes - it is as simple as that."
"On the eve of the G20 Finance Ministers' meeting, Europe is once again arriving at the negotiating table unprepared."
"Since January 2011, the US administration has been demanding that the positions adopted by financial funds on the agricultural markets be controlled and transparent."
"The Commission must quickly make proposals along these lines."
"This advance is a first step towards denying the speculators what they crave."
"The impact on European livestock farmers is dramatic and immediate, too."
"They can no longer feed their animals."
"Hundreds of farms are going bankrupt."
"Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne."
"Today, it fetches almost EUR 300."
"The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals."
"It would do well today to follow its own advice."
"In the face of this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to come up with solutions."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it strongly criticises the rise in the food commodity price index, which in recent months has reached its highest level for 20 years."
"This has caused social crises, such as the uprisings that have been convulsing the entire Maghreb since December."
"Increased food prices are clearly bringing down living standards for the majority of workers, who as a rule spend 50% of their household income on food products."
"In the European Union alone, around 80 million people still live below the poverty line, and many of them are helped through food aid programmes."
"Poor harvests in the United States, natural disasters in Russia and Brazil, the hike in energy and crude oil prices and the ageing of operators in the farming sector are among the problems that need to be addressed without further ado."
"It is now more important than ever to condemn speculation, and to examine the idea of a European food stock system in order to withstand crises such as the one we are now experiencing."
"The aim is to look for shared, collective strategies to respond promptly to the increased demand for foodstuffs, not least through specific incentive policies to attract young people into the world of farming."
"in writing. - The EPLP is supportive of the resolution drafted in response to the current steep food price hikes we are seeing and their impact on global food security."
"The most recent price increases bring to the fore many of the concerns the EPLP have long held over distortions in the food supply chain, the role speculation can play in exacerbating the situation and the lack of agricultural investment in many developing countries to build up production capacities."
"The EPLP is supportive of the need for a global response to the food security challenge but would also like to stress the role an ambitiously reformed CAP can play in helping to address this challenge."
"A reformed CAP must be in line both with global food security and development policy objectives, abolishing once and for all export refunds, that undermine the ability of developing countries to build up their own agricultural production, limiting market intervention mechanisms, which also serve to distort the market and promoting sustainable agricultural production to help both the agricultural sector mitigate and adapt to climate change, thereby protecting the EU's natural resource base and food production capacity."
"in writing. - (NL) Food safety policy is first and foremost defence policy."
"Any country which fails to provide safe and affordable food to its people and ensure a reasonable standard of living for its farmers is heading towards instability and food riots."
"The right to food is a basic and fundamental human right."
"The text before us rightly emphasises the need for a multidimensional approach."
"The steps needed to ensure safe food have much in common with the steps needed for a more efficient fight against climate change, improved development aid, the development of other commercial structures, greater transparency on the commodity markets and measures against speculation."
"I would have liked the text to have been even stronger, in particular by pressing for the establishment of an independent global agency that will strictly regulate speculation with food commodities."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also wanted to propose actions which are necessary to reduce food waste: 20 to 30 per cent of crops are lost at as early a stage as sowing and harvesting."
"In developing countries half the harvest rots because it is not being stored or transported."
"Meanwhile, consumers and distributors in developed countries throw 40 percent of their food products untouched into the waste bin."
"This is unacceptable and unethical!"
"Finally, I think that food does not belong in the forum of the WTO."
"Food can never be an ordinary commodity."
"Never!"
"I welcome the adoption of this joint motion for a resolution, which highlights the main factors contributing to today's soaring food prices."
"They are: the rise in oil prices; the growing production of biofuels, which is devouring huge swathes of agricultural land; the ever-more frequent occurrence of natural disasters; and speculation on the markets."
"The aim is no longer to supply food products at the best price, but to make as much profit as possible out of them."
"According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, food prices peaked in January, and it is estimated that, when food prices rise by 1%, the nutrition of an additional 16 million people is put at risk."
"Price hikes thus become a huge challenge for developing countries, which already devote almost three quarters of their income to buying basic foodstuffs."
"Consequently, we fear a social and political situation even more dreadful than that during the 2008 'hunger riots'."
"Europe has a vital role to play in guaranteeing global food security."
"Let us hope that the G20 ministers, who will meet in Paris in June, come up with solutions to combat food price volatility."
"The right to food, established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, has been severely affected by the current economic and financial crisis."
"The population growth that is forecast, particularly in emerging economies, and the growing rise in global poverty and hunger demonstrate that at least a 70% increase in food production is needed to satisfy the population's needs."
"At the same time, financial speculation on food commodities that leads to volatility in food commodity prices is adding to this scenario, as are extreme weather events and the constant increase in bioethanol production instead of food."
"I believe that measures urgently need to be taken to combat the destabilisation of the agricultural markets, so supporting farmers and promoting innovation in the sector, whilst reinforcing the role of the common agricultural policy as a key objective of the European Union."
"This cross-cutting issue must be discussed multilaterally as it affects people worldwide and the multiplying effects are indisputable."
"The riots that have taken place in developing countries are examples of this."
"Support for at-risk countries should be reinforced to prevent future food crises."
"in writing. - I supported the resolution drafted in response to rising food prices, which are having an impact on global food security."
"The most recent price increases highlight many of concerns relating to distortions in the food supply chain, the role speculation can play in exacerbating the situation and the lack of agricultural investment in many developing countries to build up production capacities."
"We need a global response to the food security challenge but also to stress the role an ambitiously reformed CAP can play in helping to address this challenge."
"A reformed CAP must be in line with global food security and development policy objectives, abolishing once and for all export refunds that undermine the ability of developing countries to build up their agricultural production."
"Promotion of sustainable agricultural production is necessary in order to help the agricultural sector both mitigate and adapt to climate change, thereby protecting the EU's natural resource base and food production capacity."

"1."
"Border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia"
"Mr President, the border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia at the beginning of this month placed the decades-long conflict over access to the temple of Preah Vihear back in the consciousness of the international public."
"Although the armed clashes have abated somewhat at present, we must push for a political solution to be found to this conflict."
"ASEAN, the United Nations and the EU have a duty to work more intensively on this now, and not to wait until the situation escalates again before reacting."
"In the most recent clashes civilians and soldiers on both sides were injured and killed."
"The use of cluster bombs was particularly perfidious."
"These cluster munitions wreak havoc on civilians that continues long after their launch."
"Up to 30% of cluster munitions fail to explode and remain on the ground as unexploded bombs, where they later explode when disturbed perhaps by playing children."
"We call on Thailand and Cambodia to stop using these terrible weapons immediately."
"We also call on both governments to sign up to the international convention banning cluster munitions."
"Finally, I would urgently appeal to the governments of Thailand and Cambodia to make every effort to resolve this conflict without resorting to arms."
"The civilian population on both sides will only suffer further; suffer for something to which politicians can find a negotiated solution if they only have the political will to do so, rather than attempting to pander to cheap nationalism on both sides of the border."
"author. - Mr President, since the beginning of this month there have been fights between the armed forces along the Thai-Cambodian border, near the temple of Preah Vihear, which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site."
"We have a responsibility to protect the lives of people first and foremost, but we also have a responsibility for cultural heritage."
"Particularly worrying is the reported use of cluster munitions."
"Those reports may well be true, as neither Thailand nor Cambodia has ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions."
"To prevent further escalation, which would put the region at risk of destabilisation, both governments have to assume their responsibilities and also have to care for people displaced as a result of this conflict."
"We welcome the efforts by the ASEAN chair to facilitate a dialogue between the two countries so that the dispute can be resolved in a peaceful manner."
"Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to join an urgent meeting of South-East Asian nations to discuss the conflict."
"The Director-General of UNESCO will also send a special envoy to Bangkok and Phnom Penh to urge both sides to cooperate with a possible UNESCO mission."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Lochbihler is quite right: it is firstly about people, about the dead and wounded, and about this scandalous use of cluster munitions."
"Secondly, of course, it is about containing a border conflict, settling it by peaceful means and ensuring that it does not broaden into a war."
"The third aspect - and we want to address this too - concerns the irreplaceable world cultural heritage of the temple complex in this border region."
"Karl von Habsburg, a former Member of this House and the son of Otto von Habsburg, is responsible for these matters at Unesco and will attend the March plenary here in Strasbourg to tell us more about it."
"It is my feeling that we actually need to make concentrated efforts to combine attempts to bring about peace and protect people with the protection of cultural heritage."
"Here in Europe we know only too well what terrible gaps wars can leave in the cultural landscape."
"We must therefore take action wherever there is a threat to the world's cultural heritage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the beginning of February, there has been renewed fighting between the armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand at the border near the temple of Preah Vihear, the surrounding area of which is claimed by both countries."
"Regrettably, there have been fatal casualties on both sides, and more than 3 000 people living close to the conflict area have had to be evacuated."
"In 1962, the United Nations International Court of Justice, acting in accordance with French historical maps, recognised Cambodia's rights over the temple of Preah Vihear and the land adjacent to it."
"However, Thailand has never accepted that decision."
"What is more, some parts of the border have not been demarcated, a situation which already caused several armed incidents in 2008 and 2009."
"In 2008, UNESCO listed the temple as a World Heritage site, which also provoked anger among Thai nationalists."
"Although a memorandum of understanding on the demarcation of land boundary was signed in 2000, Thailand's PAD nationalists are calling for it to be revoked because they feel it is too favourable towards Cambodia."
"I should like in particular to highlight the action taken by Indonesia, the current chair of ASEAN, which has offered to play the role of mediator in this conflict."
"On Monday 14 February, the UN also urged the two countries to observe a permanent ceasefire, while it made no plans to send UN peacekeepers to the area."
"I hope that these two countries will finally be able to settle this land issue peacefully and to stop taking thousands of people wishing to live in peace hostage in this way."
"author. - Mr President, for us in the European Union, the idea of taking military action over border disputes is now thankfully unimaginable."
"However, this is sadly not the case on the border between Thailand and Cambodia, whose armies have clashed several times in the past couple of weeks over a disputed, tiny, part of their border near to an ancient temple."
"Aid agencies report that some 30 000 people have been displaced by the fighting, so it is hardly surprising in such circumstances that innocent civilians have been killed, although both sides contest the actual numbers."
"Cambodia's Prime Minister, Hun Sen, has referred to the clashes as a 'real war'."
"Such bellicose and incendiary rhetoric can only make matters worse."
"The short-term solution to this dispute lies in the hands of both governments and the UN Security Council, which should take the lead in imposing solutions to de-escalate the crisis."
"In the longer term it is to be hoped that further ASEAN regional integration will help to make such clashes a thing of the past, as has been the case here in the EU for decades."
"Mr President, new incidents, apparently minor, took place on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning on the border between Thailand and Cambodia."
"Extremely tense relations have developed between the two neighbouring nations and I believe that this is the reason why the debate we are having today is welcome."
"I would actually like to thank Mr Posselt for the initiative he came up with."
"I would also like to say that I too deplore the human losses resulting from the armed clashes since the start of the month."
"Especially in the current charged atmosphere, we must firmly ask both sides to act with the utmost restraint and comply with the request from the UN Security Council to establish a lasting truce."
"Whatever the source of disagreement between Thailand and Cambodia, resorting to force is not a solution."
"I therefore wish to appeal to both sides to find an urgent peaceful solution to the territorial dispute in the area around the temple of Preah Vihear."
"I must actually remind you that an unequivocal decision was made by the International Court of Justice in 1962 and that there are ample opportunities for resolving the dispute, including via mediation through ASEAN."
"All that is needed, in accordance with international law, is to conduct negotiations in good faith."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PL) Mr President, the 11th-century temple of Preah Vihear has many times been the scene of clashes between the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the Khmer Rouge army and the regime of Lon Nol."
"Since the beginning of the 20th century, the temple has been the subject of a dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, who each in turn claim the right to the building and the surrounding terrain as well as the right to establish the border between the two countries."
"We have been witnessing the latest developments in this dispute since the beginning of February this year."
"Despite the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled that the temple belongs to Cambodia, there are other questions which still have to be decided."
"Both governments should make every effort to find a compromise which will provide the foundation for a permanent agreement."
"A repeat of the conflict of a week and a half ago, when the armies of both countries shelled each other, is unacceptable both from the point of view of the people of the region, who are in danger of being killed, and from that of the temple, which, despite its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list, has sustained damage."
"UNESCO has already offered its help, as has the Association of South-East Asian Nations."
"Today, the European Parliament has joined the appeal."
"A ticket to gain entry to the temple of Preah Vihear costs five dollars."
"I would like to ask what the price is of the conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, which has lasted for over 100 years."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I find it appalling that, in the 21st century, there are some political forces that keep operating in a 19th century paradigm."
"Growing nationalism in many parts of the world is giving rise to conflicts based on ethnicity as well as on religion."
"The Governments of Thailand and Cambodia must consider that the border clashes have an impact on peace and stability in the region as well as on relations between the two countries."
"Even if there are unresolved political issues between countries, it should not reflect on people-to-people contacts."
"Otherwise there is an imminent danger of growing nationalism as well as xenophobia."
"The situation on the border between Thailand and Cambodia should be resolved peacefully in accordance with the ruling of the International Court of Justice of 1962."
"The beginning of this year has seen already far too much bloodshed around the world."
"Mr President, it is a particular strength of the European Union that we are not egoistic, that we can see past the end of our own European nose and that we do look at what is happening outside Europe and in far-off exotic Asia."
"This conflict, as has been rightly emphasised, in fact has a history of over a century."
"However, it is good that the European Union and the European Parliament, which is in fact the heart of the Union, has something to say on this matter."
"It is good, because we should be present wherever there is debate about human rights, wherever there is debate about this most important matter, and this conflict most certainly shows that people have died and are fighting today, although not with such deadly results, about matters which perhaps could be decided in a more peaceful way."
"It is good that the European Parliament is intervening in this matter."
"Mr President, in the International Court of Justic ruling of 15 June 1962, it was decided that the Preah Vihear temple falls within the sovereignty of Cambodia."
"It is the obligation of the Thai Government to respect this fact and to refrain from attempting to change the internationally recognized boundaries through military force."
"At the same time, the Cambodian government is obliged to allow access to this temple to worshippers from Thailand."
"In a situation where one of the parties to a dispute is inclined to go beyond the rules and to impose its interests by force, it is necessary to mobilise international institutions in order to convey a clear verbal message that the world wishes to live under stable political conditions and does not wish to see disputes settled through the use of military force."
"It is therefore necessary to mobilise the relevant international institutions locally, in order to prevent the spread of unnecessary conflict and trauma to the civilian population."
"The offer of Indonesia, as the presiding country of ASEAN, to mediate in the border dispute is the best way to find a first step towards resolving this situation."
"(PL) Mr President, UNESCO is trying to rescue the temple of Preah Vihear - a monument on the World Heritage list - and to finance its conservation."
"However, not only are Thailand and Cambodia failing to respect that effort, but they are also breaking the international Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which is binding on both countries."
"I think this thoughtlessness may mean the destruction of a building which has lasted since the 11th century."
"Above all, however, I think this example should raise the question of responsibility."
"There must not be a repeat of what happened in Afghanistan in 2001, when a unique statue of Buddha was destroyed."
"This was the result, not only of the religious fanaticism of the Taliban, but also of the lack of sufficient commitment from western countries."
"The destruction of the world's cultural heritage must not go unpunished."
"This is such an important matter, that by analogy with the International Criminal Court in The Hague which tries war criminals, an institution should also be established which tries and brings to justice people who destroy priceless monuments."
"Mr President, the resolution on border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia condemns the armed conflict and urges both countries to stop fighting, reduce tensions and accept the mediation of ASEAN and the United Nations."
"We are dealing with a totally unjustified conflict."
"In 1976, as ASEAN members, Cambodia and Thailand signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which commits them to rejecting the use of force in relations between member states and to the peaceful settlement of interstate disputes."
"The conflict is unreasonable, also, because the International Court of Justice ruled in 1962 that the Temple of Preah Vihear, close to where the fighting is occurring, belongs to Cambodia."
"There are many reasons to believe that the armed clash is linked to nationalist fervour in Thailand, steered by elements in the government which are provoking the fighting to curry favour with hardline voters with a view to this year's elections."
"Mr President, border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have left an estimated 1 000 dead and another 30 000 displaced."
"We deplore the loss of life and make the prevention of any further such losses a priority."
"I would also like to express my concern at the alleged use of cluster munitions and call on both countries to refrain from using such munitions."
"Killing people and endangering people's lives is never a solution."
"We therefore strongly support all the parties currently working to find a solution and to stop the violence."
"We stand for peace and we urge peace."
"(RO) Mr President, I too would like to join my fellow Members who are calling for the peaceful resolution of the tense situation on the border between Thailand and Cambodia."
"The clashes which broke out at the start of the month mark the resumption of an older conflict over the UNESCO temple located on the border between both countries."
"I should stress that a decision made by the International Court of Justice in 1962 confirmed that this monument belongs to Cambodia, and the authorities must respect this decision."
"While it is true that the area around the temple was not demarcated by the Court, I believe that Thailand and Cambodia can reach an understanding by means of negotiation and not through the use of weapons."
"The clashes in the area are not only putting a UNESCO monument in danger, but the lives of the population as well."
"A border conflict is always a source of instability."
"This is why I encourage the initiative from both governments to resolve the issue bilaterally."
"I think that the project aimed at setting up a buffer zone to prevent the destruction from spreading is a step towards peace."
"(RO) Mr President, I too would like to express my regret at the loss of human lives, especially in the case of innocent civilian victims."
"I am also alarmed that thousands of people have been obliged to abandon their homes due to the clashes on the border between Thailand and Cambodia."
"As summarised in the joint motion for a resolution, there is an international legal framework which both sides must comply with."
"I believe that the appeal made by the European Parliament must be followed by strong pressure from the High Representative for Foreign Affairs."
"However, what may be even more serious is the use of cluster munitions."
"I believe that we have a duty to demand Thailand and Cambodia to ratify the convention banning this type of weapon."
"Mr President, this situation is a further reminder for the European Union of the importance of mediation and conflict prevention."
"To use its soft power to the fullest extent, the EU needs to invest more in conflict prevention."
"It is high time that the Vice-President/High Representative Catherine Ashton came up with an initiative to build up a credible mediation and conflict prevention capacity."
"This requires policy coherence, standing as a good reminder for the EU Member States."
"(ES) Mr President, I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight two matters that have already been mentioned, but which I consider to be fundamental."
"The first is the use of cluster bombs by both Thailand and Cambodia, and the need for both countries to ratify the international Convention on Cluster Munitions."
"The second matter is also one that we frequently discuss in these debates on urgent issues."
"It relates to freedom of expression, fundamentally on the Internet."
"I believe that the weakness and fragility of the Thai political system reveals some serious situations."
"For example, the trial being held against Chiranuch Premchaiporn for comments on his website criticising the Royal Family."
"The person responsible for the comments has been freed, while the person responsible for the website has not yet been freed."
"I also believe it is necessary to point out the need for freedom of expression and, above all, for freedom of association in each of these countries."
"Mr President, unfortunately this dispute is over a century old."
"It re-emerged in June 2008 and has escalated since the beginning of this month."
"Many people have different views as to why it should have escalated at this particular time."
"There are those who think that hawkish Thai generals are using it as an excuse to overthrow the government and to cancel the elections proposed for later this year."
"Be that as it may, this dispute - particularly looked at from a distance - should be solvable."
"It is not a major dispute, particularly if the United Nations uses its mandate and its influence to bring about three things: firstly, an agreement to end cluster munitions; secondly, a permanent ceasefire; and thirdly, if necessary, deployment troops to oversee that ceasefire."
"If these happen, then this dispute can be brought to an end."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I can confirm that the Commission is following the events along the Thai-Cambodian border closely."
"On 7 February 2011, the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, expressed her concern about the armed clashes."
"She called on both countries to exercise the utmost restraint, to take the necessary steps to reduce tension, and to resume dialogue with a view to resolving their differences peacefully."
"The points raised by the Parliament's draft resolution were discussed on 14 February 2011 in the United Nations Security Council, in the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia, the latter in its capacity as current chair of ASEAN."
"We agree with the conclusions of UN Under-Secretary Pascoe that the situation is indeed serious."
"The issue is not only about a world heritage site."
"It is also about - perceived or real - national and cultural identities and national pride."
"Most importantly, the issue is about human lives and about regional stability."
"There are two questions: what can the region do to redress the situation, and how can the EU contribute to a peaceful settlement?"
"It is obvious that this kind of conflict cannot be solved by armed force."
"ASEAN has a role to play, and we are pleased to see that ASEAN is assuming its responsibility."
"The Indonesian Foreign Minister has rightly invoked the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation."
"This agreement requires all parties to settle their differences by peaceful means."
"We welcome the decision by Indonesia to convene a special ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting on this subject on 22 February 2011 in Jakarta."
"There is broad agreement in the United Nations on not letting this issue get out of hand."
"Members of the Security Council have called on both parties to refrain from provocation and from deploying military reinforcements along the border."
"It is becoming clear that regional efforts offer the most promising avenue for a peaceful resolution to the conflict."
"For the EU, this implies giving full support to ASEAN."
"The External Action Service is following the matter in detail and will be considering options for supporting ASEAN, if such support is appropriate and is requested from their side."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the final debate."
"2."
"Yemen: death penalty against juvenile offenders, notably the case of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Yemen - death penalty against juvenile offenders, notably the case of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum."
"author. - Mr President, I look with great admiration at the courage of citizens who defy the repression and violence of their governments."
"We have seen this happening in popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, Algeria, Bahrain and also in Yemen."
"The young generation wants hope to replace cynicism, opportunities to replace poverty, justice to replace impunity and internet freedom to replace repression and censorship."
"We have a long list of serious concerns about developments in Yemen in relation to democracy, human rights and the independence of the judiciary, as well as to the persecution of journalists, bloggers and human rights defenders."
"In particular, we are concerned about the climate of fear that is created by the execution of juveniles, despite Yemen's commitment to the international community not to execute juvenile offenders and the reflection of that commitment in its own penal code."
"There is a lack of adequate means to determine the age of defendants, so it is difficult for people to defend themselves."
"We call on the President of Yemen and the authorities to at least respect Yemen's own laws and commitments to the international community and halt the execution of juveniles."
"We also stress the need for reforms in Yemen, as called for by so many demonstrators in the streets, and we want their living conditions and their rights to be improved."
"Mr President, the Arab countries are being rocked by a wave of popular uprisings that are spreading to them all, one by one, and I hope that this will continue."
"An unprecedented wave of protest against the dictatorships in power in those countries is gaining ground."
"These dictatorships are in place more often than not with the support and, at best, amid the silence of all of the Western regimes."
"No country seems immune to popular uprisings, and that is all to the good."
"We took too long - you took too long - to realise what was happening in those countries, and you are still delaying now."
"It took until 2 February for the European Parliament to adopt a resolution on Tunisia, and it is only now, at this part-session, that we have adopted one on Egypt."
"We had requested, in connection with these emergency situations, a resolution on Algeria."
"Our request was refused once again, just as, for months, you - or at least the vast majority of you - refused to see what was happening in Tunisia."
"Today, protest movements are being formed, as we speak, in Iran, in Libya, with regard to which you have just given your support - your conditional support, but your support nonetheless - to a partnership agreement, and also in Bahrain and in Yemen, to mention only those that we know the most about."
"Yes, that is right, in Yemen, where President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for no fewer than 33 years."
"Talk about a managed democracy!"
"Of course, it is much better than the situation in Libya, since Mr Gaddafi has been in power for 42 years!"
"We were among the few who said that we could not vote today on a resolution on Yemen without taking account of what was happening in that country."
"Men and women there are fighting for their freedom."
"Violence is erupting between supporters and opponents of the regime."
"Since the rallies began at the end of January, hundreds of people have been injured."
"Yesterday in Aden, a young demonstrator was shot dead during clashes with the police, who opened fire to disperse a gathering."
"Right now, students in Saada are barricaded inside their campus, where they are still surrounded by the police, and we remain silent."
"When we think of Yemen, we think only of the problem of capital punishment for minors."
"I am by no means suggesting that the abolition of the death penalty should be abandoned - I have always been a staunch supporter of its abolition, and I believe that any supposedly democratic country that is incapable of abolishing such a punishment is criminal and should not lecture others on democracy and human rights, even if it is the world's leading power."
"Yes, this capital punishment is even more unacceptable when it is applied to minors, especially in a country where it is impossible to know for sure when a person was born and where this impossibility is used to sentence people to death, the benefit of the doubt being given, dare I say it, because of the failure to establish their date of birth and so prove that they were minors at the time of the offence."
"And you would like us to adopt a resolution focusing on just one issue, a resolution that merely emphasises, in paragraph seven, the need for reforms, as called for by, I quote, 'so many demonstrators'?"
"That is a bit weak."
"Therefore, I and my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have tabled three amendments to update this resolution, and I hope that, together, we will be able to adopt a resolution worthy of the name."
"author. - (RO) Mr President, I want to assure Mrs Vergiat that, as anyone can see, we are debating not only the death penalty, but also the events taking place recently on the streets of Yemen."
"I believe that when it comes to the vote, she will also be able to see what stance our group adopts on these issues."
"However, we must not forget that the subject of the emergency resolution which was adopted to be discussed today is the persecution of juvenile criminals and the imposition of the death penalty in this case."
"As you are aware, if we Europeans find the death penalty unacceptable and barbaric, it is even more awful and terrible when juveniles are involved."
"The bottom line is that the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by an offender under the age of 18 even violates Yemeni legislation, although the authorities in this country continue to carry out such executions."
"author. - Mr President, the topic of the urgent resolution is important in itself."
"I too want to call on the President of Yemen to halt the execution of Thabet Samoum, as well as to call on him and the authorities to commute the death sentence passed on him and other juveniles such as Ali Abdulla."
"However, as has been said, it would be unfortunate to miss this opportunity and not raise some of the basic and more important issues that are emerging now in that country."
"That is why I would also like to see Parliament add, at the end of the resolution on which we will be voting, that it notes that in Yemen as in other Arab countries, notably Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent weeks to demand more democracy and reforms of the state."
"'Whereas many protestors have been attacked or taken into custody by the security forces': that is our first amendment."
"Secondly: 'expresses its deep concern about the long-standing political and socio-economic problems in Yemen and calls for considerable efforts by the international community to prevent the escalation of the current crisis'."
"Finally, our third amendment: 'expresses its solidarity with the demonstrators who demand democratic reforms and improved living conditions; welcomes in this context President Saleh's announcement that he will step down in 2013 and calls on the authorities to stop violence against peaceful protestors and to release all demonstrators who express their dissent peacefully'."
"If all three of these amendments are included, the resolution would be really very good."
"author. - (RO) Mr President, the death penalty is truly the most inhumane punishment possible and I have appealed against it on countless occasions."
"Indeed, the European Parliament has made appeals for its abolition in the countries which still retain this barbaric practice."
"However, the executions in Yemen referred to in our resolution are especially outrageous as juveniles are involved."
"Even before a crime has been committed, the victims are children."
"This therefore violates the fundamental right to life, as well as the international conventions which Yemen is party to and, last but not least, even the penal code in this country, which explicitly forbids the use of capital punishment against juvenile offenders."
"The difficulty in determining the exact age of those convicted due to the lack of birth certificates is a circumstance which increases the discretionary nature of this type of punishment."
"We cannot discuss this specific issue without taking into account the state of affairs in Yemen."
"The Yemeni authorities are violating human rights."
"Journalists and activists are being imprisoned illegally."
"Women are discriminated against regarding their participation in public life and access to education, while the judicial system is anything but independent."
"The recent riots are not only motivated by economic and social concerns, but they also express the strong desire to make Yemeni society democratic."
"author. - Mr President, Yemen is a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which expressly prohibit the execution of juvenile offenders - those convicted of crimes committed when the perpetrators were under the age of 18."
"The impending execution of Muhammed Samoum, and indeed the detention on death row of several other juvenile offenders, is an affront to international law."
"By pursuing such policies, on the bizarre excuses of the accused not having proper birth certificates or of uncertainty about their age, Yemen is aligning itself with the brutal theocracy of Iran."
"However, the difference between the two countries is that Yemen receives massive aid from the West, including the EU, in order to root out al-Qaeda terrorists, whereas Iran is an international pariah."
"Therefore, we have considerable leverage here in the EU over President Ali Abdullah Saleh."
"I urge the High Representative to take all possible steps to persuade him to grant clemency in this case."
"Having announced that he will shortly relinquish his post, President Saleh has a real chance now to leave a positive and enlightened legacy in his country, which has been brutalised by conflict and terrorism for so long and now dreams of a democratic future."
"Mr President, the use of capital punishment on juveniles under the age of 15 was prohibited in Yemen in 1991."
"Since 1994, this ban has applied to people below the age of 18."
"Unfortunately, this prohibition is not always respected in practice, for example in the case of people who do not have any documents which confirm their age, as has already been mentioned in this Chamber."
"Other dangerous things are also happening in Yemen."
"It is a country where the number of weapons has long ago exceeded the number of people, where brutal tribal battles are a daily occurrence and where teenagers with weapons do not cause a stir."
"There is even a saying in Yemen that 'if you are old enough to use a knife, you are old enough to fight for your tribe'."
"Besides, everyone who has been to Yemen knows that almost everyone carries a knife, and a teenager with a Kalashnikov is nothing unusual."
"Yemeni society is also a very young society - almost half of Yemenis are still under 14."
"The different militias recruit young soldiers, and we should also fight against this."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the death penalty is still in use in 58 countries and one of these countries is Yemen."
"My Group condemns the death penalty in general and the planned execution of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum in particular."
"We want to remind the Yemeni Government of its international commitments regarding the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"Both conventions prohibit the executions of people under the age of 18."
"On Monday, Amnesty International reported on the actions of Yemeni security forces."
"According to Amnesty, the security forces beat protestors with sticks and shocked them with electric batons during peaceful protests in Sana'a. My Group condemns these violent actions and urges the Yemeni Government to cease all violence against its own people."
"Mr President, I promise I will not read quickly, because I am going to speak slowly."
"It is an honour for me to speak straight after the former Prime Minister of Finland."
"I would like to say that the call for Yemen not to carry out the death sentence on juveniles is an example of the European Union's characteristic minimalist approach."
"I am opposed to capital punishment, though I know that in this Chamber there are people who support it, although they do not say so publically."
"I am opposed to capital punishment, irrespective of whether it concerns a juvenile person or an adult."
"However, on this particular question I hope we are going to rise above our national and political divisions to demand unequivocally from the authorities in Yemen that on this matter the President of Yemen should make use, after all, of his right to grant a pardon."
"This really is a question of a truly united fight."
"Mr President, the Yemeni administration has made a commitment to accept the application of both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"Both of the cases of condemned juvenile offenders are subject to the regime of these documents, and it should therefore not be possible for a judicial body in Yemen to issue a legal decision denying the rights and protection arising from these documents."
"Penalties imposed in violation of the valid commitments of a country, and hence the applicable law, cannot be accepted."
"If the Yemeni Government claims that its power is based on civilized democratic principles, then it cannot use barbaric forms of governance based on arbitrariness and injustice."
"In my opinion, we should make this fact clear to the Yemeni Government today."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally I believe that it is important that here in the European Parliament we condemn dictatorial means, that we condemn dictators and dictatorships, but I also believe that it is important that we urge Yemen in general towards democratic structures."
"However, I think that, although this Yemen affair has been raised in the European Parliament, it is not the European Union's job to adopt a position on this."
"This affair is totally confused."
"There are totally unclarified circumstances in it."
"Even the particulars of the crime cannot be made out satisfactorily."
"For one thing, we do not even know how old the young man accused and convicted of the crime was at the time the offence was committed."
"It is possible that he was not a minor."
"We do not see clearly in this case."
"Nothing illustrates Yemen's astonishing backwardness better than the fact that not even the birth certificate of Mohammed Taher Thabet Samoum has surfaced."
"Neither has it been proven to this day whether his school papers presented by his lawyer are genuine or whether these are false school papers."
"Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not about stealing a hen but this is a case of murder, and so here I prefer to be a little restrained and more measured than the speakers so far."
"The European Union must consider, similarly to the world's other democratic countries such as the United States of America, the option of the death penalty for certain exceptionally serious crimes proven beyond doubt."
"(FI) Mr President, the Samoum case is not a oneoff event in Yemen: at least eight other juvenile offenders are in custody awaiting a death sentence."
"This is especially challenging in a country where there are no birth records, so it is impossible to say with any certainty whether someone was underage in a situation when a crime was committed."
"It is nevertheless important to remember that the state of Yemen is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which expressly prohibit the death sentence against juvenile offenders and harsh sentences in general for such people."
"The execution of juvenile offenders is, furthermore, forbidden in Yemen's own penal code."
"In contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to say that the death penalty is always cruel, inhuman, and a punishment that strips a person of human dignity."
"For that reason, the EU will fight against the death penalty in all situations, and we too in this House will appeal in favour of that."
"(RO) Mr President, sentencing a child to death is unacceptable in the world we live in."
"Turning this practice into a habit is a crime in itself."
"This is why I want to express my disagreement with the decision made by the Yemeni authorities to continue such actions."
"The government is violating both the international treaties on this matter and the penal code which prohibits the use of the death penalty for juveniles."
"In addition, the way in which the justice system tries to find out the age of those brought before it remains unclear."
"This case is a sad example of what is going on in Yemen."
"As an MEP and citizen of the EU, I believe in the fundamental importance of a person's right to life, and children must be the first to be protected."
"I appeal to the EU's High Representative to halt the succession of these bloody executions."
"(RO) Mr President, Thabet Samoum and Fuad Ahmed Ali Abdulla were probably minors, as they maintain, when they committed the offences for which they were sentenced to death."
"They received their sentence years ago and it may be carried out at any time."
"They are being subjected to huge psychological strain, which is inhumane and degrading treatment in itself."
"We call on the authorities to refrain from carrying out these punishments."
"In addition, neither offender can prove that they were under the age of 18 because they do not have birth certificates."
"Obtaining a birth certificate is a serious problem in Yemen where only 22% of births are officially registered, according to UNICEF."
"Some of the funds we use to help this country will perhaps resolve this problem."
"Public discussion about these cases must lead to the abolition of capital punishment in Yemen and to the sentences of hundreds of people condemned to death being commuted."
"I call on the European Commission and Council to insist on achieving this objective in the dialogue with this government."
"(PL) Mr President, adult or juvenile - capital punishment is a subject to which we ought to devote a lot of time."
"After managing to develop our ethical code in the wake of the nightmares which have affected Europe, we should be promoting it in other countries - in countries with which we have any kind of economic contact, but I am also thinking here of countries in Europe."
"In Belarus, sentences of capital punishment are still imposed and the death sentence is still in use."
"What is happening in Yemen must attract our attention and we must make the loudest appeals to the Yemeni Government to put an immediate stop to these awful practices, and also to look into the fact that - as my fellow Member said a moment ago - there are still a number of juveniles in prison awaiting execution."
"I appeal, too, to all of us: we should be working more closely together with organisations such as Amnesty International and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, so that our voice will be heard better and have greater force throughout the world."
"(DE) Mr President, the decision in Yemen to impose the death penalty on someone who was a minor at the time of the offence is shocking."
"Yemen has clearly acted unlawfully here, since like nearly every country in the world Yemen is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"Under Article 37 of the Convention, neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment may be imposed for crimes committed by persons before their 18th birthday."
"This decision has been justified by the claim that the age of the accused is uncertain."
"However, death sentences are also passed against minors in other parts of the Islamic world."
"Sharia courts are imposing capital punishment on youths in Somalia, for example."
"Together with the UN, the EU must act more resolutely and more speedily here to prevent breaches of international law with such serious consequences."
"Dialogue is good, but Realpolitik and economic pressure are better ways to advance our argument."
"At any rate, they tend to get things moving much faster."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are speaking, hundreds of prisoners packed into Yemeni gaols are waiting for their death sentences to be carried out."
"I think this debate should call for greater attention and a swifter commitment from the European institutions."
"The ongoing violation of the International Convention on Human Rights is a topic on which Europe must be neither silent nor absent, least of all with regard to a country such as Yemen, with which we maintain economic relations. Inevitably, therefore, we must also pay great attention to issues of this kind."
"In Europe and the Western world, rehabilitation is clearly an important, basic aspect of a sentence."
"A death sentence has absolutely no rehabilitation purpose, which is why we need to intervene with the utmost firmness and determination and to make our voice heard in this respect."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Union, in implementing its well-established Death Penalty Guidelines, has long been active in fighting the death penalty in Yemen, both generally and by targeting individual cases."
"The capital punishment of juvenile offenders has always taken place in Yemen."
"In earlier times, however, cases were largely unknown and civil society was not as active."
"The EU-funded and UNICEF-implemented Juvenile Justice Programme has contributed significantly to raising awareness, both in Yemen and within the international community."
"This programme was carried out together with a coalition of civil society organisations and the Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood."
"However, awareness-raising is not enough."
"We need to follow up with actions."
"As a last resort, the EU delegation actively carries out démarches to halt executions."
"The two most recent cases were in December 2010 for Fuad Ahmed Ali Abdulla, and in January 2011 for Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum."
"In both cases, the execution was halted - after EU intervention - to allow for presentation of evidence of age."
"The issue of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum was taken up again last week."
"It seems now as if a presidential pardon is the only hope for a formal reversal of the sentence."
"The EU and UNICEF have again contacted President Saleh and now, according to our own feedback from Sana'a, the execution is on hold again."
"Yemen is bound by international obligations, and by its own juvenile justice legislation and penal code, not to execute juveniles."
"The reasons for having juveniles on death row are mainly attributed to a lack of capacity in age determination."
"We are therefore, together with UNICEF, looking into how to assist Yemen in building up such expertise, so as to arrest the issue at its roots."
"In the immediate term, the EU will encourage the setting up of an independent body to re-examine the age of juvenile offenders."
"We will also aim to support the capacities of lawyers to provide legal assistance to juveniles."
"In the medium-term, we are looking to develop EU support for an effective civil registry authority."
"We are thus taking this extremely grave issue very seriously and using all available means."
"The Government of Yemen has shown receptiveness to our démarches."
"The EU remains prepared to assist them, now and in the future, to achieve our goal of eradicating the death penalty totally."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the final debate."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (FI) We have frequently addressed the subject of the death penalty in our resolutions."
"Condemning minors to death is rare, but Yemen is one of those countries in which it has happened."
"Although Yemen has made progress in its efforts to prohibit death sentences against minors, courts have continued to pass them."
"The case of Muhammed Taher Thabet Samoum is not the only one."
"Generally speaking, and in connection with intercultural dialogue, it is worth giving serious consideration to what radicalises young people, prompting them to commit crime, even murder, and how best to prevent them from going down the road of crime."
"As is known, the death sentence does not reduce crime."
"The prodemocracy demonstrations that began in Tunisia and Egypt have received much support from the local youth."
"The lack of prospects and opportunities, in addition to a desire for democracy, has provoked resistance."
"This wave of resistance also spread to Yemen last week."
"I share my fellow Members' concerns and demands with respect to Samoum and others who have received the death sentence."
"Although we are now waiting with interest and hope to see what political changes the demonstrations in the Arab countries will lead to, we cannot for a moment close our eyes to outrages which contravene international human rights agreements, such as the death sentence for minors."
"3."
"Uganda: murder of David Kato"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Uganda - murder of David Kato."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all would wish that David Kato, who was murdered a few weeks ago, was still alive and that he could be here with us - as he was just last November - to speak about the rights of lesbian and gay people and the lack of rights for lesbian and gay people in Uganda, and to plan together with us what can be done to change that."
"We all would rather he was alive and had not been the victim of a brutal murder."
"David Kato worked in his home country of Uganda to defend the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people."
"I am pleased that we have succeeded in bringing about agreement between six political groups in this resolution to condemn the murder of David Kato and to call on the authorities, the new political leadership that will be elected in Uganda tomorrow and also religious leaders to bring to an end once and for all the persecution of and violence against lesbian and gay people and against other minorities, and to contribute to enabling lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to live freely in Uganda too."
"Here in the European Union we also have a responsibility to work for such equal rights and to honour the memory of David Kato and others who sacrificed their lives before him in the fight for equal rights."
"To this end it is also essential that Baroness Ashton - our High Representative for Foreign Affairs - and the new European External Action Service work for these same equal rights; for example, in order that the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People is also used in all non-European countries."
"author. - Mr President, today we have an urgent resolution on LGBT rights in Uganda for the third time in this parliamentary term."
"The previous two were warnings and attempts to prevent what happened to David Kato, the human rights activist who was brutally murdered."
"We must condemn LGBT discrimination across the world, including in Europe and even in this House."
"The murder of David Kato is a crime that needs to be fully and impartially investigated."
"Not only do the perpetrators have to be brought to justice, but the broader context of intolerance, discrimination and threats to LGBT people needs to be analysed, and changed."
"Local publication Rolling Stone and Ugandan parliamentarians have played a role of incitement rather than one of protecting citizens."
"Since David Kato's murder, the authorities have been too silent."
"The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has put the rights of LBGT people on the agenda over and over again and, with the support of all Members of this House, we have urged respect for their human rights - because that is what LGBT rights are - and we will not be silent."
"I hope that those Members who are sometimes hesitant or even reluctant to stand up for gay rights will think again and realise that killing people is never justified and that it needs to be met with our ongoing and unequivocal condemnation, just as we address the violations of the rights of other minorities across the world, such as Christians."
"The Commission and the External Action Service need to use the toolkit to promote, and protect the enjoyment of, the rights of LGBT people to the full extent with regard to Uganda."
"author. - Mr President, the murder of David Kato is the direct result of the hatred and hostility towards Uganda's LGBT community, whipped up by certain hard-line parliamentarians in that country."
"Twice in the past year we have lambasted the outrageous attempts by some MPs in Uganda to mandate the death penalty for the so-called crime of same-sex activity."
"It is inevitable that in a climate of such bigotry the lives of gay rights activists would be endangered, and so it has sadly proved to be the case with David Kato."
"He knew the risks of publicly defending gays."
"He and other alleged homosexuals were outed last year by a newspaper which printed their photos next to a headline which said, disgracefully, 'hang them'."
"I am sure that many of my London constituents are deeply concerned about the European Union giving financial aid to a country where such disgusting sentiments are not only tolerated but sometimes apparently officially condoned."
"I hope that Parliament's Delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament will consider carefully what action it can take to register our anger and disgust at Mr Kato's murder and, more generally, to underline that the EU's continuing engagement and financial aid to African countries must be reciprocated with progress on fundamental human rights on that continent."
"Mr President, we are now on to the third European Parliament resolution of this parliamentary term on discrimination against the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) population in Uganda."
"Today we are dealing specifically with the case of Mr David Kato, whose killing has been strongly denounced by many NGOs and international bodies."
"Mr Kato was, in fact, a symbol of the fight against homophobia in his country, and more specifically of the denunciation of the Bahati bill, which goes very far in cracking down on homosexuality, since it envisages sentences right up to life imprisonment and even the death penalty."
"We must pay tribute to him, but we must also think of all those whose photographs, names and addresses have been publicly disgraced by a rag whose name I shall not even mention."
"The climate with regard to the LGBT community is unacceptable, exacerbated as it is by the religious authorities and in particular by the evangelist fundamentalists close to the Head of State."
"Tomorrow, presidential elections will take place in Uganda."
"Although there are eight candidates, the outgoing President has already declared himself certain of his re-election and announced that he will imprison anyone who protests against the elections."
"Those elections are undoubtedly an opportunity to remind Uganda of its human rights obligations, to tell it that the fight against discrimination of any kind, including against LGBTs, is an integral part of these universal values and that we should together respond to Mr Ban Ki-moon's appeal to make the decriminalisation of homosexuality a universal fight for human rights."
"deputising for the author. - Mr President, for those of us who live in the developed world, the chasm between us and the sub-Saharan area both in terms of thinking and practice is very difficult to comprehend."
"The case of David Kato is an example of that."
"He was a man who was regarded as the father of the Ugandan human rights movement."
"As a founder member of SMUG, Sexual Minorities Uganda, he was condemned by a magazine called Rolling Stone, and won his case against them."
"The editor said that the persecution of homosexuals and their execution should continue."
"Sure enough, David Kato was murdered, on 26 January."
"author. - Mr President, it is always a sad moment when we have to pass a resolution on the death of a human rights defender."
"For me it is even sadder because, like others in this House, I met him when he came to Parliament to plead for it to act on behalf of those living in Uganda."
"As a gay man, can I personally thank this House for the way it has united in this resolution in saying that hatred against lesbian, gay and bisexual people, and the diminishing of their human rights, is totally unacceptable."
"The justice that we can give David Kato is not only to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice for the crime that they have committed - the senseless murder of this young man."
"The real issue is that in the continent of Africa, as Mr Tannock quite rightly said, on issues of human rights and civil liberties, we have given our colleagues too far and too easy a ride on these vital matters."
"The best thing that can come from this is that the colonialism that we imposed through our laws, and sometimes through our religion, can actually end in the repeal of the law in the 38 countries that criminalise homosexuality and bring to an end the death penalty in Somalia, Mauritania, Sudan and Northern Nigeria."
"That would be a memorial not only to David Kato, a giant amongst the pygmies who preach prejudice and persecution."
"It would also be a memorial to this Parliament speaking up for those who have no voice."
"Mr President, I truly believe that the discussion about the violation of the rights of sexual minorities in Uganda ought to go further than voicing criticism."
"We should reflect on the effectiveness of our measures supporting human rights and examine the level of contribution from European diplomacy towards this."
"In December, we adopted a resolution against the punishment of homosexual persons in Uganda and the incitement to crimes against a community stigmatised for its sexual orientation."
"I abhor this awful crime, but at the same time, I also abhor the reluctance of European institutions and European Union Member States to resort to the tools of persuasion and pressure which they have available."
"I believe that it is appropriate for us to firmly request the Ugandan authorities to guarantee respect for fundamental rights, conduct a fair investigation into this case and prevent other such crimes."
"I also think that we need to issue a warning to the Commission for it to become involved much more actively in defending human rights."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we will pass our third resolution against the criminalisation of homosexuality in Uganda."
"Within a short space of time gay people have been declared fair game in Uganda."
"Even children or minors are affected."
"This is all due to the irresponsible actions of a US-based Christian sect and the call by local newspaper Rolling Stone for a hundred people whom it named as being gay to be hanged."
"Now David Kato - one such person publicly named as being gay - has been hammered to a pulp on a public street; this is, in fact, what we were hoping to prevent with our last resolution."
"We call on Uganda firstly to hold an independent investigation into the murder of David Kato and not to arrest just anybody for the crime."
"Further, we call on Uganda to prosecute those who call for the public murder of gay people."
"We also call on Uganda to revise its legislation."
"Mr President, I would like to join in expressing my sadness, emotion and, above all, my outrage at the murder of David Kato, and to say that what we need to do now is to show clear determination and a firm will to combat not only this type of murder but also insults and any type of discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"In Africa homosexuality is only legal in 13 countries, and in 38 countries it is considered a crime."
"This is unacceptable and, moreover, as the European Union we must fight it both politically and economically."
"We should not forget that finally we also have the opportunity to contribute, from an economic point of view, to combating this type of measure."
"Persecution on the grounds of sexual orientation also needs to be considered as an essential element of the basis for applying for refugee status, and for the right to protection from the European Union and from the Member States that, unfortunately, do not currently grant that right."
"If we had had that possibility in the case of David Kato, perhaps we would not be mourning his loss."
"How many more deaths are we going to have to mourn in the future."
"Mr President, I think a situation in which we are talking about Uganda for the third time in 14 months and for the second time in only a few months is one which is very disturbing."
"I agree with previous speakers that in fact this is not about the human rights of just one group, but it is about human rights in Uganda in general as all minorities there are facing extreme challenges."
"I think it is particularly important for the European Parliament to speak again on this matter."
"I welcome the fact that the representatives of different political groups are speaking together on this matter and are, in fact, speaking with one voice, although of course they may have different emphases."
"Human rights are not respected at all in Uganda, especially the rights of this group."
"We should therefore protect this group in particular."
"We should also defend the right to unhindered political activity and we should also stress, in this context, the rights of human rights defenders."
"(PL) Mr President, the brutal murder of David Kato, one of Uganda's best-known human rights defenders, is the result of hatred towards homosexual people."
"Even if the murderer is punished, the atmosphere of hatred will still remain, sanctioned by the law which discriminates against LGBT people."
"Homosexuality is a crime in as many as 38 African countries, and in four of those countries it carries the death sentence."
"The European Union actively supports democratic change in Africa."
"We must not allow human rights to be violated in such a drastic way."
"How much blood must still be shed, how many more people have to die before the international community can force a change in legislation in Africa which violates human rights?"
"It is also necessary to examine the role of the Church, which instead of promoting love and peace, is promoting hatred against homosexual people, teaching the ridiculous theory that homosexuality is a serious illness which needs to be treated."
"Mr President, I would just like to make a point of order before I go on to my speech."
"This is the third time that we have been promised speaking time but then not been listed."
"Just because we are independent Members of this House, it does not mean that we do not have a say as well."
"Going on to my speech as I wish to give it, I would like to take the time to commend the late David Kato for his brave work in Uganda, for defending not just his rights, but also the rights of other LGBT people in Uganda, and indeed of those in Africa."
"It is only too sad that, although he came to this Parliament last October, we obviously did not heed his warnings - nor did the international community - and now he has been killed."
"I find it unbelievable that the European Union is still giving aid to Uganda."
"I would hope that, after the elections in the next couple of days, we will review that."
"I hope that, if there is no amnesty for people being prosecuted for LGBT offences, we would withdraw all aid."
"I would just like to make one final point."
"It is very sad that the current Presidency of the European Union, the Hungarians, have decided to ban an LGBT pride march this June."
"What message does that send out ... ?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mrs Sinclaire, I have been told that your staff did not notify your speaking time."
"If your staff can forward proof of such notification then I assure you personally that I will look into the matter."
"I will attend to it personally if you submit the proof of notification to me."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the murder of David Kato has been met with harsh and decisive condemnation from the European institutions."
"We must not forget, however, that this violent act is just a single episode in a wider state of affairs, in which cultural, ethnic or religious minorities suffer discrimination in various parts of the world."
"Just a few weeks ago, we adopted an urgent resolution condemning what had happened to Coptic Christians in Alexandria, Egypt, who had been cruelly murdered just because they wanted to profess their faith freely and respectfully."
"Looking beyond gay rights, Uganda is an extremely vulnerable country, the victim of financial speculation by certain powers interested in profiting from this country's weakness."
"The European Union must therefore devote its attention to Uganda so that the country can benefit from our ability to promote democracy and civil rights even in non-EU countries."
"Mr President, hatred and human rights violations against sexual minorities continue worldwide."
"The recent news of the killing of David Kato in Uganda is yet another sad example of the discrimination and brutality that sexual minorities are facing."
"The killing of Mr Kato has to be investigated thoroughly, and the person or persons responsible have to be brought to justice."
"It has been reported that certain sources, including the Rolling Stone tabloid, had publicly called for the killing of Mr Kato."
"These allegations need to be investigated."
"I must say that I was appalled by the comments of the Ugandan Minister for Ethics and Integrity, who announced that homosexuals can forget about human rights."
"(PL) Mr President, when I think of Uganda, I think of how much that very beautiful country has suffered since the times of Idi Amin and of how human rights are still being violated there, and I am grateful to all the fellow Members who so diligently draw attention to this."
"I think that while we are on the subject we should also talk about the language of hatred and what it can produce."
"For ultimately it was the language of hatred (the tabloid which published photographs of Mr Kato) which led to this horrendous murder."
"The language of hatred is also in use here in the European Union."
"There are Internet sites such as Redwatch, and on these sites the names and sometimes even the addresses are given of people who have a different sexual orientation, a different religion or a different world-view."
"In fact, on these Internet sites violence is openly incited against minorities."
"We must protect human rights and the safety of minorities around the world, but we must also do the same here in the European Union."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by paying tribute to the late David Kato."
"David Kato was a courageous human rights defender and fearless LGTB rights activist."
"As a leading voice on LGTB rights, his life was under threat."
"On 2 October 2010, David Kato's name and picture, along with the names and pictures of other alleged LGBT persons, were published by a Ugandan tabloid, the Rolling Stone, under the headline 'Hang them', shamelessly putting their lives at risk."
"It was a success that he won an appeal against the paper."
"On 3 January, a court ruled that the paper had violated their constitutional rights to privacy and safety and awarded the three plaintiffs damages."
"It was his last success."
"On 26 January, David Kato was killed."
"The EU, through its heads of mission in Uganda, expressed its shock and called on the Ugandan authorities to investigate David Kato's murder vigorously and to ensure that the perpetrators of this terrible act were brought to justice."
"David Kato will be a great loss to the global community of human rights defenders and to Uganda."
"His death also reminds us of the volatile situation for LGBT people in Uganda and elsewhere."
"Right after his death, on 28 January, another paper, Red Pepper, published an outrageous article with very insulting statements about homosexuals."
"The draft anti-homosexuality bill put before the Ugandan parliament has been temporarily shelved, but can be re-tabled once a new parliament is established after the upcoming elections in Uganda."
"The EU position on LGTB rights is very clear."
"The criminalisation of homosexuality, as foreseen in the draft Uganda bill, goes against international human rights standards."
"The draft bill also goes against the EU-supported United Nations Declaration on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity of 18 December 2008."
"The EU heads of mission have raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions at the highest level: with the President, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice and the Uganda Human Rights Commission."
"On 9 February, the Human Rights Working Group, which brings together several partners in Uganda, invited human rights defenders to give an update on actions undertaken by the LGBT - and broader human rights defenders' - community, following David's murder."
"On 3 February, the EU Delegation, together with ten EU Member States represented in Uganda and Norway, launched the Local Implementation Strategy on the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders."
"The strategy set out, in a more practical way, how EU missions and Norway can work to assist and acknowledge the work of human rights defenders, including LGBT activists."
"The EU intends to keep raising its concerns in relation to the draft anti-homosexuality bill and other cases of the persecution of LGBT people in Uganda on every suitable occasion, in dialogue with the government."
"In addition, the EU will continue to support local human rights organisations in their efforts to change attitudes in the country."
"The EU delegation will shortly meet with a protection organisation for human rights defenders to discuss ways of supporting their work for LGTB activists."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"It was with great concern that I learnt about the death of human and LGBT rights activist David Kato Kisule in Uganda."
"We already condemned in this Parliament the criminal sanctions applied to consenting relations between same-sex adults in private and the Bahati Bill, which provides for stiffer penalties right up to capital punishment."
"The murder of David Kato Kisule proves that there is both a major and real danger that hate and discrimination will cost human lives."
"I welcome the statements made by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hilary Clinton who condemned David Kato Kisule's death and highlighted his efforts to establish a life of dignity in Uganda, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity."
"I share the sentiments of those who are calling on the European Commission and Council to take rapid, effective action in condemning and halting this discrimination under the law and in reality."
"in writing. - Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, the murder of David Kato Kisule was a tremendous tragedy for his family and friends as well as a great loss for the LGBT and human rights movement in sub-Saharan Africa."
"I find it astounding that this horrific act has been treated by the Ugandan authorities with marked indifference."
"The martyrdom of David Kato and the discrimination against the LGBT minorities should be addressed vocally with the Ugandan authorities."
"David Kato's efforts would have been in vain if the Bahati Anti-Homosexuality Bill were to pass in the Parliament of Uganda without a firm international reaction."
"The European Union must exert pressure on the Ugandan authorities to decriminalise homosexuality and reject the use of the death penalty under any circumstances."
"Uganda must fulfil her obligations under international law and the Cotonou Agreement, which commits Uganda to protect all persons, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, against threats and violence."
"It would be a serious infringement if the Ugandan government and judiciary were to encourage and exercise such violence themselves."
"The European Union and its Member States must make use of the conditionality of development assistance and cease sponsoring such governments."

"Guidelines for the 2012 budget - other sections (debate)"
"The sitting will now continue."
"The first item is the report by Mr José Manuel Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2012 budget procedure, Section I - European Parliament, Section II - Council, Section IV - Court of Justice, Section V - Court of Auditors, Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee, Section VII - Committee of the Regions, Section VIII - European Ombudsman, Section IX - European Data Protection Supervisor, Section X - European External Action Service (Α7-0049/2011)."
"Madam President, first of all, let me offer my greetings to you, Madam President, to the Commissioner and to all my fellow Members who are here."
"Allow me to start by thanking all those who took part in this report and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups."
"The work has resulted in a broad consensus, as shown by the vote last week in the Committee on Budgets, where this report was passed by 34 votes to 1, with 1 abstention."
"This report aims to be in harmony and in line with the current moment: with the economic, financial and social situation through which we are struggling, with the crisis that we are experiencing, and, at the same time, with what the European public wants from the European Union and its institutions."
"We will have a budget of restrictions, a budget of austerity and, at the same time, a budget which will have to provide the institutions and Parliament with the means to keep up with the European project and to keep up with the European public's expectations."
"Our objective is excellence in lawmaking and it would be very bad if we lacked sufficient means to achieve this: it would be a terrible sign for our times and it would have a cost, which the European public would still have to bear."
"In order to achieve this, we will need the necessary resources."
"We have new powers resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, given the current situation, we advocate a neutral increase, which means that we advocate an increase equal to inflation."
"We are in line with the Commissioner's letter, with the recommendation that he sent to Parliament and the other institutions."
"Therefore, when it becomes necessary, if it becomes necessary, we will draw up a letter or an amending budget for the purpose of commitments such as that which the European Union has to Croatia, or that resulting from the eight new members of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In order for us to achieve a savings budget, it is clear that we have, more than ever, to follow the principles of good management and economy, the principles of efficiency and effectiveness."
"These principles will have to translate to budgetary rigour, simplicity and transparency."
"With these principles, we will already be able to successfully identify cuts, not only in the estimates that we will now prepare, but we also want savings in the implementation of the 2012 budget."
"In this way, we will manage to keep up with our responsibilities."
"We would also like - and introduced this concept - a budget that is a zero-based budget, in which each expense is justified and in which variable expenses are well known; wherever justified, there can be a cost-benefit analysis for these expenses."
"Clearly, we will not endanger projects under way because that would not simply be a backward step, but would rather be a loss."
"I am referring to projects such as the extension of the Konrad Adenauer Building, projects such as the House of European History; these projects will go ahead under this budget of restrictions."
"We also argue, on this basis, that forthcoming budgets should be multiannual budgets, so that there can be overall planning right from the outset; overall planning that is in accordance and in line with the multiannual financial framework."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, my best wishes on the occasion of International Women's Day."
"I welcome the principles set by the rapporteur, Mr Fernandes, on budgetary vigour, especially as regards the administrative budgets of the European Union."
"For me, this is sure that this is the line to be taken under the present economic conditions in the European Union."
"Therefore, with this in mind, I asked my colleagues in the Commission to be particularly sensitive to increases in administration and we can promise that our increase should be less than 1%."
"This means, given that there are some contractual obligations, that there are cuts for 2012 in the areas of information technology, meetings, conferences and mission costs, as well as in the area of studies and publication."
"I have written a letter to the heads of the other institutions and here is their response."
"I think this is really the line to be taken for 2011 as regards administrative expenditure."
"We have indications from the Council that they are also to be very restrictive."
"The same principle should be applied as regards future enlargement."
"I think the estimates should be included in the budget when the formal decision on the date of accession is taken, in the form of an amending letter or amending budget."
"However, I have to remind you on this very occasion that administration only accounts for less than 6% of the European Union budget, so this is quite a decent proportion."
"As for the operational expenditure, the European budget has its own internal logic."
"The programmes are gaining maturity with time, so we now have maturity of major programmes that started in 2007."
"The European budget is mainly about investment and not consumption and social transfers."
"On the one hand, we should be very restrictive as regards administrative expenditure, but on the other hand, we should understand the logic of the internal dynamics of European budgets, otherwise we will produce a lot of so-called 'RAL' (reste à liquider), which constitute a mountain of unspent money, unspent commitments, and this is not in line with a decent budgetary procedure"
"I therefore welcome once more the principles we can see in the report by Mr Fernandes."
"We are to hold discussions on the basis of guidelines on 30 March and I am looking forward to our meeting towards trialogue on 30 March."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my regret and dismay that neither the Secretary-General nor the two vice-presidents with responsibility for the European Parliament are present."
"We normally expect from the Commission that its responsible members should be present; we should also expect the same from our most senior representative."
"Secondly, I would like to address the subject of the management of the House's buildings."
"I welcome the fact that the KAD project in Luxembourg is making progress, that it would seem that the costs are under control, and that things are going according to plan."
"When the KAD extension project is complete, bringing staff together under one roof should lead to greater efficiency and synergy, as well as reducing annual costs, because eight offices will be closed."
"It is essential that this target should be met as we need some of these funds for other purposes, as Mr Fernandes has pointed out."
"I believe that the House of European History is an important project because it will attract many visitors, who will be offered an insight into the significance, aims and purpose of the European Union in the context of European history in a very effective way."
"Thirdly, I would ask that the staff appointed in Luxembourg should be relocated to Brussels."
"Because they frequently need to work in Brussels, they are constantly travelling back and forth, also causing problems for the Members."
"This only applies to a small number of sub-areas and relocation really should be considered on efficiency grounds."
"Fourthly, I think it a very good thing that the European Parliament is only making provision for moderate expansion."
"The fact that other areas are only expanding on a modest scale should not be taken by the EEAS as a reason for massive expansion."
"I would call on all institutions to cut their cloth to their measure in these times of economic and financial difficulty."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his report, but also for his approach to putting together the other sections' budget."
"He is right to balance the need to ensure that the European Parliament and other sections are able to function properly against ensuring that budget increases are kept to an absolute minimum."
"I particularly welcome his proposal to keep increases within the rate of inflation."
"I believe the initial proposal of 5.2% is far too high."
"Of course, to achieve the moderate savings pursued by the rapporteur and others within the Parliament, we need to ensure we also identify savings within the budget."
"I have therefore offered to work with the rapporteur to ensure those savings are found."
"I believe there are potential savings to be found in things like the buildings policy and in terms of enlargement - which the Commissioner has mentioned himself - but also in things like the proposed cost of a non-European office, which I believe at this time is an unaffordable luxury."
"Finally, can I say we also need to work very closely with other institutions, particularly the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, which I know were very concerned about their budget for 2012 as well."
"We need to ensure that they, like us, are able to function properly but also, at the same time, limit their spending increases for the future."
"So I can say that the Socialists and Democrats Group is very keen to work with the rapporteur; we do support the proposals for these guidelines, and we look forward next week to discussing the estimates."
"I should like to reply to Mrs Hohlmeier's comment."
"Mr Pittella, the Vice-President responsible for the budget, is here in the House listening to the debate."
"Madam President, thank you Mr Fernandes for this excellent report."
"The key principles of good budgetary management are efficiency, thrift and the responsible deployment of the financial resources entrusted to us."
"However, something that arises again and again in all budget negotiations, and which we need to avoid here once again, is greed and the desire to hold on to our old ways."
"We need to distinguish between greed and need."
"There is little doubt that the job increases outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon and required as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon are something necessary."
"Care should be taken to ensure a balance between the jobs in political groups and committees and administrative posts."
"As my fellow Member has already observed, it would have been good to have the Secretary-General attend this session to hear what we have to say."
"The new departments referred to by Mr Vaughan are not needed in this form if we make sensible use of the synergy effects within this House."
"We have plenty of competent people in the various Directorates General and I am sure that we will be able to bring them together in an effective way."
"With regard to the House of History, I would agree with Mrs Hohlmeier that it is important that such a project should have a business plan from the start."
"We should not regard this as something of a request show in which everyone gets what they want; we need to manage our resources wisely on the basis of a reasonable budget."
"Finally, I would add that we should not make the mistake of failing to invest in the future because of a misguided wish to save money."
"The investments we make today, for example in IT resources, can save us a lot of money in the coming years, which is why thrift should not be allowed to become an end in itself."
"It must make sense and must be reasonable in terms of the future."
"Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, the issue currently under debate is the Parliament's budget for 2012 and I would like to emphasise that from the perspective of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the right balance must be struck between limited and justified increases, which are mainly the result of the new powers and responsibilities under the Treaty of Lisbon, and self-discipline and self-restraint in times when public funds are in short supply."
"To the outside world, the Parliamentary budget is still something like the European Parliament's calling card and continues to have a symbolic significance: How do we deal with the austerity policy - the necessity for this policy - as it impacts directly on us?"
"Mr Fernandes uses words like consolidation, containment and self-restraint."
"However, we have heard few real proposals so far about where he intends to make the cuts and where resources are to be pared back."
"Of course, it is right to call for greater efficiency in the administration of Parliament and, from my own point of view, I can see some scope for improvement."
"I would now like to address the issue of the House of European History: I am all for this idea in principle."
"However, I believe that the project must have clear business plans."
"If there is a desire to prioritise such a project - I am directing these words specifically to Mr Fernandes once again - if terms like self-discipline and consolidation are really meant seriously, then we must also be prepared to propose cuts in other areas."
"If priorities exist as a result of political will, then, by definition, other areas must be given secondary priority in order to produce a consolidated budget."
"To talk about consolidation without making the relevant recommendations is to fudge the issue."
"The matter will only work if people are prepared to say where the cuts are to fall - particularly in the case of new priorities."
"This is what I meant when I referred to the European Parliament's calling card: limited increases, as well as clear self-restraint."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what I find is a very well-balanced report, particularly in its seeking of consolidated resources and an austerity budget."
"The principles that he sets out - legislative excellence, good management principles, being able to have accuracy and simplicity, and submitting cost-cutting plans - should apply not just to all institutions other than the Commission, but also to the Commission budget itself."
"However, looking at the technological points that the rapporteur makes, it is not just in the longer term that we should be looking for savings, but also in the short term, when we should be able to come up with cost-cutting measures."
"One particular point of concern to my group is security."
"We seem to place too much emphasis on stopping people coming into the institutions."
"We do not allow them enough freedom of access or the possibility to circulate."
"Could I suggest that, when the Vice-Presidents come to this particular point, they should be looking at the US Congress, which does ensure the security of people going into the building, but then allows them to flow freely through it."
"Having a professional security service enables that to happen."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, it is a disgrace that in the present economic crisis, a proposal for a 5% increase for 2012 is already being put forward for this Parliament's budget."
"Members' assistance allowance was increased once again by EUR 1 500 per month only last week."
"No attempt is being made to tackle the outrageous waste caused by the three seats of this Parliament."
"Worse, the European Parliament has now engaged in a EUR 60 million refurbishment of a building to be used as the European History House - as if we did not have museums in Europe."
"Does the EU want to rewrite history?"
"And what about the External Action Service that will employ, among others, 50 officials who will earn 20% more than the British Prime Minister, and will need a new building that will cost EUR 10.5 million per year."
"Madam President, on behalf of the British taxpayer, I beg you to stop this rip-off."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft produced by Mr Fernandes for the 2012 financial year refers to cost-efficiency and consolidation."
"As representatives of the citizens of Europe, we in Parliament must comment on this."
"Cost-efficiency is essential."
"However, the additional expenditure arising through the accession of Croatia, the establishment of the EEAS and the three new financial authorities have all impacted on the EU budget."
"The fact is that new expenditure should not necessarily - and indeed absolutely must not - lead to budgetary increases."
"Potential savings can be found in all of the Union's institutions, for example, in personnel and building policy, or in administration."
"I would once again suggest that the various agencies should be subjected to an audit and that synergies should be sought with the various Member States."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wanted to congratulate Mr Fernandes for his excellent work."
"It is not easy to speak about institutions' budgets and resource management, especially if you try to discuss the improvement in their performance in parallel with the need for economic consolidation which Member States and the European Union must face up to in a context as sensitive as it is today."
"It is precisely for this reason that I fully support his appeal to the values of legislative excellence and sound financial management, which are guiding principles on which all the institutions' activities should be based."
"Indeed, at a time of crisis in which our primary objective must be to relaunch the European economy, the prime example of virtue must come from the institutions themselves."
"Virtue does not just mean austerity, but rather increased administrative efficiency to ensure a fair and improved use of resources, which will enable all the institutions to work both effectively and efficiently, rendering them capable of reaching the main objectives that Europe has set itself in recent years."
"Turning more specifically to Parliament's budget, I believe, as does Mr Fernandes, that the 2012 budget should be one of consolidation, taking into account that it could become a point of reference, rather than the current debate on the future multiannual financial framework."
"I think, however, that part of the resources should be used to bring in some necessary improvements to enable Members to carry out their duties with the help of quality services."
"I therefore think savings should be made in common services, but that further efforts should also be made on the property policy, by rationalising the space already available to us and by adopting a medium- and long-term plan that allows advance planning of expenditure on buildings as well as making our decisions in this area more transparent and rational."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, we should discuss the costs that are to be avoided or saved in this budget."
"However, I would call on you all to be a little more objective in your knee-jerk responses to the discussion in relation to the agencies."
"Why is this?"
"Firstly, because the Committee on Budgetary Control is permanently engaged in this debate and also draws attention to ways in which cooperation between the agencies and the performance of their duties can be improved, and also because we are expecting a special report on the agencies this year from the European Court of Auditors and will then have a more objective basis for what is, at present, a somewhat ill-considered discussion, particularly with regard to the question of how the agencies are managed and how we may be able to achieve these savings."
"Speaking of savings, I would like to come to my next topic, our building policy."
"The fact is that when it comes to the buildings of the European Union, we can certainly save resources."
"Speaking personally, I would question whether it is really a good idea to build new buildings for the European Parliament in Brussels because this strategy really only makes sense if real estate prices in Brussels continuously rise."
"At present, the market would not seem to support this."
"If real estate prices on the market do not rise, then the option of renting rather than buying really does make sense, particularly when you walk around the European quarter with your eyes open and see how much office space is actually available to rent in the area."
"Which brings me to the issue of the House of European History."
"I believe that greater legitimacy is required here because it is not enough that to date, all the initiatives for the establishment of the House of European History are simply based on resolutions by the Bureau of this House and have no democratic legitimacy."
"This needs to change."
"Above all, we need to know how the operating costs and follow-up costs of this institution are to be covered."
"(DA) Madam President, I would also like to thank Mr Fernandes for an excellent report, and I would like to thank Commissioner Lewandowski in particular for his letter to the institutions regarding reining in our administrative expenditure this year."
"I think that this letter was very apt, and it will help to establish the approach that we believe will make it easier for us to insist on savings being made, and I think that has to apply to all institutions."
"It has to apply to the Committee of the Regions, to the Economic and Social Committee, and to the Court of Justice, whose expenditure has, of course, been rising sharply."
"It must also apply to the Court of Auditors."
"It is a little more difficult for small institutions like the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and that, of course, is something that we need to take into account."
"However, I think that we in Parliament have a particular responsibility to demonstrate that we can show restraint."
"We have had new tasks conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon which involve additional expenditure, but the forthcoming year, 2012, must be a year of consolidation."
"We have talked about enlargement."
"We will include Croatia's accession in an amending budget. Many people have also mentioned the question of the House of European History."
"I think it is an excellent idea to have this House of European History as part of our visitor services."
"Many young people do not know the history leading up to the establishment of the EU very well, and it is said that if we do not know our history, we are doomed to repeat it."
"I think it is very, very important for Europe's recent history to be told, and therefore we will support this House of European History."
"Last but not least, I would like to say that our expenditure is, of course, very much linked to the fact that we have several seats, and that costs money. We need to look closely at this."
"Unfortunately, our biggest cost is something that we cannot do anything about."
"That has to do with the fact that we have to move between Strasbourg and Brussels."
"If the European Council really believes that savings have to be made, Europe's Heads of State ought to address this matter."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"(CS) Madam President, it is clear that the entire European Union and its Member States will still be feeling the lingering effects of the economic and financial crisis in 2012."
"The European Parliament must therefore adapt its budget strategy to this fact."
"We must strive for maximum budgetary discipline and austerity."
"I am pleased to find this fact in the report, and to see that the report emphasises this fact."
"Austerity, however, cannot mean that expenditure rises in line with inflation."
"Our aim must be to keep Parliament's expenditure at the same level as this year."
"All possible effort must be directed towards savings and the better use of existing parliamentary resources."
"This must apply to all areas of European Parliament activity, starting with a rationalisation of the administration of buildings through to the better use of information technology and the human resources policy."
"There are potential savings here and we must have the courage to implement them."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a period of general economic hardship, the fundamental task of European institutions is to lead by example."
"This report is rightly focused on fulfilling the criteria of efficiency and on the management of costs and services."
"I therefore wonder whether a real and immediate check on the effectiveness of certain outsourced activities might not be necessary."
"I am referring, in particular, to Parliament's information technology and internal security, partly in the light of recent events of which we are all well aware: the theft at the post office last month."
"A further criticism needs to be levelled at the European External Action Service."
"Created at theoretically zero cost to reduce waste and improve the effectiveness of the European Union's external relations, it is proving to be a failure on both fronts, politically and economically."
"I would not want the European Parliament to be anything less than rigorous in this area."
"(NL) Madam President, last week, I was asked by several voters in Flanders how it could possibly be that we, as members of the European Parliament, are still receiving EUR 1 500 a month to recruit additional staff at a time of economic problems and uncertainty, and at the very time when ordinary people are having to tighten their belts."
"What we are doing at present is actually spending even more."
"The voters' questions and comments are absolutely spot-on."
"We, as the European Union, should be setting an example."
"We should be cutting our coat according to our cloth and, at precisely this point, we have no choice but to come to the unfortunate conclusion that this report by Mr Fernandes is something of a missed opportunity."
"Calls are being made - and rightly so, I think - for us to exercise responsibility and restraint with regard to the budget."
"Recital A even mentions, quote, 'employing strict management procedures so that savings may be achieved,' unquote."
"Well, it is unfortunate that this report fails to specify where exactly we could make those cuts."
"There are, of course, quite a few areas where they could be made - I am thinking of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and the trips between Brussels and Strasbourg which cost EUR 200 million per year."
"I challenge the Commission and the Council, but Parliament too, to carry out an exercise and put all these things in order, to look at where we can make savings and then translate this into an actual plan, so that we can put a number of things to debate and bring about savings."
"(FI) Madam President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur for a very wellbalanced, excellent report."
"Everyone here is talking now about thrift, and that is an excellent thing."
"We need budgetary discipline and efficiency, and we should adhere strictly to what our main task is and not expand beyond that task, which is legislative work."
"Most are saying that we must be frugal, but nonetheless talk about what we should not save."
"We should be talking about concrete measures that would enable us to make savings."
"We can make savings if we stop travelling between three places of work."
"We, of course, know how politically difficult it would be to carry this through."
"I would like to raise one matter, and that is the notion of security, which Mr Elles mentioned here."
"In a year, we have had a bank robbery, the canteen has been held up, and so has the post office."
"No one has even been caught."
"The security is little more than a joke."
"We fail in one obvious area: Members of Parliament enter the building where there is no proper controlled entrance."
"We should acquire an electronic signature."
"At present, we have lists and an office where a lot of people work and which takes down names and enters them in a computer."
"This is a waste of money: we should be making savings and introduce a better, credible system of security."
"We only have to do it, but Members say no all the time and that they do not agree with electronic signatures, even though that way, we would make obvious savings and have a better system of security."
"I do not understand how this works in the US Congress; there, everyone agrees with this system, but here, somehow, these things do not get done."
"I hope that we will now focus on areas where savings can truly be made."
"(SK) Madam President, I regard it as very important from a political perspective that the guidelines for the 2012 budget reflect the economic and political circumstances under which it was drawn up."
"At a time when Member States are forced to make savings, and our citizens are bearing the consequences of the financial and political crisis, we cannot expect a big increase in the budget compared to the previous year."
"On the contrary, we must look for areas of our operations where we can save the tax resources of our citizens, without reducing the quality of our work."
"I believe we have some direct spare capacity in the way we organise our work."
"The three headquarters of the European Parliament and the regular shuttling of thousands of workers and MEPs from Brussels to Strasbourg 12 times a year are well known to the public."
"Ladies and gentlemen, such a squandering of public resources shows nothing more than contempt for the realities of the situation."
"Any talk about cost-cutting will appear false until this performance of shuttling to and fro for European Parliament debates is brought to an end."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Fernandes for drafting guidelines for the European Parliament and the other institutions."
"In my opinion, the guidelines he has drafted combine the need to make savings, or rather the necessity of making savings, of which we are all aware given the European Union's current economic situation, with a guarantee of the appropriate conditions for good law making."
"I would like to emphasise at this point that we should not forget that the Treaty of Lisbon and the forthcoming enlargement mean that the European Parliament will be faced with new tasks."
"It is therefore absolutely vital, for the good of the citizens, to introduce solutions which will facilitate the proper and due functioning of the European Parliament."
"I would like to emphasise that I will continue to hope for cooperation with the rapporteur which ensures that the 2012 budget being drafted by the European Parliament is a budget which is characterised by financial discipline, but also one which does not only think about the following year or the two or three years which come after it, but which is able to introduce modernising instruments which facilitate the European Parliament's work, and investments which I hope will make savings in the future."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Fernandes on his excellent report."
"I, too, believe that the 2012 budget should be realistic and adapted to the current economic situation."
"As a result of my many years of experience of managing a regional budget and my membership of the Committee on Budgets, I attach particular important to discipline when it comes to planning expenditure."
"I believe, however, that we should avoid false economies, which may result in an economic slowdown and a reduction in economic competitiveness."
"Increased employment levels and the creation of high quality, sustainable jobs are a prerequisite for economic growth and overcoming the effects of the crisis."
"The European Union budget must promote increased employment."
"The key to growth lies not in reducing expenditure, but in increasing efficiency and linking European funds to the achievement of strategic and measurable results. Thank you."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Fernandes for his work and for focusing on the possible savings that may be made in our administrative expenditure."
"Staff and buildings policies are the two main areas in which our administrative expenditure is concentrated, as is clearly demonstrated by the report."
"Taking into account the future accession of Croatia to the European Union and future personnel requirements, it will be necessary and appropriate to manage staff procedures, particularly through mobility."
"If, on the one hand, this choice of human resources policy offers greater flexibility, on the other, it will require increased training for European Union staff."
"Concerning the buildings policy, the text explicitly mentions the principle of centralisation."
"The tough policy we are applying to budgets - starting with those of Member States - should, in the medium-term, also make us consider the desirability of retaining three seats of Parliament, an admittedly complex issue, but one which we cannot fail to address."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the debate and I can assure you that the Bureau's proposal is a model of rigour, transparency and sound administration, and I wish to emphasise three points in particular."
"The first point is that the increase suggested in our proposal does not exceed the average rate of inflation in the European Union."
"Secondly, I share the concerns and we are working towards a prudent and far-sighted buildings policy for security and for staff."
"The third point is that the EUR 1 500 increase was agreed and put into reserve by the Committee on Budgets."
"The Committee on Budgets has released the reserve; this is not money going into the pockets of Members of Parliament - it is worth clearing up this misunderstanding and falsehood - but to assistants who will help Members to better perform the duties they are assigned by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Madam President, I would like to point to one minor area in which we could save money, which is software."
"We pay Bill Gates a huge sum of money annually for using his Windows software."
"He may be a nice chap who donates a lot of that money to good causes, but if we were to use open software more bravely in this House, it would be a step towards cleaner, cheaper and modern management."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to ask Commissioner Lewandowski what the specific procedure is for accessing the euro safety net, in other words, the money put up by the European institutions, in 2012."
"Will the Commission make a proposal if a particular state expresses the desire to make use of the safety net?"
"Does the European Parliament have a full role in making this codecision and is this also to be an issue this week in the context of the widening of the safety net?"
"Secondly, I have a comment to make on the EUR 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance."
"I would ask all the Members who do not make full use of the secretarial allowance to state publicly how much money they save themselves - after all, this is an area open to abuse."
"It may be that there are some Members who do not need to use the secretarial allowance at all because they very rarely attend Parliament."
"In such cases, these funds should not be used up in full."
"Only those who work particularly hard could use up the entire allowance."
"Everyone else should return this money to the taxpayer."
"(SL) Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by congratulating Mr Fernandes on an excellent report."
"However, I would agree with those members who have said that savings are necessary, especially making budget savings."
"It is a fact that the European budget has been shrinking for decades."
"Looking at the GDP we have generated in the EU, its volume has constantly decreased."
"Recently, the Commissioner has said that, at the very beginning of the financial perspective, EU gross domestic product was approximately 1.3%."
"That figure today is barely 1.12%."
"At the same time, though, national European budgets have increased significantly."
"For example, over the past ten years, the proverbially modest UK budget has increased by 100%, hence two and half times more than the EU budget."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner comment, in particular, on whether he is likely to encounter any difficulties in implementing the next budget in 2012 because of this actual decrease in the European budget as compared to the national budgets of the Member States."
"Madam President, I would thank all my fellow Members for their contributions."
"I should like to mention that our objective at this time was the guidelines."
"However, we have already gone further than guidelines and set a specific objective: we want a neutral increase, which means that the 2012 budget will not increase above inflation."
"I am well aware that we have new powers."
"I am well aware that we need resources for these powers, but we have to take on board the principles of good management, and achieve savings with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness."
"These principles will not be used to seek blind savings: savings that will become costs in the future."
"We will make savings that do not put at risk the objective that we have set out: the objective of excellence in law making."
"I am certain that I would also call this budget one of reconciliation: reconciliation of current needs, of the current time of crisis, and the requirements that these times impose on the institutions to respond efficiently, in terms of keeping up with what the people want, with what the European public wants."
"Just one paragraph about a confusion that remains: there was no increase in the budget for Members and there will be no increase for next year."
"The sum to which everyone is referring - which is not for Members and which refers to the possibility of taking on another assistant - was already set out in 2010 and there has been no change in budgetary terms, no budgetary increase in 2011."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11:30 on Wednesday, 9 March 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - As elected representatives, everyone in this Chamber will be aware of the many sacrifices which our constituents and national governments have had to make over the past three years."
"Education, health, transport and other frontline services have all seen their funding slashed across the EU."
"It is important that the European Parliament has the necessary budget to properly fulfil the mandate which has been given to it from the European people."
"However, it is also necessary that the parliamentarians represent the same European people by ensuring that there is no frivolous spending, no unnecessary price increases, and that value is found in a market where suppliers and businesspeople are fighting for every last euro."
"I trust that both my colleagues in this Chamber and those working throughout the European institutions will consider these principles in the years ahead."
"Female poverty - Equality between women and men - 2010 (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the topical item of the day, the joint debate on the following reports on women in the European Union:"
"the report by Mrs Mariya Nedelcheva, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on equality between women and men in the European Union - 2010 (Α7-0029/2011); and"
"the report by Mrs Rovana Plumb, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the face of female poverty in the European Union."
"Madam President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I was born in 1979 at a time when European citizens were directly electing their representatives for the first time."
"I am proud of the fact that in this same year, for the first time ever, a woman - Simone Veil - a valiant supporter of women's rights, assumed the Presidency of the European Parliament."
"Today, I am one of the 35% of women represented here in this Chamber."
"Never before has this figure been so high in the European Parliament."
"So whom do we owe it to?"
"We owe it to all those women who had the intelligence, the strength and the courage to join together and demand their right to vote, their right to work and to education."
"We owe it to those women who, quite simply, wanted to champion respect for their dignity and for their rights."
"We have been fighting for 100 years now to combat unfair and groundless discrimination."
"Significant progress has certainly been made, but combating gender inequalities is a day to day task and we have still a long way to go."
"The European Union has always led the way when it comes to gender equality."
"I believe that this House of ours must ensure that it stays at the forefront of this momentum even when it comes to the most sensitive of subjects."
"The present economic crisis has made us face our own contradictions."
"As highlighted in my report, the effects of the crisis have been felt more severely by women and its effects longer lasting for them than is the case for men."
"As I also pointed out, however, we need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves, get a move on and come up with the answers!"
"We should take this opportunity to alter our frames of mind and move forwards."
"It is now vital to emphasise the role that schools play in combating gender stereotypes."
"By providing wider opportunities in education, vocational training and employment, we can improve women's access to higher levels of responsibility."
"It is also time to put a stop to the persistent pay gap between men and women and I also believe we need to step up a gear when we look at the composition of boards of publicly listed companies."
"Only 3% of board members of publicly listed companies are women."
"That is not acceptable."
"Time to step on the gas."
"What if, despite all our efforts, the big companies keep applying the brakes?"
"Well then, unfortunately, we will have to raise the spectre of quotas and binding targets."
"It is with reluctance that I speak of quotas because, in principle, I am not in favour of them."
"But if the carrot does not work, well then, the only alternative would be the stick."
"There is no denying it: the presence of women on the labour market can only benefit economic growth."
"The European recovery plan will have a greater chance of success today if gender equality policies are an integral part of it."
"Concrete proposals to achieve a better work-life balance must be put forward to demonstrate that our ambitions can be more than mere dreams, because that is what is expected of us."
"It is all very well being driven by values and ideals, but we must also be pragmatic and effective in our work."
"Finally, Madam President, I should like to raise one last point."
"I was pleased to hear that the European Commission was going to make a proposal in the spring to combat violence against women."
"The scourge of violence against women in all its forms needs to be fought with all our might."
"I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for being so proactive on this matter"
"Madam President, I am not a pessimist so I would like to end on a positive note, if I may."
"I think that on this day, the one hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day, we should pay tribute to the courage, strength and determination shown by women in Tunisia, Libya, Iran, Egypt and by countless others in their struggle to defend human rights."
"The wind of freedom sweeping across North Africa should wipe out the last vestiges of authoritarianism, poverty and social exclusion, so that women in these countries become socially, politically and economically emancipated whilst respecting their culture and their traditions."
"It is also our role in the European Parliament to pay tribute to these women, encourage them and support them in their desperate struggle for democracy and human rights."
"Please note that I mean human rights in the fullest sense of the term!"
"rapporteur. - Madam President, firstly, let me wish all women a happy anniversary on this important date, 8 March, the day which marks the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, 100 years of struggle for women's rights."
"I would like to thank all my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the secretariat for their contributions to this report."
"My report deals with an issue which is both general and eminently concrete in terms of its consequences: female poverty."
"85 million Europeans live below the poverty line and 17% of all women in the EU are classed as living in poverty."
"These are the facts."
"The economic, financial and social crisis affects all of us, but it particularly harms women in the labour market and in their personal lives, since they are more likely to be in insecure jobs, more likely to be made redundant and less likely to have social security."
"This is how things stand at present."
"What can we do?"
"Women are expecting us to provide concrete proposals, concrete measures."
"It is 8 March, and I shall try to summarise my report in eight points."
"First and foremost, we call on the Member States to take into account the gender dimension in their plans for recovery from the recession by promoting and boosting the employment of women, and adopting specific measures as well as adjusting budgets to ensure equality of access to public sector expenditure, with a view to both enhancing productive capacity and meeting women's social and environmental needs."
"Second, we call on the Commission and the Member States to take the appropriate measures to eliminate gender inequalities in employment as part of Europe 2020."
"I strongly encourage establishing as an objective the reduction of the gender pay gap by 1% each year, in order to achieve the target of 10% reduction by 2020."
"I stress also the need for positive action to increase women's representation in political, economic and corporate decision-making bodies."
"The third issue is related to reconciliation between private and professional life."
"I call on the Council and the Member States to renew and fulfil their commitments related to the Barcelona targets for the provision of accessible, affordable and high quality childcare, and to develop new targets for the care of dependent persons."
"Fourth, we call on the Commission and Member States to frame health policies which aim to combat and prevent practices that harm women's health and cause social exclusion and poverty."
"Fifth, we call on the Member States to adopt the necessary measures in order to offer better opportunities for women in education while fighting stereotypes and eliminating traditional role models in school curricula."
"Our sixth point is that there is a direct link between families' social circumstances and children's growth."
"Therefore, we call on the Commission and the Council to develop and implement a strategy to halve child poverty by 2012."
"Seventh, we should not ignore violence against women."
"It has an increasing impact on the risk of marginalisation, poverty and social exclusion."
"I call on the Commission to establish a European Year for combating violence against women."
"Eighth, let us underline the importance of the Structural Funds and, in particular, the European Social Fund, as key tools to assist Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion."
"I think that we can do it."
"We have the power."
"We have the strength and the intelligence to tackle this important issue at European level and in all Member States."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, it is nice that on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, this House is guided by a woman."
"I think that is very symbolic and it is also very symbolic that we can, during this day, debate these very important issues on the agenda - thanks to the rapporteur, Mariya Nedelcheva - which shows a great support for the Commission's work towards gender equality and focuses on important issues that the Commission has emphasised and will continue to emphasise."
"One hundred years of struggle and we still do not see the end of it."
"I regret that because I always hope that we can eliminate, if you like, the yearly celebration of the struggle of women, but as long as we have not arrived there, we cannot do so, and we have not arrived there yet."
"Parliament's report shows very clearly what the gaps are."
"The gaps are in poverty: we have heard the second report on this too."
"On poverty, women are leading so there is not a gap in this sense, but what are we doing - and my colleague, Lászlo Andor will answer this - to get women out of the poverty trap?"
"The second element is women in the world of employment."
"There are still some problems concerning the balance between family life and professional life."
"There is the problem of the pay gap where women still earn 17% less on average than men - and you might have seen that on 5 March, we had the European Gender Pay Gap Day, with measurements to see how much more women have to work than men in order to reach the same level of pay."
"The fact is that we were, in effect, not paid until 5 March; we had to work until then without being paid."
"Only from 5 March on did we start to be paid."
"I hope that one day, the gender pay gap day will be on 1 January, which would mean that there would be equal pay at that moment."
"The political commitment of the European Commission is contained in our new strategy."
"The themes which are mentioned in our strategy for gender equality are the same as the ones the rapporteur has mentioned: economic independence for women, gender pay gap, violence against women and promoting gender equality in external actions."
"To start with external actions, you might have seen Cathy Ashton and myself on 8 March speaking to women outside of Europe and saluting the courage of all those women who are fighting to survive and who are fighting for the establishment of a democracy; we need to make it clear that we are standing by their side."
"Speaking about all these upheavals, speaking about the wars and speaking about the genocides, which unfortunately continue to go on, you all know that women are in the front row."
"Women and children are the most vulnerable in our societies but also in the societies outside, and that is why the Commission is working to streamline its various policy initiatives on violence against women and to create synergies between areas with similar objectives."
"So this is where we are in developing a coherent policy response to tackle this huge problem: my link is concrete actions in areas where there are clear legal bases in order to have efficiency, and in this regard, I am going to present a victims' rights package in May this year in which legislation to help women and children will, of course, be very high on the agenda."
"Maybe I should finish with a theme which has been high on the agenda in these last few days."
"You know that on 1 March, I brought the CEOs of large European listed companies around a table to tell them that we do not agree anymore with the 90% quota for men on boards of directors - because that is what is happening."
"There is only one woman for ten men on boards, which means a 90% de facto quota for men."
"So we think that this should be tackled, mainly because all the economic evidence and the scientific evidence on economic functioning shows very clearly that companies with an balanced decision-making structure have a higher return on investment and make more profits than companies with solely male decision-making structures."
"So women mean business; it is in the interests of economic development that women take more responsibility."
"Here, I have challenged publicly listed companies in Europe to sign a 'Women on the Board Pledge for Europe' by March 2012: to pledge to replace outgoing gentlemen on the board by qualified women - and there are so many that it should not be difficult to find these women."
"We are going to see, to observe, to analyse and to count what is happening between today and 8 March next year, and if nothing changes, then I am prepared to take action at EU level to redress the gender balance in corporate board rooms."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Madam Vice-President, what you said was highly symbolic and rich in essence."
"Now, for reasons of balanced representation, I shall give the floor to Commissioner Andor."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this is indeed a remarkable anniversary and it is a great responsibility to participate in this discussion."
"First of all, I wish to thank the rapporteurs from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the associated Committee on Employment and Social Affairs respectively for their report."
"This report is very timely because the issue it highlights has been on the agenda for a while, but it has become more pressing as a result of the impact of the financial and economic crisis on vulnerable groups in society."
"Let me highlight some of the key elements in my employment and social policies that I believe will improve working opportunities and conditions for women."
"There are indeed urgent measures that the Member States need to take in these areas."
"For instance, they need to reduce labour market segmentation by readjusting the balance in employment protection legislation between those workers on permanent contracts and those on time-limited, precarious contracts - which is so often the case for women."
"They also need to strike a better balance between work and private or family life and to remove other disincentives to participation in the workforce by second earners, who again are mostly women."
"It is important to increase the employment rate in the EU and the key challenge in this area is the participation in the labour market by all workers, both male and female."
"I believe that the European Social Fund will have to be better and more robustly used in the future to support the demand-side policies to open new opportunities for women, especially those returning to the labour market after childbirth."
"It is a source of great concern to the Commission that over 80 million people are at risk of poverty in today's European Union."
"The Member States have the main responsibility for fighting against poverty, but the Union has a role to play."
"That is what some three-quarters - 74% - of our fellow Europeans believe, according to the Eurobarometer surveys."
"The flagship initiative, the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, includes proposals for practical measures to achieve the numerical poverty reduction target."
"The Platform focuses on the continuing importance of active inclusion for people furthest from the labour market."
"As I have already pointed out, women make up an important component of that category."
"In 2012, the Commission will present a communication assessing in depth the implementation of active inclusion strategies at national level."
"I mentioned that more than 80 million people are at risk of poverty in today's European Union."
"What is even more worrying is that over 20 million children are among them and the figure has not improved over time."
"Helping to lift those children out of poverty means helping to lift their parents out of poverty too, in particular, the single parents, who are mostly women."
"This calls for a multidimensional approach, covering employment policies to help parents find work, the design of tax benefit systems, and the provision of key services, such as housing, quality childcare and education, and protection of children's rights."
"As foreseen in the Platform, the Commission intends to put forward a recommendation in 2012 on child poverty."
"It will outline common principles and effective monitoring tools to combat and prevent poverty in early life."
"Providing the funding to meet those challenges is also crucial."
"Almost a third of the European Social Fund's allocation of EUR 21.7 billion for the present programming period goes to measures to improve access to employment."
"In addition, almost EUR 3 billion - 2.77 to be precise - from that allocation goes to supporting self-employment and business start-ups, and the beneficiaries are very often women."
"In addition, the European Progress Microfinance Facility has recently been established to support job creation and self-employment."
"The Facility provides loans to people who have lost their jobs and want to start up or develop their own small businesses."
"It pays special attention to women and young people."
"A budget of EUR 100 million has been made available over four years but can be increased to more than EUR 500 million in the joint initiative with the international financial institutions."
"Over the last ten years, EU cooperation under the open method of coordination on social inclusion and social protection has helped to raise awareness and promote the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion set the frame to reduce poverty across the whole range of policy areas."
"Let us do our utmost to make sure it achieves its aim."
"Madam President, as the rapporteur for the opinion on the report on equality, I concentrated on the labour market."
"Unfortunately, the pay differential is still 17% and women are still not always represented in management and supervisory boards."
"There is an urgent need for action here."
"We can no longer afford to waste the potential of females in society, whatever their age."
"We have a good level of education and the state invests in these young women and mothers."
"We really do need to make progress here and demand that companies finally put their fine words into action."
"To this extent, I welcome the fact that companies really are taking a step in the direction of a voluntary quota."
"However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects."
"In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school."
"Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too."
"This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves."
"Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit."
"Madam President, one hundred years ago, women demanded the right to vote and stand for election and today, we are still campaigning for equality for women in many areas, particularly in terms of career options, but also in relation to payment for work and social entitlements, particularly in old age."
"This is revealed not only by the earnings gap between men and women."
"Despite their increasing involvement in the labour market, statistics in all 27 Member States of the European Union show that women are at greater risk of poverty than men."
"There are many reasons why poverty is a female issue."
"I can only go into some of them because of a lack of time."
"The increase in the number of precarious jobs discriminates against women on several counts."
"Over 30% of women are employed in part-time work, compared with only 7.4% of men."
"Studies show that even in these part-time jobs, women are still paid significantly less than men for the same working hours and the same work."
"This reduces the opportunities to integrate in the labour market and pursue a career."
"Pension entitlements are reduced, so that poverty is pre-programmed, particularly for those who choose an independent, single life."
"However, we believe that a life free from poverty can be achieved by political means by developing social security systems in which pensions and minimum wage levels above the poverty threshold are guaranteed and working hours are generally reduced."
"We do not want to wait another hundred years to find out that it is self-evidently the right of women to organise their lives independently of male decisions, despite having child dependents."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, we are voting on two reports that address areas in which women are marginalised and excluded from society."
"Women are traditionally at a higher risk of poverty, especially single mothers and women over the age of 65."
"Among the five objectives proposed by the European Commission in the EU 2020 strategy is the fight against poverty, which makes the report by Mrs Plumb extremely relevant, especially in terms of gender policies in the light of the economic and financial crisis."
"The vulnerability of individual women leaves them exposed to the risk of poverty, social exclusion and therefore isolation."
"This makes it incumbent on the institution we represent to put in place concrete strategies and programmes."
"I also congratulate Mrs Nedelcheva on a good report that promotes equality between men and women in the European Union."
"The representation of women in the public sector, as in the private sector, is very low compared with men."
"In the finance sector, the numbers are even less positive: women represent only 10% of board members of the major European listed companies and 3% of the chairpersons of those boards."
"I therefore support the introduction of quotas to increase the participation of women in the public and private sectors and especially in education; this must be supported because it plays a key role in preventing teachers from directing their students towards professional sectors according to gender stereotypes."
"I will conclude by recalling the words of one of the first American female mayors who said: 'Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as men to be thought of as half as good'."
"In conclusion, let me say that luckily for us women, this is not difficult."
"Madam President, today in Parliament, as we mark the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, we are devoting particular attention to issues of gender equality and overcoming female poverty."
"More than a hundred years ago, women fought for the right to work, and now they have to fight to obtain equal pay for equal work."
"We are moving forward, but progress in the area of gender equality is slow."
"Discrimination still thrives in the workplace, there is deep segregation of the labour market according to gender, the pay gap continues, there is still a shortage of women in decision-making positions and politics and insufficient support for motherhood and single mothers."
"In the European Parliament's report on equality between men and women, we established that it is crucial to strengthen the principle of gender equality in the family and society, to stop violence against women and trafficking in women, guarantee maternity leave, create suitable conditions to take advantage of the services of nurseries and childcare centres, reduce female poverty and assess the contribution made by women to the development of family, society and the economy."
"In order to achieve these objectives, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States must work together, and on this historic day, I would like to convey my greetings to all women and to call on them to continue to fight for their rights and equal opportunities."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first of all, let me congratulate all my colleagues on the fruitful work done over the years as summarised in my report on inequality between men and women, and on the crucial issue of poverty addressed in Mrs Plumb's report."
"While celebrating the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, it is crucial that this House take stock of the long way we still have to go to ensure gender equality across the Union and to mainstream it into all sectors and areas."
"Let us start with the employment sector and the gender pay gap."
"How long will we sit contemplating statistics showing unequal positions, with women paid up to 34% less than men in some EU Member States?"
"We must push for measures - legislative if necessary - to achieve concrete results in practice and not just on paper."
"The place of women in the European labour market, and the numerous obstacles they have to face in the form of discrimination, contribute to the rising phenomenon of women's poverty."
"Too many women remain in a position of relative economic insecurity and dependence."
"They tend to be concentrated in part-time and temporary jobs that are less-well paid, or in inferior positions."
"Poverty gives rise to trafficking in women, to violence and, more generally, to exploitation of all kinds. We also know that as a result of poverty, women victims of domestic violence prefer not to take steps for their own protection because of a lack of financial security."
"Mrs Reding, on this symbolic day, we look forward to the EU strategy on combating violence against women, as you have already promised."
"Madam President, 8 March 2011, the one hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day."
"That calls for a celebration of everything we have achieved, such as the franchise for women, the right to equality and reproductive rights, at least in the more civilised countries."
"However, this is also a day for feeling sad about all the things that are still not as they should be."
"In the EU, women are still severely under-represented in decision making, caring responsibilities fall almost entirely on women's shoulders and there is still a persistent income gap between men and women, including outside the EU, where some countries have not even begun working on giving women the franchise."
"The hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day also calls for an historical comparison."
"The first really major step for women in the labour market was taken during the two world wars, especially the Second World War."
"There were simply too few men to do the work in factories and offices."
"Employers no longer had a choice and women entered the labour market in large numbers."
"Such a period is upon us again."
"This time, not because of a war, fortunately, but because of an ageing population."
"In five to ten years, there will again simply be too few men to fill the vacancies at various levels."
"Employers need to attract and retain women."
"The ageing population could provide an ideal opportunity for gender equality."
"It is up to us, as European politicians, and it is up to our colleagues in national parliaments, to encourage this development by providing quality maternity leave for mothers and quality paternity leave for fathers, by providing a sufficient level of affordable childcare, by providing the right to flexible hours and part-time work with good social rights, by establishing quotas for women's inclusion in corporate executive bodies and politics, or making credible threats to that effect."
"Together, we can ensure that it does not take another hundred years before men and women have equal rights and equal opportunities in every sphere."
"Madam President, I am the shadow rapporteur for the report on the face of female poverty in Europe, so I will focus on this report."
"The report brings together a whole range of issues which provide a very good description of the position of women in the EU."
"I am pleased that the report sets out many points indicating the need to make use of flexible forms of employment, and by that I mean both fixed-term employment and part-time employment, because in my opinion, single mothers in particular, and families in general with young children to raise, need to make use of the broad range on offer on the labour market, so that they can combine work life and family life."
"At the same time, of course, I welcome and fully support the fact that attention is drawn here again to the persistently large pay gap between women and men."
"I would briefly just like to say that the report also includes some issues we would find it difficult to support."
"This includes, for example, the call to create a European charter of women's rights and the reference to the report on maternity leave, which, as we know, the Member States have not accepted."
"In this spirit, we have supported some of the amendment proposals."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, as this is a genuinely good and comprehensive report."
"Madam President, a hundred years of fighting for equality - I think it is important today to also consider the pioneers who started the fight for equality a hundred years ago and who prepared the way for the progress that we can nevertheless see has been made."
"I would like to thank all my fellow Members, all the NGOs - all those who are continuing the fight for equality."
"We are to debate the situation of women in the EU, but I think it is important for us today to also show our solidarity with those women who, right now, out on the streets and in the squares, are showing enormous courage by taking part in the fight for democracy and justice in other countries."
"I think we should also remember these women today."
"The reports we are debating here illustrate the inequality on the labour market, where women have precarious jobs and suffer pay discrimination of an average of 17%."
"Only 6 out of 10 women in Europe participate in the labour market, and when they have a job, it is often a precarious part-time job that does not provide a decent living."
"There is nothing strange about this, because there are powerful forces opposing the expansion of childcare and other prerequisites for women to be able to work."
"Equal opportunities on the labour market mean that we must have the Maternity Leave Directive - which I hope will also include paternity leave."
"I hope that we will soon be able to discuss parental insurance, where men and women take equal responsibility for providing for the family, but also for looking after the children."
"If women in the EU were to work to the same extent as men, prosperity would increase by more than a quarter."
"We cannot afford to do without women on the labour market."
"Quotas are called for."
"I believe that quotas are a necessary instrument in a society in which only 3% of large companies are headed by women."
"I can compare the use of quotas with antibiotics."
"I do not like the excessive use of antibiotics, but when someone is ill, I am very pleased that they exist."
"It is certainly indicative of an ailing society if only 3% of women are in the leading roles of large companies."
"Quotas are therefore a necessary instrument for putting right what is wrong in our society."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, there is a lot of self-congratulation going on here in the European Union on International Women's Day."
"It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog's breakfast of it."
"You talk about maternity leave."
"All that is happening with draconian maternity leave, let me tell you, Madam, is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business."
"So you have done them no favours."
"We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court, which means that even if young women could get a job, they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled."
"And now you are talking about quotas."
"What kind of madness is this?"
"Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business - professional women - are being patronised on quotas."
"Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say, are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business?"
"The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(SV) Madam President, Mr Bloom, desiring parental insurance and believing it to be a good thing does not make someone raving mad."
"You only need to look at those Member States that have a well-developed parental insurance system."
"Those countries - the Nordic countries, Sweden for example - also have the highest rate of employment for women."
"This proves that good parental insurance means that we will also have higher employment figures for women, and men, too, of course."
"Parental insurance is good for equality on the labour market."
"Women can also contribute to prosperity in the EU."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, this is simply not true and is not borne out by the statistics in my country."
"Speak to any small businessman you like in my country."
"I am not interested in the honourable Member's country or other people's countries, I am interested in my country and my economy, and I can tell you that all businessmen and women will say that they will not employ young women because of the draconian maternity laws."
"I wish, I desperately wish, you would come into the real world; hands up any of you who have had a real job!"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(ET) Mr Bloom, you of course know that in Europe, women are better educated than men, including in your home country."
"Why do you then think that, if quotas are imposed on companies, that one-third will include just those illiterate women that may also exist in our society?"
"Madam President, in reply to Ms Oviir, I would simply counsel her to let companies do their business."
"The less you regulate, the less you tax, the less you interfere, the quicker our economy will recover."
"That is what it is all about, and that is something the honourable Member does not understand."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(PT) Madam President, Mr Bloom, do you know what the United Kingdom's problem is?"
"It is having 52 weeks of poorly paid maternity leave."
"Only the first six weeks are paid at 60%, while 33 are at only a token rate and there are 13 weeks unpaid."
"That is only for rich families, in which the women can stay at home and see the family budget reduced."
"That is the problem of the United Kingdom, not our proposals regarding maternity leave."
"Madam President, in reply to Ms Estrela, I can assure her that the problem with my country is that we have given up self-government and we are Members of the European Union: that is my country's problem."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FI) Madam President, in fact, I want to thank Mr Bloom for these opinions of his, because they are quite prevalent."
"If that were not the case, we would have made a lot of progress."
"Only there are a lot of people who keep quiet."
"I would have liked to ask you, Mr Bloom, if you think that children are just the children of women, and that fathers have no responsibility and no need for paternity leave or to look after their families other than by going to work."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, in reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki, I would say that I believe that children are the responsibility of their parents and nobody else."
"I do not accept that somebody takes responsibility for his neighbour's children."
"It is for the parents to take responsibility for their children and that is how it should be."
"The more self-responsibility we had in Europe - and indeed, the world - the better it would be, in my view."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of the signs of the absolute poverty of our society that we still need to discuss the issue of equality between men and women."
"Women suffer disadvantage not just in the world of work, but also in society at large."
"The list seems endless, which is why I will confine myself to a few keywords: wage levels, working and appointment conditions, precarious employment contracts, pension entitlements, childcare, social security and various forms of violence against women."
"There are plenty of women who are better qualified than men and yet we find ourselves discussing equal pay for equal work - incredible."
"Something equally incredible is the fact that women are at greater risk of poverty than men; older women and single parents are particularly at risk."
"Let me remind you that 2010 was the Year for Combating Poverty."
"Poverty is a female issue."
"This has serious consequences for society because poverty leads to illness and can consequently result in unemployment."
"(HU) Madam President, today, there have been two debates in Parliament the subjects of which were based on the reports of my fellow Members - on these I congratulate them - and in which it is truly difficult to say anything new, since the situation is almost unchanged and, in a certain sense, has even become worse over the past years."
"In the debate on the wages of men and women, for example, we have been saying year after year that there is still a sizeable difference, even though the principle of 'equal pay for equal work' was laid down in the Treaty of Rome already back in 1957."
"What is more, since 1975, we also have secondary legislation in this respect, although it is true that if we had to make a list of laws that are in effect but are not working, this one would obviously have a good chance of coming out on top."
"Indeed, as has already been mentioned here, the latest statistical data indicate that the current difference is 17.5%, but some of us still remember that a couple of years ago, this percentage was as low as 15%, while the variability is extremely high."
"And this is not the issue of small and large enterprises, and not only an issue for women; it is also an issue of social justice."
"We cannot state often enough that the wage difference, as has been pointed out by my fellow Member more or less in the same sense, is the punishment of women for motherhood, and is created when young women return to the labour market."
"And therein lies the true major problem: that small enterprises will never solve the problems of society."
"What Parliament requested in this regard, that is, to ensure a transparent distribution of salaries between genders, and to make sure that those who continuously violate this principle at least do not receive support from European funds, is, in my opinion, not much."
"True, there is some progress: the introduction of the 'equal pay day' represents some measure of progress, but the truly great achievement would have been if that day were held on 1 or 2 January instead of 5 March."
"(PT) Madam President, women are in the majority in universities and are better qualified, but when it comes to decision-making positions, their rise is blocked by a glass ceiling."
"That is why we need quotas."
"It is a shame that Mr Bloom has already left."
"In politics and in economics, it should be noted that there is only one female chair of a central bank."
"Women were not responsible for the financial crisis, but they could have helped to prevent it."
"Why is it that when we are talking about quotas, someone always brings up merit?"
"Is it just the merit of women that is being questioned?"
"Is it the case that men do not have merit?"
"The quota is a necessary and temporary measure to promote the balanced representation of men and women in decision making and I would therefore congratulate the Commission on the efforts it has been making to ensure that decision making is shared in economic power as well."
"(ET) Madam President, a happy International Women's Day to everyone!"
"When it comes to gender equality, it is not just differences and social justice that are the issue."
"Gender equality is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion."
"Investing in gender equality measures will pay off in terms of a higher level of women's employment, women's contribution to GDP, a higher tax yield and sustainable fertility rates."
"Our understanding of gender equality is, for many, still at a medieval level today; or, at least, this is what we have heard in some speeches."
"There is a bogeyman in this subject, and this bogeyman is quotas."
"People are forgetting, or perhaps do not want to see, that a quota is not being imposed on decision-making positions, and that a quota will not put incompetent women in positions of power."
"In Europe, women are better educated, they are able to take responsibility, and they are able to work well and to get paid fairly for their work."
"Those countries where quotas are applied, where they were already being used 20 years ago - I am thinking here of Northern European countries - have indeed shown that our objectives can be achieved through this measure and these days, people have reconsidered their behaviour - quotas are not necessary to the same extent as they were in the past."
"It is considered the norm for women to participate in all areas of society."
"I would, of course, like to say many things about poverty as well as single mothers, but unfortunately time does not allow me to do so."
"Thank you to everyone who gave speeches - one day, we will be winning nonetheless!"
"(DE) Madam President, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day provides us with good reason to celebrate, give thanks and fight on."
"We are dealing with a report into women and poverty; one of the key reasons for this problem is wage inequality between women and men."
"As we have already heard, wage equality has been enshrined in the Treaties of Rome since 1957. However, the pay differential is still 17.5% throughout Europe and as high as 23% in Germany."
"In 2008, this House adopted a report on wage inequality thanks to the excellent work of Mrs Bauer."
"This report called on the Commission to instigate legislative initiatives to combat wage inequality."
"There has been no action since then."
"Furthermore, Commissioner Reding, all you have done is to designate 5 March as European Equal Pay Day, an announcement you made on Friday, 4 March."
"Lucky that you remembered to do this before the day had actually passed."
"We have no more time for meaningless press releases."
"We do not want to hear nice words from you."
"We want you finally to take action so that the 100th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome will not be another day on which the pay differential between women and men is more than 0%."
"We want equal pay now."
"I would like to turn now to the issue of women's quotas and to my fellow Member from England: I would like to know whether he believes that only 3% of women in England and throughout Europe 'know how to do their business'."
"Perhaps that explains why there are so few women on supervisory boards?"
"I do not think that this is the case."
"We need a quota."
"Mrs Reding, you have said that businesses must commit to appoint women by next year."
"Is it your wish that we should have these commitments by next year, or that women should have been appointed by next year?"
"I hear that you want the second objective I mentioned."
"(PL) Madam President, the problem of female poverty, which is of the utmost importance, is raised in the resolution under discussion."
"It is worth reminding ourselves that it is women who are bearing the heaviest burden as a result of the financial crisis."
"It is primarily women who have felt the consequences of this crisis in terms of reduced employment levels, lower pay and restructuring measures."
"Furthermore, it is women who shoulder parental and child-rearing responsibilities while, at the same time, participating in the very difficult and ever-changing labour market."
"The situation of women in the EU Member States is very diverse, and it is therefore extremely important to show solidarity and understanding for women in regions where the problem of poverty is particularly acute."
"The issue of unequal pay should force us to stop and think, since there are also pay differences in companies which are managed and owned by women."
"This is a worrying fact, and it requires that we give thought to whether the causes lie deeper, and whether administrative rules and regulations - hard law - are sufficient in this instance, or whether it is necessary to alter people's awareness and culture in general."
"Nothing can replace respect and social culture, and legislation will not be enough either."
"(PT) Madam President, it is particularly significant that this year, on International Women's Day, we are discussing these reports that seek to draw attention to the inequalities and discrimination that persist."
"In some countries, society is even taking backward steps."
"When we highlight an historic date linked to women's struggle for recognition and the exercising of their rights, we are highlighting the worsening of unemployment and unstable jobs, along with low wages, and discrimination in terms of wages and on the basis of maternity that assail women workers; these are taking on expressions that are particularly shocking and unacceptable in the younger generations."
"Situations of loss of income are on the increase and women are getting poorer."
"The situations of disabled, immigrant and retired women with small pensions, and of low paid women workers, are particularly critical."
"The problems faced by women in the rural world and in family agriculture are increasing, as are those of women running micro- and small enterprises."
"The impact of austerity measures in some countries, such as Portugal, Greece and Ireland, is having repercussions for the lives of women as workers, citizens and mothers."
"That is the case with the deliberate reduction of wages, the freezing of admissions to university courses, and the blocking of collective bargaining; and with the cuts to healthcare, education, social security and a variety of forms of social support."
"Preventing the taking of measures, under the pretext of the crisis, which threaten women's right to equality and to the necessary economic and social cohesion, is therefore a crucial issue."
"Fine words and declarations of good intentions are not enough."
"It is time to break with the neoliberal policies of the Stability and Growth Pact, with liberalisations and privatisations, and with free competition, which are always in the service of economic and financial interest groups."
"It is time to prioritise women and their rights, equality, and economic and social cohesion, so that we can have a better society; so that we can truly respect human rights and consolidate the progress that women have helped to build for our civilisation."
"(ES) Madam President, today is a very significant day to talk about equality between men and women because we are celebrating International Women's Day, remembering those who fought for women's working and economic rights and their right to vote 100 years ago."
"We have made considerable progress in those 100 years, but much remains to be done."
"True equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life."
"I believe that every one of us, both men and women, can do a lot more to achieve true emancipation for women."
"There are many women in the world whose right to life is being threatened, whose dignity is being violated, and whose freedom is being denied."
"Allow me, on this International Women's Day, to demonstrate my support and hope to all women fighting for their democratic rights in the revolution in North Africa."
"Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world."
"We are worth the same and deserve the same."
"I will continue fighting to achieve that equality and International Women's Day will continue to exist until it is achieved."
"Even if there are many who do not want to see it, the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children."
"I must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in Parliament, and I promise to continue working toward that, of course."
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to begin by commending the work of my fellow Members, Mrs Nedelcheva and Mrs Plumb."
"On this symbolic day marking 100 years of International Women's Day, I could almost repeat word for word what was said last year as the fight is still ongoing."
"It is true that women are more resilient to the current crisis in terms of job losses."
"As for combating violence against women, we look to the Commission to indicate what its intentions are, to agree to our call for the creation of a European Year highlighting this issue, and to put forward a strategy."
"I am told that this will happen soon, which I am delighted about."
"Unfortunately, equal pay is not yet a reality despite the many efforts made by some Member States and by the European Commission, in particular."
"Paternity leave has also regrettably been rejected by Member States despite the all-out efforts of this Parliament and the right to abortion is still not recognised in four Member States of the Union and challenged in others."
"I welcome the new Belgian law on quotas for female representation in companies and on company boards, as well as the tremendously proactive approach displayed on this matter by Mrs Reding and President Buzek even in the press on the other side of the Atlantic."
"Lastly, we should, however, celebrate the fact that after 100 years, we are half way down the path to gender equality thanks to European and national laws."
"Let us stay on track so that it does not take another 100 years to achieve true gender equality."
"Madam President, as many Members have pointed out, the progress of women's rights has moved steadily forward over a number of years."
"In the 30 years between the first elections to the European Parliament and 2009, when I was elected, the representation of women has more than doubled."
"We now see women in major roles in politics, business, industry and the media."
"Perhaps most importantly, as a society, we have come to appreciate the necessity of the role of women and to recognise their contribution, winning equality along the way."
"However, we need to be mindful of how far we push calls for more equality and in what areas."
"Our concern should be to focus on what is still wrong today."
"In the UK, women still account for under 20% of the Members of Parliament, nearly half of the companies in the FTSE 250 have no females in the boardroom at all, and only a fifth of all engineering, science and IT graduates are women."
"Given the diverse nature of our societies, this is clearly something that Member States need to address - without quotas and targets arbitrarily set at an EU level."
"However, over and above representation, there are thousands of women across the EU, and indeed the world, who endure violence, exploitation and exclusion."
"They are the ones without a voice."
"It is those women - who suffer from discrimination, are deliberately discouraged from achievement, or are victims of repression - who surely deserve our absolute attention."
"(DE) Madam President, firstly, I would like to welcome the small number of men who have joined the small number of women in this plenary."
"Naturally, I am in favour of equal treatment and equal opportunities for women and men."
"I have been successfully campaigning for this at national and European level for over 50 years."
"Unfortunately, the report on the equality of women and men in the EU 2010 once again contains exaggerated demands that are counterproductive for women in the final analysis."
"I do not have the time to explain them all here."
"It is through no fault of the rapporteur that the large number of amendments have made the report quite hard to digest."
"In relation to the controversial question of whether the EU should impose a women's quota in listed companies, I must warn against praising Norway as a shining example of such a measure."
"You may ask why."
"Since the introduction of the women's quota between 2003 and 2009 the number of companies quoted on the stock market has decreased from 554 to 362."
"One in three companies gave the introduction of the women's quota as the reason it withdrew from the stock market."
"In Norway, 70 women, known as 'golden skirts', occupy about 300 seats on management boards."
"This is warped, but very interesting."
"Speaking for myself, I might be attracted to the career of a 'golden skirt' as I have not been a member of a single management board so far."
"The Commission needs to think carefully and weigh up the consequences before reacting too hastily to this problem."
"I also regret that this report recommends in the same breath that women should be allowed easy access to contraception and abortion."
"In other words, abortion is equated with contraception as a simple means of birth control."
"This is an insult to women."
"I cannot agree to this, quite apart from the fact that the EU has no powers in this area - subsidiarité oblige!"
"I regret the fact that some female Members consistently mix these two issues together."
"That is not necessary."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put a very simple question to Mrs Lulling: does she not believe that the move to equality between men and women is, even in 2011, hindered precisely because of views such as hers, which are therefore the views of a woman, and which she is so eager to share with us even today?"
"(FR) Madam President, I do not know, I have said nothing before 2011, why has the situation deteriorated?"
"It will not deteriorate if we remain realistic, but it will deteriorate if we adopt a utopian and unrealistic approach."
"(Applause)"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FR) Madam President, Mrs Lulling, whereas I could be very proud that you have thanked the few men present in this debate, being one of the rare male members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I could get really cross were you to tar me with the same brush as Mr Bloom."
"I would like to know if you can distinguish between Mr Bloom and me or whether I am to regret that you associate us both in the same struggle because we clearly hold radically opposing positions."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Tarabella, I made no mention of Mr Bloom!"
"You have done a great service to Mr Bloom because it was you who put the questions to him and gave him the opportunity to take the grandstand here."
"I am grateful these questions were raised as I can therefore have the time to speak that I need."
"However, I must tell you, Mr Tarabella, that you are a distinguished member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"I can always count on you to put across the voice of reason, and I am sorry that you and I have not been listened to where some passages of these reports are concerned."
"Madam President, on the anniversary of International Women's Day, when we are debating the Plumb report on the face of female poverty and the Nedelcheva report on inequality between women and men in the European Union, and when the institutions are focusing on quotas for women on boards, the PS Women group is dedicating its 2011 campaign to the issue of pension systems and female poverty."
"All European societies are facing ageing populations, and pension systems all over Europe are being reformed."
"This is why the EU must send a signal that the lives of ordinary women are central to our concern."
"On the fundamental issue of pensions, the European Commission should be leading the charge in closing the structural gaps between women and men."
"Women should not be disadvantaged for reasons beyond their power: the pay gap, as my colleague mentioned, taking care of relatives and non-decent work."
"Our first task is to raise awareness among women."
"We need to underline that during the ongoing discussions on pensions, the female factor has come up very rarely."
"We want policy makers to be aware of the effects of that and to make sure that precise data on women and pensions become available."
"The Commission needs to conduct research on the gender effect in pension reforms in Europe and I am sure that Viviane Reding will do that."
"We need to look at best practices at national level and look into a European approach."
"It really is time to think about what we have achieved during the last 100 years."
"We need a clear future for our children."
"It is also important to remind ourselves of what Clara Zetkin did one hundred years ago, because bridging the gender pay gap was her idea."
"It will be really important too that we make changes in the style of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire - remembering that Ginger Rogers had to do everything 'backwards in high heels'."
"(PL) Madam President, the reports on inequalities affecting women and men in the European Union contain many suggestions for what should be done and what steps should be taken to reduce these inequalities."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to Commissioner Reding for the measures she is taking at European level to reduce differences between women and men."
"However, the majority of these measures should be taken at national or Member State level."
"This is where fierce opposition is frequently met from politicians, institutions and public opinion."
"Women's organisations therefore frequently call on the Commission for help."
"Yet grass-roots actions are of key importance, as in the case of Poland, where it was possible to overcome opposition thanks to a women's social movement known as the Congress of Women."
"We collected over 100 000 signatures for a social and legal initiative and, as a result of a broad debate which mobilised public opinion, the Polish Parliament voted through 35% parity for women on all electoral lists, including those for European elections."
"I am very proud that Poland has joined the countries where parity is a legal requirement, and that it is the first of the new Member States to introduce this significant change."
"We will now carefully monitor what influence this has on women's political participation."
"I would like to state clearly that we should set ourselves new goals straight away, and these goals should be equal pay for various groups of women and parity in other decision-making bodies. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs and I also dedicate this 8 March to the women of North Africa and the Middle East, such as the many women who, at this moment, are demonstrating in Cairo and Iran and fighting for democracy and liberty in their countries."
"In this respect, I hope that firm measures will be taken, including in the external actions of the European Commission, to establish links with these women."
"Even in Europe, there is a great reawakening of women's participation, starting with demands to respect the dignity of women in the media and in the behaviour of men in institutions, as was said in town squares on 13 February by 1 million Italian women and many concerned men."
"As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers - which most young women are - during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers."
"While I agree with Mrs Reding's initiative concerning boards of directors, I am less supportive of the initiative on insurance which risks penalising women in particular."
"Without this, there will be no Europe 2020."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say that, for me, the fight for equality between men and women has nothing to do with the Left or Right; it is not a fight by men or by women; it is a fight for society as a whole."
"What kind of contemporary society would invest in training young girls, as we do, only to then deny itself of 50% of the available intelligence in the workplace?"
"That must not be the kind of society in which we live."
"I call on you, the Commission, the Council and Parliament to mobilise so that we leave behind a more egalitarian, fairer society that does more to harness the training of young girls and their intelligence."
"The second point, Commissioner, concerns equal access to positions of responsibility."
"As you know, I am French and I was against quotas."
"But after 10 years, I have realised that without quotas, we will not achieve anything."
"Without quotas, there will never be as many women as there are men"
"(Applause)"
"in positions of responsibility."
"I heard the President of Parliament support this view last week."
"I think that we really do need to go down this road now."
"You know that I was against quotas as I find it somewhat degrading having to protect women who should be able to progress on the basis of their skills."
"I feel we now need to resort to that approach, however."
"The third and final point is our need to fight for equal pay for men and women."
"Thank you for your contributions."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Madam President, today we are honouring the struggle by women through the ages and female achievements."
"We are recording the persistent democratic deficits which are currently being exacerbated by the economic crisis: poverty, trafficking, violence, unemployment, sexual exploitation, the pay divide, denigration in the media, the perpetuation of stereotypical roles and under-representation in the centres of power - all of which are feminine nouns - do most damage to single mothers, elderly women, female immigrants and disabled women."
"We need coordinated action at European and national level: more effective employment and social protection policies to combat poverty, more measures to reconcile home life and work to support working women and pro-active measures and quotas for balanced representation in the centres of power."
"We need proper education and awareness-raising to stamp out violence and stereotypes."
"The road is long, but we must travel it, because women deserve better opportunities without prejudice."
"(PL) Madam President, women are discriminated against in every area of life; they are beaten and raped."
"Half of all European women have experienced violence, and over one million suffer it on a daily basis."
"Work continues on the directive on violence against women, yet at the same time, there are countries in the European Union, including Poland, unfortunately, which allow themselves to use legally-sanctioned violence against women in the field of sexual and reproductive health."
"The lack of proper sex education and easy access to contraceptives mean that women who become pregnant, including those who are underage, are forced by law to give birth to the child."
"A pregnant woman is treated like an incubator, deprived of the right to decide for herself and of the right to health and privacy to which every man is entitled."
"The ban on abortion does not reduce the number of such procedures carried out."
"Anti-abortion legislation must be condemned, since it is a form of state violence against women and institutional discrimination against women."
"If men were the ones who became pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to express my acknowledgement and gratitude to all the women, many of whom are well known and written about, but many others of whom are anonymous, who have worked and fought these last 100 years to achieve the standard of equality we now have."
"However, there still remains much to be done, and these reports bring us to issues such as the reconciliation of family and work life, difficulties in accessing the labour market or the fight against gender-based violence, which is one of the main scourges that exists in Europe and worldwide."
"Equality between men and women is still not a reality."
"Therefore, we must now begin a new phase which sees commitments become realities."
"From the European institutions and from the rest of European society we have to aim to make progress toward achieving true equality between men and women."
"Such equality could provide the opportunity to achieve a more just and equal society and, on that road, men are essential."
"Much remains to be done and we will see it through together."
"(PL) Madam President, today is an opportunity to remind ourselves of people's right to equal treatment, regardless of their gender."
"In spite of many measures undertaken to ensure equal rights, the issue of the pay difference between women and men is still unresolved."
"Women are still in a more difficult situation; employers frequently assess their suitability for a job not on the basis of their qualifications, but on the basis of whether they will have children or not, or, if they already have them, who will look after them when they are ill."
"Nobody asks men or fathers such questions when they are being recruited."
"I would therefore stress the need for changes to the system, and for measures to be taken which change the way in which society perceives this problem, and which ensure that women themselves are liberated from the internal belief that only they are responsible for raising children, thus allowing these inequalities to be eradicated."
"Knowing the charisma and determination of Commissioner Reding, I believe that this will most certainly be achieved. Thank you."
"(FI) Madam President, on this International Women's Day, it is worth examining how equality is actually implemented in Europe."
"We share a new concern, and that is the feminisation of poverty."
"Although women do more work than men, men earn higher levels of pay and still receive bigger pensions."
"It is wrong that men are becoming richer and women poorer."
"That is very true of older women in particular, and that is why they should be helped in every possible way."
"Ageing and growing old, especially with regard to women, should not be a burden."
"It should not be regarded as a liability, but something that enriches society and Europe and is a resource."
"The future of the world and Europe will mainly depend on women, and mothers in particular."
"Obviously, it is good that the sons and husbands of mothers, Mr Bloom and myself, have something meaningful to do other than go to war."
"My congratulations."
"(Applause)"
"(SL) Madam President, the Vienna Philharmonic, probably the best classical music orchestra in the world, only permitted women members to join and perform with them a few years ago."
"Just imagine what our orchestra here, this Parliament, would look and sound like if we did not have our women members livening it up with their character and informed debate."
"It is obvious that a day like today, a day to remind us of the inequality of women, is more than necessary."
"On pay day, on the day when roles are allocated at work, and on all days when it comes to caring for children and family, women are not equal."
"Our responsibility in the European Parliament and the responsibility of our colleagues in national parliaments is to legislate appropriately in order to bring about that equality."
"However, I think that we will also promote that equality by showing care and attention to women on a daily basis."
"(SK) Madam President, it is important that we are discussing female poverty today."
"At the same time, it is a pity that, in seeking a solution, we remain beholden to a one-sided way of thinking."
"Solving female poverty involves more than just forcible intervention in the family environment."
"The most recent OECD research shows that such intervention has only limited success."
"Women devote more time than men to household work and childcare."
"This applies even when the man is on parental leave."
"They do not do this because they have to, but because they want to."
"They prefer to opt for part-time employment."
"According to OECD figures, 30 to 50% of all economic activity of women does not appear in current measures of affluence, such as per capita GDP, for example."
"Solving female poverty therefore also involves recognising the work that women perform within the framework of intergenerational solidarity."
"In recognising this work, we will take a fundamental step towards solving poverty."
"(EL) Madam President, I have something different to say: today is not a day of celebration, as far as I am concerned; it is a day of remembrance of the women who died in the uprising in America not 100, but 157 years ago."
"We should not forget that either."
"If we are to move forward, we need three basic things:"
"the first is support structures for working women: nurseries and crèches;"
"the second, Commissioner Andor, is financial support for women; and"
"the third is to change attitudes in schools and here, Commissioner Reding, I propose that there should be quotas, not only on governing boards, which is like trying to repair the house from the roof down, but also for nursery and school teachers, so that we can live equality of the sexes."
"To close, I call on you Madam President, as a female president, to circumvent the rules and to give the floor to the remaining ten female speakers for this special ceremony for Women's Day."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both here in the Chamber and in the galleries, the campaign for women's rights in the workplace, in the family, in democracy, for economic independence for women and against male violence, female poverty and discrimination against single mothers, lesbians and female migrants, is one that has already gone on for too long."
"Today, we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day."
"Happily, in the future, we shall also be able to celebrate what has been achieved, while not losing sight of the work still to be done."
"Mrs Morin-Chartier has already said that she would not have put much faith in quotas ten years ago, but that she has changed her mind: quotas are essential."
"Thank you for that."
"Quotas are indeed something that women need if they are to get anywhere."
"We have men's quotas in all supervisory boards, in all statutory authorities, in politics and in business."
"Male networks operate without any difficulty."
"Men are not necessarily in influential positions because of their performance - some are, though it is by no means true of all - but simply because they belong to these boys' networks."
"That is why we need quotas and wage equality."
"(EL) Madam President, I think that today is a very important day; we are celebrating Women's Day, the day of the women we love, the women we respect, the women who are our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters, working women and housewives."
"I wish to express my thanks to the entire female sex and to emphasise that I personally support the fight by women for equality in society and at work, for equal pay and for quotas in the centres of power, and deplore all forms of violence against and exploitation of women."
"I shall say no more, it has all been said."
"Thank you ladies, all of you, both present and absent from this meeting."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, I would like to make a special dedication to all the women who fight every day for the respect of their rights in modern society, to all the women who choose to have a child knowing that this will make it difficult to reconcile their working lives with their new role as mothers, to all the women who, aware of their talents and abilities, decide to press ahead on their own way despite the many obstacles."
"Precisely for this reason, I support the introduction of, at least initially, obligatory quotas for women as a means of breaking a culture that only helps men."
"I am convinced this would offer the opportunity that many young women have been waiting for and that, armed with their professional skills and education, they will certainly not allow it to escape."
"I have a baby who is only a few months old and I have a dream: I hope that my daughter, Vittoria, will not have to fight as we do to break these glass ceilings and that female talent will no longer have to be seen as an obligation but rather as a genuine added value."
"Madam President, it was the Trotskyists who transformed Marxist class warfare into multi-grievance group warfare."
"Society was to be segmented into groups, who might or might not have known that they had a grievance until that was explained to them by helpful young militants."
"The groups might be defined by ethnicity, religion, sex, sexuality, age or disability."
"They were all to be urged to engage in collective action against their oppressors."
"The Trotskyists grew older, if not up."
"In some cases, they moved into positions of power and influence."
"Their ideas spread much faster and further than they did."
"The word 'discrimination', when followed by the word 'against', became the ultimate evil."
"In many cases, there is no identifiable perpetrator."
"The discriminator is the rest of society."
"We are all guilty."
"People, whatever their real disadvantage, must realise when they are being manipulated and must shake off that manipulation."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day should also be an occasion to reflect and take stock."
"Today, I would like to express my thanks to the pioneering women who paved the way for us, making it possible for so many women now to play a role in political life and in business."
"However, this day should also be a warning to us not to put at risk what has been achieved so far."
"Many aspects of the programmes of the various Member States, which are now to be implemented under the cover of budgetary consolidation, are specifically against women, against women's educational opportunities, against women's opportunities to make a fair and living wage, against women's opportunities to play a role in political development."
"I am calling particularly on men - and I can see there are several among us now - to work with us in partnership to ensure that our ambitious goals can be achieved, so that International Women's Day really will be a day to celebrate in the future."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I believe that one hundred years of struggle and one hundred years of progress have to be respected, but we also have to acknowledge that contemporary Europe is still far from full equality between men and women."
"Many of these inequalities are reproduced through the imbalances in the labour markets and the bias against women in many segments and in many institutions within the labour market."
"That is why I believe that European policies and European financial instruments will have to be used to improve the situation in this area, and to improve employment opportunities and employment conditions of women, in order to make progress."
"Many concrete actions are possible."
"For example, as regards European funds, wherever it is possible and reasonable, equal opportunities conditionality would be very important, and we want to pursue this."
"However, direct job creation is also important."
"One of the key directions in job creation in the coming decade will be towards so-called 'white jobs' - jobs in healthcare and long-term care."
"Here, we have to focus on creating opportunities, because much of this work is, in any case, being done by women, but without proper remuneration and without the opportunity to accumulate rights, including pension rights for their old age."
"On the question of pensions, in the White Paper on Pensions to be published in the third quarter of this year, we will pay more attention to the gender dimension."
"There is a group of Commissioners working on this Pensions White Paper, and with Vice-President Reding participating and contributing, we will manage to address the gender dimension of pensions more forcefully than in the previous Green Paper."
"I agree with Mrs Zimmer."
"This is also a question of regulating working time."
"That is absolutely fundamental."
"We need an EU working time regulation which allows for better accommodation of working needs and family responsibilities."
"A better work-life balance is absolutely essential."
"This is part of our decent work agenda."
"I agree with those who highlighted that this is not only an issue that applies inside the EU: this is an international responsibility which we have to pursue."
"To highlight one more connection - that between the labour market and education - we have to go deep in order to improve the quality of education, to raise awareness, to teach about rights, including women's rights especially and - this is very important - rights for European minorities, whether they are immigrants or other ethnic minorities."
"Finally, on the question of quotas on corporate boards, I had an opportunity last week to discuss this matter with the new head of the Confederation of British industry - I am sure Mr Bloom will be interested to hear that."
"There are many aspects to this question."
"Apart from tackling stereotypes and the organisational and cultural aspects, our discussion also highlighted the need to organise family life differently, because of the time demands of top-level jobs."
"That is why we have to act on many fronts."
"We must not extend this discussion solely to working life and public life."
"I believe that if we continue the discussion, and the Commission's efforts, with due responsibility, we can make progress in the future."
"Madam President, Mrs Reding, Commissioner, I should like to thank all my fellow Members for their contributions and their speeches."
"Once again, today's debate proves how much the issue of gender equality matters to us."
"We all share common values and principles: those of respecting human dignity, those of fighting inequality and discrimination."
"I have a great deal of respect for the personal and often national connotations that each of us brings to these values and principles."
"Therein lies the wealth of the European vision on these matters."
"However, these different connotations must not make us lose sight of our common goals."
"We need to continue working towards improving the conditions of women both in the workplace and on a personal and family level."
"Their access to the job market should be further encouraged, especially to positions of responsibility, and national authorities, institutions, political bodies and companies should be held to account on this."
"It falls to us all to show that these objectives are achievable."
"It has indeed been said many times today that combating gender inequalities is a daily battle."
"Strong political will needs to be backed up by concrete actions."
"I welcome all the actions outlined by the Commission and my thanks also go out in advance to all my fellow Members for the support that we will give them."
"One more point: during the debates, I was criticised for the length of the text which, it seems, gets longer every year."
"This is obviously because the previous recommendations have not been fully implemented."
"We need to make sure that they are implemented by everyone."
"I also believe that it is because of the complex nature of the matter and its dynamic developments."
"I stress that it is up to us to keep up with these developments, to avoid being locked into outdated ideas so that we are in a position to guide the former."
"Lastly, I believe that gender equality remains an issue for us all."
"Above all, I believe that each of us has the free will to recognise this and to work towards it becoming a reality."
"2011 is the European Year of Volunteering, and our greatest joint initiative this year should be achieving genuine progress in gender equality."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioners Reding and Andor for their strong commitments on these important issues."
"I would also like to thank all my colleagues for their strong messages on this important debate today."
"First of all, I would like to say that gender equality is not only a matter of social justice; it is also a matter for progress and we need to build together a fair society for all of us."
"Next, I would like to say that I strongly support quotas."
"Yes, we need women in top positions, but let us not forget poverty."
"We have to tackle and we have to prevent and reduce poverty and we need concrete measures."
"Preventing and reducing poverty is an important component of social solidarity and I strongly believe in women's solidarity."
"We need support for all citizens; we need support from the whole of society and I would like to thank the NGOs, the social partners and all women and men in society who are fighting year by year, day by day, to achieve gender equality."
"We have to make this gender equality become a reality."
"We can accelerate on the track today; together, let us make things happen."
"And once again, I wish all women happy days."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote on the two reports will take place at midday today, 8 March."
"This will be followed by celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day."
"All the women in the Chamber, in Parliament, in the Commission and in the Council are cordially requested to attend a joint photo call after the ceremony."
"I hope that this announcement will be heard by all the ladies and gentlemen in their offices and that they will attend the plenary directly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Following the celebration of the centenary of International Women's Day, it would not be going too far to stress the enriching role that women play in the development of the family, of society and of the economy, although it is often underestimated and underpaid, which significantly increases the risk of poverty."
"One of the main problems lies in limited access to work, in working conditions, or even in accessing roles compatible with their qualifications."
"Moreover, the present economic crisis being experienced by the European Member States has been exacerbating the employment situation of women because of their susceptibility to finding unstable jobs."
"The promotion of equality also involves the struggle against violence against women, whether physical, psychological or sexual, which must be combated and condemned."
"As such, specific programmes have to be adopted to promote the active inclusion or reintegration of women in the labour market, whilst creating specific opportunities for lifelong learning with a view to providing them with skills and qualifications, as well as to reinforcing their confidence and developing the skills necessary in the light of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"On the day when we are celebrating International Women's Day, I support the principles set out in the report on 'Equality between women and men - 2010'."
"However, I believe that in the period ahead, we must move from fair principles to adopting concrete measures to reduce the current gender inequalities."
"Romania, the country which I come from, is in the middle of the Global Gender Gap Index 2010 rankings, in 64th place to be precise, in terms of discrimination between women and men."
"In general, Romanian women are better educated than Romanian men, with a steady rise being seen in the proportion of women among the total number of graduates."
"The current situation is that 60% of graduates are women and only 40% are men."
"However, the incomes received by women continue to be lower than those received by men."
"The gender risks which affect women's opportunities on the labour market are still very powerful, ranging from the higher risk of poverty to blocking access to key positions."
"In the hope that the labour market will treat women more fairly, I would like us, too, to help change this situation."
"This report is an important step towards this."
"The issue of gender equality deserves appropriate attention, particularly at the time of the hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day."
"I personally consider many of the issues from the submitted report to be exceptionally important."
"One of the issues I would like to underline is the pension gap between men and women."
"The gap is caused by the fact that working women interrupt their professional lives more often than men, in order to look after children and sick or older family members, and, because of their family commitments, are more willing than men to accept part-time work or non-permanent work arrangements."
"It is this factor which leads to the pension gap."
"I consider no less important the call for special attention to be paid to vulnerable groups of women, such as disabled or older women, immigrants, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual women, or members of minorities and women with low qualifications or no qualifications, who are caring for dependents."
"Last but not least, I consider it important to secure access to support services aimed at preventing gender-based violence and protecting women against such violence, regardless of their legal status, race, age, sexual orientation, ethnic origin or religion, which the report also calls on the Commission and the Member States to do."
"Gender equality is a fundamental principle of our times, but inequality between men and women still persists."
"The percentage of women amongst scientists and engineers has increased significantly."
"In the EU, women constitute 59% of graduates and 41% of those with doctorates."
"However, there are paradoxical figures worthy of consideration."
"Women are under-represented in science when we are talking about leadership roles."
"Only 19% of university professors in the EU are women."
"These figures lead one to believe that there are problems with women's access to the upper reaches of academia."
"It is essential to find solutions that make a successful career in science compatible with a stable family life."
"I am referring, for example, to the use of new technologies that will enable women scientists to carry out their work from home."
"Only in this way will we manage to resolve the imbalance between men and women in science and research, which continues to be an obstacle to the European objective of increasing competitiveness and maximising potential for innovation."
"The current economic and social crisis is having a very negative effect on the living conditions of men and women in the EU."
"It seriously threatens the female part of the population, particularly in the areas of gender equality, employment conditions and access to employment."
"In the area of employment conditions or income levels, women have been seriously affected, and unless appropriate measures are taken immediately, there is a risk that the situation will deteriorate even further."
"It is also important to take account of the position of women within the framework of the fight against poverty."
"At the global level - in comparison with the male population - up to 17% more women live in poverty, according to statistics."
"The contribution that women make to developing the family and society is also underrated."
"The inequalities between men and women, especially regarding access to education or the sharing out of family responsibilities, are factors which exacerbate female poverty."
"Serious consequences also result from the pay gap between men and women, or the so-called glass ceiling, which prevents women from securing managerial or leading roles."
"The promotion of gender equality is a way of combating violence against women."
"It is absolutely imperative to combat the various forms of violence, regardless of the level of seriousness of physical, mental or sexual violence."
"In respect of this factor, too, it is desirable for EU Member State governments and European institutions to support mechanisms aimed at achieving gender equality in the various aspects of social, economic and political life."
"It is, of course, appropriate that we should be discussing gender equality on International Women's Day, but it is not enough."
"The issue's importance must also be made apparent on all other days when we are taking decisions."
"An essential ingredient in equality, furthermore, is everyone's inviolable right to his or her own body."
"That then extends to the right to contraception, abortion and good sexual health."
"All these issues have been and will obviously long continue to be visible in the way Parliament votes."
"Regrettably, all too often, the quarrels still reflect attitudes that sustain the subjugation of women."
"Equality is one of Europe's fundamental values, and it is an unambiguously positive value."
"The only problem is that equality is interpreted in a great many different ways, some of which are extreme interpretations which do not take into account the real differences that exist between people."
"The various interpretations which are possible have resulted in the emergence of ideologies associated with equality and directly linked to this term."
"There have been instances in the past when crimes were carried out, including even genocide, in the name of equality understood in a specific and doctrinal sense."
"There is less risk of dogmatism when it comes to equality between women and men, but overly radical positions are still held."
"The equality of women and men cannot be limited to political declarations and legal regulations."
"The implementation of standards based on the principle of equality is very important, and changes in mentality are necessary in order for this to be possible."
"We must encourage and support education and information measures and promote good practices."
"We must ensure that awareness of equality is the rule, rather than the exception to the rule."
"True equality must be something which is found within people, in their attitudes, and in their everyday, spontaneous behaviour."
"Equality is not an isolated value, either."
"We should not accept any affirmation of equality which is worded in such a way that it excludes other key values, such as freedom, dignity and justice."
"I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on their reports, which raise the important issue of equal rights."
"As one of the reports reveals, over 20 million Europeans, mostly women, have limited access to the labour market because they care for dependent adults."
"We also know how difficult the challenges are facing parents who wish to combine raising children with professional work."
"I believe that taking concrete steps to reconcile professional and family life is a matter of the utmost importance for both social and economic development in Europe."
"We need to take measures promoting the creation of local support systems for families caring for children and dependent adults, and to review legislation and make wider use of new technologies in order to remove barriers to flexible forms of employment."
"I believe that the European Union should make every effort to ensure that the huge potential of its capable and well-educated female citizens is fully unlocked."
"I would like to welcome the host of issues raised by this report, which has enabled us, regardless of the committee we are working in, to find a series of correlations which need to be achieved so that we make a greater contribution to achieving the EU 2020 targets."
"As you have seen, calls are being made for measures to be taken at national and European level to promote entrepreneurship among women by creating training, professional and legal advice structures, and by facilitating access to public and private finance."
"I welcome, in particular, the need to develop entrepreneurship at local and regional level as a main source of job creation and economic development."
"The potential women offer in terms of running businesses is used to a very small extent."
"This is why I think that both the European Social Fund and the European Fund for Regional Development must support actions which will allow entrepreneurship to develop among women."
"There may certainly be cultural, material or economic differences preventing us from doing this."
"However, these are factors which we need to bear in mind and for which we need to produce the framework required to overcome them."
"One hundred years after the first public demonstrations by women in the fight for their rights, it has still not brought the desired outcome."
"On the contrary, the current crisis pushes the wheel of history back a few metres, in terms of establishing equality between women and men."
"Women the world over are again coming out onto the streets, just like 100 years ago."
"They are standing at the head of demonstrations in Greece, Spain, the Czech Republic and Belgium, and also in North African countries."
"The EU has, until recently, been boasting of the improving situation of women on the labour market, and in securing education, decent living standards, access to women's healthcare or greater representation in constitutional bodies, but the deepening crisis seems to have consigned this to the margins of Community interest."
"The counter-crisis measures are directed mainly towards the male population."
"The needs of women are perceived as second-level issues."
"The past 100 years have shown what women have given to the world and to progress, and how many of them gave their lives in the struggle for peace, and also how many new lives they have brought into the world."
"This is no small matter."
"However, the world still owes a debt to women."
"It is not a matter of doing them a favour, but of declaring clearly their equal status in society."
"After all, these women are not fighting for themselves, but for a better and more humane world."
"I should firstly like to pay tribute to the bold and enormous task undertaken by my colleague, Mrs Nedelcheva, the rapporteur on this matter."
"The fight for gender equality is a daily battle across all our States."
"My generation was one of the first to see women gain access to senior positions of responsibility, in particular, to elected office."
"I am therefore delighted to see that women are now present in many fields that were still closed to them not so long ago."
"Nevertheless, inequalities still prevail and there are many battles yet to be fought, not least of which is a persistent wage gap and the place of women on the boards of large companies."
"Lastly, I would like to emphasise the importance of ensuring all women have access to quality reproductive healthcare."
"Ever since I started my political career, I have campaigned for women's access to abortion in a safe medical setting."
"Contraceptives must also be made readily available to them."
"I therefore advocate that contraceptives should be free, particularly for minors."
"in writing. - (DE) Trying to sell women's quotas as a milestone is simply populism."
"What women really need is a genuine freedom of choice in life: They must have the certainty that none of their decisions will be given a lesser value."
"An important step in this direction would be to introduce family tax splitting in all Member States so that the establishment of a family does not become a poverty trap."
"Support for women's quotas in supervisory boards only comes from women who are already top earners, if at all."
"Since Norway introduced the women's quota requirement for the management boards of listed companies, these posts are simply accumulated by a small number of women, who occupy several seats on different management boards."
"These women are often disparagingly referred to within business as 'golden skirts', something that is not exactly favourable to the working atmosphere."
"We need to begin in the areas where women suffer genuine disadvantage: we need to look at the position of unpaid carers, at part-time employment and at the plight of the many women who work hard to cope with the demands of family and career."
"Social solidarity and the European social model are values which distinguish Europe from societies in other parts of the world."
"There is a question mark over the extent to which these values are sustainable in the context of the call for global competitiveness based on reduced labour costs, the loosening of labour law, reductions in social protection for workers and the weakening role of the state."
"We will probably not fundamentally enhance global competitiveness in this way, and it is much more likely that we will irreversibly undermine social cohesion and open up divisions in society."
"Make no mistake."
"Women are fundamentally at risk through these measures."
"Pay differences have a significant impact, just like the budget cuts in the public sector."
"From this perspective, pension and health reforms at the national level must be fair to both sexes."
"It is no accident that the issue of European poverty applies more often to older women."
"The fight against inequality is not virtual reality."
"It concerns real people."
"As we discuss the report by Mrs Nedelcheva today, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, it is high time for us finally to follow up our words with deeds."
"The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments."
"These include mandatory women's quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any."
"Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women's Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service."
"We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)"
"100th anniversary of International Women's Day"
"I am extremely pleased to be able to preside over our Parliament together with my female fellow Members."
"Six of them are Vice-Presidents of Parliament, two are Quaestors, and the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is sitting next to me."
"This is a particular honour and privilege for me."
"I am resuming the sitting."
"The next item is the debate on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day."
"We shall begin with a short film summarising the history of this notable day."
"Please start the projection."
"(Projection of a film)"
"Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, a film lasting two minutes cannot show everything that has happened over the past 100 years."
"We have, in fact, changed Europe in this time, and we Europeans can be proud when we compare Europe to many places in the world, but at the same time, we know that our journey is not over."
"There are still too few women in politics, and here in the European Parliament, our female Members account for only 35% of all Members."
"This figure is admittedly somewhat higher than in the national parliaments, but it is still not enough."
"Fortunately, the figure in our Parliament's main decision-making bodies is well over 40%, and we are very pleased about this."
"This is also the case for the chairs of the committees."
"Yet the European Parliament's formation in three years' time, after the next elections, essentially depends on the national parliaments and the way in which representatives are appointed to the European Parliament."
"It is our national parliaments that must ensure that the number of women in the European Parliament increases."
"We are calling on them today to do so, and we are calling on our counterparts in the national parliaments to ensure that appropriate legal solutions are found and the appropriate decisions are taken to facilitate an increase in the number of women in the European Parliament."
"We can also set an example when it comes to the employment of women."
"Of those employed in the European Parliament, 59% are women and, at the same time, over 50% of these women deal with matters of substance."
"I have extensive experience in this area and can pride myself on the fact that while I was responsible for the government in my country, around 50 women occupied the highest ministerial positions and served as directors of the most important state offices."
"This record has never been broken, neither before nor in the dozen or so years since."
"As President of the European Parliament, I have also called for there to be more women in the European Commission and in high-level positions in the European Union."
"We can be pleased that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is a woman."
"The situation in European businesses has also changed, which is very beneficial not only for women, but, above all, for the way in which these businesses operate."
"We should also ensure that women and men employed in the same jobs with the same skills receive the same pay."
"We still have a lot to do in this respect."
"We are very well aware that women are also capable of fighting for democracy and human rights."
"I would like to pay tribute to all of our female fellow Members in the European Parliament, and to think at this point about the women in North Africa and in the Middle East who are showing true courage in their fight for democracy."
"Let us also remember that the past winners of the Sakharov Prize include magnificent women such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Leyla Zana and the Ladies in White."
"I should therefore like once again to repeat that we will not agree to depriving women of their dignity in the name of any legal system, religion or culture."
"We will not agree to women having fewer rights than men, in Europe or elsewhere in the world."
"We will protest if women are unfairly treated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on 3 November 1793, 218 years ago, Olympia de Gouges was beheaded in Europe because she drafted a declaration of the rights of women and female citizens."
"That was the only reason."
"One hundred years later, in 1906, women were given the right to vote."
"The first country where this happened was Finland."
"Let us remember this."
"Over the following century, we made enormous progress in achieving equality between women and men."
"I would like to stress something which is very important for me personally, namely, that 8 March is a holiday for women."
"This is true."
"Yet this holiday primarily serves to remind us that we should remember the most important issue in Europe today, namely, equality of rights for women and men, during the remaining 364 days of the year."
"The principles we wish to reinforce on 8 March should also apply on the other 364 days in the year."
"This is the main challenge facing us."
"It is not enough merely to commemorate 8 March; we need to think about this matter on all the other days in the year as well."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, when the International Women's Day was launched, the equality of women was a brand new and revolutionary idea."
"Since then, gender equality has become one of the basic principles of modern society."
"Its source lies in inalienable human dignity shared by men and women in equal measure."
"However, as with all achievements, it is not enough to simply declare this."
"Human dignity, including the characteristic dignity of women, has been subject to different violations in different ages and places."
"Our focus and our responses must be in line with this."
"It speaks volumes that this commemoration is taking place after the debate on the report entitled 'The face of female poverty in the European Union'."
"Poverty and the European Union."
"Some time ago, this would have seemed an unlikely association."
"The economic crisis hit the less protected groups particularly hard."
"The over-representation of women in this category in itself sets out certain tasks, to say nothing of the typical fates afflicting masses of women, which give poverty a female face outside of Europe, at a global scale."
"Borrowing the words of Saint Francis of Assisi: Lady Poverty."
"Women with small children fleeing war or famine, broken families without fathers living in slums, women and young girls forced into prostitution, even within the European Union."
"There are a number of matters among the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency, the successful promotion of which could have an impact on increased employment among women."
"Foremost among these is the Europe 2020 strategy with its own employment policy targets for recovery from the economic crisis and for the reduction of poverty."
"The employment of women strengthens women's dignity."
"It helps enable them to take their decisions and shape their lives freely."
"The flagship initiative 'Platform against Poverty' stresses that steps taken with a view to reducing poverty must also take into account the differences between the situation of women and men."
"The Hungarian Presidency considers the decision adopted yesterday by the EPSCO Council on the renewal of the Pact for equality between women and men by 2020 an important achievement."
"Besides economic policy measures, we must not forget about the special role of women in society either."
"We must give women the possibility to harmonise their careers and family lives, and the possibility to choose."
"To this end, we are working on the review of the directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding; the relevant progress report will be prepared for the June EPSCO."
"The priorities of the Hungarian Presidency include raising awareness of the role of families in the context of responding to social, economic and demographic problems."
"For this purpose, we will be organising a demographics week with the involvement of NGOs and with an informal meeting of ministers for family affairs."
"The aim will be to discuss the means to be used to increase birth rates."
"In all this, women, and women's choices of course, have an exceptional role."
"Special focus must be given to the situation of women belonging to disadvantaged groups in the European framework for the Member States' Roma strategies, which we expect to be approved by the June European Council, and to which Mrs Járóka and others, the rapporteurs and helpers, have provided very valuable input in the European Parliament."
"We expect that in the Council, too, we will declare that we intend to emphasise the role of Roma women in holding their families together, which would be a good basis to build upon when seeking answers to the issues of the Roma population."
"Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me a brief digression."
"Historic experience has shown that there cannot be a strong civil society without the active social involvement of women."
"As Mr Buzek also mentioned, there were female protesters among those who demanded freedom in Tahrir Square, Cairo."
"They, too, wish to become shapers of the changes that are taking place."
"The European Union must encourage their efforts: generously, free of ideological stereotypes, openly and with sympathy."
"Mr President, Mrs Győri, honourable Members, today, we remember the voices of those women who, on 19 March 1911, set off from Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, gathering in numbers along the way, and going ever further to defend the rights of women to universal suffrage and to better working conditions."
"Today, we pay homage to a century of struggle and of success that has benefited us all."
"Where would our democracies be and, in particular, the European democracy represented here in the European Parliament, without the full participation of women in public life?"
"Where would our societies and our economies be without the talent of women?"
"In many ways, European women serve as role models for the rest of the world."
"The place held by European women in our societies is a source of inspiration for women worldwide."
"In this respect, I would like to mention the courageous struggle of women in North Africa who, shoulder to shoulder with men, are doing everything they can to resist dictatorships and establish democracies."
"The active role that European women now have in the economic and political life of the European Union is the result of their determined commitment."
"We welcome European integration, one of the founding principles of which is equality between men and women, a principle that is fully recognised in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Over the years, important legislation on equal treatment and gender mainstreaming in European policies has allowed us to move towards a more egalitarian society and labour market."
"But we should also be outraged at what remains disappointing, unacceptable, or even intolerable."
"I refer to an average rate of female employment at 62.5% as opposed to 80% for men, increasing academic success amongst women which contrasts with their career prospects: this is still disappointing and has to change."
"Women are over-represented in lower paid and less secure jobs, and under-represented in positions of responsibility."
"Disparity between the pay received by women and men stands at 18%, which results in the risk of 22% of women over the age of 65 falling below the poverty threshold as they have no adequate pension: this is unacceptable and has to change."
"According to estimates, 20 to 25% of women in the European Union have been subjected to physical violence at least once in their life."
"This is intolerable and has to change."
"Today, we must renew our commitment to continue working together so that gender equality really does become a reality."
"We all stand to gain, whether in terms of social and economic cohesion, sustainable growth or competitiveness."
"In September 2010, the Commission adopted a strategy which set out five priority areas for action for the period 2010-2015: equality in the labour market, equal economic independence for men and women, equal pay, equality in senior positions and promoting equality beyond the EU."
"The Commission will continue to stand side by side with women from all corners of the earth who fight the daily battle for access to education and to the right to work, with those fighting for democratisation and for the exercise of freedoms and political and civil rights."
"The Commission will do everything within its power to ensure that these goals become a reality."
"However, we must not forget that legislation - however well implemented - is not the answer to everything."
"Behaviour and attitudes must also change."
"Honourable Members, today, we commemorate women's fight for equality."
"In Europe today, we can say that the EU would not be possible without European women, all European women!"
"They provide key inputs to our project based on values, including the values of gender equality."
"Mr President, 'one is not born a woman, one becomes one'."
"This quotation shows that our concepts of what women and men are form the basis for all of our choices in life - choices dependent on our gender, not our interests, skills, commitment, etc. Gender stereotypes place men and women in different pigeonholes, and a hundred years of fighting for equality has not succeeded in shattering these gender stereotypes."
"However, we refuse to wait another hundred years, because it is these gender stereotypes, these norms that result, among other things, in 97% of large companies being managed by men, in women suffering pay discrimination and having precarious jobs - when they have a job at all - and in the fact that it is women who are responsible for the unpaid work in the home."
"It is women who shoulder the main responsibility for the children."
"Women are subjected to violence, including within close relationships and in the form of sexual violence, and women are sold as commodities in the sex trade."
"We are seeing the feminisation of poverty."
"This has its origin in the various norms that society is composed of."
"A great deal of progress has been made during the hundred years of fighting."
"If I compare the opportunities that I have in terms of different life choices with those of my mother and my grandmother, I can see how much progress has been made, but there still remains a great deal to do."
"Therefore, the fight will continue every day of the year, not just on 8 March."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are celebrating the one hundredth International Women's Day, commemorating the demonstration of worker women who protested for equal wages in New York in the mid-19th century."
"The goal they set more than 150 years ago in 1857, to ensure equal pay for equal work, is still relevant today."
"In the European Union, women earn 15% less than men; this number is 16.5% in my home country, Hungary, and even though more than half of the world's total population comprises women, they only receive a 10% share of global income."
"Besides eliminating the gender gap in wages, the appropriate reinforcement of the role of women in the family and the assertion of the principle of equal treatment still remain to be solved."
"We must not allow having children to represent a poverty risk in Europe, and being a woman or a mother to represent a disadvantage."
"Whether we are looking at the initiatives launched within the UN or those within the European Union, true equality between men and women has still not been implemented in most places."
"We lay little emphasis on the situation of women living close to the poverty line, on the phenomenon of multiple discrimination, and on combating domestic violence and violence committed against women."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today marks 100 years since we first celebrated International Women's Day."
"One hundred years ago, the fight was about women's right to vote, among other things - something that we take for granted today."
"However, there is still a long way to go to achieve full equality, and I would like to emphasise the importance of women being represented in the decision-making processes at all levels."
"Women must be involved in politics, but they must also be involved in the world of business."
"We must also have women in the banks."
"We must not exclude half of the population from being involved in making the important economic decisions."
"That is not democracy."
"We need to use the whole of our talent base."
"Quite simply, our competitiveness is also at stake."
"I therefore welcome Commissioner Reding's 'Women on the Board Pledge for Europe' initiative."
"It is very good that the EU will once again be leading the way when it comes to equality, but we need to have binding legislation if quotas for board members are to be anything other than symbolic politics, and I hope that you have the courage to do that."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the equality of all human beings is enshrined in the first two articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"This states: 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."
"They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood'."
"What a wonderful sentence."
"However, even one hundred years after the first International Women's Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women."
"Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe."
"Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women."
"We have largely achieved this freedom."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past."
"Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace."
"It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe."
"They look to us to play a pioneering role."
"It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions."
"That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women's Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which we now find ourselves does not really warrant a holiday, but should encourage us to agree once again on the implementation of genuine equality."
"This 100th anniversary should be an occasion for us, as women, to look back and take stock."
"For me, the results are as follows: equality must be enshrined in constitutions and declarations of human rights as a grand principle."
"However, we need laws and regulations to make these principles a reality."
"I believe that this also requires the use of quotas."
"If we look at the European institutions, we can see that things are no better than at the top in the business world."
"There are hardly any women right at the top in management positions."
"If we are to achieve this, Mrs Reding, Mr Barroso, then we need genuine tough quota regulations."
"I would have welcomed an honest appraisal from you of the lack of equality for women in the European institutions, because then you would have realised the importance of these quotas."
"(Applause)"
"I believe that it is a shame that there is still no place at the table for women, however well qualified they may be, when managerial decisions are made and when strategic policies are planned."
"The quota is the instrument whereby we can achieve this."
"Mrs Reding, on this, the occasion of the 100th International Women's Day, we call on you: make a genuine commitment to do all you can to promote a real quota for women in management positions - as is already the position in Norway, Spain and France."
"I am at a loss to know why this issue has not already been addressed in Mr Barroso's speech."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, last week in the United Kingdom, Lord Davies delivered his speech to the government on how to increase women's participation in the boardroom."
"His report consisted of voluntary targets for businesses."
"No one can disagree that we need more women in the boardroom."
"What I cannot accept is that we need quotas to get there."
"How patronising is that?"
"Almost as patronising as giving the women in this room a rose when they came in."
"Well, I gave my rose to a man."
"On a positive note, the UK is making real headway in the elimination of the gender pay gap."
"The latest figures show that the pay gap between men and women in full-time employment is down to 10%, the lowest since records began."
"Finally, on International Women's Day, I must pay tribute to motherhood."
"True equality is having the right to choose and not be judged for these choices."
"Whether a director in the boardroom, surgeon in the hospital, part-time care assistant, car mechanic or housewife and mother, a woman has the right to make her own choice."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, we welcome women's struggle for freedom, social progress and peace at a time when we are celebrating 100 years of commemorations of International Women's Day."
"Women have struggled and achieved a great deal during those 100 years, but that has still not been enough to eliminate the existing inequalities, the discrimination that persists in accessing jobs with rights, the wage inequality which is reflected in pensions, the difficulty of career progression and professional achievement, and the obstacles to accessing management and decision-making positions in economic, social and political activity; the tendency is for this situation to get worse at times of economic and social crisis."
"Although motherhood is a social function indispensable to society's development, discrimination against women for being mothers and workers continues, which, well into the 21st century, is scandalous."
"We would reaffirm our group's solidarity with the struggles of women here."
"We continue to demand an end to inequality and discrimination, an end to all violence against women, and an end to gender stereotypes."
"This requires not just a break with neoliberal policies, but also a serious commitment to alternative policies that put the issue of human rights and gender equality at the centre of decision making and EU policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many goals have been reached but some battles have not yet even begun."
"Today, the urgent issue is that of women of other cultures living in Europe and around the world in conditions where they struggle to demand even the minimum standards of dignity and humanity."
"We cannot celebrate this holiday without bringing the issue of women in the Arab-Muslim world to the fore, otherwise we will continue to ignore a problem which is theirs today but will soon become ours as well."
"We cannot ignore the numbers involved in a crisis that grows year by year in Europe, in our cities, and in the schools where our children grow up."
"There has, for a long time, been an increase in cases of violence of all kinds suffered by Muslim women within their own families."
"Hence, I have been asking for some time - and I ask for it again today - for Europe to put in place targeted policies against the spread of Islamic radicalism, against forced marriages, honour-rights, female genital mutilation and domestic violence."
"We European men and women must fight for those women who live in Europe and beyond, who have no voice, and who are oppressed by the monster of Islamic fundamentalism."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to pay tribute to all the women around the world and all the women in the last 100-plus years who have fought for equality."
"It was in 1893 that New Zealand gave women the vote."
"If I may pay tribute to my own country, it was in 1970 that a certain Labour politician, Barbara Castle, pushed forward the first equal pay act in the Western world."
"Of course, it was the United Kingdom that had the first woman Prime Minister in Europe."
"However, I think that the European Parliament has lost touch with reality."
"I am against discrimination of any kind, even positive, as it inevitably leads to the creation of victims."
"Women do not need to be patronised by quotas, and instead need barriers to their progress to be removed."
"Member States would do better to focus on issues such as the need for improved childcare."
"We have had a recent Court of Justice decision on car insurance that boycotts traditional, tried and tested, sensible methods of risk assessment."
"Despite the EU's stance on positively discriminating in favour of women, this case exemplifies politically correct Euro-babble, with a potty decision which actually makes life more difficult and expensive for women."
"Common sense is a stranger to the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"1."
"Request for the waiver of Mr Elmar Brok's parliamentary immunity ("
"(FR) Madam President, you know this since you yourself were disavowed by the European Court of Justice in an immunity case concerning me."
"I am hopeful that the leniency we are showing towards Mr Brok for a financial affair will also apply to the freedom of expression of those Members of the House who belong to the minority."
"The equality that prevailed 20 years ago in this House was a credit to it and to its Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Unfortunately, the immunity system has turned into a party political issue."
"I personally deplore this and hope that our institution will pull itself together."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I only have to clarify one statistic."

"Innovative financing at a global and European level ("
"(FR) Madam President, I regret that there is some confusion in this report by Mrs Podimata, which raises a number of important issues with regard to innovative financing."
"I would like to ask the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to withdraw the alternative motion it has tabled so that the joint drafting work that has been carried out can be concluded."
"Secondly, I regret that a slightly artificial opposition has emerged on the issue of a tax on financial transactions and that there are two very similar amendments."
"I regret that, as a result, Parliament cannot express its overwhelming support for this tax in conditions that are reasonable with regard to Europe's competitiveness."
"(DE) Madam President, I can tell Mr Gauzès this: yes, we intend withdrawing this draft for an alternative resolution."
"I recommended this to my group for a very simple reason: The following amendment, which has been signed by 120 Members from all groups, shows that proposals regarding a financial transaction tax are not the preserve of any one group, whether the socialists, conservatives, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) or the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"The point is that we are making an institutional proposal and issuing an institutional signal that this House is capable of saying on a cross-party basis: 'We want the private sector to pay its share in dealing with the burden of the crisis'."
"This is not a socialist demand, or a PPE Group demand; it is our common wish."
"If we manage to express this today on an institutional basis, then this will be a major success for the European Parliament."
"This is why we are withdrawing this motion."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Madam President, yesterday in plenary, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) put forward another proposal which could constitute a compromise."
"It was: could it be made clear that resources will be channelled to the EU budget and the support mechanism?"
"We tabled the subject for debate yesterday and we are waiting for a reply, so that we can reach a compromise and send a positive message to the EU institutions."

"Reducing health inequalities ("
"(DA) Madam President, I would like to address the Danes in particular."
"In the Danish translation, the word 'equitable' has been translated as 'ligelig'."
"This is not a good translation because people will then think that it means 'uniform'."
"Thus, in the final report, the word 'retfærdig', meaning 'equitable', will be used."
"It has a different meaning, and I will, of course, recommend that all of our colleagues in the Danish delegation - and perhaps the Swedes have the same problem - vote in favour of the word being corrected in the report."

"The point of the report is not to instigate a debate on the question of zero tolerance, Nor does it aim to make it easier to import genetically modified soya."
"I would therefore implore you to vote against paragraphs 3 and 9."
"These amendments would lend the report a completely different character."
"If these two items are accepted, I shall have to withdraw my name."
"(DE) Madam President, because the outcome of the vote has been to alter the report, I would ask you to have my name removed from the document."
"I wish to hand back the report."
"(Applause)"

"Equality between women and men - 2010 ("
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in paragraph 66, after the phrase 'stresses that women should have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, particularly through easy access to contraception and abortion', through this oral amendment, I propose that the following text should be added after the word 'abortion': 'whilst also recognising the right to life of the unborn child, calls on Member States and the Commission to implement measures and actions to support the continuation of the pregnancy by bringing in specific social and welfare policies which help women to overcome, wherever possible, the causes that lead them to choose abortion'."
"This oral amendment is to ensure the freedom of women to have safe access to the termination of a pregnancy, but also to affirm the principle that abortion is not a delayed method of contraception nor a means of birth control."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Schaldemose for her report which, above all, must be praised for proposing concrete measures to strengthen the surveillance systems for movement within the common European market of products that are safe for European consumers."
"It is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers."
"Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products' life cycle."
"In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market."
"I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled."
"(PL) Madam President, there has been much discussion of the safety of consumers in relation to food products, yet we sometimes forget that normal items of everyday use can pose an equally serious threat to health, and sometimes even to life, particularly in the case of small children."
"The basic tool used to monitor goods placed on the market is continuous market surveillance, and appropriate legislation is essential, particularly with regard to the monitoring of e-commerce."
"It goes without saying that appropriate cooperation between consumer organisations, national authorities, manufacturers and sellers is essential."
"Let us not be overzealous, however, and let us instead give calm consideration to a definition of a hazardous product."
"Let us not forget that it is not only important that functional items be appropriately designed and that safe materials be used for their manufacture; it is equally important that common sense be applied while using them, and that children who have access to them be properly supervised."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, Parliament has adopted a report on the subject of general product safety, which is another important step towards strengthening the protection of European consumers."
"In fact, the report stresses the importance of traceability throughout the lifecycle of the product and asks the Commission to undertake actions to assess and evaluate new technologies, ensuring consumer safety at optimised costs."
"Giving European consumers the ability to know all aspects of a product increases awareness and strengthens their protection."
"I believe that new technologies can help combat counterfeiting, especially in the textile sector."
"The objective of this report is to protect consumers but also to protect all companies operating in Europe that have not decided to outsource their business."
"Through this report, we can certainly find an excellent solution to the continuing dispute over the designation of non-European origin having full traceability."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the report by Mrs Rivasi is the result of an assessment of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 which aims to set general standards of conduct that would apply in any future global health emergency."
"Following a long and successful revision phase, the report makes cooperation, independence and transparency its core principles."
"It calls for greater and improved cooperation between the health authorities of the Member States and European institutions, in order to address harmonised and commensurate risk management."
"Its objectives are a change in the strategy of Member States regarding their national plans for the management of influenza, including stocks of vaccine, the publication of the names of all the experts consulted by the European health authorities, and an efficient relationship of trust with the media responsible for disseminating public health messages."
"That is why we voted in favour of it."
"(PT) Madam President, we know very well what happened with influenza A and it should serve as a lesson for us all."
"I do not know whether you remember how all this started, but the truth is that it started one way and the subsequent response was completely disproportionate to the scale of the problem."
"That is why the report voted on here today is so important: because we must learn from what was done so that it is not repeated."
"We have a right to know who took the decisions, how everything happened and who it was that decided that it would happen that way."
"We also have the right to know which countries responded in a certain way, and why it is that they responded in a non-transparent way without leaving us a minimum of doubt, because we still have our doubts whether there was any business."
"We need a guarantee that no trace remains, whether or not any business was done in connection with this influenza."
"That is why I believe, Madam President, that all public health risks must be tackled, but not irrespective of how this is done or who pays for them."
"(PL) Madam President, one of the key conclusions drawn in the report we have voted through on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza is the lack of an independent evaluation carried out by national and European healthcare bodies."
"This results in ill-advised public health decisions."
"It is alarming that, in the opinion of the former ECDC director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, never before had a vaccine been granted a marketing authorisation with so few data available on its effects."
"She said this in response to a question on the safety of adjuvants in the vaccine against the H1N1 pandemic."
"Greater transparency is needed for decisions which affect human health."
"In Poland, the health minister decided not to purchase vaccines or implement a vaccination programme, in spite of pressure from the media and many other groups."
"One could be forgiven for wondering how stressful it was for the citizens bombarded with information on a daily basis telling them that they should be vaccinated."
"One could also be forgiven for wondering whether it is ethical to be focused exclusively on profit, and to neglect the health of citizens and, as a result, also undermine trust in official recommendations on vaccinations, which are intended to protect us against epidemics. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to date, the recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) have been transposed into European Union legislation on a provisional basis, by means of annual regulations on fishing opportunities."
"These relate to measures for the conservation, management, exploitation, monitoring and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products in the Mediterranean."
"The permanent character of these recommendations, however, requires a more stable legal instrument for their transposition into EU law."
"It is therefore appropriate to transpose the recommendations in question via a single legislative act to which future recommendations may be added."
"This is what we have done today and this will give greater certainty to the law while, at the same time, representing an important step towards simplification."
"At this point, the parties to the GFCM are obliged to ensure full implementation of the measures agreed, starting from the established date."
"Timely transposition was therefore necessary in order to make these international measures directly applicable to natural or legal persons across the EU and to ensure legal certainty in this regard."
"(PL) Madam President, our group endorsed this report, since it is an absolutely essential component of plans for a future common fisheries policy."
"Given the changes that await us, regionalisation is extremely important, as is ensuring that this policy is built on the basis of this very regionalisation."
"A debate awaits us on the subject of discards, a disgraceful debate on ill-conceived legislation."
"Legislation should be based on measures of this kind, or, in other words, on regionalisation, and we should create a common fisheries policy that takes this into account. Thank you very much."
"Madam President, if we look at the history of our common agreements, the common fisheries policy, the common agricultural policy, the result is, quite clearly, there for people to see."
"While, in some areas, this has led us to increase production at artificial prices, we have also seen the depletion of our fishing stocks and we have seen problems with discards."
"It is quite clear that that system has failed."
"It is time for us to recognise that the best way forward is a system based on property rights and transferable property rights for future generations who have an interest in securing the resources for their generation and for future generations."
"If only we could learn the rule of law, and if only we could apply property rights to fisheries policies, we would have sustainable fisheries policy not just for the common fisheries policy of the EU but globally, and we would have no need for these agreements."
"Madam President, every day, thousands of tonnes of dead fish are tipped over the sides of vessels into the sea."
"They sink - the scales and the bones are clogging the sea beds, suffering - as the UK's national poet puts it - a sea change into something rich and strange."
"For once, the metaphor is entirely apposite."
"Now, the European Commission has belatedly woken up, years after this problem of discards first arose, and has attempted to do something about it."
"However, every solution proposed by the Commission would bring perverse incentives of its own - one can limit the days a boat spends at sea, one can restrict the size of the mesh of the net, one can force skippers to land every last sprat they catch."
"All of these things are based on the existential problem of the common fisheries policy, which is precisely that it is a common policy: it defines fisheries as a common resource to which all nations have equal access."
"No one has ownership and therefore, no one has an incentive to treat fisheries as a renewable resource."
"We need to copy what Iceland, New Zealand and the Falklands and other places have done, in giving skippers an incentive in conservation and giving them property rights."
"The only way to do this is by re-establishing national control over territorial waters."
"(DA) Mr President, a large majority in Parliament has once again decided that we here in this House are to support a financial transaction tax."
"Of all the taxes that we could possibly adopt, the so-called Tobin tax is the most stupid of all."
"The only positive thing that can be said about this tax is that it has never come to anything, because if it was the Beast of the Apocalypse, why was it not implemented many years ago?"
"The first time it came up for consideration was right back at the beginning of the 1970s."
"However, every time there is a crisis, this old chestnut is reeled out, and after a little while, we come to the conclusion that it is not a good idea."
"It is simply not a good idea to introduce a tax in Europe alone because we have safe havens, and so the capital can move to somewhere else in Europe."
"It is a tax on trade rather than on profits."
"The Tobin tax does not provide a solution to anything at all, and Mr Tobin himself acknowledged that a few years ago."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic and financial crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory framework of the global financial system."
"In the European Union, the financial crisis was followed by a significant fiscal crisis, an important factor of which was the excessive and, on several occasions, unjustified pressures of the markets against national bonds."
"It was once more short-term and highly speculative transactions that were in the middle of that crisis and have underlined the clear connection between inefficient financial regulation on the one hand, and supervision and the sustainability of public finances, on the other."
"The economic costs of the crisis are still to be fully assessed."
"However, what is clear by now is that the world and the EU cannot afford and should not allow for another crisis of a similar magnitude."
"In order to provide comprehensive and integrated responses to the crisis, we need new and innovative financing mechanisms which are capable of curbing speculation and re-establishing the primary role of the financial sector."
"It is therefore necessary to change, and in an extremely positive way."
"(FI) Mr President, I am in favour of the introduction of a global transaction charge."
"The Commission should not delay in carrying out an impact assessment as to whether such a charge could be initiated at European level in the first phase, and, following this study, the decisions should be taken by the EU."
"Every year in London, tax revenue worth EUR 7 billion is collected by means of an additional stock exchange tax."
"It is not quite the same as the transaction charge being discussed here, but the results from London and their impact are encouraging, so the Commission should carry out an impact assessment promptly, and then we should take the decisions at EU level."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis that has taken hold of Europe in recent years has revealed serious shortcomings in the regulatory framework."
"We need to prepare new instruments capable of curbing speculation and restoring the role of the financial sector."
"We need to meet the needs of the real economy and support long-term investments, while ensuring a fair distribution of the burden among the main financial players."
"In this way, we will succeed in creating new additional resources in order to address global and European challenges, such as climate change and the objectives established in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I hope, however, that more attention will be paid to the measures for public supervision and transparency of innovative financing systems, since these are a sine qua non for their introduction."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the adoption of the report by Mrs Podimata represents a significant step forward for a more balanced, more progressive and stronger economic and fiscal policy in Europe."
"It is now clear to everyone that Europe, as the coordinating authority of the 27 countries, urgently needs to equip itself with economic and financial instruments that are capable of controlling the economy and not just submitting to it."
"For this reason, the proposed taxation of financial transactions has caused quite a stir and generated a large amount of attention and discussion."
"The fact that the majority of this Parliament has voted for this regulation is important and significant because, for the first time, things were not just left to ride and instead, we have achieved a step forward."
"I do hope that the Commission and the Council will continue on this path."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current economic crisis has revealed serious shortcomings in the framework for monitoring the financial sector and the need to respond with new instruments and new fiscal policies."
"The financial system has started to generate profits from speculative transactions and it is absurd that this sector is not subject to any taxation."
"We need a cure, a financial transaction tax, which is why I voted in favour."
"For other policies such as energy or the environment, Europe has managed to be the world leader, becoming an example and a stimulus for other countries outside the European Union."
"I believe we should do the same for the financial system."
"I hope that the Commission will respond soon, presenting a legislative proposal that can meet the expectations of citizens, on whom the burden of the crisis has fallen."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, introducing a new tax is always a measure to be considered with great care."
"If, on the one hand, it allows the introduction of a system of incentives that reduces risk and negative externalities, on the other hand, it certainly creates distortions that could penalise European financial markets."
"I am convinced that the income from speculative activities and financial transactions should be taxed, just as I also feel that it is appropriate that the pros and cons should be assessed carefully and that a tax of this kind should be thoroughly investigated so that it produces the desired effects without ceasing to generate wealth."
"However, I must point out that, logically, if the Union was to act in isolation, it might lose competitiveness and would not have any practical means of inducing other global economic players to follow suit."
"This is precisely why I favour taxation, provided it is introduced globally and after discussion amongst the G20."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we were delighted to adopt the measures proposed by Mrs Podimata."
"For those of us in the Italian delegation of the Italia dei Valori party within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this was a moment of great satisfaction, because it shows that Parliament knows how to follow up its statements of principle."
"In fact, as early as the debate on the report by Mrs Berès on the financial, economic and social crisis, we had argued in favour of a tax on financial transactions."
"This was done today, so we are delighted to declare that we voted in favour because this tax will shift financial resources from the financial economy - and therefore away from financial speculation - to the real economy."
"The tax will also respond to the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to large European projects in infrastructure, research, ecological restructuring and in our system of production."
"Mr President, when we look back at this financial crisis, we have to make sure that we learn some lessons."
"For example, we have to learn the lesson that inappropriate regulation can sometimes cause a problem, as the Community Investment Act in the United States did."
"It encouraged banks to lend to customers who were not creditworthy."
"When one in ten of those customers defaulted, that started a subprime crisis and we have been seeing the consequences ever since."
"We have to understand the consequences of printing money too cheaply and of holding interest rates down so that people make investments based on bad decisions, and of not recognising that money itself has a value."
"As the Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises said, if you make those bad decisions and create malinvestment, when the market corrects itself, everyone loses out and the credit cycle bursts."
"This is exactly what we saw."
"We also have to learn the lesson that banks should never again be allowed to be too big to fail."
"If we put in place this tax to raise money, what message will it give to banks?"
"Banks will say to themselves that they can continue to operate as they did before, without due care, and that they can collapse and the taxpayer will bail them out."
"It is time we learned the lessons of the financial crisis."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the clear proof that the right to European citizenship is still not guaranteed lies in the serious inequalities that still exist between Member States."
"Compared with other places, there is no right to health that can be exercised to the same extent in Bulgaria or Romania, so it is evident that this resolution, with all its complications, can be a useful point of reference."
"Today, we celebrate International Women's Day and there is no doubt that access to treatment and support is still much more complicated for women."
"Therefore, we need more information, more prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, and healthier lifestyles."
"Appropriate lifestyle choices are what is required, so we must say no to addiction, no to obesity, to alcohol, to smoking and to infectious diseases."
"To do this, we need a real cohesion policy that looks at the issue of the right to health as a truly European goal."
"(DE) Mr President, our primary concern must always be to maintain health and secondly, to restore health."
"Education is the key in all Member States."
"Healthy nutrition and exercise and a good level of general education are particularly important."
"In essence, this is a matter for the Member States."
"Europe should promote the sharing of experience in relation to health education in the various areas."
"I voted against this report despite its many good ideas."
"I am completely opposed to paragraphs 25, 26 and 29."
"The important ethical and moral decisions of the Member States, such as reproduction techniques and abortion, have no place here."
"To mention abortion in the same sentence as contraception without even considering the right to life does not reflect the will of Christian Europe."
"(FI) Mr President, it is quite true that health inequalities vary quite a lot within the European Union."
"The Member States are very different, as are their practices and traditions."
"It is obvious that if we look ahead and want to narrow this difference between health services at European Union level, we will need more training, education and awareness of what things affect health."
"Obviously, socio-economic status has received a good deal of attention in this report, but I myself believe that a focus on the very basic issues, including access to health services, exercise, diet, and these sorts of things are important."
"These are what we need to highlight and stress the importance of if we look ahead and want to build a better and healthier Europe."
"In my opinion, we need an exchange of best practices."
"I myself abstained from voting on this report because I believe that it contained a lot that is irrelevant."
"I hope that we can concentrate on narrowing health inequalities universally in the European Union."
"Mr President, I think one of my major concerns over the last few years, when we have been discussing the idea of taxation at international level, has been the attack on countries such as the Cayman Islands, when all they have done is heed the advice we have given them when it comes to development issues."
"For many years, we have been telling the islands of the Caribbean and other developing countries that they should diversify away from sugar and bananas, start to go up the value chain, and start to get expertise when it comes to services."
"The Cayman Islands have done that, and now about 40 to 50% of their economy is in financial services, thanks to their system of tax neutrality."
"Not tax evasion, but tax neutrality."
"They do not double- and treble-tax the funds that decide to locate there."
"But what do the hypocritical imperialists of the European Union do when the Cayman Islands decide to compete with them on taxation?"
"They decide to act like the imperialists of old, and try to attack the Cayman Islands for wanting to compete with the EU."
"Shame on this EU imperialism!"
"Mr President, I found it very difficult to support my friend Ms Joly's report, because she started talking about a European and global tax."
"USD 880 billion worth of funds leave developing countries through various legal and illegal means and are deposited in European and western banks."
"We, in return, put 60 to 70 billion of European taxpayers' money into developing countries for poverty elimination programmes."
"Had that money - that USD 880 billion that escapes out of developing countries and is deposited in our banks - been left in those developing countries to develop those countries, how much better would it be that they would grow faster, have capital formation abilities, have property rights and commercial practices?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is called on to reform its common agricultural policy, ensuring consistency between agricultural and external trade policy becomes all the more crucial."
"Agriculture and trade are, in fact, two intersecting policy agendas."
"Their dynamics influence and, to an increasing extent, are influenced by regulatory settings at the multilateral, inter-regional, regional and bilateral level."
"These regulatory settings are not static, however; they create hierarchies and evolve through negotiations."
"Regulative diversity, divergent commercial interests, trade tensions and disputes reflect the complexity of domestic agricultural policies and international trade."
"Since agriculture is not simply an economic activity, but agricultural and food policies are to serve fundamental objectives, such as food and consumer safety, the principal challenge now consists of effectively accommodating trade and non-trade concerns."
"Our trade policy will therefore have a crucial role in deciding whether agriculture will continue to make a positive and full contribution to these objectives without affecting its dynamics."
"(PL) Mr President, food security is a priority for the common agricultural policy."
"In order to achieve genuine food security, we should maintain proper proportions in international trade."
"Fair competition should be recognised as playing a key role in this respect."
"European farmers and food producers have to meet exorbitant EU standards and spend a great deal of money adapting their products to meet restrictive standards and rules."
"Yet the EU does not, in practice, have any control over producers and farmers from third countries, from which we import huge quantities of food products."
"Firstly, such agreements are unfair to our native producers, and secondly, such a policy is also hazardous as far as the health of European consumers is concerned, since the EU has no real control over the quality of these products, and this must be changed immediately."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it outlines very clearly the problems faced by the European Union's agricultural sector and farmers, especially in terms of trade policy."
"Let me be very clear, the European Union's agricultural sector should not be sacrificed in any way in order to secure trade arrangements such as with Mercosur."
"Unfortunately, however, I feel that that is precisely the direction in which things are going."
"There seems to be a perception that European agriculture can be used as an easy bargaining chip."
"If this is indeed the case, I foresee major problems in many sectors of agriculture, and especially in the livestock sector."
"With regard to equivalent standards, no one should be threatened by what we demand, which is that imports into the EU should meet the same standards as required of our own producers."
"Surely we have a responsibility to our consumers to ensure that this is the case."
"I am also very unhappy with the Commission's attitude to Parliament in this regard."
"It is unacceptable that it should try and keep us in the dark."
"As negotiations continue, I want the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to be taken on board."
"(PL) Mr President, the Papastamkos report makes some very good proposals."
"The EU is engaged in numerous multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations with various groups such as the World Trade Organisation."
"Trade in agricultural products plays a key role in this area, particularly with regard to access to the European Union's markets."
"The EU is a net importer of agricultural products."
"In the four years following the reform of the sugar market, we went from being a net exporter to being a net importer."
"We import 70% of agricultural products; products which are exported by developing countries."
"We have a trade deficit with the Mercosur countries."
"As Mr Kalinowski said, agricultural products which are produced in line with other standards are imported to EU markets, while European farmers incur huge costs associated with animal welfare or environmental protection."
"We cannot destroy the achievements of the common agricultural policy, which is funded from the EU budget, by means of decisions which reduce the effectiveness of this policy."
"We must be sure that the necessary synergy exists between the common agricultural policy and the trade policy conducted by the EU."
"(FI) Mr President, I also wish to say a few words about this report by Mr Papastamkos, which is very thorough."
"I might also say that it gives a good and broad picture of how the European Union's agricultural policy and trade policy are interrelated and the sort of policymaking tool agricultural policy functions as in the EU."
"It is obviously true that, when we look at our budget too, agriculture is an important part of it."
"That is why the subject of agriculture always comes up when there is talk of EU policy."
"On this point, it is worth remembering that, as we also import a lot of food into the European Union from various places, especially from third countries, we need to adhere to these ethical standards."
"Purity is a very important issue in this respect."
"It is also important to remember that we need to attend to the matter of agricultural production on our own continent, in different parts, including the peripheral countries, Finland too, where there are very high levels of expertise, pure products, and so forth. When we speak of agricultural policy, and if, in the future, we continue to invest in it, we have to maintain these high ethical standards."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Papastamkos report."
"I would like to express my admiration for this report, and I am glad that the European Parliament has declared itself firmly in favour of defending Europe's food security, which is under threat as a result of excessive concessions in international trade negotiations on food."
"There is a strong lobby group in the European Union working to reduce food production in Europe and increase food imports from third countries, since they make profits on these exports."
"This was apparent during the reform of the sugar market, for example."
"The European Union should not give in to this lobby group, but oppose it out of concern for its own food security."
"A policy of giving in to this lobby group at a time of increased food demand is a suicidal policy in the long term."
"(LV) Mr President, fair trade in agricultural products is one of the most important driving forces in the economic development of developing countries."
"It is also essential to help reduce poverty and prevent food crises."
"Many regions and countries in Europe are dependent on agriculture, especially the newest Member States, in which agriculture receives significantly smaller direct payments than representatives of the older Member States."
"What is more, these regions also have to compete with Latin American producers, who do not have to comply with equally strict quality standards, and who enjoy reduced customs tariffs."
"This type of situation markedly reduces our farmers' competitiveness and profits."
"That is why I supported this report, because it calls for a review of European Union trade policy, a regular evaluation, the application of uniform standards to agricultural products from third countries, and the opening of the market to third-country agricultural produce only if our farmers receive compensation for the losses that they would suffer from the increased volume of imports of third-country agricultural products. Thank you."
"Mr President, when I speak to my friends in many of the poorer countries of the world and ask them what is the best way in which we can help them to alleviate and tackle poverty in their country, they often say that aid is not the answer."
"What would help them would be for us to help the entrepreneurs in their country to create wealth locally, and for them to be able to trade with us in the European Union."
"We can help by opening up our markets."
"One of the big problems with that statement is the fact that we have the common agricultural policy."
"The United States has all sorts of subsidies as well."
"While we preach open trade, we are being hypocritical when we close our markets to the very good produce from developing countries."
"On top of that, we use something called sanitary and phytosanitary standards."
"Of course we all want safer food, but quite often, these standards are used as a non-tariff barrier against imports from developing countries."
"It is time to trust the consumers."
"As long as food is safe, let the consumers decide whether they want food grown in Europe or grown elsewhere."
"Let us stop subsidising unprofitable and unfeasible industries in Europe."
"Mr President, the European Union's common agricultural policy is unmatched in its wastefulness, in its corruption, in its Byzantine bureaucracy, in its selfishness, in its hypocrisy and in its immorality."
"At the end of the 1950s, the Argentinean Ambassador to the EU was the appointed spokesman of the developing countries."
"He said that if Europe had to subsidise its farmers, then they understood that and that they did not like our keeping out their products but they understood it, but he asked us not to land them the double blow of then dumping our surpluses on their markets."
"The EU did not listen then and it has not listened since."
"The last World Trade talks were given the optimistic title 'Everything but Arms'."
"Of course, these quickly descended into everything but farms, because the EU is determined to retain this protected and subsidised position for this one niche sector."
"Infer from what has happened."
"The common agricultural policy has existed since 1960."
"This is what the EU has been doing for longest."
"If this is what we have come up with - the ecological calamity, the poverty, the inflationary consequences of higher food prices - what are we thinking of if we want to give these same institutions additional powers?"
"Mr President, normally I agree one hundred percent with what my friend, Mr Kamall, says, but today I beg to differ."
"I have come to the view, having thought about it long and hard, that food security is a very important aspect of our global population growth."
"The European Union should be secure in its own food security."
"This means self-sufficiency."
"Not over-production, where we dump on developing countries, or under-production, where we take food from the mouths of hungry people."
"So we should go for self-sufficiency in Europe, self-sufficiency in Asia, and self-sufficiency in Africa and the United States."
"If we have self-sufficiency as our target in our programmes, then everything else can come into play on international trade."
"Food is something that we cannot play with."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Häusling report."
"Protein is essential for healthy animal nutrition."
"Europe needs to take action in order to assure a reliable supply of protein."
"We must pursue all avenues here, from support for research and cultivation to information and training for farmers in relation to the advantages of established practices and crop rotation."
"Let us not lose sight of the proven principle of a circular economy."
"The Commission must review the ban on the feeding of animal protein to non-ruminants, while still respecting the ban on cannibalism."
"Specifically, it needs to consider the possible use of animal protein for bone meal for pigs and poultry."
"These materials must be prepared according to the current stringent regulations for protecting human health and the environment."
"Valuable sources of protein are currently being destroyed here simply because we are not able to organise ourselves to deal with these products correctly."
"(PL) Mr President, I regret the fact that the Häusling report, which is a good report, could not gain the support of its own author due to ill-advised amendments."
"I, too, voted against its adoption."
"I believe that there are no grounds for using the amendments to this report to promote concessions on GMOs in the European Union, and that we should not promote GMOs."
"Europe should defend traditional and natural agriculture."
"Genetically modified crops pose a threat to agriculture in Europe and to food security, and for these reasons, I agree with the rapporteur."
"I followed his example on this matter. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her contribution."
"Talking about equality between men and women in the world of work today is not, and must not be, merely an exercise in rhetoric."
"On the contrary, female employment is a strategic issue for Europe, in both cultural and economic terms."
"As is evident from the available data, if the employment rates for women were similar to those of men, gross domestic product would increase by 30%."
"The current crisis must not, therefore, force us to take backward steps but, on the contrary, must make us move forward towards active policies on female employment."
"We therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered."
"The report has the merit, moreover, of focusing on positive policies to promote the employment of women, the issue of vocational training and female entrepreneurship."
"I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face: the serious problem of violence against women."
"Europe now needs to have a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women."
"(DA) Mr President, listening to the debate on quotas for women on the boards of listed companies, it is clear that here in this Chamber, trench warfare is being waged again and again, and that is indeed a shame."
"I will not make a secret of the fact that I am very much opposed to statutory quotas, partly because I think that it is bad for the companies, but also because it is bad for those qualified women who will automatically be marginalised on the boards. I therefore say 'no' to quotas."
"However, we could take the pragmatic approach and discuss whether we could not require listed companies to draw up an equality policy and some objectives of their own, where they decide themselves what these objectives are to be."
"That would be good for the women who manage to get onto the board with this approach, but also for the companies, because they will have ownership of the objectives that they are to implement."
"I believe that we should try a little pragmatism for the sake of the companies and the women concerned."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the reports on equality between women and men and female poverty in Europe and I am delighted that this has been debated on the very day that we celebrate the hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day."
"Notwithstanding Directive 2002/73/EC on equal treatment between men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, further efforts still need to be made to achieve proper transposition."
"Suffice it to say that, although the level of female education has increased significantly in recent years and the number of female graduates is now higher than that of male graduates, women remain concentrated in traditionally female sectors and are frequently paid less and occupy fewer positions of responsibility in all spheres of society."
"The lack of access to support services for their dependents, such as children, the disabled and the elderly, to adequate leave schemes and to flexible working arrangements, all impede women from working."
"I would like to close by remembering the women of the world who are fighting for the most basic of rights and I would like this House to express its solidarity with the Iranian feminist associations that are today taking to the streets, inviting women to demonstrate without the hijab."
"(SK) Mr President, I would like to explain briefly why I did not support the resolution assessing 2010 from the perspective of equality."
"The text of the resolution supports equality between women and men in many areas, while, at the same time, supporting abortion - the termination of a new life."
"The text is in conflict with United Nations resolutions stating that abortion should never be used as a form of birth control."
"In adopting this resolution, the European Parliament is not only meddling in the affairs of nation states, but more than anything ignoring the right to life enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights."
"I am sorry that a majority of Parliament has supported this text."
"It is an alarming signal, and I call on national organisations and associations to protest to the MEPs who represent them in the European Parliament."
"(FI) Mr President, I think that it is very important that we speak about equality between women and men in the European Parliament, and not just today, when we are celebrating a special day: we need to talk about it all the time."
"It is truly important to remember that we were created as men and women."
"That is a source of wealth, but it does not mean that if you are a man or a woman, you are somehow worse or weaker: we were also created equal."
"That is why it is very important to ensure that now at last in the 2010s, we can be equal in Europe, which would mean that men and women would also be treated in the same way in the labour market."
"Of course, the situation now is that women have continually been worse off with regard to pay and so on, and that cannot be the case in a civilised society."
"Instead, we need to ensure that equality can be implemented in the true meaning of the word."
"As far as quotas are concerned, they will be needed as long as we adopt a way of thinking where everyone is equal, and then it is ultimately competence in the labour market that will be the decisive factor."
"(ES) Mr President, today we have passed one more initiative but we must, as the Commissioner said, move from words to deeds."
"Despite measures, inequality persists."
"Women are well educated."
"According to the most recent data from universities, they are the achieving better results, but we continue to be discriminated against."
"This is especially the case for women who are disabled, elderly women and immigrant women, who suffer double discrimination."
"Today, in addition to this initiative, we have heard many statements but we are not prepared to set an example."
"It is sufficient to look at what gender the President of the Commission is or to examine the members of the Council, the rotating presidencies, the President of the Council, the President of Parliament and the President of the Court of Auditors; at the members of the European Central Bank, among whom, for the first time, there will be no women; at the chairs of this institution's parliamentary groups; or at the lack of women in the delegations of some countries."
"The image of European politics remains male."
"We have a very long way to go."
"That is why I voted for this initiative."
"I believe in quotas as the way to make progress along this difficult path and, above all, in the motto I started with: from words to deeds."
"(LV) Mr President, although the situation with women's rights has improved, I should nevertheless like to draw attention to at least three aspects."
"First, differences in rates of pay are still significant, and during the crisis, these differences have increased, because we have opted to support the banks, and not schools and nurseries, which predominantly employ women."
"Second, support for women, mothers-to-be and new mothers is insufficient, especially in the new Member States."
"There is also discrimination in the labour market."
"Third, in politics, where the ideal male-female ratio would be 50:50, women's participation is still considerably smaller."
"The same phenomenon can be seen in management roles."
"I believe that this report of ours will not be capable of giving a new impetus to the resolution of these problems."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report, and also in favour of quotas."
"I wish, with regard to this, to thank Commissioner Reding, for having proposed - or perhaps I should say that she has issued an ultimatum - that she would take action unless there were more women in listed companies a year from now."
"In fact, in doing this, the Commissioner is only implementing the EU treaties and directives that say that men and women are equal."
"I know that quotas arouse conflicting feelings, and that they do not represent proper democracy, but neither does this situation that we are in now."
"In Finland, quotas were introduced at local government level 10 to 15 years ago."
"They were opposed and seen as something that would cheapen women and it was thought that there were not enough women to fill these positions."
"The women were found, however, and practice has shown that, in Finland at least, these quotas at local government level work very well."
"Mr President, thank you for stepping in and chairing this session, and may I thank your staff and the interpreters."
"The recent ruling that insurers may not discriminate on the basis of sex in order to factor in differences in driving ability or differences in longevity is flawed on so many levels that it is difficult to know where to begin."
"Take, first, the expense."
"This will cost an extra billion pounds."
"Premiums will rise and fewer people will take up insurance."
"Secondly, take the poor jurisprudence, the way in which the European Court of Justice is ruling on the basis of European Court of Human Rights precedent."
"Thirdly, take the bad faith."
"When the equality and non-discrimination directives were passed, it was clearly understood that actuarially justified distinctions would still be justifiable."
"Take, fourth, the judicial activism, the way in which our judges have disregarded what the law says in favour of what they think the law ought to say."
"Take, fifth, the attack on free contract."
"If you want to insure me and I am happy to accept the terms you offer, it is not for the State to come between us and declare our transaction illegal."
"Then take, sixth, the knock-down argument: what has any of this to do with the European Union?"
"Surely each country could work out its own rules on sex equality in accordance with its own proper democratic mechanisms and procedures."
"Mr President, a court with a mission is a menace."
"A supreme court with a mission is a tyranny."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, female poverty is a long-standing issue that has historic causes and is certainly not the product of an economic crisis."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report by Mrs Plumb since I am convinced of the need to maintain a strong commitment, both in Europe and at a national level, to supporting further progress towards gender equality."
"I believe that the measures contained in this report will provide useful support - perhaps not exhaustive, but it is a step forward - to the strategies for implementing the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted by the European Council and to the framework of action on gender equality."
"The promotion by Member States of specific programmes to promote the active inclusion or reintegration of women into the labour market is the best decision in that respect."
"However, it is essential that these programmes are not only coordinated at local, national and European level, but also find ways of coordinating with partners outside the European Union."
"(ES) Mr President, women have always done the unseen work: doing the housework and providing emotional support; things that you cannot buy and for which you cannot hire somebody in."
"However, we have not valued it."
"Women are now entering the labour market."
"However, we continue to be at risk of poverty, a situation which is worsening in the context of the economic crisis."
"I voted for this initiative as it is our obligation to eradicate poverty among women."
"This can be done by strengthening legislative instruments and measures so as to be able to reduce the pay gap between men and women."
"We must implement active employment policies in women's favour and revise social protection systems, with special consideration for older women and those with disabilities."
"Let us promote the entry of women into the labour market, as they bring increased profits, and let us reduce the gender pay gap, because that will increase gross domestic product by 13%, as a number of studies are showing."
"It is a matter of justice, but it is, above all, an opportunity for competitiveness in Europe."
"Written explanations of vote"
"Under the German Criminal Code and Tax Code, the offence of tax evasion can only be punished if the taxpayer is aware that it is a case of tax evasion and does it intentionally."
"In this case, there was clearly no intention of tax evasion, since the sum in question was paid transparently, credited to a Member's current account, after he had invoiced the company Speakers Agency for it."
"Moreover, it is fairly common for accidental failure to declare small sums, as in this case, to generally be treated exclusively within the scope of administrative proceedings."
"The fact that this failure was treated in this way and that Mr Brok was not even directly informed that he had been accused is completely out of the ordinary."
"The fact that the Public Prosecutor has not even quantified the precise amount of tax owed - also by way of non-payment of interest - makes the case for fumus persecutionis even stronger."
"Under these conditions, it is inappropriate to waive the Member's immunity."
"I agree with the report when it finds it inappropriate to waive the Member's immunity."
"In truth, criminal charges have been brought against a well-known political figure in respect of a sum and in circumstances which would, in the case of an ordinary citizen, have attracted merely administrative proceedings."
"The case is one of fumus persecutionis in that it appears that the proceedings were brought with the sole aim of damaging the reputation of the Member concerned."
"I voted against waiving the immunity of Elmar Brok, because criminal charges have been brought against this well-known political figure in respect of a sum and in circumstances which would, in the case of an ordinary citizen, have attracted merely administrative proceedings."
"Moreover, the public prosecutor not only sought to withhold knowledge of the charge from Mr Brok on spurious and highly derogatory grounds for no due cause, but made sure that the case received great publicity in the media, thus inflicting the maximum amount of damage on the Member concerned."
"The case is one of fumus persecutionis in that it appears that the proceedings were brought with the sole aim of damaging the reputation of the Member concerned, and therefore in these circumstances, it would be completely inappropriate to waive the Member's immunity."
"in writing. - I abstained on this report."
"While, on the one hand, I have the highest admiration for the work done by Mr Brok, on the other, I have serious doubts about using parliamentary immunity to prevent due legal process on a tax avoidance case."
"Paying tax is a duty that no citizen should be able to shirk."
"This has been pointed out to Mr Brok."
"The purpose of immunity is not to offer protection from criminal offences but to protect freedom of expression."
"I am therefore pleased that he has rectified his mistake."
"The report is nonetheless unpleasant on more than one account."
"Mr Speroni, EUR 5 000 is not a negligible amount, and no one forced Mr Brok into this situation."
"Therefore, the accusations of persecution for 'the accidental omission of a minor sum' are, to my mind, completely uncalled-for."
"I shall vote against."
"Defending the independence of the mandate of Members of this House is the responsibility of Parliament, and that independence cannot be jeopardised."
"With respect to the allegations, the Member is the target of fumus persecutionis, in other words, the proceedings were brought with the sole aim of damaging the reputation of the Member concerned."
"I am therefore not in favour of waiving his immunity."
"in writing. - Despite the fact that, personally, I dislike Elmar Brok because of his inappropriate behaviour and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric, I think that there should be compelling reasons for the waiver of the immunity."
"It is well known that the request for waiver was set out in a letter from the Public Prosecutor of Bielefeld in which he claimed that Mr Brok failed to include in his income tax declaration for 2005 a fee of EUR 5 000 for a speech he had given in Munich on 28 October 2005 at the 'Europa Forum' held by the HypoVereinsbank Group, for which tax was due on an amount of EUR 2 900."
"It is also known that Mr Brok did not pay this money and was caught for that mistake."
"Nowadays, immunity is used as a kind of 'cudgel' for settling one's account or as 'loose change' for manipulation of Members of Parliament."
"The German Public Prosecutor has requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of a Member, Mr Brok."
"These proceedings relate to a failure to disclose on his income tax return fees relating to a talk given in Munich, for receipt of which he owed EUR 2 900 in tax, but which has now been paid."
"However, it refers to the legal opinion that the proceedings in question would not have been handled in the same way if he had been a normal citizen and that there are strong indications of political persecution."
"Under these specific circumstances, and as this is fumus persecutionis, I voted in favour of not waiving Mr Brok's parliamentary immunity."
"in writing. - With this report, the EP decided not to waive the immunity of Elmar Brok."
"I am voting in favour of this report."
"The proper functioning of the internal market requires safe products and confident consumers."
"The central concern being to make it safer, this should not be an obstacle to its enlargement."
"Following the adoption of a common approach for defining product specifications, with progress reflected in the strengthening of the general safety of products within the internal market, improvements can still be made, as too many accidents with tragic consequences still occur in this area, particularly involving children."
"Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety (GPSD), which regulates general requirements relating to product safety, was adopted around ten years ago, and so revision of it is a priority, in order to bring to an end the existence of two levels of divergent rules relating to the market oversight that is imposed on and applied to harmonised goods, depending on whether consumer goods are involved or not."
"The relevant legislative framework consists of three elements: a new legislative framework, the GPSD and harmonisation directives by sector."
"It is therefore important to harmonise this complex situation."
"The inhabitants of the EU must be able to have confidence in the safety of all goods being sold on the EU market, and high standards of health and safety must always apply."
"This is a timely and important report and I welcome its contents, especially as regards sharing information on studies relating to the safety of products, in order to cut down on duplication of services to save time and resources."
"European consumers must be certain that the products being imported into the EU are of the same standard as those made there and that the expansion of trade would not affect product safety."
"I support the request to the Commission in the report to do more within the International Consumer Product Safety Caucus to ensure that dangerous materials are not introduced into the single market."
"It is vital that the single market is able to deal with the online market and the impact which that has on product safety and market surveillance."
"It is reported that there is an increase in the number of products which are being purchased online from third countries and which contravene EU standards, putting EU consumers at risk."
"I voted in favour of this important document."
"The General Product Safety Directive 2001/95/EC (GPSD), which regulates the general safety requirements for products, was adopted almost 10 years ago and has yet to be revised, although there have been many changes globally and within the EU over the last decade."
"There are still many issues in this field that need to be addressed for EU consumers to feel safe."
"Products for children demand particularly careful regulation."
"Every year, there are accidents in the EU when children use unsafe products, and sometimes this even results in death."
"Strengthening market surveillance must be a key feature of the revision of the General Product Safety Directive, ensuring the traceability of products and manufacturers and laying down and applying standardisation principles, which would facilitate better protection of our consumers and would provide them with clearer and more accurate information about products they have bought."
"The revision of Directive 2001/95/EC aims to ensure a high level of health and safety protection for consumers, paying special attention to the most vulnerable consumers, namely, children and the elderly."
"It seeks to institute transparency and more active oversight of the markets, as well as more rapid means of intervention enabling products considered dangerous to be withdrawn from the market."
"The proper functioning of the internal market requires safe products and informed consumers with the ability to choose."
"For these reasons, I supported this report."
"In my opinion, the good functioning of the single European market also involves product safety and consumer confidence."
"The drive towards the free movement of goods and a further expansion of product diversity must not, in fact, deflect attention from consumer protection."
"In the context of the globalisation of markets, in which more and more products come from abroad - and especially from China - international cooperation on matters related to product safety becomes a priority."
"Directive 2001/95/EC governs the general safety requirements applicable to goods."
"However, the transposition of this directive by Member States has not happened in a uniform manner and has raised a number of issues concerning both its scope of application and the actual dangers associated with the products."
"I therefore believe that it is crucial to review it so that we can detect and block products that are unsafe, thus ensuring complete protection of the interests of European citizens."
"Finally, I fully support Mrs Schaldemose's proposal to adopt concrete measures in the field of product traceability."
"It is my belief that these measures will allow authorities, businesses and consumers to identify those products which, after entering the European market, do not prove to be safe."
"Today, more than ever, the European single market needs regulatory instruments that will establish uniform controls on the safety of goods sold in our countries."
"We urgently need this because we have to protect our consumers from the wave of products, especially those from countries such as China, that very often are designed and packaged without taking the least account of end-user safety."
"We must monitor the goods that enter our markets for their quality and for their compatibility with our consumer safety standards and we must, above all, combine national practices in the area of market surveillance - which are sometimes very different from each other - into one instrument."
"Putting the proposals of this report into practice will therefore mean obtaining a text as soon as possible to resolve the current problems of European legislation, where several directives overlap, sometimes without covering all fields of application and all possible case studies on the safety of the marketed goods."
"Good results can also be expected from the exchange of best practices among Member States, as strongly recommended by the report, in the final overview of the proposals of Mrs Schaldemose's text."
"For these reasons, I will vote in favour of the report by Mrs Schaldemose."
"The products available on the internal market have steadily expanded and multiplied over the last 10 years."
"This is roughly when the General Product Safety Directive came into force, which regulates the general requirements ensuring that products do not endanger a person's safety."
"This is why the motion for revising this directive is more than timely."
"We currently have a directive which only partially overlaps with the new legislative framework adopted in the middle of 2008."
"Correlating the regulations would provide us with more chances of achieving the aim of a coherent internal market for both harmonised and non-harmonised products, as well as offer comprehensive protection for consumer interests."
"At the same time, these regulations need to be totally transparent so that they are accessible to manufacturers."
"Consequently, it is important for us to get rid of the two overlapping layers of diverging market surveillance rules applying to harmonised goods, depending on whether they are consumer products or not."
"Market surveillance is closely linked to product safety as it is a key element in ensuring that products comply with the requirements stipulated in the relevant EU harmonisation legislation and that they are not dangerous."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report, which proposes to review the General Product Safety Directive."
"In fact, I am strongly convinced that the single market can only function well if it strengthens consumer confidence and provides them with safe products."
"In fact, European Directive 2001/95/EC, which governs general safety standards applicable to goods, was approved 10 years ago: now is the time to update it in light of the arrival of new products on the market."
"Consumer safety and protection have always been priorities for our political action and hence it is essential to review this directive by updating the rules on safety requirements for products and aligning the legislation of the new regulatory framework."
"I agree with the need to implement certain measures."
"I am referring, for example, to the need to strengthen market surveillance, to take concrete steps on product traceability, including the use of modern technological tools to create a Consumer Product Safety Information Database, and to pay more attention to products for children."
"In short, if these measures are implemented soon, they will make consumers more confident when they buy in the European market."
"I support the initiative for improving and strengthening European measures to ensure safe products on the market, the main concern being the wellbeing and protection of consumers."
"I believe the measures proposed at a local level (producers and companies), in particular, those relating to traceability, product safety and the transparency of e-commerce, to be relevant and essential points with regard to the elimination of gaps in the European approach to this matter, and consequently, to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"I would also like to point out the importance of cooperation between Member States, which will serve to harmonise safety levels and strengthen market oversight."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe it to be essential for guaranteeing that all products placed on the single market are safe, ensuring a high level of consumer protection."
"Member States, in cooperation with the European Commission, need to introduce in a coordinated manner penalties, including heavy fines, for economic operators that deliberately place dangerous or non-compliant products onto the internal market."
"In order to ensure consumer confidence, it is essential to have strict rules on the quality of products that are placed on the market, and EU rules have been directed towards this objective, with some success."
"However, in my opinion, these rules must necessarily be subject to two conditions, which are no more than two sides of the same coin: (i) on the one hand, they cannot be more restrictive for European producers than for their international competitors, which place their products on the same market without complying with the same rules; and (ii) they cannot be so exacting that they jeopardise economic competitiveness."
"While bearing these two constraints in mind, the Commission therefore needs to revise the directive on general product safety and market surveillance, paying particular attention to the most vulnerable consumers, and most especially to children."
"We know that, of the many accidents that occur because products placed on the market are unsafe, the majority involve children, which requires concrete measures relating not only to the safety of the end product, but also to its suitability for the public for which it is intended."
"This report deals with the need to review the directive on general product safety and market surveillance adopted nearly 10 years ago."
"Throughout the last decade, significant progress has been made on this issue within the European Union, and so it is universally recognised that it is both possible and desirable to make improvements within a legislative framework that guarantees product safety, while benefiting consumers and companies at the same time."
"First of all, the directive needs to be brought into line with the new legislative framework (NLF)."
"Then, the legislative overlap in some areas and non-coverage in other areas by the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) and the NLF need to be eliminated."
"I agree with the rapporteur's position that product safety rules should be updated and harmonised with the NLF in order to optimise consumer protection - through the provision of a quality product - and to ensure full transparency for producers."
"This report contains a set of guidelines for the future review of the directive on general product safety and market surveillance."
"The emphasis is on the objective of achieving a higher level of product safety, progress towards which requires greater surveillance, and for which sufficient resources need to be allocated to supervisory authorities, in order to ensure, among other aspects, traceability along the entire supply chain."
"The important question of the country of origin of a product and of the manufacturer responsible is also tackled."
"In addition to defending the consumer's right to information, this also protects industries within EU countries."
"We have criticised the consequences of the development and deepening of the single market for economic and social divergence within the EU."
"However, the concrete proposals put forward in this report - which focus on the interests of consumers - merit our agreement."
"Despite our opposition to the development of the European internal market, on which the premise of this report is based, the concrete proposals that it sets out and the pivotal question that it analyses involve the improvement of conditions and safety for consumers."
"Its concrete objective is to set out guidelines for the future review of the directive on general product safety and market surveillance."
"The rapporteur has placed great emphasis on the need for increased supervision, with the aim of achieving a higher level of product safety."
"It is also emphasised that sufficient resources need to be allocated to supervisory authorities in order to ensure traceability along the entire supply chain, given its importance for determining the country of origin of the product and the manufacturer responsible, which, in the case of imported products, also protects European Union industries."
"That is why we voted in favour."
"Considering the good work done by my Danish fellow Member, Mrs Schaldemose, I am voting in favour of the report concerning the directive on general product safety and market surveillance."
"This report has my support because it includes measures on traceability that are useful for halting the movement of products that might be harmful to consumers, and also because it emphasises strict control of products from third countries, and China in particular."
"All commodities and products sold on the EU market must be of a high standard of safety to protect European Union consumers."
"Product safety is one of the main concerns of consumers, who do not want the goods they purchase to pose a threat to their health."
"It goes without saying that product safety depends mainly on the manufacturers and importers who place products on the market."
"Market surveillance also plays a huge role in ensuring that only products which meet the required standards reach the market."
"The European Parliament is sending out a strong message with the report that has been voted through, calling for directives on product safety to be consistent with other legislative acts, which will guarantee a better-functioning market surveillance system and clear and transparent regulations for entrepreneurs, and will provide consumers with a guarantee that the product they have in their hands meets legal requirements."
"There have, however, been an alarming number of notifications made via the RAPEX system, with the overwhelming majority of them relating to products originating from China."
"In the opinion I drafted on this report for the Committee on International Trade, one of my demands was for cooperation on product safety to be stepped up with our main trading partners, and for further work to be carried out to improve the operation of the RAPEX-CHINA system."
"I hope that stepping up cooperation with China will result in an improvement in the quality of products imported to EU markets from China."
"The General Product Safety Directive 2001/95/EC (GPSD), which establishes at Community level general safety requirements for consumer products, has to be reviewed and brought into conformity with the new legislative framework (NLF), adopted in 2008, through integration, in particular, with the regulation on market surveillance."
"The product safety and market surveillance legislative framework consists of three layers of legal acts (GPSD, NLF and sector-specific harmonisation directives), which leads to uncertainties and confusion in the internal market."
"The level of market surveillance differs considerably among Member States and a number of them fail to designate necessary resources for efficient market surveillance and interpret products posing serious risk differently, which can create barriers to the free movement of goods, disturb competition and jeopardise consumers' safety within the internal market."
"The current legislative framework for market surveillance does not provide enough coherence and should therefore be reviewed and further coordinated."
"I resisted voting in favour of this document because I believe that by only considering consumer safety, we would reduce the free circulation and broad variety of products."
"The measures adopted must be adequate but, at the same time, we must also consider consumer safety, as well as the free circulation and variety of products."
"It is also clear that market surveillance is a challenging activity for a number of Members States, as they are unable to designate necessary resources for efficient market surveillance."
"I support the final form of the report on a revision of the directive on general product safety and market surveillance."
"I applaud the fact that the final version does not include proposals to set up further agencies, and that it will therefore not lead to further demands on the budget."
"I would like to highlight how the report emphasises the issue of standardisation as a regulatory instrument which, in its essence, comprises an example of 'smart regulation', and therefore regulation which is not top down, but which comes from below, from the interested parties."
"It is precisely for this reason that I would like to call for the greater involvement of market supervision bodies in the process of creating safety standards, as this is an opportunity to ensure in an adequate way that their expertise is brought to bear in the standardisation process."
"In connection with the greater scope for action in the area of creating product safety standards, I consider it essential to focus on the stability of the European standardisation system, simplifying European standards and reducing the time it takes to create standards."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate Mrs Schaldemose on the work she has done."
"The report adopted today by Parliament concerns the important issue of product safety and, consequently, of the protection of citizens."
"The substantial European commitment to protecting consumers from defective and dangerous products has already meant that good standards have been reached, but I think there is still room for improvement, especially in relation to so-called vulnerable consumers, such as children, the elderly and the disabled."
"In this area, I believe the strengthening of the market surveillance system through a measure to improve the effectiveness of border controls is crucial, together with the complete traceability of products through the entire supply chain."
"I will conclude by reiterating the need to review the regulatory framework currently in force, represented by the General Product Safety Directive, according to the guidelines set out today by the vote of Parliament."
"in writing. - There are still too many unsafe products available on the market."
"I welcome this report, which says that RAPEX (EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products) needs further improvements."
"Specifically, Member States need to improve the effectiveness and visibility of custom rules and authorities in tackling poor product safety."
"Although unquestionable progress has been made in the last 10 years in terms of product requirements in the internal market of the European Union - partly thanks to a common approach - much still remains to be done."
"Indeed, it would be important to review the current European legislation on this subject."
"It is clear that the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD), which was approved more than 10 years ago, now needs to be reviewed."
"This would also allow the prerogatives of the new legislative framework (NLF) on products, which was approved in 2008, to be respected."
"Closer monitoring of the market then needs to be put into practice, which goes hand in hand with product safety."
"However, the real problem to solve - and the true priority of the report - is to pay attention to products intended for children and to products that appeal to them."
"It would also be advisable for the Commission to propose a proper regulation on general product safety and market surveillance."
"This should include essential elements such as the adoption of concrete measures in the field of traceability, the obligation for manufacturers to provide a detailed risk analysis during the design phase or, again, strict regulations for the sale of products online."
"Consolidation of the internal market is essential for the satisfactory economic development of the EU."
"However, this aspiration is only possible if the products on the market are safe and if there is consumer confidence."
"Our existing objective of securing free circulation and an increased variety of products available on the market cannot be dissociated from the related safety of consumers."
"Great progress has been made over the last few years with regard to product safety."
"However, there is a need to continue improving, especially in connection with products aimed at children, who are more susceptible to being affected when safety rules are not observed."
"in writing. - This report, adopted unanimously in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is some kind of contribution by Parliament to the revision of Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety."
"What is important is that the report underlines the significance of the revision of current European legislation, so that products which are unsafe can be located and stopped."
"This and other measures are intended to provide the EU population with protection from the appearance of dangerous products on the market, and that is why I voted 'for'."
"Around 60% of the products reported in the RAPEX system come from China."
"The majority of dangerous products thus come from a market that is almost impossible for the EU to control."
"I hope that the new RAPEX China system will help remedy this."
"The EU must take a strong position in order to protect consumers and their health."
"The recall of hazardous products must take place more quickly and more efficiently and there must be improvements in traceability back through the production chain."
"This report is moving in this direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"The huge size of the European market requires effective and specific regulations to ensure consumer product safety and therefore, I think the EU needs to update its own regulations in order to ensure market surveillance."
"The report by Mrs Schaldemose - which I voted in favour of - confirms the need to review the directive of 2001, given the difficulties Member States faced in transposing it."
"By not applying the directive since 2004, the Member States have caused problems to emerge over the surveillance of products and have not guaranteed certification to the extent they might have done."
"I agree with the emphasis that the report places on combating counterfeiting through better identification of products in respect of consumer safety through the use of new technologies."
"This report relates to the review of the directive on general product safety and market surveillance."
"In a context of free movement and a constant increase in the variety of products available on the market, it is essential that we do not lose sight of consumer safety."
"It is a duty of both governments and companies to ensure greater product safety."
"Legislation at a European level has already been successful, strengthening the general safety of products within the internal market."
"However, improvements can still be made, as there are gaps in this area that compromise consumer safety and which could have harmful consequences."
"I voted in favour of this report as I had to agree with the rapporteur's proposals, which consisted of emphasising the importance of reviewing current European legislation on product safety so that dangerous products can be identified and withdrawn from the market, for the benefit of the end consumer."
"I would point, in particular, to amendments to safety rules for products aimed at the most vulnerable consumers within the single market, namely children, the elderly and people with disabilities."
"I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mrs Schaldemose."
"Consumers must be guaranteed greater protection from defective and potentially dangerous products."
"Through this report, we are telling the Commission that we need to review the directive and that we need to strengthen the market surveillance system and have market surveillance which is consistent across the single market."
"In order to effectively combat the presence of defective products in the common market, I believe it is vital to improve border controls, especially in ports."
"I ask the Commission and our national governments to introduce tougher sanctions on imports from third countries that violate safety standards."
"Full traceability of products throughout the supply chain is another key point for guaranteeing the ability to withdraw defective products from the market, even as they are being produced."
"To this end, we must ensure that the border authorities have sufficient resources."
"Also, I would ask for greater attention to online sales, which are on the increase, particularly sales of those products that can cause direct damage to the consumer, such as pharmaceutical products and food."
"I voted in favour of the report on the revision of the General Product Safety Directive."
"Indeed, I am in favour of a clarification of the current product safety legislative framework, which consists of three layers of legal acts."
"In order to ensure that market surveillance authorities do not face any uncertainty, we should establish a common European framework applicable to all products present in the internal market or entering it."
"Moreover, let us not forget that, in order to dissuade economic operators from acting illegally, it is important to take action both in terms of penalties against those who deliberately put dangerous or non-compliant products on the market, and in terms of transparency: any ban on products should be published."
"Another crucial element is dealt with in this report: that of product safety from a global perspective."
"In this context, the European Union must set itself the goal of improving exchanges of information on dangerous products originating from third countries, such as China and India, in order to tackle the issue of product safety and traceability before products enter the European market."
"in writing. - A well-functioning single market would also mean safe products and consumer confidence."
"While aiming for free circulation and an even broader variety of products on the market, we should not lose focus on consumer safety."
"A general look at the area of product safety shows that, during the last decade, we have seen progress when it comes to product safety in the EU."
"Governments as well as enterprises take responsibility to ensure safer products and, due to legislation at EU level, there has been a common approach to product requirements, which has improved the general safety of products within the internal market."
"Although progress is seen, there is still room for improvement in this field."
"This needs to be addressed, as it could jeopardise the safety of the consumer or sometimes even be fatal."
"With the adoption of this resolution, the European Parliament stresses how vital it is to improve border controls, especially in ports, in order to effectively combat the presence of defective products in the common market."
"The text adopted asks the Commission and our national governments to introduce tougher sanctions on imports from third countries that violate safety standards."
"Also, greater attention should be paid to online sales, a phenomenon which is constantly on the increase and, in particular, sales of those products that can cause direct harm to the consumer, such as pharmaceutical products and food."
"Full traceability of products throughout the supply chain is another key point for guaranteeing the ability to withdraw defective products from the market, even as they are being produced."
"To this end, we must ensure that the border authorities have sufficient resources to carry out the checks."
"It is important to stress the requirement that manufacturing companies verify the possibility of risks to safety and health even at the product design stage and for the creation of a public database about product safety."
"The review of the directive is intended to unify and harmonise standards which apply to consumer goods, and which currently overlap and differ on the subject of market surveillance."
"In a globalised world where we are witnessing the movement of goods and people, there is a growing need to implement systematic checks on saleable products."
"Particular attention should be paid to products arriving from third countries, where hygiene and health standards, production processes, and the use of materials not permitted in Europe, carry the risk of contaminating items that end up on our tables or in our hands."
"In particular, we need to test children's toys for toxic substances as they often put them in their mouths; all the more now because in virtually all cases, the toys are made in China, a country unfortunately renowned for its low production costs and poor quality control."
"Of particular interest is traceability, which is useful for stopping the movement of products that might not be safe for consumers."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which suggests further improvements to the rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products in the EU."
"Improving effectiveness and visibility of customs rules will help to tackle poor product safety, ultimately benefiting consumers."
"in writing. - A safe internal market is a priority for our citizens and this report highlights inadequacies in the legislation on product safety and market surveillance and in the way these are implemented at both EU and national levels."
"The current lack of legal certainty, whereby various legal instruments apply to different categories of products, while loopholes exist in other areas, is an obstacle to market safety and to the proper functioning of the single market."
"The General Product Safety Directive and rules governing market surveillance should be replaced by a single regulation, as the legal instrument guaranteeing the greatest level of clarity and uniformity."
"For this reason, I have identified this as one of the key priorities for inclusion in the Correia De Campos Report on the Single Market Act for Europeans, for which I am shadow rapporteur."
"Furthermore, in light of the fact that more and more people shop online, legislation on product safety and market surveillance must now be brought up-to-date to include measures covering online selling so as to strengthen consumer confidence in this area."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by Mrs Schaldemose, because this is a serious and topical issue."
"The existing mechanisms relating to general product safety must be improved, as this will help to safeguard a high standard of protection for consumers' health and safety."
"Coming from a country which is at a geographical crossroads, I consider this proposal to be especially constructive, as many products imported from third countries do not meet the health and quality specifications clearly set out in EU legislation."
"We shall only be able to be truly effective and help to clean up the market and really benefit consumers if these products are subject to such prevention and supervision mechanisms."
"I voted in favour of the report on the revision of the General Product Safety Directive and market surveillance because I generally support the strengthening of market surveillance in the interests of efficient consumer protection."
"I believe it is important to protect children, older people and people with disabilities because the Community has a special responsibility to these groups."
"After a ten year gap, it was about time for the directive to be thoroughly revised in order to include new commercial channels, such as online shopping."
"I am voting in favour of this report as I agree that better cooperation in response to pandemics is needed, and I agree that a review of the prevention plans drawn up by the EU and its Member States is necessary."
"The World Health Organisation urgently needs to reassess its definition of a pandemic, taking into account not only its geographical spread, but also its severity."
"I believe that this issue should be better managed by assessing recommended vaccination strategies, and that this can only be achieved if the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control exercises its powers more effectively as an independent agency, with adequate resources for this purpose."
"I welcome this initiative which wants to ensure better vigilance and complete transparency with regard to the evaluation of medicinal products recommended in the event of health emergencies, and to improve vaccination and communication strategies to prepare for and prevent pandemics."
"I think that the European Union must allocate more resources to research and development regarding public health prevention measures in order to achieve an increase in the investments dedicated to a better evaluation and anticipation of the impact of an influenza virus, both between pandemics and at the beginning of a pandemic."
"This is why I voted for this report."
"The European Union was obliged to learn from the controversial management, in 2009-2010, of H1N1 influenza in Europe, and to adopt the measures necessary to prevent further disproportionate reactions."
"That is why I voted in favour of this text, which makes provision for more cooperation, more independence and more transparency in order to deal effectively with any future pandemics."
"More cooperation, in the sense that this text envisages a review of the prevention plans put in place by the European Union, a review of the roles and responsibilities of key actors, and the introduction of a procedure enabling Member States to make group purchases of vaccines and medicinal products."
"This text also calls on the WHO to include the criterion of severity in its definition of a pandemic."
"More independence, in the sense that the text stipulates that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control should exercise its powers as an independent agency so as to have scientific studies that are not influenced by pharmaceutical companies."
"More transparency, lastly, in the sense that the text calls for an assessment of the effectiveness of vaccination strategies."
"Consequently, this text will allow for more consistent communication between Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"According to the figures provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at the end of April 2010, influenza A(H1N1) caused 2 900 deaths in Europe in 2009."
"These figures are low in comparison to the official mortality estimates for seasonal influenza, which the Commission put at 40 000 deaths in a moderate year and 220 000 in a particularly severe season."
"They are also significantly less than the most optimistic forecasts suggested by the health services of the EU Member States."
"A maximum-level alert was issued over this virus, triggering in some Member States a raft of measures that were very costly (e.g. the costs are put at EUR 1.3 billion in Great Britain and EUR 990 million in France - compared to EUR 90 million against seasonal influenza), and in those cases, disproportionate to the actual level of danger of the virus."
"I agree that the World Heath Organisation should revise the definition of a pandemic, not basing this solely on the spread of the virus, but also including the possible severity of a disease to allow for more adequate responses and protect EU citizens from real dangers."
"I believe that in this area, there is a need for better cooperation between the Member States and the responsible institutions and organisations, as well as a more transparent distribution of responsibility among the key actors."
"Influenza A (H1N1), caused by the influenza A H1N1 virus, was initially detected in Mexico at the end of March 2009, and subsequently spread to various countries."
"In May 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) attributed moderate severity to influenza A (H1N1), and in June of the same year, the WHO declared a level 6 alert, corresponding to a pandemic phase."
"This maximum-level alert declared by the WHO set in train a series of measures in Europe."
"In some cases, these were very costly measures (for example, the costs were estimated at EUR 1.3 billion in Great Britain and EUR 990 million in France, compared to EUR 87 million against seasonal influenza)."
"The response was disproportionate."
"Each Member State reacted in its own right, without much coherence or solidarity."
"This report, which I supported, reaches the correct conclusions in recommending greater coordination between Member States and European health institutions, as well as clarification and a review of the roles and responsibilities of the key players and management structures, and threats to health at a European level."
"Finally, it recognises the need for studies on vaccines and anti-viral medications that are independent of the pharmaceutical industry, including with regard to the monitoring of vaccination coverage."
"In the light of the reaction of several European Union countries with regard to combating a possible pandemic of the H1N1 virus, I agree that improvements are needed in the formulation of responses based on the scientific information available in this type of situation."
"I therefore support a review of response and prevention plans in the event of a pandemic risk."
"Any review needs to aim for greater cooperation and coordination between the Member States' health authorities and the European institutions."
"Another aspect that I believe to be extremely important is the requisite transparency, with regard to both the medical products used and the scientific reports provided by health authorities, in order to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure the safety of, and provision of information to, citizens."
"The EU was the region of the world that was best prepared and had the best reactive capacity for dealing with this outbreak, although the considerable differences in the Member States' preparedness and the lack of any real cooperation between them weakened this."
"Preparation and reaction with regard to health risks within the EU is the responsibility of the Member States, and so it is essential that cooperation and coordination between them, the institutions and international and regional organisations are improved, particularly during the initial phases of a viral outbreak, in order to gauge its severity and to be able to make relevant management decisions and adopt a coherent approach."
"The differing recommendations made within the EU and Member States with regard to priority target groups for vaccination indicate the enormous uncertainty and divergent points of view that persist with regard to an appropriate response."
"The costs, which were quite significant, could also have been reduced through greater cooperation between the Member States, and between these and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"I support the need to draw up a European code of conduct relating to the exercise of the role of scientific expert in any European authority in charge of safety and of risk management and forecasting, in order to avoid further cases of corruption."
"The management of the H1N1 influenza epidemic, for which there had been prior warning, was a failure."
"We should therefore learn from that crisis so that we can deal with any future pandemic threats more effectively."
"Clearly, Member States will have to cooperate more with each other, but also with the European institutions, in order to provide a more effective response in the event of a pandemic."
"Similarly, we need to clarify the role of the structures at EU level that manage medical threats, and to ensure that the WHO revises the definition of the criteria for raising a global pandemic alert."
"Finally, it would seem appropriate to devise a system of joint public procurement of vaccines by Member States."
"Last but not least: there needs to be total transparency in relation to the experts who advise European public health authorities, in order to put an end to potential conflicts of interest."
"I welcome the vote on this report, for which I was appointed shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"For the sake of the 500 or so million citizens that we represent, we need to learn from this crisis so that we can deal with any new pandemic threats more effectively."
"The text adopted yesterday is a very good compromise in terms of health cooperation, independence and transparency."
"Given the proven failure of genuine health cooperation between Member States, it was necessary to adopt a constructive and practical approach involving the following actions:"
"Reinforced cooperation between Member States and better coordination between Member States and European institutions to ensure a more effective response in the event of a future pandemic;"
"Clarification of the roles of the structures at EU level for the management of medical threats;"
"The call on the WHO to revise the definition of the criteria for raising a global pandemic alert;"
"The assessment of the vaccination and communication strategies applied in Member States to regain citizens' trust;"
"The creation of a system of joint public procurement of vaccines by Member States, to prevent disparities;"
"The publication of the declarations of interest of the experts who advise the European public health authorities, to prevent any conflicts of interest."
"I voted for this report because I think that better coordination is required at EU level in terms of responding to epidemiological risks."
"The case of H1N1 influenza highlighted flawed risk management at a global level, mainly due to the inadequate correlation between the levels of alert and the actual dangers, the consequences of which entailed a large wastage of funds."
"In this context, I think that the European Union needs to implement an independent system for assessing pandemic risks, as well as better coordination in terms of managing these risks."
"In this context, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control must be equipped with the capabilities required to be able to play as active a role as possible in this area."
"I voted in favour of the report on the management of H1N1 influenza because it highlights the importance of strengthening cooperation, independence and transparency in the management of future pandemic crises, specifically through improved application of the powers of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control as an independent agency."
"In 2009, the world was gripped by fear of a virus with great pandemic and possibly deadly potential: influenza A. Fortunately, the worst fears with regard to the morbidity and mortality associated with the H1N1 virus were not confirmed."
"In Europe, this virus was responsible for 2 900 deaths, well below the number of deaths caused by seasonal influenza."
"However, as a result of World Health Organisation alerts and fear, exceptional measures were taken by Member States, such as mass vaccination, which represented a substantial cost to health systems."
"It is important to draw conclusions from the management of influenza A that took place, rather than point out errors."
"The most salient of these, in my opinion, is that, even so, it is better to err through excess than through omission."
"Secondly, we should learn lessons for the management of future pandemics, which could be more aggressive, and understand how and when to act and what measures to take."
"Fortunately, according to data provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the H1N1 influenza virus caused fewer deaths than initially predicted, and is currently considered a disease of low severity in the EU."
"It created a certain amount of alarm at the beginning of its spread, which led several Member States to make substantial investments in vaccination programmes that turned out to be excessive, because in countries such as Poland, which did not take any exceptional measures, the mortality rate remained at the level of those countries that embarked on national vaccination campaigns, with costs estimated at many millions of euro."
"According to this report, 'the policies on the purchasing of vaccines had already been laid down in advance purchase agreements signed back in 2007 with pharmaceutical companies'."
"This reveals a lack of transparency in this procedure due to the Member States' unacceptable dependence on pharmaceutical companies."
"Thus, I have to agree with the rapporteur, and hope that her recommendations, particularly with regard to certainty of information and the precautionary principle - which needs to benefit patients rather than companies - are taken into account by the Commission and by all Member States."
"In the light of the troubled process of managing the declared influenza A (H1N1) pandemic and the acknowledged numbers (2 900 deaths resulting from H1N1 influenza, whereas 40 000 were caused by seasonal influenza during the same year), the report calls for transparency, which seems laudable to us."
"This relates both to what happened - with the complete clarification of procedures adopted and responsibilities - and to the approach to future situations."
"The following issues are mentioned in particular: the question of the procurement of vaccines and anti-viral treatments; information on recorded cases and their severity; the granting of access to documents relating to clinical trials, research protocols and adverse effects of medicines (by the European Medicines Agency); and conflicts of interest among specialists who advise European public health authorities."
"The report 'calls for the prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics to be revised in order to gain in effectiveness and coherence, independence and flexibility'."
"It also recommends a strengthening of cooperation between Member States in this area, with regard to both the definition of the severity of viral outbreaks, and decision making."
"Overall, we consider it to be positive, and we voted in favour for this reason."
"During this phase of assessing what happened during the management of the H1N1 influenza issue, lessons need to be learned, and it should be recognised that countries need to have public health systems and extension services in the area of public health that are able to operate in different areas, specifically:"
"The drawing up and assessment of scientific studies, independent of the pharmaceutical industry, on the efficacy, safety and risk-benefit ratio of anti-viral vaccines and medicinal products, and on recommended target groups;"
"In the assessment of information on the medication recommended in the event of a health emergency, especially in pandemic situations;"
"In the strengthening of capacity in terms of managing and anticipating risks, and in relation to research and development in these areas, as well as with regard to preventative public health measures."
"There is also a need to improve cooperation between the various national services, and between these and the relevant international and regional institutions and organisations."
"I endorse the report by Mrs Rivasi on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU because it highlights the European Union's excessively alarmist attitude when evaluating the problem."
"I am in favour of devoting an appreciable level of attention to matters concerning EU citizens' health, but not of adopting excessively alarmist attitudes, which then result in exorbitant public health spending."
"That is why I voted in favour of the report."
"The motion for a resolution that we have adopted has laid the foundations for much-needed reflection on the European Union's response to the spread of swine flu."
"As everyone will remember, instead of finding joint solutions at that time, the Member States entrenched themselves in individualistic positions."
"The various national governments' reactions were highly varied, ranging from large-scale vaccination to no vaccination at all, as in Poland."
"That experience should motivate us to improve coordination between the national health authorities and the European institutions, review prevention and vaccination strategies and redefine the criteria for a pandemic alert."
"I would like to point out that more effective cooperation can not only lead to cost reductions in the management of such crises, not least through possible group purchasing of vaccines by the Member States, but, above all, it can ensure that people are afforded better protection, since, of course, the virus is not stopped by borders."
"Lastly, I hope the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will be given the support it deserves so that it can continue to do its job of evaluating and controlling health emergencies with complete independence."
"I voted for the report on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza."
"Nevertheless, I should like to point out that this 'management' was, in fact, yet another capitulation to the 'precautionary principle', which requires action before any proper reflection."
"The fact that the WHO Director-General declared a threatening pandemic, but chose not to have the inoculation herself, is a potent illustration of the discrepancy between personal judgment of the severity of that outbreak and the public discourse of those in charge."
"Since the contaminated blood affair, no public health official has been willing to take any responsibility whatsoever."
"The H1N1 influenza was extremely instructive."
"First, it taught us how to throw money down the drain."
"The cost of this 'swine' influenza (EUR 900 million according to the Court of Auditors!) is not due to the number of victims."
"There were 10 times fewer H1N1 influenza victims than victims of ordinary seasonal influenza."
"Yet it is true that those 2 000 annual victims, most of whom were elderly or already ill, are of no interest to anyone."
"They are much less exotic."
"Next, it taught us how to completely disguise a lack of judgment with alarmist speeches and arm waving."
"Tens of millions of doses were ordered unnecessarily."
"We had what was meant to be a mass vaccination programme organised without any regard for common sense."
"The communication was so exaggerated and contradictory that the people of France turned their backs with suspicion, and rightly so, on the orders that were given to them."
"There was a suspicion of common interest between those who took the political decisions and those who benefited from them financially."
"Finally, the H1NI influenza taught us that, in France, however error-prone, negligent or incompetent a minister, nothing would force him or her to resign."
"And the daily events within the French Government are proof that, on this matter, nothing, absolutely nothing, has changed!"
"There was a lack of transparency in 2009 and 2010 in the way in which we dealt with the H1N1 strain of influenza, designated by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic."
"This is dealt with in the 'Report on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU'."
"I welcome this report particularly because it provides for complete transparency in relation to the medicines used in the event of urgent medical intervention and a pandemic."
"The Member States acted unilaterally in ordering and deploying vaccines."
"The important issue in this context is to evaluate the strategy for stockpiling vaccines and to work towards the joint procurement of the vaccines by the Member States in future."
"Improved coordination between the responsible authorities in the Member States and the European agencies is also important."
"Thanks to the amendments tabled by my political group (the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)), this report contains constructive proposals to help us learn from the health crisis caused by the H1N1 virus, notably, by enhancing European coordination."
"Indeed, the initial report contained a number of inaccuracies and could have discouraged people from having the inoculation."
"However, the report as adopted today seeks to restore the confidence of our fellow citizens in health crisis management."
"Health professionals will need to be more involved in drawing up and implementing a strategy for preventing and combating a pandemic."
"We can no longer allow such confusion and suspicion to surround immunisation campaigns."
"It will be essential to improve communication by taking into account how easy it is for rumours with no scientific basis to circulate on new media and the Internet."
"Fortunately, the influenza was less serious than anticipated, but it would be dangerous to underestimate the degree of unpredictability and potential severity of future pandemics."
"I voted in favour of this report because the World Heath Organisation should urgently revise its definition to include the severity of a disease in its definitions on the stages of a pandemic to allow for more appropriate responses."
"Better cooperation is needed in the response to pandemics."
"There must be a review of prevention plans, a clarification and, if necessary, review of the roles and responsibilities of key actors, and reinforced cooperation between Member States in order to ensure coherent risk management in response to a pandemic in compliance with the International Health Regulation, as well as more serious coordination on the part of Member States with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"A procedure must be introduced enabling the Member States to make group purchases on a voluntary basis."
"Manufacturers have to bear full liability for the authorised indications of their products, and this should be fully applied by Member States in all contracts for the procurement of vaccines."
"The prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics must be revised in order to be more effective, coherent and sufficiently autonomous and flexible to be adapted as swiftly as possible, and on a case-by-case basis, to the actual risk, based on up-to date relevant information."
"I agree with the opinion that vaccination strategies should rely on three conditions to be successful: efficacy of the vaccine, a positive benefit-risk balance for the vaccine, and targeting of risk groups."
"I believe the resolution on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU clearly reveals the mistakes made and, at the same time, lays the foundations for fresh, effective management of influenza pandemics."
"It is well known that the reaction to the spread of H1N1 influenza was exaggerated in comparison to the real scale of the problem."
"Precisely for that reason, I believe that Europe's influenza pandemic prevention plans need to be reviewed in order to provide rapid, consistent and effective responses."
"In that respect, it is essential, in my view, to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the Member States in order to arrive at a truly European strategic approach to the problem."
"Furthermore, I believe it would be useful, as mentioned in the text of the resolution, for independent scientific experts not linked to the pharmaceutical industry by any kind of interest to be involved in that process, alongside operators from the pharmaceutical sector."
"Being aware of the severity of H1N1 influenza and the importance of our citizens' health, I think that this report is particularly significant, as it also highlights the correct way to manage these situations."
"The moderate severity of this disease was confirmed back in 2009 by the World Health Organisation, and the different approaches adopted by Member States resulted in huge costs, the sale of vaccines produced urgently and a revision of the definition of a pandemic, taking into account as a criterion not only its geographical spread but also its severity."
"These factors highlight the fact that a different approach is an absolute must."
"The European Union requires more cooperation, transparency and independence with regard to resolving these situations."
"The subject of influenza appears every year on the agenda not only of the European Parliament, but also of many national parliaments."
"I believe that the Rivasi report takes a very broad approach to the problem of H1N1 influenza, discussing it under several headings such as cooperation, independence and transparency, which will be absolutely vital in the event of a future pandemic."
"I believe that the European Union must take active and speedy measures, and so I voted in favour of adopting the report on the management of H1N1 influenza."
"in writing. - I voted for this report because there was nothing in it to object to."
"However, given the limited impact of H1N1 influenza, I am not sure why Parliament decided to allocate time and resources to it."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for a very detailed and frank report, which contains many alarming messages."
"It is beyond doubt that the joint approach of the EU during the pandemic verified the potential of joint action, while also revealing dramatic weaknesses, particularly in the areas of prevention, objective statistics and the purchasing of safe and effective medicines."
"The EU has twice recently faced the problem of a dangerous viral infection."
"Not enough has been learned from the experience."
"I welcome the proposals relating to more stringent testing of the effectiveness of medicines and pressing for objective data collection, and also the interest in protecting all EU citizens regardless of healthcare system."
"I consider the demand for research and development funding to be of fundamental importance, as well as the rule that pharmaceutical companies will have a consultative role, and not a deciding role."
"The same applies to studies and tests on vaccination materials and other medicines, which must be drawn up independently of pharmaceutical firms."
"I also support the demand for more stringent rules for professionals and advisers working for European institutions."
"The public must be clearly and transparently informed, although in a way which will not cause panic, but will provide qualified and comprehensible information."
"As the Quaestor jointly responsible for protecting the health of MEPs and European Parliament (EP) employees, I would like to say that our measures in the EP have been effective, but not cheap."
"On the basis of statistical data presented in this report, the reaction to the spread of H1N1 was actually disproportionate to the actual nature of the phenomenon, generating, in fact, very costly vaccination campaigns in many Member States."
"The rapporteur therefore considered it appropriate to raise extremely important issues, first of all, concerning the overwhelming influence of pharmaceutical companies."
"She urged that studies on antiviral medications should be independent of pharmaceutical companies."
"The accelerated authorisation procedures have demonstrated their limitations, because no scientific evidence is available and data released by the industry are therefore still used."
"There is also need for better cooperation, to request a review of prevention plans and the roles of key actors, and also to enable Member States to make group purchases on a voluntary basis."
"The World Health Organisation (WHO) should revise its definition of a pandemic as soon as possible so as to include the virulence of the virus in its classification."
"In this regard, it is necessary that the vaccine should be effective, have a positive relationship between risks and benefits, and be genuinely targeted at risk groups."
"Finally, we must avoid any conflicts of interest because they may immediately generate suspicion of undue pressure in public opinion."
"This report has the virtue of condemning the lack of transparency of the European Medicines Agency as well as the links between pharmaceutical companies and experts on vaccines and antivirals."
"It is therefore a shame that the report does not call for the activities of that agency to be suspended until a real, comprehensive reform has taken place."
"I am voting to encourage the rapporteur to go further next time."
"The management of H1N1 influenza within the EU has revealed a variety of difficulties, particularly with regard to its actual severity and scale; the response by the Member States was disproportionate in size and extremely costly, when compared to the deaths that occur every year due to normal influenza and the amounts spent by Member States in combating this."
"An analysis of the management of H1N1 influenza in Europe highlights a basic problem: an absence of independent assessment by national and/or European health authorities, and the resulting inability to adapt public health measures in the best possible way and in real time to the actual clinical and epidemiological statistics available."
"Thus, changes in the management of future cases of pandemics are needed in order to avoid generalised panic among people as well as unnecessary costs."
"in writing. - This report evaluates the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU and highlights elements that should be improved: cooperation, independence and transparency in the management of future pandemic crises, namely through better application of the ECDC's competence."
"However, one assessment is not enough and I have not noticed any further developments in the area of fast and efficient reaction to outbreaks of diseases and not a word about preventive measures."
"As always, the report is vague and unspecific."
"I voted in favour since there is no other report."
"There were fewer fatalities from type A/H1N1 influenza in 2009 than from seasonal influenza."
"Even though the WHO classified the H1N1 influenza as a minor illness, at the same time, it issued a pandemic warning of level 6, the highest possible level."
"In order to meet their obligations to the population, the EU Member States consequently spent billions to combat an influenza outbreak whose potential threat is much less than that of normal influenza."
"The media also contributed to the panic."
"When a pandemic is announced as dangerous but turns out to be a storm in a teacup, then worryingly, future warnings will no longer be taken seriously."
"This clearly demonstrates that the WHO needs to revise its pandemic criteria."
"Naturally, good cooperation and joint procurement are advantageous in the event of a pandemic, helping to achieve price reductions."
"However, if the authorisation of new medicines is rushed through in order to deal with illusory pandemics, then we are faced with an enormous problem."
"The role of the media and the pharmaceuticals companies in fanning the flames of panic has not been considered here."
"For this reason, I abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, because it is difficult to predict the severity of a pandemic and how it will unfold, and often when a pandemic occurs, many decisions are taken that are disproportionate."
"Therefore, it is necessary to pay significant attention to ensuring cooperation, independence and transparency."
"Above all, the prevention plans established both in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics must be revised consistently, so that they are flexible and adapted effectively every time there is a risk of a flu pandemic."
"Furthermore, we must encourage cooperation and coordination of action at international and regional levels in order to properly ensure risk management and react promptly to the risk of a pandemic."
"I believe that more financial resources need to be allocated to research and development, and to that end we need to increase investment to evaluate and anticipate the impact of an influenza virus."
"It is important to ensure that the prior purchase agreement and delivery process takes place transparently, reducing corruption in this area."
"We must limit the influence of pharmaceutical companies, not just as regards distribution, but also the carrying out of studies into vaccines and antiviral medications."
"Scientific experts should declare publicly that they have no financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry."
"I voted in favour of the report on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU."
"In numerous cases, including in Greece, attention on the part of the institutions and the State decreased as publicity in the issue decreased."
"Debate on the influenza has stopped, but the virus not only continues to exist; it is proving to be even more deadly than before."
"For example, in Greece, there was an increase recently both in the illness and in the number of deaths caused by it, with losses exceeding 100 human lives."
"The main cause given was the lack of information: vulnerable groups, like chronic sufferers who should have asked to be vaccinated, did not do so, considering that the danger had passed."
"The report on the management of H1N1 influenza in the EU during 2009-2010 highlights the low level of severity, in statistical terms, that the illness had within the European area (in human terms, each person who died is an irreplaceable loss)."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported 2 900 deaths in Europe resulting from infection with H1N1 during 2009."
"This number is lower than the European Commission's official estimates for the number of deaths due exclusively to seasonal influenza."
"The number of deaths is also markedly lower than the most optimistic forecasts of health services within EU Member States."
"The fact that the Member States and the European institutions accepted the maximum-level alert declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) resulted in a set of costly and disproportionate measures in the light of the severity of H1N1 influenza."
"However, given the WHO's recommendation, I do not believe that any other course of action could have been taken."
"However, this case still needs to be reflected upon, and I agree with the rapporteur's view that the EU requires greater cooperation between its Member States, greater independence and greater transparency, specifically with regard to the cost-benefit assessment of these measures with a major financial impact."
"in writing. - The report considers that better cooperation is needed in response to pandemics and calls for a review of the prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States (MSs)."
"It also calls for reinforced cooperation between MSs and coordination of MSs with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)."
"It also urges the WHO to revise the definition of a pandemic, based on its geographical spread and severity."
"The ECDC is invited to apply its competences as an independent agency to assess and communicate the severity of infection risks within the EU, making recommendations on best practices in areas such as crisis management techniques, vaccination and communication strategies."
"Moreover, the report calls for an assessment of the influenza vaccination strategies recommended in the EU and applied in MSs, covering the efficacy of the vaccines, their risk-benefit balance and the different target groups recommended, with regard to a safe and effective use and MSs' reports on relevant information to the Commission (i.e. the number of doses of vaccines purchased and actually used, the number of H1N1 infections and people that died due to the infection, etc.)."
"The EU needs to improve cooperation, independence and transparency in the management of future pandemic crises."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Rivasi for her excellent work."
"This report is an important attempt to highlight the doubts that have been raised over the disproportionate response to swine flu in Europe, as well as the potential influence of pharmaceutical companies on the actions taken."
"I am critical of the EU's response in 2009-2010 to 'swine flu', the H1N1 virus."
"I suggest, for the future, group purchasing of vaccines to save money and more effective rules to prevent conflicts of interest, for example, by publishing the declaration of interests of experts who advise European health authorities."
"In this regard, I note that according to European legislation, liability for vaccines lies with manufacturers and not national governments."
"I also call on the World Health Organisation (WHO) to revise the definition of 'pandemic' and also take into account the virulence of the disease and not only the geographical spread of the virus."
"In order to provide the Union with its own capacity to prevent risks of a pandemic, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) must be guaranteed the support it needs to perform this task entirely independently."
"in writing. - The EP has today thrown a spotlight on the disproportionate response to the swine flu outbreak in Europe."
"Member States spent billions of euro on vaccines, which were authorised in a rush despite the moderate nature of the virus."
"Health budgets are notoriously overstretched, and there are far more important health issues to tackle than giving subsidies to big pharmaceutical firms."
"MEPs have today called for a revision of the EU's health response mechanisms."
"Preparedness plans should become sufficiently autonomous and flexible to be adapted as swiftly as possible to the actual risks."
"The evaluation of medicines needs to be fully transparent, and all declarations of interest should be published to allow for public scrutiny of possible conflicts of interests."
"The EU blindly followed the WHO in its response to the swine flu outbreak, and this clearly needs to change."
"The EP has called for meaningful EU risk evaluation and for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be given adequate means to carry out all its tasks, not least, to assess the severity of infection risk."
"Even through the virulence of H1N1 influenza in Europe has not been particularly aggressive, this virus has so far caused no fewer than 4 700 deaths."
"The report published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that, in the management of the virus, the EU has been unable to adapt quickly to the medical measures necessary to limit infection."
"This is largely attributable to prevention strategies adopted in the various Member States, planned in consultation with the World Health Organisation (WHO) years ago without ever having received substantial updates."
"To prevent such situations recurring, in view of the harsh criticism received over the manner of distribution of vaccines, we must concentrate our efforts specifically in this direction in the future, optimising authorisation procedures for the marketing of medicinal products used when reacting to health crises."
"We support the own-initiative report, as we are all aware that the excessive alarmism linked to the so-called bird flu pandemic cost the EU about 10 times more than the normal flu campaign."
"The fact that the World Health Organisation (WHO) accepted the alarm without acting independently through analyses of costs and risks undertaken by the European agencies, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), led to costly and unnecessary vaccination campaigns and, in particular, encouraged the population to buy disproportionate quantities of sterile disposable material and disinfectants."
"The end result in terms of deaths, which is what must be considered by the law maker, was even lower than that of a normal seasonal influenza."
"It is therefore essential that the Commission should report to Parliament with a detailed cost-benefit analysis within six months, stating how it intends to react to similar situations in the future."
"The WHO should revise its definition of a pandemic in order to take into account both the geographic extent and the virulence of the infection."
"in writing. - I supported this report which evaluates the management of H1N1 influenza and calls for a joint procurement mechanism for vaccinations."
"It is important that we learn from previous outbreaks so that we can protect ourselves better in the future."
"I voted in favour of the report after the Committee succeeded in ironing out the accusations and misjudgments to a certain degree."
"The report is critical and indicates ways in which the EU can organise itself better in future with more joint action to prevent a pandemic."
"in writing. - Whilst the ECR Group is in favour of improving lines of communication and cooperation between Member States in relation to health threats like epidemics, the report on H1N1 ill advises Member States on the facts surrounding H1N1 and on the precautions they should take in the event of another epidemic."
"There are several disputable facts within the report and explanatory statement which may lead to a false understanding of H1N1, its impact on European societies and government response plans."
"We believe the recommended steps which a Member State should take when faced with future epidemics (from the buying of vaccinations through to the reporting of facts to EU bodies) are unwise and would not solve any major issues associated with H1N1 or future pandemics."
"The report also places liability for vaccines with manufacturers, which may hinder the supply of vaccines and blurs lines of accountability."
"Furthermore, the dossier tries to broaden ECDC's mandate and their working relationship with Member States, which is undesirable as it may lead to an increase in their budgetary allowance."
"The ECR Group has therefore voted against this report."
"I support the favourable outcome of the vote in committee on the appointment of Harald Wögerbauer as a new Member of the Court of Auditors, on the basis of a positive assessment of his curriculum vitae and the written responses he provided to the questionnaire given out to candidates for the post in question."
"Today being the centenary of International Women's Day, I voted against the nomination of Mr Harald Wögerbauer because there are not enough women at the European Court of Auditors."
"I agreed with this proposal, because Mr Harald Wögerbauer fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 286(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and a favourable opinion has been delivered on the nomination of Mr Harald Wögerbauer as a Member of the Court of Auditors."
"in writing. - I abstained on the appointment of Mr Harald Wögerbauer as a Member of the Court of Auditors."
"I did so because of reports from colleagues of his unclear performance regarding his experience in the Austrian Court of Audit."
"The Court of Auditors is a supervisory institution that verifies the legality and regularity of the European Union's income and expenditure, as well as overseeing its good financial management, operating with complete independence."
"In this spirit, the appointment of its members must be governed by criteria of capability and independence."
"Therefore, on the Council's initiative, Harald Wögerbauer was put forward for the Court of Auditors."
"He submitted his curriculum vitae, completed a written questionnaire and was interviewed by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"He argued his case well enough to justify his appointment to the Court of Auditors, to perform his duties capably and independently."
"As a result of the constitutional reforms necessitated by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2010, the ruling parties in Austria introduced a kind of standardised nomination procedure for some EU posts."
"It would seem that a number of important positions are missing from the list in Article 23c of the Austrian Federal Constitution, according to which decisions on senior appointments should be made known at least to the Austrian President or that the Federal Government should seek consensus with the National Council on the appointments."
"Harald Wögerbauer, political director of the Austrian People's Party parliamentary club, is to become a new member of the Executive Committee of the European Court of Auditors."
"It would seem that Mr Wögerbauer meets the technical criteria."
"However, because the Austrian People's Party would appear to be taking a kind of autonomous line in relation to pending personnel decisions at EU level and this contravenes democratic principles and the continuous calls for greater transparency in EU appointments, I have abstained on this vote."
"I voted in favour of the report relating to the appointment of Harald Wögerbauer to the post of member of the Court of Auditors."
"All of the data presented, on which my decision was based, indicates that the criteria laid down in Article 286(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, specifically, the guarantees of independence, were met, and so I welcome the appointment of Harald Wögerbauer to the post of member of the Court of Auditors."
"I am voting in favour of this report as several recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), and which are already in place in the GFCM contracting states, need to be transposed into a single EU legislative instrument."
"This simplification is required in order to avoid the drawing-up of annual regulations to update legislation, as has occurred in the past."
"I voted in favour of this document."
"The objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP) are to ensure the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources and a high level of protection for the ecosystem."
"The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) was set up by an international agreement in 1949, and the European Community is a member of the Commission."
"The GFCM plays an important role in implementing the fundamental objectives of the fisheries policy, to promote the development, conservation, and rational management of living aquatic resources, to formulate and recommend conservation measures and to promote cooperative projects in the area of training."
"As the recommendations adopted by the GFCM are binding on its contracting parties, and the Community is one of these, the provisions of the agreement should therefore be transposed into Community law, ensuring the consistency and application of this policy."
"I voted in favour of this document, which aims to merge certain measures adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) into a single piece of EU legislation."
"Until today, the European Community has adopted annual regulations for the purposes of bringing the regulation into line, while this report marks a step towards the bureaucratic and administrative simplification that is one of the objectives of the European Union."
"The document also has the merit of bringing clarity even to purely technical aspects: For example, it establishes clear measures to restrict fishing in the Gulf of Lions, and sets the minimum mesh size of nets in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, while prohibiting the use of towed dredges and trawl nets to a depth of more than 1 000 metres."
"I voted in favour of this report because I think it is a positive step in an economic sector that is crucial for Europe, in other words, fisheries."
"I believe that any intervention by the EU should always start from an analysis of the needs that emerge from local businesses depending on this activity, often characterised by the presence of the small and medium-sized enterprises so fundamental to the economy and society."
"Very many areas in the Mediterranean regions have such characteristics, so it is very important that legislative proposals that set out to deal with the fishing in this area are clearly inspired by the principle of subsidiarity, so as not to risk compromising the entire system."
"I am also firmly convinced that it is, above all, essential to offer special protection to small and medium-sized enterprises working in the field, involving them in decision making and giving them as much support as possible, because they are actually very difficult to redevelop."
"Regulations that take no account of these features may cause irreparable damage to smaller markets, forcing a conversion into another area that would be very complex to achieve."
"in writing. - (PT) I agree with the draft legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) Agreement Area."
"In order to prevent the powers of Parliament being usurped, Article 28 should be removed from this proposal; this stipulates that the provisions of the regulation should be amended in line with a comitology procedure reducing the role of Parliament to simply receiving information from the Commission relating to management committee procedures."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report on the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) Agreement Area, as it transposes recommendations adopted by the GFCM, and which are already in operation within member countries of the GFCM, into a single EU legislative instrument."
"in writing. - (PT) The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has been adopting recommendations at its annual sessions."
"The aim of this proposal for a regulation is simply to transpose some of the recommendations adopted into a single EU legislative instrument, to which future recommendations may also be added."
"The content of the recommendations adopted by the GFCM and the obligations pertaining thereto are frequently entirely or partially covered by EU legislation adopted previously, with only the aspects that differ needing to be transposed."
"The regulation voted on will apply to all commercial fishing and aquaculture activities carried out by EU fishing boats and by nationals of Member States within the GFCM area."
"It does not apply to fishing operations carried out exclusively for the purposes of scientific research that take place with the authorisation and under the authority of a Member State."
"In this case, just the European Commission and the Member States in whose waters the activity is being carried out need to be informed beforehand."
"I believe that the Commission's proposal could run counter to Parliament's powers with regard to the matter in question, in particular, Article 28, which needs to be replaced so that both the effective participation of this Chamber in future amendments to the regulation and respect for its prerogatives are ensured."
"The aim of this proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation is the transposition of certain recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)."
"The conversion of this agreement into a single EU legislative instrument represents a significant advance, making it possible to improve the control of catches of fish species within the waters covered, as well as cooperation, information and communication between the European Commission, the Member States and the Executive Secretariat of the GFCM."
"Given that this represents a simplification of procedures - putting an end to annual regulations - and that these recommendations are already in operation within countries that are members of the GFCM, I applaud this initiative, with which I am fully in agreement, and I look forward to the satisfactory implementation of this regulation."
"We recognise and acknowledge the importance of multilateral cooperation for the promotion of the proper conservation and management of marine biological resources - the subject of this agreement."
"However, the proposal for a regulation that was approved contains a provision that we consider to be unacceptable and which we sought to amend, proposing the removal of a paragraph from Article 28."
"This having been rejected by the majority, we voted against the final proposal for a regulation."
"It aims to confer on the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts that could affect an area forming part of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of a Member State."
"The area is known as Eratosthenes Seamount and is part of the EEZ of the Republic of Cyprus."
"This possibility clashes with the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, particularly as this is an area that is highly sensitive from a political point of view, given that the area in question is disputed, illegally, by a third country that is a candidate for EU membership."
"The seabed in this area contains natural resources that the Republic of Cyprus has a legitimate right to exploit, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"In this context, the EU's remit should not go beyond questions relating to the common fisheries policy."
"We have always attached the greatest importance to multilateral cooperation at the level of the promotion of the proper conservation and management of marine biological resources, which is the subject of this agreement."
"However, the proposal for a regulation that was approved contains a provision that we consider to be unacceptable and which we sought to amend, by proposing the removal of a paragraph from Article 28."
"This having been rejected by the majority, we voted against the final draft regulation."
"The sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus is called into question, even more so as this is an area that is highly sensitive from a political point of view, given that the area in question is disputed, illegally, by a third country that is a candidate for EU membership."
"The seabed in this area contains natural resources that the Republic of Cyprus has a legitimate right to exploit, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"In this context, the EU's remit should not go beyond questions relating to the common fisheries policy."
"I agreed with this document, as the main tasks of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) are to promote the development, conservation and rational management of living aquatic resources, to formulate and recommend conservation measures, and to promote cooperative projects in the area of training."
"The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM, and already in effect in the GFCM's contracting States, in a single Community legislative act."
"This would mark an important step towards simplification, given that hitherto, the European Community has just adopted annual regulations for the purpose of adapting and updating the existing rules."
"The proposal features a series of smart solutions."
"For example, with regard to fishing gear, the proposal for a regulation specifies in detail the minimum mesh size to be used in the Mediterranean Sea (Article 15) and the Black Sea (Article 16) and prohibits the use of towed dredgers and trawl nets at depths below 1 000 metres (Article 17)."
"It also tackles issues surrounding vessels engaged in illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, etc."
"in writing. - I voted for the report on the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) Agreement Area."
"The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM, and already in effect in the GFCM's contracting States, into a single Community legislative act into which future recommendations can be incorporated by way of amendments to that act."
"This would mark an important step towards simplification, given that up to now, the European Community has only adopted annual regulations for the purpose of adapting and updating the existing rules."
"European Union membership of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) faces a major turning point with this proposal for a regulation."
"It is, in fact, proving to be extremely interesting in providing for the implementation of certain recommendations adopted by the GFCM in a single piece of EU legislation."
"Such an act constitutes a legal instrument that is certainly more stable than the present one and allows future recommendations to be added only by an amendment of the law itself."
"It represents a major step towards improving legal certainty and also contributes to the simplification of regulations."
"Over and above the relevance of provisions in respect of a minimum mesh size for fishing nets, Article 28 of this proposed regulation also questions the powers of Parliament."
"In fact, it states that the provisions contained in the regulation can be changed under the 'comitology procedure' whereby the Commission is assisted by management committees, chaired by a representative of the Commission and composed of representatives of Member States."
"This would effectively deprive Parliament of its powers, and it therefore appears desirable that the Commission should operate through delegated acts, with the possibility of Parliament or the Council withdrawing the delegated powers."
"I agree with the rapporteur over the need to simplify fishing rules by coming up with a regulation that can implement the recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean in a single piece of legislation."
"I also agree with the objectives and principles applied in the common fisheries policy, but I think all coastal Member States must guarantee the right balance between protection and the socio-economic value of ecosystems."
"In other words, I believe we should call for the protection of the interests of local communities in accordance with a general principle."
"Regulation No 1967/2006 meticulously determines the gear authorised for fishing in the waters of the GFCM area, in the Mediterranean in our particular case."
"I call on this House to take note that the objective of safeguarding our natural habitats sometimes results, as the regulations stand at the moment, in serious consequences for some fishing communities."
"In this regard, Italy is waiting for the Commission to order an exemption to the ban on fishing two particular species that are the main product of an extensive fishing industry."
"I would therefore like to make all representatives of the 27 Member States and, through them, the Commission aware of the need to consider making these instruments more flexible to give the local fishing industry what it needs to survive."
"The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) was created in 1949 by international agreement."
"Its remit covers the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and adjacent waters, the encouragement of development, conservation and management of marine biological resources, the formulation and recommendation of conservation measures and the promotion of cooperation projects in the field of training."
"The aim of this draft regulation is simply to transpose certain recommendations adopted by the GFCM, and which are already in force in member countries of the GFCM, into a single EU legislative instrument, to which future recommendations may be added through the introduction of amendments."
"in writing. - The report is intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM."
"These recommendations deal with technical measures."
"One of them is a matter of concern for the Committee on Fisheries, which considers Article 28 (procedure for amendment) of the proposal to be a very dubious provision, insofar as it could threaten Parliament's prerogatives and the current institutional balance by inflating the Commission's implementing powers to the point that all future amendments to the regulation would be covered by the Commission's powers."
"The Committee on Fisheries therefore proposes that Article 28 be deleted."
"It seems that the Commission has not completely familiarised itself with the Lisbon Treaty, and it looks as though some officials have decided to take decisions that should, in fact, be made by Parliament."
"That must not be allowed in any case."
"I voted in favour since I think this impudence on the part of the Commission is simply going too far."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, because fishing, particularly in the Mediterranean, is more than simply an economic activity; it is part of the culture and way of life."
"Entire regions are based around fishing."
"It is therefore necessary to pay particular attention to fishing in this region, because fishing in the Mediterranean has more specificities than elsewhere and it should be subject to specific measures."
"In my opinion, it is advisable to transpose various recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean in a single Community legislative act, given the fact that the recommendations mentioned are already in effect."
"Furthermore, it would be advisable to set out technical measures, strengthening restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Lions, tightening requirements regarding nets, and the issuing of authorisation to engage in fishing."
"I agree that vessels authorised to fish for common dolphinfish should be subject to more stringent regulation and should be prohibited from using towed dredgers and trawl nets at depths below 1 000 metres. Furthermore, it would be advisable to regulate control measures, providing for opportunities to inspect the landings and trans-shipment operations of third-country fishing vessels and occasions when Member States may not allow a third-country vessel to use their ports."
"I am pleased with the proposals to cooperate actively and exchange information with the GFCM."
"I voted for Mr Rivellini's report because I fully agree with the importance of simplifying Union regulations."
"The report offers the opportunity to channel all the recommendations of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean into a single piece of European legislation, making it easier for the public to access documents and helping the relevant agencies to make any future amendments."
"I believe that the activity of regulatory simplification for citizens and stakeholders is a duty that we, as legislators, need to carry out quickly and carefully to enable them to understand the opportunities that the EU provides, but, above all, to eliminate the administrative burden that brings so many additional costs."
"in writing. - The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) was set up by an international agreement in 1949."
"The area covered by the agreement comprises the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and connecting waters."
"The main tasks of the GFCM are to promote the development, conservation and rational management of living aquatic resources, to formulate and recommend conservation measures, and to promote cooperative projects in the area of training."
"The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM, and already in effect in the GFCM's contracting States, into a single Community legislative act into which future recommendations can be incorporated by way of amendments to that act."
"The provisions of the regulation are the usual types of things that such organisations regulate."
"Title II deals with restrictions on fishing gear and activities ('technical measures')."
"Title III consists of 'control measures' such as reporting requirements, inspections, etc. Title IV deals with cooperation, information and reporting requirements for the Commission and the Member States to cooperate and exchange information with the Executive Secretary of the GFCM."
"I voted for this resolution because I believe that the regulatory activity carried out by the General Commission for Fisheries in the Mediterranean has been essential with the aim of achieving a sustainable level of fishing in the Mediterranean."
"The latest statistics on fish stocks in the Mediterranean reveal that more than 54 per cent of stocks examined are overfished."
"It is therefore a priority to take legislative action to protect the marine environment, returning the use of fish stocks to sustainable levels."
"Full cooperation between Member States will now be important because they must incorporate the new standards as soon as possible, imposing appropriate sanctions against those who fail to comply with them."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which seeks to simplify the existing arrangements relating to fishing practice within the Mediterranean Agreement Area."
"The European Community and Greece are parties to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Agreement Area."
"The proposal for a regulation relating to certain provisions governing fisheries in the GFCM Agreement Area are designed to translate certain proposals adopted by the GFCM and already being applied by countries party to it into a single Community legislative act."
"I voted in favour of this particular motion for a resolution because I consider that the control measures proposed will protect the natural environment and will therefore benefit the parties to the GFCM."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM Agreement Area."
"The combining of the agreed recommendations into a future single Community legislative act will simplify administration and increase efficiency, which is something to be welcomed."
"The individual technical adjustments proposed reflect the modern requirements for a responsible fishery policy."
"I fully approve this report as it aims to initiate a new form of taxation of the financial sector, an urgent measure in itself, and also as an addition to recently approved regulatory and supervisory instruments."
"In this respect, I would stress that 'the introduction of a tax on financial transactions ought to be as broadly based as possible', as the document suggests, in a way that includes all types of transactions."
"Among other benefits, a financial transaction tax makes the market fairer and more transparent, reduces speculation and levels of fiscal fraud, and distributes the burden of the crisis among the financial operators."
"The additional resources resulting from this measure should help with combating poverty, encouraging job creation, funding the welfare state, achieving climate and environmental targets and financing other elements arising from the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I support the need, in turn, for the Commission to study a future system of Eurobonds and the projected issuing of common European project bonds as measures for stimulating investment."
"I also support the 'polluter pays' principle."
"Finally, we cannot overlook support for development, as it is important to maintain the commitment to set aside 0.7% of the gross national income of each Member State for developing countries."
"in writing. - I voted against the Podimata report on innovative financing because it wants to introduce a financial transfer tax which, while it is claimed that it is needed to protect the economy from risky trading and to provide a fund to use in the event of another crisis, and will only be placed on wholesale and professional industry, it will inevitably be passed on to the consumer and citizen taxpayer who is already struggling in this crisis."
"The tax will have a terrible impact on the City of London, the financial service industry which is Britain's largest and greatest contributor to the Treasury."
"It will cause companies to leave the UK with a loss of jobs and a loss of tax revenue."
"In the current context of budgetary cuts, the discussion of innovative financing is not only necessary, it is vital."
"Personally, I am particularly in favour of the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, ideally at international level, or, failing that, at European level."
"I am pleased that this measure was adopted by a majority of my fellow Members."
"The global economic and financial crisis has exposed severe weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory framework of the global financial system."
"Today, it is clear that we need new tools which can curb speculation and restore the financial sector's main role, guaranteeing a fair and proportionate distribution of the burden amongst the key financial players."
"We must begin to discuss taxation of the financial sector, which hitherto, unlike other sectors, is largely untaxed."
"There is also a VAT exemption approach for all basic financial activities."
"I agree with the introduction of a tax on financial transactions which could help to tackle the highly damaging trading patterns in financial markets, improve the efficiency of the market itself, reduce price volatility and create incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments with added value for the real economy."
"With this vote, Parliament has reached another milestone on the road towards global financial regulation."
"We have sent a strong message in favour of the projects of the French Presidency of the G20."
"When the economy shows its first signs of recovery, we will have to work together to promote a well thought-out, balanced model of liberalism."
"The European left tried to take sole credit for the idea of taxing financial transactions."
"It was misguided, however."
"Europeans know when to be pragmatic."
"Today's vote shows that this notion extends beyond all political differences."
"I cannot support the Podimata report, because it is Member States that are responsible for tax policy."
"The report does not do justice to that situation."
"What it aims to do is to prescribe a number of taxes at EU level, including a tax on financial transactions and an energy tax."
"If a tax on the financial sector is necessary, the revenues it generates should go to Member States' treasuries."
"After all, they are the ones who have had to bail out the banks."
"Member States would do well to use these revenues to reduce the public debt, which has increased during the crisis."
"However, the report assumes without question that such revenues could benefit global and EU policy objectives."
"That would then include climate change and development cooperation."
"Furthermore, the report includes an argument for a solidarity levy on air tickets, so that we can combat public health problems and reduce charges in the transport sector."
"I accept that we could pursue these useful policy objectives and that it would be advisable to consider allocating more resources for that purpose."
"However, as this would affect our tax measures, it is Member States who should be taking such initiatives, not Europe dictating them top-down."
"I fear that such an approach may be standing in the way of fruitful cooperation with the Council."
"More than three years after the crisis, elements for regulating the financial markets are rather thin on the ground."
"In this respect, a new tax would allow for new sources of finance to be released and for the most questionable financial practices to be regulated."
"Let us be clear: it is, at present, impossible to say that what happened three years ago will not happen again in the future."
"It is enough to drive one to despair."
"The challenge is therefore to know whether Europe has the critical mass to take specific action."
"I believe that it does and that the sooner it takes action on this matter, the better!"
"The adoption of this report in plenary indicates a path which the European Union seems to want to go down."
"Although the idea of introducing a tax on financial transactions seems to support the general public, even if the G20 leaders failed to agree on setting such a contribution at global level, I feel obliged to mention that this could have an adverse impact in the medium and long term."
"The impact of such a tax, imposed only on capital established in the EU, will certainly be to make this capital migrate to developed or emerging countries outside the EU."
"The other scenario, at least in an initial phase, will be that this tax will be passed on in the form of costs to the credit consumer or other financial services."
"Whatever the situation, the perverse effect of this is that the EU will move even closer to the dangerous situation where it will lose its competitiveness against other states such as the US, Japan or the BRIC countries."
"This will slow down economic growth and create problems, including for the real economy, which is dependent on the cheapest possible sources of financing."
"I voted for this report because I agree with the need for the European Union to seek new innovative financing instruments."
"Such instruments would, in fact, allow the EU to address the current challenges, because they would play both a regulatory role and a role for the production of revenue."
"It has often been pointed out in this House that the economic crisis has highlighted the lack of regulation and supervision of the global financial system."
"We also know that the taxpayers are currently the first to bear the cost of the crisis, not only through direct taxation, but also in terms of rising unemployment, dwindling incomes, reduced access to social services and increasing inequalities."
"New instruments are needed if we are to come up with holistic and integrated responses to the crisis."
"I agree, therefore, to the introduction of the long-discussed Eurobonds, which can lead to joint management of debt by aggregating part of the sovereign debt."
"The rapporteur also proposes other funding instruments designed to curb speculation: for example, coherent and effective taxation of the energy sector and the drawing up of proposals for a tax on development that will lead to increased resources for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"We are constantly confronted in the EU with the consequences of the financial crisis, which, in 2009, overflowed into a budgetary crisis, a significant aspect of which was the excessive issuing of government bonds."
"In contrast to the approved report, however, I do not see market pressures in this, but rather the irresponsible budgetary policy of many national governments that are unwilling to reform their pension, health and employment systems."
"In my opinion, putting the blame on market failure is misguided and shows a lack of courage to face up to the necessary reforms."
"We have now approved rules on more stringent financial regulation and financial market supervision, and we should go further and take measures to kick-start European economies, for example, in the form of funding for common infrastructure projects and tax incentives for firms to invest in science and research."
"I would like to warn against the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and various forms of bank taxes, because it would tie up the financial market and distort competition."
"Eurobonds are not the solution, as they only transfer fiscal irresponsibility to the European level, to places further away from public control, where attempts at excessive spending would have even more serious repercussions than at the national level."
"I am also not in favour of a Europe-wide carbon tax, as this would impose a disproportionate burden on the energy sector in particular, and ultimately reduce the energy security of the EU."
"Financial transactions account for a large proportion of the resources in the financial sector, and the various speculative operations on financial markets played a considerable role in the global financial crisis."
"It is surely not fair for taxpayers to bear the full burden of the financial crisis, as some of this burden should be transferred to the financial sector as well, so that it can share in the costs."
"The report focuses mainly on transactions that are highly risky and speculative, and it will therefore lead to greater responsibility in the financial sector through the future taxation of financial transactions, which will paradoxically lead to greater stability in the global financial sector."
"Another reason for introducing a tax on financial transactions is the fact that financial services are not subject to VAT in most Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report because I think it is a positive step towards the future innovative financing instruments that will underpin European economic recovery."
"I consider it essential for Europe to find resources on the market to finance the key sectors of our economy, in accordance with the objectives of Europe 2020, in particular, the trans-European transport energy and telecommunications infrastructures necessary for ending the crisis."
"It is essential to drive the European economy."
"The EU's responsibility is not to impose and/or increase taxes, but have the courage to face the market."
"The solution is to be able to find new forms of financing that can ensure full achievement of projects in the shortest possible time, through the creation of ad hoc funds built upon the issuance of securities directly related to the implementation and economic exploitation of the work, and which are known as project bonds."
"Any taxation on financial transactions should be proposed in Europe only if introduced globally: I believe that the Commission should investigate the possibility of introducing such a tax at EU level, attempting to predict whether this will result in negative consequences for the competitiveness of the EU."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution as I agree with the Commission's objective of increasing the size of the EU budget through the use of innovative fiscal instruments, and recognise the potential benefits of increasing private sector financing using public funds."
"I also believe that such measures should be accompanied by transparent reporting, combined with investment guidelines, risk management, exposure limits and adequate control and supervision procedures, established in a democratically accountable manner."
"I welcome the European Parliament's support for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at European level during the vote in plenary."
"A tax on financial transactions at European level will penalise highly speculative and socially useless financial transactions, while providing the European Union with an annual income of EUR 200 billion."
"This vote goes against the competitiveness pact."
"Rather than penalising States and citizens, we need to tax the financial markets."
"The Commission and the Council must urgently take note of this."
"I support, with some reservations, the Podimata report on innovative financing."
"I share the rapporteur's concern about the economic and financial crisis that we are going through, and the consequent lack of investment."
"I also agree that it is desirable for investment to translate into greater progress and innovation, and that there is a need for Europe to increase its capacity for intelligent investment."
"However, I fear that, overall, the report seems overly inclined towards increased taxes, when in several countries (such as Portugal), we are already experiencing an overdose of fiscal burdens."
"In its final version, the report calls for the introduction of a financial transaction tax (at a global, or at least European, level), while admitting that the consequences of this need to be studied (positing an a posteriori study for this)."
"I applaud the defence of the launch of Eurobonds, which would facilitate access to the market for the more fragile euro area countries, and the opinion that this would be beneficial 'to all participating Member States and to the euro area as a whole'."
"in writing. - (FR) Some people do not support a financial transaction tax (FTT) at European level because it would distort competition on the financial markets at Europe's expense."
"I do not believe that a tax of only 0.01% on these transactions will cause investors to withdraw from the world's largest financial market."
"If we rely on the G20 to take this initiative at global level, we will wait forever."
"I am therefore pleased that the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in favour of this FTT at European level has been adopted."
"It would provide an estimated EUR 200 billion of income a year, thus allowing the Union to properly finance its budget, at a time when Council Members are already making known their intention to cut it, despite the added value that results from European expenditure."
"The crisis, brought about by financial market players, is being used as an argument by our right-wing governments to call for budgetary cuts, especially in social expenditure."
"Hence, European citizens would pay for mistakes that were not of their making."
"The FTT would reintroduce social justice into European decisions by consolidating public finances at the expense of those who weakened them in the first place."
"Therefore, this was exactly the right time to make this move."
"The economic and financial crisis has highlighted the total lack of ethics in this area."
"The paradigm of the new welfare economy, whereby the pursuit of individual wellbeing is the key to collective welfare, which is the sum of its parts, is apparent in all its inadequacy."
"According to this approach, individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest, let alone the general interest."
"Yet because public government must set general interest as a framework within which to operate, and provide free space for freedom and individual rights within it, it must support this with a fair and progressive tax system."
"Consistent with this approach, which must be supported at global level by the EU and all G8 and G20 countries, the revenue from financial transactions must be made comparable to other revenues through a specific tax system that favours greater responsibility by operators together with other rules and new paradigms."
"The introduction of Eurobonds designed for the crisis fund and infrastructure projects could strengthen the EU's ability to take action if they were additional to the EU budget."
"The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving, albeit slowly, in this direction."
"The current economic crisis has highlighted shortcomings in the supervision of the financial sector."
"We therefore need new tools and new fiscal policies."
"Indeed, the financial system has generated substantial profits from speculative transactions, and it does not have to pay any tax."
"By voting in favour of a tax on financial transactions, the revenue of which could be usefully channelled into development aid, the European Parliament has indicated that it wants to stop this injustice."
"This tax should, of course, be applied internationally, but if this does not happen, we would ask the EU to shoulder its responsibilities by implementing it in Europe."
"In this way, Europe would set an example, both in terms of innovative financing and in terms of showing solidarity with developing countries."
"It is now up to the European Commission to submit to us a legislative proposal that meets the expectations expressed by a very large majority in this Parliament."
"I welcome this vote on the tax on financial transactions because the European Parliament is calling for the Union to implement this tax scheme without waiting for a hypothetical decision on the matter at global level."
"The European Union has the largest financial sector in the world."
"It should therefore lead the way."
"According to various studies, the creation of a tax of around 0.05% on transactions would generate some EUR 200 billion of annual revenue to be used to finance the recovery and development cooperation, and to protect the environment, while, at the same time, discouraging financial speculation."
"Having said that, I also remain convinced that we need a tax of this kind at international level: the Union must encourage its partners to adopt regulations on financial taxes."
"I say this because, if this tax is applied only in the European Union and not internationally by Europe's main financial competitors, the Union's finances will suffer greatly."
"In particular, I hope that a compromise will be reached on this point during the French Presidency of the G20."
"For over 10 years, the European socialists have been fighting in the European Parliament for a tax on financial transactions."
"This tax would have many benefits: not only would it discourage financial speculation; it would also fund aid to developing countries and their adaptation to climate change, while contributing to the European Union's budget."
"The world is now in a different situation: the recession has made the need to stabilise the financial markets yet more acute, and the European Union needs new resources to overcome this recession - it must overcome it by means of a recovery, not by means of austerity."
"At the same time, the groundswell in favour of the tax is getting bigger: more and more governments are supporting the idea, and the European Parliament has already voted repeatedly in favour of introducing a tax on financial transactions."
"This new vote in favour of the tax is an important step: Parliament is saying that we must act immediately at European level, even if there is no global agreement."
"Parliament's request is clear, and the vote was an overwhelming one: we must now turn our words into deeds and implement the tax on financial transactions."
"The report on innovative financing addresses a number of important aspects."
"Unfortunately, it contains a proposal for Europe to introduce a financial transaction tax on a unilateral basis."
"I believe that the Swedish example of the unilateral introduction of a kind of financial transaction tax in the 1980s, which resulted in the majority of trade in shares, bonds and options moving to London, should be taken into consideration so that we do not make the same mistake at European level."
"I consider there to be a big risk that the stabilising effects on the financial market will not be realised if the EU introduces such a tax independently."
"The risk of trade in shares, bonds and options transferring to less transparent and less open markets outside Europe is great."
"That will not create better conditions for control of the financial market."
"I therefore voted against the amendment that proposed a European Tobin tax but, in spite of the fact that this proposal was voted through, I chose to vote in favour of the report in the final vote."
"This choice was made on the basis of the fact that, as Europe 2020 negotiator for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would otherwise have risked undermining the group's negotiating position on what are, for us, important issues, such as the importance of creating a real internal market, enabling the financing of infrastructure projects by means of European project bonds, and a possible solution with regard to a European carbon tax."
"I voted in favour of this report as it defends the creation of specific instruments, such as the introduction of a financial transaction tax, which could contribute to improving the efficiency of the market, increasing transparency, reducing excessive price volatility and creating incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments, with added value for the real economy."
"We Swedish Social Democrats are very much in favour of a transaction tax at global level."
"The EU should work very actively to get such a system established."
"If an international agreement should, in time, prove to be politically impossible, the alternative of introducing a transaction tax within the EU alone should be given very careful consideration."
"It should be based on a well-balanced impact assessment."
"The Commission is currently preparing an analysis, but this has not prevented its representatives from pre-empting events on several occasions by expressing clearly negative views of a tax at EU level."
"That is unacceptable, in our opinion."
"Therefore, in order to send a clear signal to the Commission that this matter should be taken seriously and that the process must be unbiased, we have chosen to vote in favour of the amendment that talks specifically about the introduction of an EU tax."
"It is very important for an objective and thoroughly considered basis for a decision to be established with regard to this matter."
"This report deals with the need to find new forms of public sector financing at a world and European level."
"In reality, the current economic and financial crisis is requiring Member States to seek revenue to attenuate their budget crises."
"New means of financing include taxation of the financial sector and CO2 emissions."
"In recent times, the financial sector has distorted its objectives of financing the development of the economy and, with the excuse of needing to cover risks, has increased rates, immediately obtaining enormous profits that seriously affect public finances and citizens."
"Meanwhile, a tax on CO2 emissions would make the 'polluter pays' principle fairer and more consistent, contributing not only to reducing climate change, but also to financing investment projects in this area."
"I agree with having a financial transaction tax at a global level."
"I believe that its introduction at a European level should be preceded by an impact study."
"I also agree with the implementation of Eurobonds, as I believe them to be a common instrument for debt management."
"This report talks about 'innovative financing'."
"In truth, however, it does not escape from the tired old positions rejecting the most elementary justice."
"The financial market should have been effectively controlled and regulated a long time ago. A brake should have been applied on speculation a long time ago, whether it involved commodities, including food, property, benefits and pensions, or the sovereign debt of states (to give a few examples)."
"The European Commission, however, obstinately refuses to proceed with these proposals."
"This is despite knowing that financial losses caused by tax evasion and fraud in Europe are estimated to be between EUR 200 and 250 billion per year, a sum that would be sufficient to reduce public deficits without the need to increase taxes on employment - the old solution."
"It also obstinately refuses to introduce a financial transaction tax at EU level and is not pressing for its adoption at a global level."
"The same applies to the scandalous continued existence of tax havens."
"These would be ways of bringing in revenue to combat poverty and other persistent economic and social problems."
"Current estimates of revenue generated from a financial transaction tax, even at a low rate, indicate that around EUR 200 billion per year would be generated at an EU level."
"I welcome the resolution on innovative financial instruments which represents Parliament's contribution to the debate on how to generate new revenue, ensure a fair tax policy and maximise income recovery capabilities."
"I support the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT): the recent crisis - for which we can blame a certain kind of speculative finance - shows how states and citizens end up paying personally for the damage caused by others."
"A tax on financial transactions would swell the EU coffers by about EUR 200 billion each year and help curb speculative activities, making them more expensive and therefore less attractive."
"However, I believe that this tax should be established globally and not only in Europe, in order to avoid creating a competitive disadvantage to Europe itself which, let us not forget, is highly attractive being the largest global market."
"We should also all welcome Parliament's support for Eurobonds and project bonds, which will promote recovery by stimulating the real economy and encouraging the creation of infrastructures vital to the European economy."
"There has long been a need to control and effectively regulate the capital market, preventing speculation on a very wide range of products, including commodities, property transactions, benefits, pensions and insurance, as well as a whole panoply of derivatives, including speculation on sovereign debt."
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has made no progress with these proposals, when it is well known that financial losses caused by tax evasion and fraud in Europe are estimated to be between EUR 200 and 250 billion per year, which alone would be sufficient to reduce public deficits without the need to increase taxes on employment."
"However, if we also had financial transaction taxes at a world level and, therefore, also at a European Union level, as well as an end to tax havens and speculative financial products, we would have even greater sums with which to address economic and social problems."
"Current estimates of revenue generated from a financial transaction tax, even at a low rate, indicate that around EUR 200 billion per year would be generated at a European Union level."
"In the light of this, we cannot accept that a clear position on the creation of a financial transaction tax should be delayed under the pretext of further studies and assessments."
"If the financial system, responsible for reckless trading and speculation, is being held up as one of the major causes of the financial crisis, then it is right that those responsible should have to pay their share by offering the most significant economic contribution."
"I nevertheless consider the method suggested in this report will affect the precarious balance of competition by undermining its foundations, since it would have to be applied on a global scale."
"For this reason, and to avoid creating a dangerous precedent with regard to the European tax system, I do not support Mrs Podimata's report and voted against it."
"I voted for the amendments and for those parts of the text that relate to taxing financial transactions."
"In fact, I voted for the principle of making financial institutions help to shoulder the cost of the recession, for which they are responsible, and to consolidate our public finances."
"However, the problem with this report, which I voted against, is that its main aim, by way of innovation, is to create new taxes, managed, where possible, at European or global level, or at the very least with international bodies deciding who the beneficiaries will be and how the money will be used."
"Moreover, there is no guarantee that taxes on labour would be significantly reduced."
"Similarly, I can only oppose a carbon tax at every level, as it would invariably penalise the least well-off citizens, as seen with Mr Sarkozy's unjust and unpopular project."
"I also oppose the creation of a European agency responsible for issuing European bonds in order to pool public debt - this a real bonus for madmen paid for by people with more sense."
"Finally, I regret that, although the part devoted to development funding rightly castigates government corruption and tax havens, it is careful not to denounce the outrageous practices of multinational firms, and especially their use of transfer prices."
"in writing. - The report on 'innovative financing' sends a strong message to the financial institutions and, in particular, to the banking industry, that it is time to further regulate the financial sector, holding banks administratively responsible and legally accountable for their negligent actions and ineffective risk management practices."
"It has become evident that the financial services market is often incapable of regulating itself sufficiently and that the quality of consumer protection and safeguards in the financial services sector require tangible and strong improvement, particularly with regard to the monitoring and supervisory aspects."
"The current situations might be used as a window of opportunity to strengthen the financial services industry and to restore citizens' and consumers' confidence in the sector, as they are now the ones footing the bill for the big blunders and bailing out the major financial institutions."
"Having said that, the Commission should first evaluate the impact which a tax on financial transactions will have on the European economy, because any future proposals should not be based solely on decisions taken on impulse to address the buzzword of the moment, but should consist of a pragmatic approach that will prove to withstand the stresses of time and will restore the trust of the European citizens in the financial markets."
"The adoption of the Podimata report was the chance for Parliament to show unequivocal support for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at European level."
"Until now, the European right had always frustrated the proposals by the socialists on this matter, whether in parliamentary committees or in plenary sessions."
"The fact that a majority of MEPs, and hence a section of the right, have been won over by this project, which has been advocated for many years by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is good news."
"It shows that, together, we are gradually becoming aware of the merits of this project."
"This vote marks a new stage in the process of introducing a financial instrument that would serve, in particular, to generate additional own resources for the EU budget, but also to support development initiatives internationally."
"However, the fight is not over."
"For the time being, this is only a policy position."
"Beyond their statements, we must remain alert to the genuine willingness of European Heads of State or Government, a large majority of whom are right-of-centre, to introduce this tax."
"For many years, we have been fighting for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions."
"Despite the many reservations this idea has met with, the adoption of this resolution by a large majority is an important step."
"By encouraging the taxing of financial transactions internationally and, in any case, by recommending the creation of such a tax within the European Union, Parliament is laying the foundation of a new global financial order."
"On top of this, we should mention the new financial prospects that such a tax would offer, since its introduction could generate some EUR 200 billion per year."
"This vote is a great victory; it is now up to the international bodies to be as bold as the Members of the European Parliament have been."
"The taxing of financial transactions is something that the socialists and the Left in Europe have long been fighting for."
"The adoption, by a large majority, of the report by my Greek colleague, Anni Podimata, is testament to the political progress made by the European Parliament."
"This is a great victory for the European left, and one of which it can be proud."
"Although the text has no direct legislative effect, it does mark a decisive political step forward: from now on, the European right within the European Parliament will be unable to prevent the introduction of such a tax."
"This is a real step in the direction of budgetary federalism, which is the only way for the European Union to achieve its goals in terms of growth, employment and overcoming the recession."
"I agreed with this report, because one of the main advantages of innovative financing tools is that they can bring a double dividend, as they can contribute to the achievement of important policy goals, such as financial market stability and transparency, and offer significant revenue potential, but the effects of these tools on the negative externalities produced by the financial sector should also be taken into account."
"I agree with the provision and the call for innovative financing measures to raise more from this sector and contribute to shifting the burden of taxation away from working people."
"This would have the potential to improve market efficiency, increase transparency and reduce speculation, even out excessive price volatility, create incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments with added value for the real economy, as well as help to finance global public goods and reduce public deficits."
"I support the idea of issuing common European project bonds to finance Europe's significant infrastructure needs and structural projects within the framework of the Europe 2020 agenda and anticipated new EU strategies, such as the new strategy on energy infrastructure development, and other large-scale projects."
"EU project bonds would thus secure the investment required, would attract the support they need, and would become an important mechanism for maximum leverage of public support."
"These projects must also contribute to the ecological transformation of our economies, paving the way for the zero carbon economy."
"in writing. - (LV) A new financial transaction tax will not solve European Union Member States' budgetary problems."
"That is why I did not support the report on innovative financing at the global and European level."
"Contrary to what some people believe, it will not be banks that pay such a tax, but their customers, the same old taxpayers therefore."
"At a time of economic recovery, we should not be introducing new taxes; instead, we must reduce government expenditure."
"A new tax would only serve to conceal governments' inability to reduce expenditure, and not have the desired effect."
"The report put to the vote in Parliament today relates to the introduction of innovative financial instruments."
"I wanted to support the resolution with my vote because the economic crisis of recent years has highlighted the lack of regulation and the need to create new financial instruments that can resolve major financial speculations."
"This EU action will therefore be able to unequivocally re-establish the necessity of responding to the needs of the real economy by supporting long-term investment and creating new additional resources to face up to and win major global and European challenges, achieving growth and development objectives under the EU 2020 strategy."
"The dramatic increase in financial transactions has revealed the growing gap between finance and the real economy."
"The introduction of a tax on financial transactions, the issuance of common European bonds and the anticipation of a carbon tax, are some of the proposals geared to the creation of new processes, which are needed for our economy but must not, however, have a negative impact on the most vulnerable consumers."
"I very much welcome the result of the vote on the report on innovative financing at a global and European level."
"Two matters of key importance were covered in this report, namely, the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds."
"These could be important sources of funding to increase the EU's financial and economic capabilities, enabling it to implement large and strategically important projects, including transport and energy projects, and also possibly facilitating the mobilisation of private capital."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been calling for a similar solution for some time."
"I am pleased that a clear majority has voted in favour of introducing these innovative solutions."
"The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years."
"This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today."
"The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax."
"It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when?"
"We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train."
"At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study."
"One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax."
"It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present."
"The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market."
"We cannot accept this carbon tax."
"This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies."
"Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax."
"We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax."
"I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe."
"In recent years, the global economic and financial crisis has exposed major weaknesses in the global financial system's regulatory and supervisory framework."
"Financial transactions are typified by a hefty increase in volume and by a noticeable disparity between the volume of financial transactions and the needs of the real economy."
"Short-term investments, which predominate, have led to excessive volatility and risk-taking."
"Short-term speculative transactions were at the heart of the crisis and have underlined the clear connection between inefficient financial regulation and supervision and the sustainability of public finances."
"I voted for this report because the problems caused by this market behaviour have had a major impact on public finances, European citizens and beyond."
"The report intends to create tools designed to reduce speculation, guarantee a fair distribution of the burden between the key financial players and create new additional resources to meet the major challenges."
"Tax evasion and fraud are currently estimated to cost EU Member States approximately EUR 250 billion a year."
"The novel element is the tax on financial transactions, which would generate revenues of approximately EUR 200 billion per year for the EU and would discourage speculative transactions."
"in writing. - In voting for this report, Euro MPs are responding to the public's call for fair taxation of the financial sector."
"The financial sector is largely exempt from VAT and is under-taxed, while ordinary citizens have faced the costs of the financial crisis, including contributing EUR 9 500 in government support from every man, woman and child in the EU."
"In this vote, MEPs have backed the hundreds of thousands of campaigners who are actively working for a Robin Hood Tax - a tiny tax on financial transactions that can raise billions to meet priorities at home and our commitments to fighting poverty and climate change internationally."
"Global agreement would be the best way to introduce such a tax, but the UK's stamp duty on shares demonstrates it is possible to introduce a successful, well-designed financial transaction tax (FTT) without undermining competitiveness."
"An EU-wide coordinated FTT would be the first step towards a global FTT."
"It is time for action and the EU can lead this campaign for global fairer taxation."
"in writing. - Labour Euro MPs are responding to the public's call for fair taxation of the financial sector."
"The financial sector is largely exempt from VAT and is under-taxed, while ordinary citizens have faced the costs of the financial crisis, including contributing EUR 9 500 in government support from every man, woman and child in the EU."
"In this vote, Labour Euro MPs have backed the hundreds of thousands of campaigners who are actively working for a Robin Hood Tax - a tiny tax on financial transactions that can raise billions to meet priorities at home and our commitments to fighting poverty and climate change internationally."
"Global agreement would be the best way to introduce such a tax, but the UK's stamp duty on shares demonstrates it is possible to introduce a successful, well-designed financial transaction tax (FTT) without undermining competitiveness."
"An EU-wide coordinated FTT would be the first step towards a global FTT."
"It is time for action and the EU can lead this campaign for global fairer taxation."
"The idea of a tax on financial transactions has been advocated by the Left for years."
"This idea is today the subject of a consensus."
"This concession to our views is welcome."
"Nevertheless, a tax on financial transactions should be aimed solely at promoting the general interest of the people, not the smooth operation of free trade or of the pollution rights trading that some - and indeed this text - call the 'carbon market'."
"I shall vote against this crude hijacking of what was a good idea."
"Despite agreeing with a large part of the content of this report, I could not vote in favour of it since it advocates the introduction of a financial transaction tax (at a global, or at least European, level), although it admits that the consequences of doing so need to be studied (proposing an a posteriori study for this)."
"The party that I represent has always fought against the introduction of such a financial transaction tax in Portugal, in the light of the detrimental effect it could have on the financial markets."
"Portugal is exhausted and unable to deal with further tax burdens, given that in the end, this tax would be borne by the citizens, as the financial institutions would pass it on to their customers."
"The introduction of such a tax only at a European level could lead to other markets gaining competitive advantages in relation to European financial markets."
"in writing. - (ES) I have voted in favour of the Podimata report regarding innovative financing on a global and European scale as it introduces an idea that has been one of the pillars of the Left in the world: the introduction of a financial transaction tax."
"The text could certainly be much braver and not make this tax dependent upon the creation of a similar tax at global level."
"My political organisation has always advocated the need to create a tax on world capital flow, such as the so-called 'Tobin tax'."
"For this reason, although the proposal made in the report seems insufficient to me, I believe it is a step in the right direction."
"With the global economic and monetary crisis of 2007, we were able to observe the major weaknesses of the global financial system's regulatory and supervision framework."
"I spearheaded the fight within the European Parliament for innovative financing by setting up a working group on the feasibility of a tax on international transactions."
"I am convinced that such a tax would not only allow for better regulation of the financial sector by restricting purely speculative activity, but would also help the poorest, particularly developing countries, and the least developed countries among them, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to take the measures necessary to adapt to climate change."
"A tax on financial transactions at European level could potentially generate around EUR 200 billion of revenue per year in the Union and close to USD 650 billion per year globally."
"If we made consistent progress at European level by applying a tax on international financial transactions, we would preserve the strong message we sent in December 2010 when we adopted the recommendation entitled 'the financial, economic and social crisis: recommendations concerning measures and initiatives to be taken'."
"in writing. - The adoption of this report would be the first strong signal by Parliament in favour of a financial transaction tax at a time when the Commission has an ambiguous approach, both showing a willingness to regulate financial actors but exempting them from taxation."
"It is necessary to point to the hypocritical discourse of some right-wing leaders, calling for a form of taxation of the financial sector, but only at global level, where we all know it is most unlikely to be implemented."
"The Commission should give a precise and clear signal about the fact that the transaction tax must be paid by everyone."
"The situation where farmers pay tax while financiers do not is not acceptable."
"Social injustice gives birth to malice and permissiveness converts government institutions into a sandpit created by banks."
"I voted 'for'."
"The introduction of a financial transaction tax is a step in the right direction and would mainly affect hedge funds and similar products, which would seem to be of very little benefit to the real economy."
"It is doubtless right for Europe to take the lead here - after all, we would have to wait indefinitely if we were to try to bring the Americans on board too."
"However, a financial transaction tax should not be used as an opportunity to introduce an EU tax by the back door."
"Unfortunately, however, Mrs Podimata's report takes us in precisely that direction."
"Fiscal sovereignty must remain with the Member States."
"If Brussels cannot manage on the money it gets, then it needs to tighten its belt."
"There are enough powers already that could be better regulated at a national level than at EU level."
"The other calls contained in the report, namely for the introduction of Eurobonds and a carbon tax, should be rejected."
"On the one hand, Eurobonds are a product that goes against all economic sense, while on the other, fiscally prudent euro area countries are once again unfairly required to pay the price."
"The EU would simply become a transfer union."
"Also, a carbon tax with dubious objectives would damage Europe's economy and destroy jobs and would thus have a negative impact on most people."
"For this reason, the report should be rejected."
"I voted against this report because, while the idea of a contribution by the financial system, which is greatly to blame for the crisis of the last two years, seems right, the way it is implemented leaves me very puzzled."
"I must say that I welcome the proposal for the creation of Eurobonds, which I believe can be a useful tool, but I have more problems with the bulk of the report, which is on the introduction of a tax on financial transactions."
"I think it is too risky to apply this only to one level of the European Union, as it might make the entire EU financial system uncompetitive, and operators could get around it without too much difficulty by focusing on other markets."
"Also, I would not want this tax to pave the way for the creation of a potential centralised EU tax system, which is something to which I would be totally opposed."
"Until now, the European taxpayer has borne the main financial brunt of the economic crisis."
"It is therefore important that other instruments should be used to ensure that the players and speculators in the financial markets shoulder some of the responsibility."
"This is only fair."
"However, a financial transaction tax should not be used as an excuse for the introduction of direct taxation from Brussels."
"This would erode the fiscal sovereignty and general sovereignty of the Member States."
"This report reveals tendencies in this direction, which is why I have voted against it."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on innovative financing at global and European level."
"Europe, with the world's largest financial market, is gradually trying to get back on its feet following the crisis, the effects of which will be felt for many years to come."
"Consequently, it is crucial to establish innovative financing measures which would ensure financial stability and transparency."
"Currently, the majority of financial services are exempt from VAT."
"Therefore, significant revenue is being lost through the financial sector and the tax burden is increasing for working people."
"I believe that the tax on financial transactions is an effective financing measure that would help reduce speculation and public deficits."
"Having properly assessed its possible negative impact on the EU's global competitiveness, we must make every effort to ensure that it is also applied at global level."
"Furthermore, in order to increase the GDP of all countries, it would be advisable to establish a tax on bank assets which would be proportionate to the systemic significance of the credit institution concerned and to the level of risk involved in an activity."
"I agree with the proposal on issuing European project bonds which, as a common debt management instrument, will help to attract increased investment in European infrastructure projects."
"Furthermore, in order to obtain maximum benefit from the application of the carbon tax, it is necessary to set the minimum mandatory requirements for all Member States, preventing overwhelming burdens from being shifted to low income consumers."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's own-initiative report on innovative financing at a global and European level."
"The financial crisis and the debt crisis have revealed the gaps in the operation and control of the financial sector today."
"The introduction of a tax on global financial transactions is not a new proposal and it is certainly an unpopular proposal in all the developed countries without exception, especially in those which apply low taxation policies."
"Nonetheless, if global agreement proves impossible, the introduction of a financial transaction tax in the EU, if it does not damage its competitiveness, will help to improve how this particular sector operates and, at the same time, will generate important public revenue."
"This is the thrust of Amendment 2, which I voted in favour of."
"This report relates to innovative means of financing at a world and European level."
"It outlines measures for dealing with the serious deficiencies in the regulatory and supervisory framework for the world financial system revealed by the global economic and financial crisis of 2007-2009."
"Financial transactions are currently characterised by an enormous increase in volume and a substantial discrepancy between the volume of financial transactions and the needs associated with them in the 'real world'."
"New trading patterns, such as short-term investment and automated high-frequency trading, which have taken a central role within global financial trends and led to excessive volatility and risk taking, merit the attention of those in government."
"These are sufficient reasons for the European Parliament, within the framework of its remit, to make its contribution and indicate the measures it believes to be appropriate to resolve the current situation."
"The report on innovative financing addresses a number of important aspects, such as the importance of creating a real internal market as a basis for European growth, the importance of enabling the financing of European infrastructure projects by means of European project bonds, as well as a possible solution with regard to a European carbon tax so that we can switch to sustainable production in Europe."
"The fact that the report points out that the EU Member States must meet the aid targets that have been set is also important."
"We nevertheless chose to abstain in the final vote because we do not believe that it is a good idea for Europe to introduce a financial transaction tax independently if other countries do not also do the same."
"We believe that the Swedish example of the unilateral introduction of a kind of financial transaction tax in the 1980s, which resulted in the majority of trade in shares, bonds and options moving to London, should be taken into consideration so that we do not make the same mistake at European level."
"We consider there to be a big risk that the stabilising effects that we hope a financial transaction tax will have on the financial market will not be realised if the EU introduces such a tax independently."
"The risk of trade in shares, bonds and options transferring instead to less transparent and less open markets outside Europe is great."
"That will not create better conditions for control of the financial market and it would also undermine the joint European supervision of the financial market that we have put in place."
"In order to tackle the global financial crisis and the major recession resulting from it, several governments have increased sovereign debt to unsustainable levels, with the aim of rescuing financial companies and stimulating their respective economies."
"At the same time, banks are accumulating profits through the differential between loans obtained from central banks at an interest rate of almost nil and the price at which they grant credit to customers and to states."
"Thus, it is a moral imperative for financial businesses to shoulder their responsibilities in the face of the crisis that they caused."
"A financial transaction tax is the least that can be demanded."
"To those seeking to delay this accountability, on the pretext that such a tax can only be introduced at a global level, I would say: (1) that the EU's position would be greatly strengthened by the unilateral launching of this tax; (2) if a proportion of the capital applied in speculative transactions were to leave the EU, this would result in a reduction in the volatility of the financial markets, which would be beneficial; (3) if global financial regulation is not viable or advisable, sensible rules on the circulation of capital will be needed."
"The report is a step in this direction."
"I voted in favour of the report because it is high time for the EU to take the lead and to introduce a financial transaction tax at European level."
"I believe that if we take this first step, it will increase the likelihood of achieving the objective of a worldwide financial transaction tax."
"The amendment proposed by my group calling for the introduction of a financial transaction tax at EU level without further delay (such as the carrying out of more studies) was passed by a narrow majority."
"I would now call on the responsible Commissioner, Mr Šemeta, finally to take action."
"The resolution was passed with a broad majority of 529 votes in favour, 127 votes against and 18 abstentions."
"This is a strong signal from Parliament that cannot be ignored by the Commission or reinterpreted on flimsy grounds."
"I call on President Barroso to take action, to exercise the Commission's right to take the initiative, and to present a draft proposal to us, the legislature."
"A total of EUR 200 billion could be collected in this way - funds that are sorely needed and that should be contributed by those who caused the crisis."
"We should not turn to the taxpayers to make up for the deficits caused by the financial crisis, but instead should demand that the private sector finally pays its way."
"This money should be used both for budgetary consolidation and as a separate source of revenue for the EU budget."
"in writing. - The European Parliament today reiterated the call for the introduction of an EU-level financial transaction tax, as part of a report on innovative financing adopted by MEPs."
"The Greens have long called for the introduction of a financial transaction tax and welcomed the vote, with Green MEP Philippe Lamberts commenting: 'The EP has kept the pressure on for the introduction of a financial transaction tax at EU-level."
"While the ultimate goal should be to introduce a global FTT, there are clear benefits for the EU to push ahead on its own."
"MEPs have today urged the Commission to take steps to this end."
"The Greens have long championed the introduction of a financial transaction tax both as a means of curbing harmful speculation and as a new source for generating public revenue."
"As well as being a potentially significant source of revenue at a time when national exchequers are under strain, a financial transaction tax is socially just."
"A FTT would also clearly address the systemic risk emanating from high-frequency trading, acting as a disincentive for risky speculation."
"It is time for the Commission and Member States to stop stalling'."
"The recent economic crisis has laid bare the shortcomings of the system for regulating and supervising global finance."
"All too often, the volume of these transactions has far exceeded the needs of the real world, causing speculation which, over time, has made the capital involved extremely volatile and at risk of insolvency."
"The first to take the brunt have been taxpayers, also in terms of rising unemployment, dwindling incomes, reduced access to social services and increasing inequalities."
"To prevent future crises, the EU now needs to promote real changes in regulation and supervision, giving shape to a more healthy and robust financial environment."
"The idea of a levy on financial transactions has important advantages, especially in the aftermath of a crisis like the present one: stabilising the markets, providing incentives for long-term investment and ensuring traceability for the auditing of individual transactions."
"Curbing speculation, supporting long-term investment and achieving greater long-term growth under the EU 2020 strategy: it is important to complement all this by introducing a similar system of financing outside the European Union as well, in order not to give rise to competitive disadvantages against us."
"In today's vote, we saw support for the report concerning innovative financing in the world and in Europe."
"The only part that was not supported was the proposal calling on the Commission to investigate the feasibility of the EU's carbon tax, which, like VAT, will be introduced onto the internal market for each product."
"I am pleased to note that there was support for the main points calling on the Commission to investigate the feasibility and practicality of various new taxes and the consequences resulting from them."
"With the bank taxes, taxes on financial activity and taxes on financial transactions, everyone has their own economic objective, and their potential for bringing in income differs, so it is important that, before imposing additional taxes, an in-depth analysis is carried out."
"There was support for the idea under consideration that, if a financial transaction tax is imposed, it should be introduced as widely as possible."
"At the same time, Members of Parliament, including myself, asked for clarity on who will ultimately pay this tax, because the tax burden usually falls on the customer, which, in this case, would be retail investors and individuals. Thank you."
"in writing. - I supported the Podimata report which includes a number of good ideas regarding a global financial transaction tax."
"The truth is that much of the financial sector, particularly the investment banks, has still to reform itself following the flaws that were revealed by the financial crisis."
"Even the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, admitted last week that the cost of the austerity measures being taken in Britain, and across Europe, were being borne by 'people who were utterly blameless' while the financial sector had gone back to a 'business as usual' mentality."
"It is right that the private sector should pay its share for the consequences of the financial crisis and provide for any future bail-out given the existence of many banks which are still deemed 'too big to fail'."
"The onus is now on the IMF, and the European Commission, to assess the positives and negatives of a global financial transactions tax."
"in writing. - During today's vote on the Podimata report on innovative financing, a separate amendment was voted on that called on the Commission to come forward with proposals for an EU-level financial transaction tax proposal in the absence of any initiatives at the G20 level."
"I voted in favour of the amendment for the purposes of group solidarity and because I believe that clear support for the concept of an FTT from Europe may spur further discussions at the G20."
"However, I am very clear that the introduction of an FTT at EU level, if not also implemented globally, raises potential risks to the UK's competitive position as a financial centre, which has a clear impact on citizens in South-East England."
"I am very wary of an EU-only FTT and believe that any proposal must be rigorously impact-assessed to ensure that the positive impacts outweigh the downsides for my constituents."
"Prior to the result of such an impact assessment, I flatly reject proposals for a blanket 0.05% FTT on all financial transactions as being arbitrary and ill thought-out."
"I voted against the report, as it does not guarantee that a tax on financial transactions would be used for the purpose for which a true Tobin tax should be used, namely, developing countries and investments in the climate."
"The report is unclear about whether the tax will accrue to the EU's budgets, which opens up the possibility of more problems."
"Firstly, I am fundamentally opposed to increasing the EU's own resources."
"Secondly, we will be wasting an opportunity to have a genuine Tobin tax if the EU has the right of disposal of the tax - see the Commission's proposal that the tax should finance EU projects and gaps in the EU budget."
"My vote should not be construed as opposition to a tax on financial transactions in the EU."
"I fully support a genuine Tobin tax."
"I also support the positive elements of the report, such as the fight against tax fraud, the 'polluter pays' principle and the call for energy efficiency."
"Today, I once again voted in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) and agreed that, if we fail to impose an FTT at a global level, the EU should take the first step, anyway."
"We have to take advantage of this momentum and restrain the greed of the financial and banking sectors."
"After all, a global crisis requires global solutions and Europe, as the largest financial market, can play a pioneering role in this regard."
"A financial transaction tax could provide Member States with sufficient revenue to balance their budgets and keep their economies going."
"Because the revenue potential of an FTT of 0.05% amounts to nearly EUR 200 billion in the EU and USD 650 billion globally, this tax could also form an important part of the solution in the search for new and sustainable sources of income."
"An FTT could limit speculation and stabilise markets, create incentives for long-term investments and, because each transaction is traceable, it could increase transparency and ensure that financial players accept their share of the cost of the crisis."
"Moreover, the report calls for the possibilities of issuing Eurobonds and imposing a CO2 tax to be examined in greater detail."
"in writing. - In contrast to my Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal colleagues, I have supported this report which addresses a variety of possible financing sources including a Financial Transactions Tax."
"It also calls for a debate on the use of revenue which could come from a FTT."
"I strongly supported the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at global level during the vote on the report on innovative financing at global and European level."
"However, the possibility of applying such a tax exclusively at European level should first be the subject of a feasibility study by the European Commission."
"Indeed, we should establish whether this tax could be implemented at European level without having adverse effects on European competitiveness internationally."
"The economic and financial crisis has revealed serious deficiencies in the regulatory and supervisory framework of the global financial system."
"Responses need to be provided to the crisis through new instruments that can put a brake on speculation, restore the role of the financial sector, ensure an equitable distribution of the burdens, and create new, additional resources for facing global challenges, such as climate change, development goals and intelligent, sustainable, inclusive growth within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This own-initiative report is the result of a desire to find new, innovative sources of financing."
"Taxation instruments based on the receipt of income are not considered to be sufficient."
"The document examines the following possibilities for innovative financing: taxation of the financial sector, Eurobonds and taxation of the energy sector."
"In my view, it is essential to innovate in terms of alternative means of financing that are equal to today's challenges and in line with the modern world, but it is inadvisable to do this without first studying its real impact."
"Just as important as increasing income is bolstering the regulatory role of the market, creating mechanisms to strengthen its transparency, efficiency and stability."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the document during the plenary session."
"The report is an insult to the intelligence of the working classes and the grassroots classes, which are suffering under the barbaric war unleashed on them by capital and its political representatives."
"It clarifies from the outset that there can be no question of taxing capital: 'emphasises that an increase in the rates and the scope of existing taxation ... can be neither a sufficient nor a sustainable solution'."
"However, in order to deceive the workers, it calls on the EU to adopt a 'financial transaction tax' of 0.01%, which is presented as an allegedly 'fair distribution of the burden' of the crisis between capital and the workers and an effort to limit speculation by capital."
"At the same time, direct taxation on poor grassroots classes is being increased and indirect taxation, which literally eats into working class and grassroots incomes, is being pushed through the roof."
"The financial transaction tax is not a tax on the financial sector; it is another indirect tax."
"Alongside this new indirect tax, a whole series of so-called 'innovative financing' measures, or rather new taxes on grassroots incomes, is also proposed, such as a 'carbon tax', a 'solidarity contribution on air tickets', even a 'global lottery' to combat hunger."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against this particular report, underlining that the only popular way out of the capitalist crisis is to target the profits of the monopolies."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report."
"In my opinion, Mrs Podimata's report is very well balanced and very well explained, and I welcome the four financial instruments introduced by the report."
"The four measures are all innovative and I would like to stress that this is not solely about the issue of a financial transaction tax."
"We should be careful in choosing which instruments to implement: in my opinion, we should exclude tax on sectors - such as the energy sector - which have a multiplying effect on living costs."
"Thus, for the final phase of this issue, the Commission should conduct an evaluation through an impact assessment of the efficiency and potential results of using these instruments."
"The report contains some good ideas, for example, a financial transaction tax of just 0.05% that would net EUR 200 billion for the EU's budget."
"At present, we are failing to benefit from this money, which would simply make speculation harder, but not impossible."
"The exciting question is what the Council of Ministers will do with this own-initiative report."
"We still have a long journey ahead of us."
"in writing. - With citizens across the EU facing a growing bill for the financial crisis, the measures included in this report have the potential to raise billions of euro and alleviate some of the pressure on families in these challenging financial circumstances."
"A tiny tax on financial transactions will be able to be put to use to fight poverty in the UK and across the world and mitigate the effects of climate change."
"Campaigners for this so-called Robin Hood tax, including Labour MEPs, now need to expand on their success and continue to put pressure on the global financial sector to expand this scheme to create a worldwide Financial Transaction Tax."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which is aimed at encouraging innovative financing by means of a tax on financial transactions, increasing the economy's recovery capacities, and promoting the transition to green growth while maintaining aid to developing countries."
"The economic crisis showed, very forcefully, the vital importance of establishing global financial governance to ensure that we are no longer subject to the vagaries of unbridled financial capitalism."
"This is what the French Presidency of the G20 wants, and we must do all we can to achieve that objective."
"Financial speculation, encouraged by the lack of rules and supervision, has destroyed millions of jobs, seriously affected public finances and considerably reduced living standards for a large majority of Europeans."
"It is time to move on from this short-term vision of the economy, where money is all-important and irresponsibility is everywhere, and which led us to the edge of the abyss, so that the financial system can resume its role of serving the real economy and the people."
"The European Union should set an example in this regard, and the resolution adopted by this House sends a strong signal to our partners."
"I have voted in favour of the report by Mrs Podimata on innovative financing at global and European level."
"Until now, only the European taxpayer has borne the brunt of the financial and economic crisis in 2007 and subsequent years."
"This is the first report to consider a variety of innovative mechanisms designed to ensure that players in the financial markets also carry some of the costs."
"The proposal for a financial transaction tax at global level, if possible, is to be welcomed and a similar scheme at EU level should be seriously considered as an alternative."
"The great advantage of this tax is not just the potential income from a sector that has had little or no tax levied in the past, but also the simultaneous regulating effect."
"It is a well-known fact that the financial sector, which is frequently built on speculation, has become divorced from the real economy."
"By taxing the financial sector, we could generate incentives for longer term investments again, thus considering the needs of the real economy."
"I am voting in favour of this report because the importance of reducing inequalities in the area of health is intrinsically linked to the reduction of social inequalities, as pointed out in this report."
"Health inequalities begin at an early age and continue throughout life, and they also reproduce themselves in other generations."
"In light of this, Member States need to adopt the principle of 'health in all policies'."
"In addition to this, I strongly support the rapporteur's recommendations defending the need to promote universal access to health, including for undocumented migrants, and access to welfare protection for pregnant women in line with legislation in their own countries."
"Edite Estrela's report serves to review the health inequalities that exist within the European Union and the measures that need to be taken to reduce them."
"Thus, it is a useful report and one for which I voted, not least to reaffirm the inviolable nature of the right to abortion and the need for easy access to methods of contraception, at a time when these rights are not yet effective in all the Member States of the European Union."
"The march towards equality goes on."
"There are very significant health inequalities between countries and regions in the European Union."
"Due to the economic and financial crisis, some Member States have taken austerity measures leading to a reduction in the level of funding for public health, disease prevention and long-term care services."
"Not all EU citizens have access to quality health services."
"This is particularly true in the EU's poorer regions, where patients do not have access to quality healthcare and treatment services."
"Major disparities exist both in reimbursement for medication and the treatment of individual complex diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, which prevents the patients of some Member States from obtaining reimbursable medication and the treatment they need in their country."
"I believe that the European Commission must take measures to reduce disparities and inequality of access to quality healthcare services faced by people in the EU and establish mechanisms to monitor inequalities in health."
"The Commission should also present an initiative, aimed at encouraging and supporting the development by Member States of integrated national or regional strategies to reduce health inequalities."
"European citizens enjoy longer and healthier lives today."
"Despite average health levels within the European Union having improved over time, health disparities still exist between Member States and within Member States in Europe."
"On account of the current economic, financial and social crisis, these disparities are tending to increase."
"As the shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I pointed out the need to seek solutions."
"These will necessarily involve all participants: the European Union, national governments, regional and local authorities, and operators within the social economy."
"The challenges facing the European Union, the result of demographic changes, require a concrete plan for combating health inequalities in rural areas."
"Strengthening the mechanism for recognising qualifications will facilitate the circulation of skills within the EU and the mobility of professionals."
"Campaigns promoting healthy lifestyles and prevention and screening programmes directed at specific groups are also important for reducing health inequalities."
"For all of the above reasons, I supported this report."
"At a time when we are still fully feeling the social effects of the economic and financial crisis in our respective European societies, it was important to vote today for Mrs Estrela's report on reducing health inequalities."
"Indeed, this report is a reminder that inequalities also affect health services and that it is important to act on the fundamental causes of those inequalities so that all European citizens can at last enjoy their fundamental social rights."
"Citizens are not equal, whether in terms of life expectancy, poverty or social exclusion, and they are not all exposed to health risks."
"The report also mentions undocumented migrants, who often face tremendous difficulty in accessing health services in host countries."
"Hence, we invite the Member States to improve access to healthcare for all, whether citizens or not, and call on them to further coordinate their national health policies."
"Indeed, access to high quality healthcare is one of the most fundamental rights and should therefore be a priority both for the Union and for the Member States, which still have jurisdiction in this area."
"In the European Union, there are significant health inequalities and measures to tackle these inequalities also vary widely within Member States."
"Since I believe that these differences in health matters can have a considerable influence on individuals throughout their lifetime, they pose a problem to be tackled with determination and with an innovative political outlook."
"This report contains very interesting solutions for acknowledging the specific right to health of citizens, in particular, by focusing both on training the population and on health service coverage."
"The social consequences of the recent economic and financial crisis are obvious: since the crisis began, the number of jobless people has increased by 5 million, many households have been affected by the recession and are now more at risk of poverty or a situation of excessive indebtedness."
"I think it is essential that reducing these inequalities should be considered a priority at all levels of decision making."
"I also call on the Commission to give them greater recognition in the EU 2020 strategy and to ensure that the objective of reducing health inequalities is fully taken into account in future initiatives."
"I voted in favour of this report because health inequalities are a problem that needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency."
"They start early in life and persist not only into old age but subsequent generations."
"Inequalities experienced in earlier life in access to education, employment and healthcare, as well as those based on gender and cultural background, can have a critical bearing on the health status of people throughout their lives."
"Furthermore, poverty and social exclusion have a significant impact on the state of health."
"The reasons for these differences in health are, in many cases, avoidable and unjust."
"In order to tackle health inequalities, specific measures need to be taken, particularly as regards the most vulnerable groups."
"It is essential that the reduction of health inequalities is considered an essential priority, ensuring effective impact assessments in the area of health."
"The crisis has hit healthcare services hard in several EU Member States in terms of both supply and demand."
"On the supply side, the economic and financial crisis has resulted in a fall in the level of funds allocated to public health and healthcare services, and in the long term too, as a result of budget cuts and lower revenues obtained from the collection of taxes."
"On the other hand, the demand for healthcare services has risen in the long term as well, as a result of a combination of factors contributing to the deterioration in the population's state of health in general."
"Several Member States have included as part of their recovery packages measures to alleviate the effects of the economic crisis on healthcare services, by investing in the health service's infrastructure, making optimum use of the funds allocated to healthcare services, as well as by restructuring and reorganising the healthcare system."
"However, there are large discrepancies in Member States in terms of measures adopted to combat inequalities."
"Access is a key issue in the case of all public services."
"Gathering and exchanging evidence on effective strategies, policies and measures will help obtain support at administrative level and in different sectors."
"I agree with the assertion of the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, that enormous health disparities exist both between people who live in different regions of the EU and between more advantaged and less advantaged population groups."
"These inequalities tend to begin at birth and persist into old age, influenced throughout life by access to education, employment and healthcare, and may be exacerbated by differences based on gender and race."
"It is essential to reduce the size of the existing disparities, which jeopardise the commitments made by the EU with regard to solidarity, social and economic cohesion, human rights and equality of opportunity, as a result of which this is one of the priority actions within the 2008-2013 EU strategy for health."
"However, it is important to recognise that health policy is the responsibility of the Member States, together with the establishment of respective systems for people to access healthcare."
"The report describes several interesting measures, but does not examine their financial impact."
"I am also unhappy with the introduction of the question of abortion, which is part of a national and not European remit."
"The principles of universality, access to high quality care, equity and solidarity must become a reality within the health systems of the European Union."
"That is why the European Parliament, by a large majority, adopted the Estrela report."
"Many inequalities can still be seen in the health systems of the 27 Member States."
"MEPs have therefore called for universal access to affordable healthcare to be improved."
"Basic care must be less expensive and access to medicines more affordable."
"Inequalities between different social and age groups must be reduced."
"Member States should improve the effectiveness of their health expenditure, focus on prevention, and offer targeted programmes for the most vulnerable groups."
"This is what MEPs are asking the European Commission and the governments of the Member States to do, in order to ensure a health standard in Europe that is worthy of the European social model that we want."
"I was anxious to support Edite Estrela's report on reducing health inequalities between the countries of the European Union, but also within them."
"This is simply because it mentions a very wide range of the persistent inequalities in this area within the Union."
"These inequalities, which are unfair, are the product of numerous economic, environmental and lifestyle factors, but also of difficulties in accessing healthcare, be it for economic reasons or because of 'poor distribution of medical resources' in certain areas of the Union."
"Although health policy remains (for the most part) a national responsibility, we MEPs have a duty to encourage our Member States to continue their efforts to reduce socio-economic inequalities, thereby also reducing disparities in healthcare."
"Member States must ensure that vulnerable groups (the disabled, the elderly, migrants...and women!) really can enjoy fair access to healthcare."
"A special focus is also needed on health prevention and information, in coordination with organisations from civil society."
"Despite the fact that the report contains provisions that I consider to be of great relevance on the growing importance of healthcare provision for the elderly and the need to improve knowledge of diseases that affect older people in particular, in general, it says little that is new."
"In fact, by trying to mention everything, it ends up being a 'wish list', to which the rapporteur has added, on the pretext of 'reducing health inequalities', issues as diverse - and unconnected to equality of access to healthcare - as domestic violence, investigation of the pharmaceutical sector, and the policies of the Member States with regard to the voluntary interruption of pregnancy and access to fertility treatment for homosexuals."
"I do not believe this to be the arena where these issues should be dealt with."
"We know that access to abortion and medically assisted reproduction for homosexual couples are controversial issues within the Member States, and only the Member States can freely make decisions about them."
"For this reason as well, I cannot vote in favour of the report."
"Health and life expectancy are intimately linked to social conditions."
"It is essential that the reduction of inequalities be considered a fundamental priority at all levels of political activity, in pursuit of the 'health in all policies' strategy and ensuring that effective impact assessments are conducted."
"Inequalities persist, as shown by the fact that, in 2007, life expectancy at birth showed a variation of 14.2 years between EU Member States for men, and 8.3 years for women."
"There is a need to improve universal access to health systems and healthcare that is financially accessible to all."
"It is important to improve access to disease prevention and health promotion, as well as to primary and specialist health services, and to reduce inequalities between different social groups."
"However, I did not vote in favour of the report as I do not agree with paragraph 29, which, and I quote, 'calls on the EU and the Member States to take the necessary measures, in relation to access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART), to eliminate discrimination against women on the grounds of marital status, age, sexual orientation or ethnic or cultural origins'."
"The report contains a set of guidelines that we consider to be valid and fair."
"However, there are some comments that we need to make."
"The so-called austerity policies, which are profoundly anti-social in essence and in content, with cuts in public investment and the social functions of the state - specifically with regard to health - among other consequences that are extremely detrimental from an economic and social point of view, are also exacerbating inequalities in the area of health."
"When, in the name of the need to reduce the budget deficit, the cost of accessing public health services increases, medicine prices increase, even for chronic illnesses, due to cuts in state subsidies, and support for patient transport to treatment and healthcare appointments is removed in areas where there is no public transport, health inequalities will increase, as is happening at the moment in Portugal."
"The effect of this is that people on lower incomes have increasing difficulty in accessing healthcare."
"Rather than mere words, what is needed is a real change in the content of policies."
"Neoliberal policies need to be dispensed with, and effective equality of opportunity guaranteed, not least in terms of access to healthcare."
"This report tackles a set of important questions, but it does not go to the heart of the problems that are currently being caused by austerity policies and anti-social policies that are increasing inequalities in the area of health."
"Words are therefore not enough!"
"Neoliberal policies need to be dispensed with, and top priority given to prevention and public health, in order to guarantee effective equality of opportunity in access to healthcare."
"The Stability Pact needs to be dispensed with in order to prevent the cost of accessing public health services increasing, medicine prices increasing, even for chronic illnesses, and support for patient transport to treatment and healthcare appointments being removed, even in areas where there is no public transport, all in the name of the need to reduce the budget deficit."
"We know that the result of these policies is an increase in health-related inequalities, as is currently happening in Portugal."
"People on lower incomes are having increasing difficulty in accessing healthcare."
"Therefore, rather than fine words, what is needed is a break and change in policies, in order to give priority to respect for human rights and to economic and social cohesion."
"We are bound to acknowledge that this report contains a number of very interesting points with regard to recognising the right to health in the real sense (access to care, training of the population, service coverage, etc.)."
"We cannot, however, help but express some reservations stemming from contradictions inherent in the document itself, which have triggered a wide debate."
"Equality should be understood in a real sense and not by isolating individuals (especially women) from their relationships with their partners, children and the social context in which sexuality and reproductive ability are actually exercised."
"I am also concerned about the proclamation of 'new rights', such as the 'right to safe abortion', because that statement reduces or even nullifies the rights of others (father's expectations or life expectancy of the unborn)."
"Similarly, we can highlight some shortcomings such as the document's complete failure to mention professional operators: it says nothing about their role and their responsibilities, they are treated as automatons and not as professionals with their own skills, abilities and, above all, their own personal consciences."
"This report contains some outrageous proposals. For example, it aims to 'enable' healthcare staff to 'adopt an intercultural approach based on respect for diversity' when treating their immigrant patients."
"Furthermore, it aims to eliminate discrimination regarding access to assisted reproductive technology - particularly discrimination based on age or sexual orientation - while, at the same time, claiming that we must promote universal access to abortion."
"The predominant theme here is a synthesis of the culture of death and a reversal of values."
"Finally, it aims to make all Member States establish the equivalent of State medical aid - namely, access to free care for illegal immigrants."
"Let us remember that in France, such care is actually accessible to any illegal immigrant for any complaint - the original intention being to respond to emergencies or to the risk of epidemics - and the conditions on such access are minimal and unverifiable."
"This system - which has no checks and no limits - allows palliative treatments, promotes illegal immigration and encourages medical tourism, as well as every type of cheating imaginable, at an ever-increasing cost."
"At a time when our hospital and medical systems are in ruins, and when more and more of our fellow citizens have to go without care because they cannot afford it, such a proposal is outrageous."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on Reducing health inequalities, which addresses the various gaps present in healthcare throughout the EU-27."
"The rapporteur highlights the fact that the disparity in the health of citizens throughout the Union is, in many cases, due to the differences in opportunity, in access to services and material resources, social background, income and education; and also that such differences have been exacerbated further following the financial crisis."
"I am in agreement with various issues raised in this report - one being the suggestion that the Commission collaborate with Member States in the promotion of best practices on pricing and reimbursement of the cost of medicines, with the aim of optimising affordability and reducing inequalities in access to medicines; another being for the EU and Member States to recognise male violence against women as a public health issue; and also the calling on Member States to adapt their health systems to the needs of the most vulnerable in society by developing methods for setting the fees charged by healthcare professionals for guaranteeing access to care for all patients."
"However, I am not in agreement with references made in the report which support the promotion of abortion."
"It was absolutely crucial for the report to take age-based health inequalities into account, as it has now done."
"Age-based health inequalities result in limited access to adequate healthcare and innovative treatments."
"Older people should be able to make use of medications which have been tested for effectiveness and safety on people of the same age."
"People of this age group are still excluded too often from clinical trials."
"The average age of patients participating in clinical trials of treatments for high blood pressure is 63, yet 44% of patients are older than 70 when first diagnosed with this problem."
"Without further ado, the Union and the Member States must plan for the social and economic consequences of an ageing European population and take this demographic change into account."
"The fight against health inequalities between the countries and regions of the EU - inequalities which have been exacerbated by the economic crisis - has finally become a priority thanks to the adoption of Mrs Estrela's report."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I voted in favour of this report, which aims to improve access to healthcare for all, particularly for vulnerable groups, and to support medical and pharmaceutical research."
"It also argues that Member States should call a halt to budget cuts in healthcare services."
"Furthermore, this report takes into account the gender aspect of health inequalities and improves women's access to reproductive care."
"These considerable steps forward are only the beginning of the fight against health inequalities in the EU."
"I voted for this report because despite improvements made in healthcare, the gap in health outcomes between those at the top and bottom ends of the social scale remains large and, in some areas, continues to widen."
"Inequalities experienced in earlier life in access to education, employment and healthcare, as well as those based on gender and cultural background, can have a critical bearing on the health status of people throughout their lives."
"The combination of poverty with other vulnerabilities such as childhood, old age or disability further increases health risks and vice-versa, ill health can lead to poverty and/or social exclusion."
"Increasingly, the link between social determinants and health inequalities is being recognised."
"This means that social problems are becoming widely viewed as being linked to health problems requiring an integrated response."
"The social consequences of the current economic and financial crisis have now unfolded."
"There are nearly 5 million more unemployed than at the beginning of the crisis."
"Many households have seen their income drop, a considerable number is more exposed to poverty and over indebtedness, and some have lost their homes."
"Workers on short-term contracts were among the first to be hit by the downturn."
"Migrants and young and older workers, who are more likely to be in precarious positions, were especially affected, but categories of workers who were so far relatively well protected also became unemployed."
"An innovative view of policy is needed to tackle health inequalities, especially for people in lower socio-economic groups."
"Hitherto, insufficient attention has been paid to the issue of narrowing health inequalities in Europe."
"This is a problem that needs to be resolved."
"There are various reasons for the health inequalities between population groups."
"They relate, for example, to living conditions, education and training, occupation, the prevention of disease and services that promote health."
"It is good that people have started more and more to understand the link between special problems and health problems."
"These problems have to be resolved comprehensively."
"It is possible to address the factors that result in health inequalities through sociopolitical action."
"For example, alcohol consumption can be dealt with through policies implemented at national level (like pricing and tax policies), through regional policy (by stepping up controls), and through local activity policy (for example, by developing leisure activities for youth)."
"At European level, we need to exchange information on best health practices between the Member States."
"It is important that we stress the need to reduce health inequalities at all levels of decision making."
"In particular, sustained cooperation between all actors is needed to reduce health inequalities."
"We are all very well aware of the importance of health."
"Unfortunately, we often fail to appreciate it properly until one of our family members or friends falls ill, or we fall ill ourselves."
"Access to healthcare is only one of many factors determining the health of the citizens of any country or area."
"Other factors which have an equally significant impact on the health of the citizens include occupational status and the resultant material situation, access to education, advanced age or disability, belonging to a minority group and many more."
"'Social stratification' and archaic divisions into 'classes' also result in disproportionate differences among Europeans in terms of health."
"Our priority, and the priority of the European Union, should be to ensure that absolutely all the inhabitants of our continent enjoy equal access to healthcare, and to eliminate social differences."
"The health and welfare of citizens is a priority that this Parliament must guarantee and safeguard."
"More than this, we believe it fundamental that this right should be guaranteed to all European countries."
"Socio-economic, cultural and structural inequalities often create a diversified scenario where not all have equal access to healthcare facilities and medical care."
"It therefore happens that the most vulnerable groups, migrants, the elderly, children and the disabled pay, sometimes with their lives, the high price of having the right to health denied them."
"This should not happen, either at European level, or at national or regional level."
"The victims of a poor healthcare system, which is unfortunately widespread, are as blameless as those who do not have equal access to healthcare facilities."
"I voted for the resolution, which stands for the elimination of inequalities between Member States regarding public health standards and promotes health policies that are more efficient and affordable for everyone, not only for users, but also for those who, in their capacity as employees and medical staff, will thus be able to find more suitable working conditions to enable them to work effectively for the good of all."
"I would like to make it known that I voted against the Estrela report on reducing health inequalities as a result of paragraph 25 of the text, which emphasises, among other things, that the European Union and the Member States must guarantee women the right to safe abortion."
"I would like to note that the abovementioned document raises many important health issues, and provides us with interesting material to use as a basis for further work, but I could not vote in favour of its adoption due to the reference to abortion."
"I always stress that abortion cannot be viewed in isolation from beliefs about the consequences of becoming sexually active, since human life deserves more."
"Inequalities in health constitute a problem to be addressed at European level."
"The reasons often stem from differences in terms of opportunities, access to services and material resources, as well as from different life choices made by individuals."
"We need an innovative political outlook to address them."
"The economic and financial crisis of recent years has resulted in a reduction in the level of funding for health services and long-term care as a result of budget cuts and reductions in tax revenue, while the demand for health services and long-term care has increased."
"Numerous Member States have included in their recovery plans measures such as investments in healthcare restructuring and additional financing of the health system."
"Interventions to tackle health inequalities, however, vary widely from state to state."
"The collection and sharing of data on strategies, policies and effective interventions will help to obtain support from governments."
"It is essential that the reduction in health inequalities should be considered a high priority, by pursuing such an approach based on 'health in all policies' and ensuring effective impact assessments that take into account the results obtained in terms of equality in health."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and welcome its focus on inequality in health among lower socio-economic groups."
"I welcome the attention given to the importance of housing and employment factors with regard to health."
"I also agree with the report's drawing attention to the increased risk of obesity, smoking and drinking among lower socio-economic groups."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work, and to thank her for accepting my amendment proposals."
"The issue of equal access to health is one of the pillars of our common policy, both now and especially in the future."
"The unequal performance of economies and the current crisis should not impose limits on securing equal opportunities for the provision of healthcare to EU citizens regardless of differences between health systems."
"In my opinion, it is very significant that the text emphasises greater patient awareness and high quality legal advice for immigrants, as well as for others, including illegal immigrants."
"The fundamental principle must be that the health of individual citizens is secured through territorial and financial accessibility, and not only to medicines."
"Ensuring the coordination of education and professional training for health workers will be an important factor for progress, along with setting minimum standards for the quality and safety of care."
"The rapporteur correctly emphasises the prevention of both smoking and obesity and other conditions influencing the length of active life."
"I support the emphatic request to the Commission to encourage Member States to provide and fund treatment for patients with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and multiple sclerosis."
"The treatment of these conditions is not funded in some Member States."
"These conditions affect both elderly and particularly young people, and lead to social exclusion."
"This report highlights the inequalities in the area of health between EU citizens, men and women, young and old, which are linked to a very wide range of factors: economic, social, educational and professional situations and living conditions."
"It emphasises the importance of maintaining and improving universality and access for all to high quality healthcare, including for undocumented immigrants, among other vulnerable groups."
"It draws attention to the fact that the economic and financial crisis, together with the austerity measures imposed by Member States, have had a severe impact on the health sector, and this will make inequalities even more marked."
"This report encourages the Commission and Member States to develop a set of common indicators for monitoring inequalities in the area of health, and to continue with the 'health in all policies' strategy."
"It also stresses the importance of preventative action and a 'local care approach'."
"In the light of the above, and to encourage the suggestions contained in the report, I voted in favour."
"Ensuring access to care for everyone, both citizens and non-citizens, with or without papers, is a basic principle of public safety."
"The best way of protecting individual people's health is by protecting the health of everyone as a whole."
"I welcome this report, which makes this argument for public health as indispensable for the common good."
"The report voted on here deals with some important issues, mainly with regard to the defence of equal healthcare for all, a situation which, unfortunately, is not yet the case in the EU, in particular, among more disadvantaged groups, such as children, the elderly, and in some cases women."
"However, in my opinion, a number of other issues are also addressed that have nothing to do with health."
"What strikes me most is the approach taken towards the policies of the Member States with regard to the voluntary interruption of pregnancy and access to fertility treatment for homosexuals, which, in my opinion, should respect the principle of subsidiarity and be handled in a less surreptitious manner."
"Hence, I voted against this report."
"I voted in favour of the Estrela report on reducing health inequalities in the EU."
"Access to health services for all citizens, be they from the EU or immigrants with or without papers, is one of the basic human rights."
"It is the very people most at risk of exclusion that have to see that this fundamental right is guaranteed."
"Therefore, I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - Inequalities experienced in earlier life in access to education, employment and healthcare, as well as those based on gender and cultural background, do indeed have a critical bearing on the health status of people throughout their lives."
"It should be highlighted that nobody wants to deal with this problem seriously."
"Therefore, the report of Edite Estrela is really timely."
"When we are able to ensure equal medical care for all population strata, society will become more efficient in the economic, financial and political sense."
"I voted for that report."
"Public health continues to be our greatest asset and should be regarded as an absolute priority by governments."
"However, there are still serious divergences in the various states within the EU in relation to the health of the population."
"The effects are particularly clear when one considers the different levels of life expectancy, which can vary by 5.6 years in the case of men, and as much as 6.6 years in the case of women, within the 27 Member States of the EU."
"The reasons for this are partly to be found in poor levels of education, and high levels of poverty and unemployment."
"It is therefore hardly surprising that the wave of redundancies that followed the economic crisis has not had a positive effect on public health."
"After all, loss of income significantly reduces access to medical services in many countries."
"I have not voted in favour of the report, because it does not provide enough concrete detail about strategies to deal with the problem."
"Attempts to reduce healthcare inequalities in the European Union are certainly to be welcomed for consistent social and economic development, and that is why I voted for Mrs Estrela's report."
"Suggestions for improving healthcare in Europe through health education, access to treatment, knowledge of data and the use of mechanisms to measure, monitor, evaluate and communicate information provide an important contribution to the development of policies that are effective for reducing health inequalities."
"In doing these things, I nevertheless naturally think it is equally important to respect the principle of subsidiarity and certain national traits and characteristics that I believe must be defended and protected."
"This report on the reduction of health inequalities in the EU sets out various measures that I believe to be worthwhile and important."
"Nevertheless, I abstained from the final vote as I could not agree with the EU and the Member States having to guarantee women completely free access to abortion."
"Investment should always be made at the level of family planning and contraception, with abortion being a last resort for exceptional situations."
"I also do not believe that there should be free access to assisted reproduction technologies, which should be subject to the principle of subsidiarity and never used as an instrument for eliminating discrimination against women because of their marital status, age, sexual orientation, or ethnic or cultural origin."
"The differences in life expectancy within the EU vary from one state to another, ranging between 14.2 years for men and 8.3 years for women (11.86 for men and 7.38 for women in Romania)."
"Even within countries, groups with a different education or social level have different health prospects."
"A rise in the unemployment rate and the austerity measures could exacerbate the health inequalities which already exist in the EU."
"I voted for this resolution to call for an improvement in monitoring and preventive measures against diseases, as well as for attention to be focused on the vulnerable groups."
"in writing. - As the draft report already covered most of the relevant issues, there was no need to table many amendments."
"While we, the Greens/EFA, co-signed a number of amendments with the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, we were the only ones to try to introduce criticism of the current model of drug development based on patents, which leads to high prices for medical innovation and lack of access to affordable essential medicines."
"We called for new models of medical innovation and for tackling the lack of access to affordable essential medicines."
"We called for new models of medical research (innovation prize schemes, equitable licensing, patent pools, public/private partnerships and social conditionality in the concession of EU research funding), but these amendments were not adopted."
"Eurostat figures for 2010 are clear: there are still great inequalities between the 27 Member States with regard to the quality of healthcare provided."
"Parameters such as life expectancy in the various Member States still show too much variability from region to region, demonstrating that healthcare quality standards are still too heterogeneous within the EU."
"Access to primary and secondary education, a stable and satisfactory job, gender, cultural background and access to quality healthcare are the factors that contribute to enhancing the quality of life of citizens more than any others."
"For this reason, the report should prioritise the rights of the weakest, especially women and their specific needs."
"Although we agree with the basic principle of the report, namely, that the average level of health in the European Union has continued to improve despite major differences in healthcare due to the different systems in Member States, it is deficient when it comes to the rights of migrants."
"These are included among the most vulnerable groups such as the disabled, elderly and children, not taking into account the fact that many migrants are illegal, and have therefore arrived in Europe improperly."
"We cannot therefore consider migrants in the same way as disabled people, who are a vulnerable group that requires special care and assistance appropriate to their needs."
"The report divides society into classes - rich, poor, ethnic minorities, men, women and children - applying outdated methodology instead of talking about citizens with rights, and claims to measure these supposed health inequalities through appropriate legislation."
"The approved amendments actually made the text worse by including various topics such as climate change, violence against women, assisted reproduction and equal access to healthcare for illegal migrants."
"On behalf of the four Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament (Dan Jørgensen, Christel Schaldemose, Britta Thomsen and Ole Christensen)."
"We voted in favour of the report on reducing health inequalities in the EU."
"The report contains a lot of important proposals for reducing health inequalities."
"However, it also proposes that undocumented migrants be entitled to and guaranteed access to health services in the Member States."
"We do not share this point of view."
"We do believe, however, that it is a human right to receive emergency treatment, irrespective of a person's status in society."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report to support the approach of the rapporteur who has set out principles which should really matter concerning women's health."
"Many women in European society do not have essential rights to health programmes and access to facilities because of their social and economic position within our society, in particular, ethnic minorities and migrant women who may be undocumented."
"While it is important to safeguard against 'health tourism' as it is unfortunately termed, it is also essential to remember our commitment to fundamental human rights."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which looks at different health inequalities in Member States and encourages them to keep healthcare as a priority during the financial crisis and recovery."
"It is vital that these inequalities do not increase as governments look to save money."
"I voted in favour of the report on reducing health inequalities in the EU because I believe that there are currently great disparities between the Member States in relation to health."
"All the Member States of the Union must ensure that women have easy access to methods of contraception and the right to abortion, for example."
"in writing. - I voted against this report as I believe it failed to address its subject matter of health inequalities and took a totally different approach."
"Although there are many parts of the report I do not agree with, I would like to focus on the liberties given to 'undocumented' or 'irregular' migrants, as they are referred to in the report, which, in essence, is a method of renaming illegal immigrants."
"The report promotes giving many civil and health-associated liberties to individuals who have illegally entered many EU countries."
"This report will create many disadvantages for Member States that deal with the issue of immigration on a daily basis, such as Greece and Italy."
"Not only does it give illegal immigrants the right to claim equal access to healthcare, but it will also become the reason why even more so-called 'asylum seekers' will want to come to Europe, in a desire to benefit from free healthcare, which is non-existent in most third world countries."
"I voted against the report because it once again promotes abortion by the back door."
"Human beings are God's creation and we should not set ourselves up as arbiters in questions of life and death."
"There is no room for compromise here."
"Although I am not in a majority in taking this position, I will not be changing my stance and refuse to sacrifice a single life because of contemporary mores."
"I took the same decision in relation to pre-implantation diagnosis."
"The report from Mrs Estrela deals with the issue of reducing health inequalities in the EU."
"I welcome this work very much because although the current financial and economic crisis means that we are mainly required to deal with economic and legislative questions, we should never lose sight of issues such as health, education and social security."
"It will only be possible to implement the Community's higher objectives, such as the EU 2020 strategy, if we have sustainable systems in the broad area of social security and equal opportunities."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the report."
"I approve this report, taking into account the amendments proposed by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"We have a duty to transfer our experience of economic governance, so that developing countries can establish their own tax systems."
"This is the only way in which it will be possible to create a fairer and more equitable and sustainable tax system, combat evasion, and, as a result, promote a better international fiscal environment."
"I would also highlight the importance of this report in stressing the urgency of abolishing tax havens, a fundamental measure in the area of transparency that will enable the necessary automatic exchange of tax information."
"While taxation can be a reliable and sustainable source of financing given a progressive taxation system, efficient fiscal administration and transparent and responsible use of tax receipts, many developing countries are failing to enforce a minimum tax rate to finance their public services."
"The European Union must therefore cooperate with these countries in order to encourage good governance in tax matters."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report, which will allow for the creation of a tax system which is stable and more efficient, but also fairer, in order to reduce poverty in these countries."
"The report will also allow for the creation of a transparent, cooperative and fair international tax environment."
"Developing countries are facing difficulties establishing tax systems (the establishment, collection and administration of taxes)."
"Combating tax havens is one of the principal challenges set out in the Millennium Development Goals, as they weaken developing countries' institutions and their political systems."
"Off-shore centres and tax havens facilitate an annual illicit capital flight of USD 1 trillion and this represents roughly ten times the amount of aid money going into developing countries for poverty alleviation and economic development."
"I agree with the proposals made in the report that when allocating financial assistance, donors should support developing countries' efforts to improve tax governance and ensure that aid is used transparently and responsibly."
"This report, by agreement with the Commission, focuses on strengthening synergies between fiscal policies and development policies."
"To achieve this, the Commission, in fact, published two studies, and one year ago in this House, a resolution was approved on the same subject."
"I voted for the report because I support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and governance of the tax system, the commitment to support the tax systems of developing countries, dialogue and international cooperation in the field of taxation."
"It is, however, only right to point out the shortcomings still ongoing concerning the governance of customs revenue, the current deficiencies of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the erosion of tax revenues."
"I consider it appropriate that the European Union should do more to combat inefficiencies, including fighting to combat against tax havens, the manipulation of trading prices and the weakness of the international structure."
"It is time to reduce the manipulation of trading prices, the 'curse of natural resources', and expand the tax base, encouraging greater coordination among taxpayers."
"The increasing globalisation of markets and mobility of taxpayers mean that taxation has become a complicated matter in this day and age."
"It is even more complex and difficult to correct the situation in developing countries, due to internal factors such as vast informal sectors, the predominance of agriculture and the limited use of new technologies."
"I applaud the Commission's initiative in cooperating with these countries in order to promote good governance in tax matters through a report that identifies the main problems and solutions in a way that promotes synergies between fiscal policy and development policy, making both more efficient."
"The existence of efficient, transparent and equitable tax systems is crucial for the advancement of developing countries, in that they contribute to the financing of their public assets, the sustainability of their institutions, their reduced dependency on external aid and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"Within this context, I believe that the EU should, on the one hand, concentrate on taking action against tax havens and tax evasion (which undermine political and economic systems in developing countries by encouraging financial crime and inequality in the redistribution of tax revenues) and, on the other, establish a process of cooperation and dialogue with the tax authorities of these countries."
"I would also like to highlight the importance of expanding the tax base in these countries."
"It should be noted that tax systems in developing countries are characterised by being based on indirect taxation (in which most revenue comes from the taxation of goods and services), which constrains tax revenues and creates inefficiency within these systems."
"Efforts need to be concentrated on the development of direct taxation."
"No less important is the need to promote consistency between the European Union's development policy and its trade policy."
"Developing countries have seen their customs resources fall as a result of market liberalisation."
"These losses in resources can be compensated for by better governance and a fairer and more efficient taxation system."
"We should therefore develop improved technical and legal support in these countries in order to introduce a fair, progressive and transparent taxation system; for example, we should abolish all discretionary tax exemptions and preferences for multinationals and mining companies."
"Another way in which we can further help these countries is to put an end to the tax havens which seriously hinder their development."
"Clearly, a fairer taxation system and greater legal certainty will encourage overseas private investment and therefore, eventually, growth."
"All these provisions must not, however, lead to a fall in official development assistance."
"We should remain vigilant on this point, as the Member States are always inclined to reduce the portion of their GDP allocated to official development assistance."
"I voted for this report for the following reasons: it emphasises the need to tackle the phenomena of tax competition and tax evasion in the countries of the South; it states that the automatic exchange of information on taxation matters should be applied universally; it underlines the importance of the principle of 'country-by-country' reporting for all multinational companies; it advocates combating the phenomenon of tax havens, going beyond the insufficient actions of the OECD; and it emphasises the need to increase the consistency of European policies in support of development."
"The basis of this report is a Commission document that acknowledges the link between the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and good tax governance."
"The objective of this report is the need to promote greater synergies between tax policy and development policy, making both more efficient; to that end, it identifies the difficulties that exist in developing countries with regard to the mobilisation of tax revenues."
"The report also suggests ways in which the Union might improve the use of existing funds and instruments."
"It underlines the importance of supporting effective and sustainable tax systems, in particular, by combating fraud and tax evasion, in order to contribute to a transparent and equitable international tax environment, in particular, through assistance with taking action against tax havens."
"It is through good economic governance that these countries will be able to move away from their dependence on external aid, contributing to the development of the public and private sectors and to economic growth."
"This report deals with taxation and development in developing countries."
"In order to achieve the goals set by the UN in 2000 in the Millennium Declaration, these countries need to know how to promote good governance in tax matters, by maximising all external support."
"In 2009, the European Commission, which has an interest in cooperation with these countries, published the document 'Tax and development - Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters', with the objective of promoting synergies between development policy and tax policy, in order to make them fairer, more transparent and more effective."
"The same resolution was approved by Parliament in 2010."
"The EU believes that fairer and more consistent tax systems will contribute to reducing poverty and making up for the loss of some revenue."
"I therefore support this report, which calls for the end of tax havens - veritable 'weapons of mass destruction' for developing countries - the combating of economic crime, action against tax evasion and unfair competition, and development through good governance."
"The report identifies a set of questions that are relevant and very much of the moment, namely: - Making 'the fight against tax havens and corruption a top priority of the agenda'; - 'Difficulties encountered by developing countries in raising domestic revenues ..., multiple exemptions being granted to large domestic and foreign companies in order to attract investments'; - 'The financial transaction tax' at an international level, with 'a first step at the EU level'; - 'Low income countries need the capacity to effectively negotiate with multinational corporations' in order to 'impose capital controls' and fully exercise their sovereignty."
"However, this report is not free of contradictions, in particular, when it identifies the problems that will derive from the implementation of economic partnership agreements, namely, with regard to the reduction in tax revenue, but does not adopt a clear position rejecting such agreements."
"It also does not adopt a basic critical position on the responsibilities of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation in promoting policies that favour the destruction of production infrastructure and public services, create unemployment and undermine countries' internal markets, thus further undermining their tax revenues, budgets, sovereignty and independence."
"While recognising that cooperation in the area of taxation can be important, we should not ignore the fact that tax policy is an essential instrument of economic and social policy, on the definition of which clear political criteria and evaluations have an impact."
"Therefore, it does not fall to the European Union to export so-called 'good tax governance'."
"The sovereignty, choices and options of developing countries must be respected in full, with due attention to their specific situation and conditions."
"Meanwhile, the so-called 'Economic Partnership Agreements' that we have been imposing on developing countries, despite their resistance, severely constrain their tax systems though the significant reduction in customs revenues that they involve, alongside other serious damage."
"In addition, the continued existence of tax havens leads to very great losses of revenue for developing countries every year."
"The European Union, therefore, needs to change its policies and resolve these contradictions."
"I voted in favour of this document because it identifies positive aspects such as a clear understanding of taxation, which is essential to provide the basis for an accountable and responsive democratic system."
"Another aspect is the fact that the EU is committed to the principle of ownership of development strategies, and acknowledges the prime responsibility of developing countries themselves to improve their revenue systems, according to their own economic and political circumstances and choices."
"The Commission aims to engage the EU instruments in providing enhanced support in designing developing countries' tax systems and implementing the principles of good governance in the tax area, i.e. by paying more attention to effectively integrating the principles of good governance in tax matters into the programming, implementation and monitoring of country and regional strategy papers."
"The Commission supports country-by-country financial reporting standards for multinationals as a tool to detect international tax avoidance and evasion practice."
"It is also important to underline the fact that a Communication on Corporate Social Responsibility will consider how to develop a system for mandatory disclosure of governance information in annual accounting."
"The Commission aims to step up the process of international dialogue and cooperation in tax matters, notably by enhancing the participation of developing countries in relevant international fora."
"The Commission also insists on the need to conclude and implement Tax Information Exchange Agreements, including through a multilateral mechanism, by referring to the model of the EU Savings Taxation Directive, based on the automatic exchange of information."
"Appropriate taxation systems form a basis for sustainable economic growth and monetary stability."
"Developing countries, where such systems do not function properly or indeed at all, face serious economic and political problems."
"International legal standards supporting the proper functioning of taxation systems should have a positive impact on the economic situation in such countries."
"Let us remember, however, that we should not, under any circumstances, impose taxation policies on others, since every country must decide for itself on its own taxation systems, taking into account its current social, political and economic conditions."
"Let us therefore support good taxation policies, but not impose them."
"Efforts to make tax systems more sustainable, fair and transparent also help promote the establishment of democratic systems."
"As a result of globalisation, it has become difficult to tax internationally mobile capital."
"Developing countries must be supported to give them enough political room to manoeuvre so that speculation can be prevented and financial stability can be secured."
"I welcome joint initiatives to combat tax havens, as well as practices that intensify international dialogue between the relevant countries."
"A responsible approach to taxation will necessarily have a lasting positive effect on the development of these countries."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which concentrates on the need to strengthen the capacities of good tax governance for development and sees the need for a regulatory framework designed to support international tax cooperation, transparency, public and private sector development and economic growth; highlights that tax-to-GDP ratios in developing countries range between 10 and 20%, as opposed to between 25 and 40% in developed countries; regrets that too little support has been given so far by donors to tax-related assistance; in this context, welcomes the Commission's proposal to provide enhanced support for assisting developing countries in tax reforms and strengthening tax administrations regarding EDF for ACP States, the Development Cooperation Instrument and the ENP and Partnership Instrument, and support for national supervisory bodies, parliaments and non-state actors, and notes that more emphasis should be placed on efforts to undertake capacity-building within developing countries in order to help them make effective use of the exchange of information and effectively counter tax evasion with their own, internal, legislation."
"The Commission is doing a good job in promoting principles and criteria for the development of best governance in tax matters in cooperation with the countries in the developing world."
"Criteria of transparency, information exchange and fair tax competition are fundamental."
"The Commission seeks to implement this process by strengthening synergies between fiscal and development policies in order to identify the difficulties encountered by such countries in the mobilisation of revenue through taxation."
"On the other hand, the Commission still overlooks several issues that require a prompt response."
"We consider it necessary, in fact, to conduct a determined fight against tax havens in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but in no way limit the further measures taken, in particular, by paying attention to tax treaties."
"To this end, it is desirable that most international organisations should hold a specific mandate in order to combat tax havens."
"Lastly, it is essential to extend the tax base, passing through the adjustment of tax reform to the development of direct taxation, in order to resolve collection difficulties arising from the regressive VAT system."
"The fight against offshore companies and other tax evasions is a necessity."
"Hedge funds have been granted almost total freedom to operate by the majority of this Parliament."
"In that case, what is the point of the purely declaratory restrictions in this report?"
"The economic partnership agreements, negotiated in a disgraceful way by the use of pressure, are ruining the ACP States without leaving them the possibility of recovering in the long term."
"The report does not say a word about all this."
"Even worse, it argues that any type of nationalisation or renationalisation should be abandoned."
"I am voting against this report."
"It is a reality that poor fiscal governance is detrimental to the satisfactory economic performance of the Member States."
"The Commission now acknowledges the link between achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and good tax governance."
"It is therefore imperative that tax evasion is combated and concrete steps are taken to harmonise such measures through the entire EU, as it is well known that some countries are more effective than others at combating fraud and tax evasion."
"in writing. - We should help developing countries to elaborate policies and provide mechanisms to avoid tax evasion; this entails greater transparency."
"Also, we should transfer our economic governance experience to individual countries to help them set up their own tax systems."
"Reducing the level of corruption in developing countries and increasing their income will result in stability and balance."
"That will remove the tension and minimise the amount of financial aid from EU to developing countries."
"It is a very timely and important report, therefore I voted 'for'."
"I believe that there is an urgent need for an efficient tax system for developing countries."
"The ideas contained in this report are perfectly suitable for this."
"In particular, when the new tax systems are being implemented with the support of the EU, care should be taken to ensure that the economic partnership agreements between the EU and the developing countries promote this aim, rather than running counter to it."
"Investment policy in the EU must also create a business-friendly environment for investors at home and abroad."
"All the measures taken should result in a fundamental improvement in the living conditions of the majority of the population, who are currently cut off from income from raw materials sales and who are often forced into migration."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because it takes a comprehensive view of many of the factors involved."
"There is a need for specific measures for the improved promotion of the principles of responsible behaviour in the area of taxation, for example, in relation to transparency, the exchange of information and fair tax competition."
"It is important that the synergy effects between taxation and development policy should be improved."
"This report is moving in this direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"Given the fact that developing countries have lost significant revenue from trade taxes, it is consequently very important to ensure effective cooperation in both tax and development."
"It is important for every country to establish an efficient and effective tax system and policies to implement it, because this is the backbone of their public finances and a way of attracting investment."
"We must therefore leave developing countries some discretionary powers in this area."
"Cooperation must be based on mutual assistance, without creating additional obstacles or burdens for either party."
"I agree with the proposal that we must help ensure the quantitative and qualitative improvement in developing countries' revenue mobilisation."
"Aid allocated to developing countries should be targeted, effective and only provided if it is essential, and countries themselves should not have the right to decide whether it is required."
"I do not believe that it is advisable to give the EU an additional burden and compensate developing countries for the decline in customs revenue."
"In my opinion, we should establish a tax on financial transactions, which would limit speculation and would make the market function more effectively."
"Furthermore, we must make every effort to ensure that this tax is applied not just at EU, but also at global level."
"I voted for Mrs Joly's report on Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters, because, in line with the EU 2020 strategy, I believe it is essential to create global governance to support a global dialogue and international cooperation in the field of taxation."
"I agree with the report when it states a wish to increase synergies between fiscal policy and development through the exchange of information in tax matters and through multilateral mechanisms that refer to the EU directive on taxation of savings income to combat evasion and tax avoidance."
"The specific aim of tax cooperation with developing countries is to prevent them becoming tax havens for the multinationals, thus determining a distortion of competition with a negative effect on the development of economic processes given the interrelated nature of the global economic system."
"I voted in favour of this report on Tax and development - Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters, as I agree with the rapporteur on its importance for the development of an efficient tax system in developing countries."
"In fact, the tax system needs to become the backbone of public finances in developing countries."
"The EU's new policy for investment in developing countries needs to contribute to the establishment of an environment that is more favourable to domestic and external private investment, and to the creation of conditions for more effective international assistance."
"In order to promote growth, the EU's investment policy needs to focus on the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, including the provision of micro-credit, the effectiveness of public services, public/private partnerships and knowledge transfer."
"The European Commission working document published in April 2009 entitled 'Tax and development - Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters' provides pointers and methodologies for the promotion of synergies between tax policy and development policy, with the aim of making them both more efficient."
"I voted for this report because it clearly recognises the link between achieving the Millennium Development Goals and fiscal governance."
"It also recognises that taxation through a progressive tax system is essential to democracy."
"It recognises that offshore centres and tax havens aim for illicit capital flight which, combined with 'zero tax' systems to attract funds and investments, result in a transfer of burdens to workers and families on lower incomes by reducing the quality and quantity of public services in poor countries, as well as their ability to combat poverty."
"Assisting developing countries' judicial and anti-corruption services in their efforts to develop progressive taxation systems would be an excellent service provided by the EU."
"in writing. - Parliament has today highlighted the importance of tackling the erosion of tax revenues in developing countries, notably by doing more to combat tax havens."
"In order to be credible to this end, the EU must clearly clamp down on its own tax havens first and go beyond the OECD framework."
"The report also calls for the adoption of an international convention on tax matters that would include sanctions both for non-cooperative jurisdictions and for financial institutions that operate with tax havens."
"MEPs have also underlined the need to ensure greater transparency by multinational companies on their tax compliance in developing countries, notably the extractive industries, by ensuring country-by-country reporting."
"EU tax assistance should encourage the development of progressive taxation regimes in developing countries, notably by securing an equitable share of a corporation's profits."
"Good tax governance is crucial to development and the EU should support developing countries to this end, particularly against a background of the decline in trade taxes resulting from trade liberalisation globally."
"I welcome the support of MEPs for this report, which outlines clear proposals to this end."
"I voted in favour of the text of this report because I support the idea that greater synergy between tax and development policies can help developing countries."
"According to the latest Commission reports on taxation and development, taxation, especially if properly devised, can be a source of financing for development policies."
"It is no accident that many developing countries do not, in fact, even reach the minimum level of revenue needed to finance basic public services."
"Cooperation to strengthen its tax system and the fight against tax havens that facilitate illegal leaks of capital must underpin these processes."
"This process should encourage the introduction of financial reporting requirements for each country in order to benefit the fight against poverty."
"A fundamental condition for effective state function is that the area of taxation is in good order."
"If developing countries wish to operate in the global economy, they must integrate and reform their taxation systems."
"Taxes play an economic, political and social role in democratic countries."
"They not only constitute the main source of state revenue, but also allow social objectives of the utmost importance to be achieved."
"They fund basic services such as healthcare, education, social care and pensions."
"Tax revenue in developing countries may sustainably fund the development of these countries and improve their citizens' quality of life."
"Nevertheless, at present, such revenue is frequently insufficient to cover the costs of basic public services or to fight poverty."
"In an era of globalisation, capital subject to taxation is more mobile and barriers to trade are being abolished, which reduces tax revenue and poses a challenge, not only to the poorer countries."
"Regardless of its obvious benefits, the progressive liberalisation of trade reduces customs revenue."
"It is very important that foreign taxes should be replaced by those levied internally."
"While income tax is one of the main forms of taxation in rich countries, its contribution is minimal in developing countries."
"The majority of people are employed informally in agriculture and have irregular incomes, which makes it difficult to enforce income tax effectively."
"in writing. - I have supported this report which focuses on the importance of taxation in relation to meeting development policies and suggests ways in which the EU can more effectively use existing funds and instruments for this aim."
"The adoption of the report on 'Tax and development - Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters' is particularly important with regard to the effectiveness of the development aid granted to developing countries by the Member States of the European Union and the European Commission."
"Ensuring respect for principles of good governance in tax matters (transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition) and combating tax havens, which hinder the development of the least developed countries, are absolute necessities, and will be a priority of my term of office."
"I voted in favour of this specific motion for a resolution because I consider that reforming and updating the tax systems of developing countries is the most important way of preventing illicit capital flight and combating tax evasion."
"This capital, which often ends up in tax havens, has a direct impact on the economy of these countries, especially in this particular period of economic crisis."
"Improving tax systems will allow us to exert a positive influence on growth in developing countries, apply a framework of good economic governance, promote transparency and gain the citizens' trust."
"I voted for Mrs Joly's report."
"The establishment of a fully functioning tax system is the basis for any responsible democracy."
"The report calls for support for developing countries as they establish such structures, so as to promote responsibility in these states on a sustainable basis."
"After all, development aid alone will not be enough to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"The report also touches briefly on the problem of so-called 'vulture funds', which I believe should be completely banned."
"International development aid should not be allowed to become a football for global financial players."
"I approve this report and highlight the importance of the recommendations issuing from the Papastamkos report, which states that non-trade concerns (NTCs) should be better incorporated into negotiations within the World Trade Organisation."
"The need for some consistency between the common agricultural policy and the EU's external trade policy is also clear - it is essential to secure a level playing field for EU producers in the world market, which must not encourage unfair competition."
"If this is not negotiated, European farmers will continue to face unfair competition, and will suffer losses and discrimination in relation to competitors outside the European Union."
"I support the essential role the agricultural sector plays in providing employment and maintaining the European agri-food model, which is a strategic component of the European economy."
"Given that the European Union is the world's biggest importer of agricultural goods, the production methods used in third countries exporting to the EU must provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of health, food safety, sustainable development and minimum social standards as those imposed on European producers."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the agricultural and food policies must meet some basic objectives, such as food security and safety."
"in writing. - The British Conservative Delegation strongly supports the principle of free trade."
"Free trade creates prosperity and free trade will make a vital contribution to the recovery of the European economies."
"We believe that this report places too much emphasis on protecting EU agricultural markets from outside competition and not enough emphasis on exporting production standards."
"EU farmers are required to meet stringent environmental and animal welfare standards, for which they are, in part, compensated through the subsidy system."
"However, products imported into the EU from third countries very often do not conform to those same high standards."
"Closing EU borders to agricultural products from third countries is not the answer."
"The EU should actively seek to export its strong animal welfare and environmental standards around the world, notably through more open international markets, rather than focusing on defensive, protectionist solutions."
"For this reason, the British Conservative delegation voted against this report."
"Through this report, the European Parliament explicitly asks the Council and the European Commission to take better account of agricultural interests in international trade negotiations, particularly in discussions with South America, a large livestock farming and grain production region which does not always meet European quality standards."
"In my opinion, this is an essential report."
"I therefore voted in favour of it."
"The EU agricultural sector has a significant added value for the European economy and plays a strategic role in tackling the economic, social and environmental challenges that the EU is facing."
"Therefore, external trade policy and agreements with foreign importers must not jeopardise the EU's ability to maintain a strong and vibrant sector."
"The Commission must assume a clear position in the World Trade Organisation and carry out specific impact assessments, negotiating with other parties as regards the importation of certain products to the EU market."
"We must ensure respect for the principle that third-country production methods for export to the EU must provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of health, food safety, animal welfare, sustainable development and minimum social standards as those required of EU producers."
"This is the only way to ensure that EU producers can compete on a level playing field with third countries, and that our farmers' interests are protected."
"I voted in favour of Mr Papastamkos's report."
"International trade plays a critical role within the EU, particularly with regard to the situation in which European farmers are disadvantaged by imports from third countries and by the failure to apply the principle of reciprocity, which gives foreign farmers undue advantage where they are often not obliged to comply with the same strict and costly regulations that are imposed on European farmers in order to be able to operate within the internal market, particularly from the sanitary and phytosanitary point of view."
"I shall continue to fight for a high level of consistency to be maintained in Europe between the common agricultural policy and EU external trade policy."
"Such consistency must guarantee the European agricultural model a level playing field for EU producers in the world market."
"In my opinion, it is important to emphasise the link between EU agricultural production and international trade, which is reflected in the fact that the EU is the largest global importer of agricultural goods and, at the same time, the largest global exporter of processed food products."
"In this context, I firmly believe that making trade flows as smooth as possible contributes to greater producer flexibility and to a reduction in the costs for exchanging goods, and that this has a favourable impact on both producer revenues and consumer spending."
"I cannot therefore agree with the statement contained in the approved resolution that trade liberalisation will not make it possible for the threat of hunger to be eradicated from the world."
"This is not the role of commerce, nor can it be."
"I applaud the Commission for the fact that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation negotiations and bilateral or bioregional negotiations, it has used measures arising from the ongoing long-term reforms as proposals in the field of agriculture, while always recognising the parameters of the common agricultural policy as a line in the sand."
"In this regard, the approved text of the resolution unfortunately strikes me as having a rather one-sided focus, undermining the Commission's steps in the political negotiations to date on trade."
"I regard any further flexibility in the forthcoming negotiations as an unequivocal opportunity and a benefit."
"In relation to the criticism of some steps, such as the reduction in import duties levied on bananas or the reform of the sugar regime, I would then like to add that they were primarily based on the conclusions of the dispute resolution in the WTO, which also influenced the parameters of the EU's subsequent measures."
"I agree with the need for greater consistency between the common agricultural policy and the external trade policy in order to secure the European agricultural model and, as a result, a level playing field for EU producers in the world market."
"The accommodation of trade and non-trade concerns and the necessary convergence of regulations are essential."
"Agriculture represents a strategic sector for the European Union."
"While its impact in terms of employment and GDP may not equal that of other sectors, it assumes greater significance with regard to the characteristics of our respective regions and food traditions, since it ensures that we are self-sufficient in many ingredients that are essential for our farm produce, traditional or otherwise."
"Furthermore, this sector plays a fundamental role in safeguarding and protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of our regions."
"It is obvious that trade agreements have to be made, particularly in the trade rounds of the World Trade Organisation."
"For that to happen, however, the European Union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality, traditional and certified products, so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries."
"The basic tenet of the approved report seems to go in the right direction."
"The mistreatment of European agriculture in trade negotiations with third countries cannot continue."
"That is the subject of the report that we have just adopted, which refers to a number of principles and calls for non-commercial aspects to be better integrated into the negotiations."
"Quite rightly, it calls on European livestock farmers to respect binding environmental and health standards relating to product hygiene, even though some of their competitors put products on to the European market which do not always respect those standards."
"Indeed, too often, our farmers suffer as a result of unfair competition, and thus as a result of distortions of competition when some third countries are involved."
"The Commission must take into account the warnings of Parliament and of farmers, particularly when it comes to negotiations with Mercosur, which risk endangering European livestock farming, as well as fruit and vegetable producers in the outermost regions."
"The report on relations between EU agriculture and international trade shows us the disastrous loss of power that European agriculture has suffered, and attempts to alert the European institutions, which are responsible for this failure."
"It is currently difficult to feed Europe; the common agricultural policy has been transformed, by the Commission, into the gravedigger of the agricultural sector."
"The restrictions weigh a little more each day on the shoulders of farmers."
"All the power which formerly belonged to European agriculture, as well as its export capacity, have been reduced drastically as Europe opens itself up to foreign agricultural goods produced using methods which fail to respect the standards that Europeans are imposing on themselves."
"The future of agriculture is at stake, and it must certainly no longer be left to the Union and its institutions."
"The Member States must have the capacity to help their farmers for the good of everyone."
"I voted in favour of the report on EU agriculture and world trade, as it highlights the importance of integrating non-trade concerns into the development of the Doha Agenda, such as social, environmental and human health considerations, as well as those relating to the health and wellbeing of animals, in order to meet the highest environmental and social standards and avoid a loss of competitiveness among EU farmers within the context of world agricultural production."
"Agriculture has social functions that transcend the mere limits of food production, such as the settlement and planned use of land, the protection of the environment and the preservation of cultural traditions."
"I believe that these are entirely deserving of protection and support from the Member States and the European institutions."
"Despite my position of being favourable in principle to greater openness of markets, I believe that, where the agricultural sector is concerned, there is a need to be particularly strict with regard to reciprocity requirements and the need to ensure food security for European consumers."
"The European Union should bear in mind the need to balance conflicting values and, especially during the current economic and financial crisis, take into account the impact of the trade agreements it signs on the lives of European farmers and their holdings."
"One of the sectors most affected by the free movement of people and goods has been agriculture."
"Despite constant changes to the common agricultural policy (CAP) - seen as a symbol of European integration - the situation in this sector continues to be very precarious, as it is required to comply with exacting environmental protection and product safety standards, exacerbated by the current financial crisis."
"This is a sector that overlaps with other areas, such as trade, the environment, industry, transport, etc., which makes it very difficult to adopt a regulatory framework that satisfies all participants."
"Despite advances such as the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary measures) and TBT (technical barriers to trade) agreements, there remains a great deal to do."
"I give my support to this report as it acknowledges the fundamental role of the agri-foodstuffs sector within the EU, which is a very sensitive sector that cannot stand up to aggressive competition; this needs to be taken into account when new agreements are signed."
"However, I hope that the new economic framework for the CAP improves coordination between productivity and the international market."
"This is a report full of contradictions."
"It points out the negative consequences of the liberalisation of trade, but does not oppose the course being taken by policies that are at the root of the main problems for agriculture in EU countries (and also in developing countries)."
"It suggests nothing to change this course."
"It makes a fair criticism of the Commission's approach, which places agricultural interests below the interests of industry and the service sector, and which makes concessions on agriculture in order to obtain enhanced market access [in other areas] in third countries."
"It gives examples of the disastrous consequences of this policy - the case of sugar is a prime example."
"It acknowledges that greater liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, increased by World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, has not, to date, enabled the threat of hunger in the world to be held at bay."
"However, it does not condemn or oppose this move towards the increased liberalisation and deregulation of world trade that the EU is promoting, whether within the framework of the WTO or within that of innumerable bilateral agreements."
"On the contrary, it defends it."
"We have been criticising the failure of neoliberal policies for a long time."
"The report also does so, although in a very patchy and, at times, ambiguous way, only to then support the policy of disaster."
"We consider this to be unacceptable."
"We have seen many examples of the disastrous consequences for the agricultural sector of the liberalisation of world trade."
"This report calls attention to a number of cases, and does not shy away from the fact that agriculture has been used as a bargaining chip for the promotion of other interests during negotiations conducted at the World Trade Organisation, namely, the interests of large service and international trade corporations and certain leading-edge industries."
"We therefore advocate other solutions, given that the report is not consistent."
"We want international trade to be oriented along the lines of complementarity rather than competition - between countries, producers and types of production."
"We want agriculture to be oriented towards safeguarding the food sovereignty and security of each country, in contrast to the dangerous anarchy of producing for a liberalised market."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Papastamkos on the report and the excellent cooperation, which have my support."
"I wish to emphasise the major importance of international trade within the EU and to draw everyone's attention to the fact that European farmers are being disadvantaged by imports from third countries; the principle of reciprocity is not being applied, and often imported agricultural products do not comply with the same regulations that are imposed on European farmers, particularly from a sanitary and phytosanitary point of view."
"This problem affects not only the health of products, but also their quality."
"Hence, there must be consistency between the common agricultural policy and EU external trade policy."
"Such consistency must ensure the preservation of the European agricultural model, as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market."
"I support the main recommendations of this report."
"One very important point in the report is that the European Commission often makes concessions in trade matters in order to obtain better access to markets in third countries for industrial products and services."
"It is also stated in the report that the same standards of health, food safety, animal welfare, sustainable development and minimum social standards ought to apply to the methods of production of goods being imported from third countries as apply to the EU's own producers."
"Although I voted in favour of this resolution, of course, I wanted to use my vote (particularly on certain amendments) to show my commitment to several principles."
"Indeed, I wanted to stress the fact that, in the many negotiations on trade agreements currently under way with several of the EU's partners, it is essential to reach balanced agreements which are based on the principle of reciprocity."
"In this regard, imported products originating from third countries should respect health and social rules, as well as rules to protect consumers, the environment and animals, which are similar to those that we have in the EU."
"Furthermore, too often, concessions are made on agriculture in order to obtain enhanced market access in third countries for industrial products and services."
"This approach is no longer acceptable, and I wanted to use my vote to state once again that European agriculture must not be viewed as a tool to serve EU trade policy."
"Finally, the defence of the EU regime for authorising and marketing GMOs is a point to which I attach particular importance."
"At a time when this regime is increasingly coming under attack at the WTO, it is essential that the European Commission defends it."
"There is no denying the link between our policies on international trade, development and agriculture."
"European agriculture is encountering increasing difficulties when it comes to the export of products to the world market because price levels there are low and production costs in the EU are higher."
"This ongoing trend will continue to have a negative effect if support programmes are not put in place for agriculture."
"That is why I welcome this own-initiative report, which, among other things, provides for compensation for farmers in the event that the further opening up of the internal market to imports leads to a deficit for farmers."
"The agreements with third countries negotiated by the EU are, in themselves, unproblematic."
"However, the overall thrust of these agreements makes it difficult to maintain high standards in the EU."
"One of the things called for by the own-initiative report presented here therefore is greater coherence in agricultural policy and joint trade policy in the EU."
"In this context, I support the call for the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on trade agreements and to publish this before entering into negotiations."
"I voted in favour of this document because, at a time when the EU is reflecting on the future of its common agricultural policy (CAP), ensuring consistency between agricultural and external trade policy becomes all the more crucial."
"Coherence between the CAP and EU external trade policy shall ensure the preservation of the European agricultural model, as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market."
"The most important thing for us should be food security, safety and quality at an affordable price for EU citizens."
"There is a global increase in food demand against a background of higher production costs, severe volatility in agricultural markets, less land, less water and reduced energy inputs."
"A strong CAP is also crucial for the preservation, environmental sustainability and economic development of the EU rural areas against the threat of land abandonment and rural depopulation."
"The European agricultural sector has a clear added value and a major role to play in the Europe 2020 strategy towards tackling the socio-economic and environmental challenges that the EU is facing, both internally and as a leading global player."
"EU trade policy will play a decisive role, determining whether agriculture will continue to make a full positive contribution to these objectives."
"Trade policy should not undermine the dynamic of the EU agricultural sector."
"On the contrary, trade policy and agricultural policy can and must be mutually supportive."
"Worldwide agricultural practice and, in particular, European agricultural policy, are of major importance for food and development policy."
"That is why it is so important that international trade in this area should be strengthened and developed."
"However, this cannot be achieved by working counter to European agricultural policy but only in close coordination with such policy."
"It is also essential that stringent European standards should also be applied to imported products."
"Anything else would threaten the strict quality and safety requirements of the European agricultural sector and would therefore have a negative impact on European producers and consumers."
"We need and demand free trade in goods."
"However, this cannot be achieved without fair competitive conditions as a basic requirement."
"in writing. - (LV) European farmers play an important role in supplying food to more than 500 million people in Europe and in securing food supply in the world as a whole."
"Unfortunately, the attitude towards farmers has not always been fair."
"I fully support free trade agreements with other countries or groups of countries, but, in concluding such agreements, we must not put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage."
"The real losers from this unfair competition will be the people of the European Union, for whom we must ensure daily access to high-value and high quality food at reasonable prices."
"Often enough, this is taken to be self-evident, without thinking that it is our farmers who provide this security; farmers, whose incomes are often considerably below the average income in their countries."
"Nor do we have to do anything supernatural - we must simply stipulate that agricultural products imported into the European Union should be subject to the same environmental, social, animal welfare and safety standards that European farmers are obliged to observe."
"That would be fair and would put those farmers who wish to sell their products in the European Union on the same competitive footing."
"In this report, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to take a more forceful role in representing the interests of the European agricultural and consumer sectors in international trade negotiations."
"We should not act lightly in abandoning the benchmarks that characterise the EU agricultural sector - the highest quality and social standards in agricultural production and the best quality food for the population - by signing up to a large number of economic agreements."
"I am in favour of only opening up the market for agricultural imports if it can be assured that the competitiveness of European agriculture will be maintained."
"I believe that no further concessions should be made in the area of agriculture during the negotiations on the Doha round."
"I welcome the clear demands set down in this report."
"With today's vote, we are sending a strong signal to the Commission: the European Union cannot continue to make concessions so as to obtain access to third-country markets at the expense of the agricultural sector!"
"At a time when the European Union is reflecting on the new common agricultural policy, finding mechanisms that can ensure consistency between the CAP and external trade policy becomes a prime objective."
"The European agricultural sector guarantees many public benefits, including food safety and quality."
"Therefore, the defence of European farmers' interests must be a priority, and I am pleased in this respect that the document includes some paragraphs guaranteeing reciprocity for European farmers by means of the request for the same requirements that are imposed on European farmers to be applied to exporters of meat to Europe in order to guarantee consumer safety and fair commercial competition."
"At this point in the negotiations on the Mercosur and Morocco agreements, I think it is essential to express clearly to the Commission our concerns and also our firm position in defence of European and Italian farmers' interests."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Mr Papastamkos's report on EU agriculture and international trade."
"In particular, I wanted to support the desire of the European Parliament to emphasise strongly the dangers that the European Commission's trade strategy presents to agriculture in the European Union."
"While several negotiations on trade agreements are in progress between the Union and some of its partners (Mercosur, Canada, Ukraine, and so on), it is up to us to remind the European Commission of the need to establish trade partnerships - with realism but without naivety - which are based on the principles of free trade, of course, but also on the principle of reciprocity - both in relation to respect for health and social rules and in relation to rules for protecting consumers, the environment and animals - and which do not endanger certain European spheres of activity."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the agricultural sector, which is too often 'sacrificed' in favour of industrial products and services during trade negotiations."
"With this aim in mind, the European Union must ensure consistency between its agricultural policy, currently under revision, and its trade policy in order to maintain a strong agricultural sector, thus ensuring the food security of our fellow citizens in a context of increased market volatility."
"I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mr Papastamkos, because it presents a very realistic view of trade relations between the European Union and third countries in the agricultural sector."
"Our trade balance deficit with the Mercosur countries in this sector is alarming."
"The gap between our exports to, and our imports from, these five countries has doubled in less than a decade, and our imports are now worth EUR 19 billion as against only EUR 1 billion worth of exports."
"Too often, the European Commission makes unacceptable concessions on agricultural products, endangering the existence of European farms under the pretext that we have to ensure better access to the market in third countries for our industrial products and services."
"EU external trade policy should not sacrifice our agricultural sector, which ensures the food security of our fellow citizens, particularly in a context of increased market volatility."
"In order to prevent distortions of competition, the Mercosur countries must apply the same standards - in terms of health, food safety, animal welfare and sustainable development - as are required of our farmers who, in addition, face higher social costs."
"in writing. - I voted against this report which sends out a highly protectionist message as regards Parliament's attitude to trade."
"Taken literally, this report would make it impossible for the EU to negotiate any meaningful FTAs or, for that matter, complete the Doha Development Round."
"This report underlines the fact that the EU should contribute to world food security, and I congratulate it on that."
"Nonetheless, and despite its mention of a number of the devastating consequences of market liberalisation on agriculture, the solutions that it suggests are, once again, along the lines of reinforcing free trade, and subordinate agricultural policy to the interests of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"The report explicitly threatens Argentina for not submitting to the WTO and restricting imports of food products that compete directly with domestic producers."
"However, at the same time, it calls for more EU restrictions on imports and calls for proactive promotion of EU agricultural interests."
"Also, no precise mention is made of Brazil's situation."
"Therefore, and since this report prioritises liberalisation and competition in agricultural markets, I voted against."
"I voted in favour of Mr Papastamkos's report, which sends out a strong message concerning the weight that European agriculture must carry in international negotiations."
"At a time when Europe needs to strengthen its agricultural production to ensure food security, negotiations on international agreements are often to the detriment of the agricultural sector."
"So that we can be aware early on of the consequences of these agreements for European agriculture, we want the European Commission to carry out and publish in-depth impact assessments of trade agreements before entering into negotiations."
"Furthermore, the EU's high standards in relation to health, the environment and animal welfare must be applied to products entering European territory."
"Border checks carried out by Member States must ensure that European legislation is correctly implemented in this area."
"In the context of the EU's future common agricultural policy, we must take into account the balance between internal production and imports."
"Our efforts will have to be aimed at greater harmony between market liberalisation and protection for the domestic economic sector."
"Food security at Member State level is achieved by maintaining a stable agricultural sector, which is not jeopardised by external trade policy, against the background of increased market volatility."
"Small farmers make a significant contribution to food security in the regions where they operate."
"I think that trade agreements with third countries on importing agricultural products need to be concluded based on compensation for farmers in the event of possible losses."
"At the same time, I support an agricultural policy which is orientated as much as possible to ensuring access for EU agricultural products to third country markets."
"The purpose of promoting products with an EU regional label is to make them well known outside the EU, which, by extension, would boost their consumption."
"According to recent studies, the world's population is growing at a much faster rate than global cereal production."
"The EU has many regions which have the capacity required to utilise more efficiently their cereal production potential and are capable of making an effective contribution to narrowing these differences."
"In its favour, this report has the merit of showing concern for overseas citizens and advocating food security."
"I am aware of that."
"However, this report endorses the 'active promotion of the European Union's agricultural interests', free trade areas and trade agreements between the EU and Chiquita or Dole."
"Even worse, it explicitly threatens Argentina with sanctions for taking decisions that I would recommend for my own country."
"I am voting against the report."
"Agricultural products are an essential part of international trade and must therefore be treated as such."
"Therefore, there is no doubt that the constant increase in food prices as a result of increased commodity prices is an increasingly pressing concern for the EU."
"On the other hand, the agricultural sector also has to satisfy the food needs of an increasingly large number of people, despite being faced with increasingly limited natural resources and high prices of the factors of production; to this can be added concerns relating to the environment and conservation of natural resources, which can lead to distortions of competition, mainly in developed countries."
"In view of future needs, there is no doubt that agriculture will become a strategic sector - I would even say a crucial sector - for the economic development of the EU and the whole world."
"Since agriculture is not simply an economic activity, and since agricultural and food policy must be in the service of essential objectives such as food supply and food security, the main challenge is the efficient harmonisation of commercial and non-commercial considerations."
"The EU is the largest importer of agricultural produce from developing countries, and imports more than the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand taken together."
"If we allow these countries to gain increased market access, it could have detrimental effects not only on European farmers, but also on those developing countries most in need."
"For this reason, the EU should take a more balanced approach between the various sectors during trade negotiations, and should promote both its defensive and offensive agricultural interests."
"The agricultural sector of the EU plays a special part in the Europe 2020 strategy with regard to the various socio-economic challenges."
"The EU's commercial policy has an important and decisive role in ensuring that agriculture continues to deliver a positive contribution to the fulfilment of our objectives."
"I agree that commercial policy must not impede the dynamics of the EU's agricultural sector, and for this reason, I voted for this report."
"I did not vote in favour of this report on agriculture and international trade since it hinges on the central element of EU trade policy: free trade agreements."
"It is true that there are positive points in the report which deserve special treatment, such as the singling out of the outermost regions in order to guarantee their food sovereignty."
"Despite that, this report endorses the active promotion of EU agricultural interests without taking into account the imbalances with its trading partners and the commitment to free trade areas without accounting for the harmful impact on the people in those regions."
"Furthermore, the report explicitly threatens Argentina with sanctions for implementing protectionist measures."
"For these reasons, I abstained."
"Despite the fact that food prices have been continually increasing for some time now - and apparently the price of some agricultural products is about to rocket as a result of the capriciousness of the weather, rising fuel prices and agricultural speculation - prices in the shops bear no relation to what small farmers get for their hard work."
"Moreover, EU producers can scarcely compete on price in the world market because our social, quality, animal protection and environmental standards are so high - the very standards that we are unable or unwilling to check when importing foods."
"If we do not want our rural areas to continue to decline and the numbers of farmers to continue to reduce, posing a serious threat to the self-sufficiency of the EU Member States, then it is high time we stopped paying agricultural subsidies to the big agricultural concerns and instead gave the money to those who really need it in order to survive - in other words, to small farmers."
"If that is not possible in the centralised EU, then renationalising agricultural subsidies is the only way forward."
"The report fails to make a clear commitment to small and medium-sized farmers, many of whom find themselves slaving away for a pittance."
"That is why I abstained."
"I voted against the European Parliament resolution on agriculture and international trade because I believe that it entirely subordinates the Union's trade policy to agricultural policy, when it is well known that only trade policy can guarantee our industry, our services and even our agriculture access to external markets; this access is crucial to economic growth and job creation in the Union."
"If, in the future, we continue with the political orientation running through this resolution, it will become practically impossible to conclude trade agreements with countries or regions with significant agricultural sectors, such as Brazil or India, for example."
"Common trade policy - which affects the entire Union and all the Member States - cannot be completely at the mercy of the interests of the agricultural sector, which, in fact, affects a limited number of Member States."
"I also find it regrettable that this resolution includes accusations against Brazil that are completely unfounded, as has been amply demonstrated from the Brazilian side."
"There is a close link between the future of the CAP and EU external trade policy."
"They are two realities which cannot be considered in isolation and to which the European Union must pay particular attention."
"We cannot separate the trade discussions from their impact on agricultural production in the Member States."
"Therefore, I am in favour of a liberalised market that also takes into account the requirements of the EU's economic and trade partners."
"At the same time, however, I believe that agricultural policy should be included in the negotiation of the agreements for monitoring the quality of products exported to or imported by our markets and protecting European producers and our food supplies."
"Consequently, I am in favour of the Papastamkos report."
"However, an imbalance has developed in some areas of trade due to the distribution of responsibilities between the agricultural and trade committees of this Parliament, which should work in synergy to define a contractual balance applicable to the various commercial treaties within the EU agricultural sector."
"I voted in favour of Articles 49, 53 and 54 for the following reasons."
"With regard to the first article, it is absurd for negotiations to be conducted with Mercosur based on a 12-year-old mandate."
"With regard to Articles 53 and 54, I wish to remind you that European farmers have to comply with the highest standards of quality, food safety, environmental protection and animal welfare."
"I think that we ought to have the same requirements from all our trade partners, not only for the sake of European farmers, but also for the sake of consumers, who need to be protected."
"At today's plenary sitting in Strasbourg, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on EU agriculture and international trade."
"Many events have been observed in recent years which indicate a deterioration in the state of EU agriculture; inter alia, a significant drop has been recorded in the EU's share of global exports of agricultural products."
"The trade deficit in agricultural products is also growing, and the EU's numerous concessions have not been reciprocated."
"In view of the above, it is essential for the EU's agricultural policy and its common trade policy to decide on and agree joint directions for the areas of agriculture, trade and development."
"The document we have adopted sends out an important message in defence of the food sector in the EU."
"It condemns the European Commission's over-willingness to compromise, and stresses that decisions to open up to new markets must not have a negative impact on EU farmers."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on EU agriculture and international trade."
"The EU is the largest importer of agricultural goods in the world, but its share of global agricultural exports is declining as a result of the growth of other key agricultural trading partners and world market prices, which are low while the Union has high production costs."
"The EU is the world's biggest importer of agricultural goods from developing countries and it is therefore necessary to protect the interests of EU farmers and provide for a mechanism to compensate them for their losses."
"EU farmers must be protected from unfair competition and therefore, the same standards that apply in the EU's agricultural sector must also apply to products exported from third countries."
"These conditions must be included in bilateral trade agreements."
"Furthermore, there must be comprehensive support to obtain market access in third countries for EU products."
"I believe that the Commission's proposal to grant Pakistan a zero-duty tariff rate quota for exporting to the EU 100 000 tonnes of ethanol per year for a period of three years will not provide direct and immediate assistance and will have a negative impact on the EU renewable energy industry."
"In view of the fact that Ukrainian cereal production is highly competitive and enjoys reduced tariffs, the Commission must be more careful about applying concessions in negotiations with Ukraine."
"The report on agriculture and international trade focuses on the trade agreements between the EU and third countries with regard to agricultural products."
"The European Commission, which has been criticised on several occasions with regard to agricultural policy, is condemned by the European Parliament in this report for arriving too often at conclusions that are unsustainable for European agricultural policy."
"I voted in favour of the report because I consider the political role of Parliament, which the Commission avoids consulting when trade relations with third countries are being discussed, to be indispensable."
"I agree with the request for the Commission to suspend the agreement with Mercosur until a new agreement has been drafted with the countries concerned, in order to guarantee high quality, safe products for European consumers, as well as value for money on foreign markets."
"I voted for this report as it clearly defends the interests of European farmers in the context of international trade."
"I believe that external trade policy should not damage the EU's ability to maintain a strong agricultural sector and guarantee food security in a context of increased market volatility."
"Nevertheless, it is not unusual for the Commission to sacrifice agriculture's interests in order to achieve better access to third countries' markets for industrial products and services."
"In addition to the above, it is also important to bear in mind that the European agricultural sector is obliged to meet the highest standards in terms of quality, product hygiene, sustainable production methods, animal and plant health and welfare, traceability, pesticide residue control, veterinary medicine and additives; these aspects increase production costs and should be taken into consideration during multilateral and bilateral negotiations."
"In general terms, I believe that decisions that further open up the EU market to agricultural imports should not be taken without prior impact studies and guarantees that EU farmers will be compensated for their losses."
"The common agricultural policy (CAP) is a symbol of European integration, representing one of the most advanced forms of EU supranational decision making."
"The internal EU pressures towards making the CAP market-orientated and greater emphasis on other European policies are equally reflected in the EU's external trade policy aimed at opening up the agricultural market in exchange for improved access for European industrial products and services in third-country markets."
"This also involves preserving the European agricultural model, as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market."
"The multifunctional role of the European agricultural sector can serve as a catalyst for new paradigms: food security, safety and quality at an affordable price for EU citizens."
"There is a rise in global food demand against a background of higher production costs, worsening volatility in agricultural markets, less land, less water and reduced energy inputs."
"A strong common agricultural policy is also fundamental to the preservation, environmental sustainability and economic development of EU rural areas against the threat of land abandonment and rural depopulation."
"Today in plenary, we voted on the agriculture and international trade report."
"The report by Mr Papastamkos states that international trade policy must not jeopardise the EU's ability to ensure food security against a background of market volatility, or to ensure the preservation of a strong European agricultural sector."
"The report condemns the approach adopted by the Commission in making concessions on agriculture in order to obtain enhanced market access in third countries for industrial products and services."
"The report expands on various issues, including the impact assessment, financial compensation, the WTO/Doha, but especially on problematic bilateral trade agreements, such as those with Morocco, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Mercosur in particular."
"It also considers it unacceptable for the European Commission to be resuming talks without publishing the impact assessment and without initiating a proper political debate with the Council and the European Parliament."
"in writing. - Given the impasse in the multilateral trade negotiations, the EU has pursued the negotiation of bilateral and interregional trade agreements, as complementary to the multilateral framework."
"As in the case of Morocco, there is currently severe competition between the US and the EU as to who will enter first - and under which conditions - into key new markets."
"My colleague, José Bové, has been able to clearly question the approach of these bilateral agreements in the case of Morocco in his report in INTA which might lead to a rejection of the agreement as proposed by the Commission."
"We have voted in favour."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe it strengthens the position of agricultural policy, a cornerstone of European economic and social cohesion, not least from the point of view of the challenges presented by the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Up to now, the European Union has been the world's largest importer of agricultural products, particularly those sourced from developing countries."
"In the last 10 years, imports into the EU have almost doubled in value; they alone account for 20% of world imports."
"In view of this situation, we need to establish a European trade policy that is strong and which implements Article 208 TFEU, which stipulates that Europe must cooperate in implementing growth policies in developing countries."
"The priority now is to ensure that trade policy and European agricultural policy work together in a global context, facilitating access to the markets of developing countries, while, at the same time, enabling them to foster economic development through these practices."
"I want to stress how important this report is, especially in the context of reforming the common agricultural policy."
"I think that there needs to be coherence between the CAP and trade policies."
"Unfortunately, it has happened on very many occasions that trade agreements with a number of third countries have caused major harm to Europe's agricultural sector and its farmers."
"However, I hope that this situation will not arise again in the future."
"I also want to point out that our farmers are obliged to comply with very high standards in terms of quality, environmental protection and animal welfare."
"We should get producers from third countries who export to the EU to comply with the same standards too, to guarantee fair competition."
"In today's vote, we saw support for the report on agriculture and international trade, which dealt, to a large extent, with imports of genetically modified foods and feeds into Europe."
"I am very pleased that there was also support for the point calling on the Commission to resolutely protect EU regulations concerning the approval and marketing of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) against the demands being made in the WTO."
"Essentially, this means that the use of GMOs will remain strictly regulated, and this will improve food safety as well as the situation of our farmers."
"There was also support for a number of points concerning taxes on imports of various groups of agricultural products, as well as quality requirements on these products."
"In addition to GMO-related issues, general issues of food safety were also discussed."
"For example, Brazil has thus far not managed to consistently meet EU producer and consumer standards on food safety, animal identification and traceability, animal health and disease monitoring."
"Another issue of concern is the extensive use of pesticides in Brazil that are banned in Europe and the importation of the resulting products into Europe. Thank you."
"in writing. - I, on behalf of the EPLP, did not support the report on EU agriculture and international trade."
"While the report makes some valuable points on protecting the interests of our agricultural industry, e.g. the need to protect geographical indications within bilateral and multilateral agreements, I am of the opinion that the report includes parts which are too protectionist and which set unrealistic conditions on current and future EU negotiations on trade agreements."
"Additionally, the maintenance of protectionist measures within the EU as a means of shielding EU agricultural producers from external competition is out of step with the EPLP's position on CAP reform."
"We have always argued for the removal of trade barriers to promote a more efficient and competitive agricultural sector, to deliver a better deal for the consumer, and to present market access opportunities for less economically developed countries."
"I voted in favour of paragraphs 53 and 54 of the report on EU agriculture and international trade because I think that it is the duty of Members of the European Parliament to defend European farmers and consumers from the danger that would be presented by massive exports of poor quality agricultural products, particularly products originating from certain Latin American countries."
"We must not sacrifice the quality of our agricultural products on the basis of purely commercial considerations."
"I welcome the adoption of the report by my fellow Member, Mr Papastamkos, which states the basic criteria which should guide European Union negotiators, and which emphasises that non-commercial aspects should be better integrated into the negotiations."
"Likewise, we can no longer accept a situation in which our livestock farmers, who are constrained by very strict environmental and health standards (particularly relating to production hygiene, sustainable production and animal welfare), are sacrificed at the altar of international trade, victims of unfair competition and shameful distortions of competition in relation to third countries who put products onto the European market which do not respect the production conditions imposed by the Union, and who do not face any consequences for doing so."
"I also call on the Commission and the European Parliament to show the utmost vigilance when it comes to agreements involving Mercosur in particular, which clearly threaten European livestock farming."
"Balance between agricultural, development and common trade policy is crucial for the European Union."
"The European agricultural sector merits particular attention."
"The common agricultural policy is the oldest common policy and must be kept robust."
"I would remind you that this sector fulfils many roles and it needs to be related with other social and political objectives, such as the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Nevertheless, European agriculture does not exist in isolation from European external relations, specifically as regards international trade and development aid."
"The importance of international relations, not least through agreements such as that between the EU and Mercosur, is reflected at the economic, political and strategic partnership levels."
"That is why it is essential to promote consistency of standards, in particular, as regards agricultural issues."
"I therefore voted against paragraphs 53 and 54 of this report."
"In addition, free trade agreements expose the sector to new challenges and different realities."
"I would cite the situation of the outermost regions, which have fragile economies based essentially on farming products similar to those of our Latin American partners."
"As a Member from one of the outermost regions, I would stress the importance of taking into account the specific characteristics of these regions, and of attempting to avoid compromising their development during future negotiations."
"I voted for the report on EU agriculture and international trade because some coherence needs to be established between EU policies in the areas of agriculture, trade and development."
"EU agriculture has an essential role to play in providing employment and maintaining vitality in rural areas, while the European agri-food model is a strategic component of the European economy."
"Global food demand has grown due to the impact of climate change, higher production costs and a reduction in the area of farmland available and in drinking water resources."
"I wish to stress the importance of the trade in agricultural products for economic development and eradicating poverty."
"I call on the EU to adopt measures to support the countries hit hardest by the food crisis."
"The EU's share of global agricultural exports is declining."
"In this context, I think that the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement is of paramount importance."
"This is why the European Parliament should be closely involved in all the negotiations."
"We call on agricultural imports to the EU to provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of consumer protection, animal welfare, environmental protection and minimum social standards as those provided by European production methods."
"I wanted to use my vote to restate my firm position: we must not sacrifice our agricultural model at the altar of commercial considerations."
"The aim of opening up and liberalising trade between the European Union and its partners must not lead us to revise the food quality and safety demands we make to protect consumers."
"This is why I wanted to make clear my desire to see reciprocity of trade, health and social rules applied in our agricultural dealings with third countries, and not to accept additional concessions without guarantees."
"In the same way, I reject the idea that we should lower our guard when it comes to defending the interests of European farmers."
"If Europe has managed to establish a close link between its agriculture and its territory and to achieve a level of excellence in its agricultural production, it is thanks to the work of farmers."
"It is therefore our duty to ensure fair competition in trade relations between the European Union and its partners."
"That is why I am calling for the introduction of protection mechanisms for farmers at European level to help them to deal with any potential distortions of competition."
"I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Papastamkos on EU agriculture and international trade."
"As an Austrian, I am well aware of the problems facing our farmers from first-hand experience."
"European agriculture is one of the main foundations of the European Union, our shared culture and our living space."
"The rapporteur calls on the Commission to represent the EU's agricultural interests more forcefully and proactively."
"The EU is the world's leading importer of agricultural products."
"It is absolutely essential that we ensure that imported products meet the same high quality standards as the agricultural products originating from within the EU."
"I am voting for this report because I agree that it is necessary for the Commission to include suitable and specific measures to support farmers' improvements to crop rotation in the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"Reducing the protein deficit in the EU should be an essential element of the reform of the CAP in favour of Europe's farmers and internal market."
"Such measures are extremely useful given that protein crops currently occupy only 3% of arable land and the fact that the EU imports 40 million tonnes of protein crops, representing 80% of internal consumption."
"Protein imports represent the equivalent of 20 million hectares cultivated outside the EU, or more than 10% of the European Union's arable land, but these crops are not subject to the same health and environmental requirements as European crops."
"The shortages of imports impose an additional cost burden on the livestock and feedstuffs sectors, putting the economic viability of domestic meat production at risk."
"Rebalancing the supply and consumption of cereals, proteins and oilseeds in the European Union would have major economic benefits for farmers and the food and feed industry, as well as for improving the variety of healthy, high quality food for consumers."
"Furthermore, in the context of climate change, protein crops can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the assimilation and fixation of nitrogen in the soil, with the consequent reduction in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser."
"These crops also help reduce soil acidification, improve its structure, reduce the use of herbicides and encourage greater biodiversity, assisting pollination."
"I voted for this report because I support improving the balance between the production of plant and animal proteins, as well as the use of native protein crops."
"Seventy per cent of the protein and oil crops consumed today by the European Union are imported, mainly from Brazil, Argentina and the United States."
"As these producers are not always subject to the same environmental, health and GMO regulatory constraints as European producers, the European Union has decided to review its policy regarding proteins and to increase internal production of protein crops."
"This would allow European consumers to benefit from food which is healthier and more varied."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution."
"There has been a decrease in protein crop production in the European Union in the past ten years, while our market has, to a large extent, become dependent on imports."
"This situation was caused by previously established international trade agreements, which allowed the EU to protect its cereal production and, in return, allowed duty-free imports of oilseed and protein crops into the EU."
"This created the conditions to import the production required cheaply and to ensure the competitiveness of agriculture, in particular, the livestock sector."
"However, within the EU itself, farmers and processing businesses lost interest in this sector."
"The number of plant protein research programmes dropped, the development of disease resistant and highly performing varieties stopped and throughout Europe, practical experience in protein crop production is being lost."
"Today's situation with constantly fluctuating prices on the markets and the high price of protein feed may have a negative impact on the EU livestock sector, which is largely dependent on imports."
"The Commission should immediately consider measures to promote the production and storage of protein crops in the EU, and provide support to farmers growing such crops, which should be reflected in the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"This would facilitate the recovery of this sector, safeguard incomes for farmers, and contribute to sustainable farming in the EU."
"The dependence of some European sectors on markets outside the EU is a problem that concerns not only raw materials, but also feed."
"In particular, Mr Häusling's report highlights the fact that more than 40 million tonnes of crop proteins, mainly soy beans and corn gluten feed, are imported annually into Europe, representing 80% of the EU's crop protein consumption."
"In view of this state of affairs, I can only vote in favour of the requests made by Mr Häusling, who hopes that the future CAP will see Europe encouraging agricultural policies aimed at ending this dependence on imports, which will obviously have a positive impact on quality control and the sustainability of the supply chain."
"Given the decline in production of protein crops in the EU over the last 10 years, we urgently need to combat the risk of dependence on the international markets and the volatility of their prices."
"I therefore support the mentioned reforms of the common agricultural policy to introduce new provisions which, in addition to supporting farmers in the improvement of crop rotation systems, promote scientific services and research supporting protein seed crops."
"I should also like to mention the importance of a decentralised approach to research programmes that takes into account farmers' local knowledge and sustainable agriculture systems."
"I therefore support the Commission's proposal to consider the re-establishment of an agricultural research unit in the General Directorate for Agriculture and Rural Development."
"According to data included in this report, production of protein crops in the European Union has declined 30% over the last 10 years."
"However, the rapporteur says that 'Overall EU protein crop production currently only occupies 3% of ... arable land ..."
"In spite of public support ..., production of dried pulses ... has again decreased to roughly one million ha in 2008."
"More than 40 million tonnes of crop proteins ... are imported annually, representing 80% of the EU's crop protein consumption'."
"These figures should be enough to draw the attention of the political leadership and justify a change in policy."
"At a time when food prices are hitting historic highs, putting food security at risk, the European Union, which is reviewing its common agricultural policy, cannot fail to look at the problem of protein crop production and try to find a solution."
"This will have to involve an increased commitment to these crops which, as well as reducing imports, improve the contribution of agriculture to environmental protection, as protein crops can significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions."
"In line with data recently published by the European Commission, production of protein crops in the European Union has been declining enormously, in the region of 30%, revealing that something has gone wrong with the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"This situation obliges the EU to import more than 40 million tonnes of protein crops and is a result of longstanding agreements that permit the importing of oilseed and protein crops exempt from customs duties, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Blair House Agreement."
"Recent climate change has brought this subject onto the agenda and I consider it an important element of the CAP reform that is expected soon."
"The cultivation of protein crops, along with extended rotation of other crops, brings great benefits, not just in environmental terms, but also because it reduces costs by enriching soils in terms of nitrogen."
"I am voting for this report, which aims to reduce the protein deficit in the EU, and I hope that its recommendations, such as support for farmers intending to opt for protein crops and practice crop rotation, will be taken into account when the new CAP is being drawn up."
"The protein deficit in Europe and the imbalance between animal and plant protein production constitute a problem that has been getting worse, affecting changes to human consumption habits, food quality and security, and the crisis faced by livestock farmers."
"The rapporteur presents figures that are enlightening and worrying."
"These figures require attention to be paid to the problem and that measures be taken to solve it."
"The roots of these imbalances lie in the agricultural and trade policies in force, and no solution will be found without profound changes to both; the report makes no mention of this."
"Overcoming the present deficits and imbalances must be based on support for increasing and diversifying protein crops, and on a policy of gradually replacing imports."
"The report acknowledges this need and suggests some important measures that we consider positive, such as the creation of market conditions favourable to local production, sale and consumption, and the promotion of models for short supply chains free of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)."
"However, at the same time, it opens the door to solutions that we view with concern and cannot accept, such as lifting the zero tolerance for the presence in imported feed of GMOs, which puts the strict application of the precautionary principle at risk."
"This report seeks to respond to the problem of the protein deficit in Europe, and to the imbalance between animal and plant protein production."
"As we know, these constitute a problem that has been getting worse, affecting changes to human consumption habits, food quality and security, and the crisis faced by livestock farmers."
"The roots of the imbalances lie in the agricultural and trade policies in force, and no solution will be found without profound changes to both; regrettably, the report makes no mention of this."
"We would argue that overcoming the present deficits and imbalances must be based on support for increasing and diversifying protein crops, and on a policy of gradually replacing imports."
"Although the report acknowledges this need and suggests some important measures that we consider positive, it nonetheless opens the door to solutions that we view with concern and cannot accept, such as lifting the zero tolerance for the presence in imported feed of GMOs, which puts the strict application of the precautionary principle at risk."
"Importing protein from third countries is a major problem insofar as equivalent requirements are not guaranteed for imported legumes."
"These protein crops are mainly used in animal husbandry, which puts the price system at risk, since the volatility of these prices on the international markets increases exponentially."
"I therefore agree with Mr Häusling on the need to continue to reduce the EU's dependence on imports."
"The 'EU protein deficit: what solution for a long-standing problem?' report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has come up with a number of excellent solutions for dealing with the protein crop deficit in the EU, such as revising the Blair House Agreement with the USA, which permits protein crops to be imported duty free from the United States."
"Other solutions include the introduction of protein crops in crop rotation, or a strengthening of research and consultation, and the expansion of seed development and infrastructures for protein production."
"Unfortunately, a majority of members from three groups, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, tabled amendments that go against this clear position adopted by Parliament."
"They are calling for imports of protein crops, particularly soya, to be made easier, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are prohibited in the EU."
"Unfortunately, these amendments were passed with a narrow majority in a plenary vote in Parliament."
"However, I am convinced that calling for increased imports of GM soya is counterproductive to our actual objectives of strengthening the EU's self-sufficiency."
"This position does not reflect the wishes of a significant majority of people in Europe, who reject the use of GMOs in agriculture."
"I note with regret the voting pattern and have decided, in my capacity as rapporteur, to return the report."
"I voted in favour of this document, because CAP reform must include adequate and reliable new measures and instruments which support farmers in improving crop rotation systems so as to substantially reduce the current protein deficit and price volatility."
"The protein deficit in the EU is gradually increasing, and the EU only grows 30% of protein crops used for animal feed."
"Protein crops currently occupy only 3% of the EU's arable land and therefore, the EU is forced to import 70% of these crops for animal feed."
"The extended use of protein crops in crop rotation offers major agro-environmental and climate mitigation advantages."
"Regarding climate change, leguminous varieties can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions through assimilation and fixation of nitrogen in the soil and thus reduce the use of nitrogen fertiliser."
"With a higher percentage of protein crops in crop rotation, soil fertility and structure, nutrient storage and the health of the crops which follow is improved."
"Permanent grass-clover mixtures for animal feed and mixtures of cereals and proteins cover soils better and so reduce nutrient run-off into groundwater and rivers, as well as offering better conditions for bees and other pollinating insects."
"Extended crop rotation reduces the need for crop protection intervention and can contribute to the conservation of diversity in wild and cultivated species and varieties."
"The production of protein crops has declined dramatically in the European Union in recent years."
"As a result, we are now worryingly dependent on imports to a great extent."
"For this reason, I would like to thank the rapporteur for calling on the Commission to take steps in the medium to long term to address this problem."
"However, as long as the European Union is unable to provide sufficiently for itself, we should also consider changes in relation to our import provisions."
"A technical solution for minor traces of GMOs in imported protein products could ensure that the European market has sufficient supplies of soya available."
"As it stands, the policy on high protein crops in Europe works to the disadvantage of farmers and producers, who are forced to pay quotas for them which are dependent on turbulence in the global market."
"It also works to the disadvantage of consumers, who buy meat and milk from animals fed with high protein feed."
"Area-related and climate conditions have made it possible for the production of high protein plants in the EU to undergo structural changes, and such changes can even be considered advisable in connection with biodiversity and measures to counteract climate change."
"Feed imported from third countries is not subject to such rigorous checks as European feed, and so we cannot be 100% sure of its quality, or know the exact origin of the raw materials from which it is made."
"We should therefore take prompt measures to change this situation, since the guarantees we have given that European food will be safe, healthy and of high quality will otherwise be proved empty words."
"The next step we take to resolve the EU's protein deficit should be to relax the regulations banning the feeding of animals with meat and bone meal."
"In the case of poultry and pork, there has not been found to be any risk of diseases spreading as a result of this method of feeding, and after all, the ban on meat and bone meal was originally introduced in connection with BSE."
"Making it possible to use meal in animal husbandry will reduce production costs, which is extremely important in view of the drop in profitability of meat production."
"It would also allow us to reduce imports of high protein feed from America."
"Many studies show that the protein deficit in the European Union has markedly increased in the last ten years."
"For this reason, the European Union's dependence on imported protein has increased."
"Many sectors run the potential risk that, as a result of price volatility on the international market, they will be unable to obtain supplies of protein crops at reasonable prices."
"Unfortunately, when trade agreements with other countries were concluded several years ago, unfavourable competitive conditions were created for the cultivation of protein crops in the EU."
"We are experiencing the consequences of these ill-considered decisions today, which is why it is important to understand what happened, so that we can mark out the direction we need to take to overcome the protein deficit."
"We are currently actively engaged on a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"The focus here is on support for active farmers, protection of the environment and the development of rural life."
"However, where CAP reform is concerned, we ought not to forget other matters too."
"It is emphasised in this resolution that greater use of protein crops in crop rotation significantly improves the agricultural environment and helps to mitigate climate change."
"I consider that these arguments are sufficiently persuasive for us also to resolve protein deficit issues within the framework of CAP reform."
"The EU is hugely dependent on animal feed imports in the livestock sector because it does not produce the feeds it requires itself."
"Seventy percent of the protein rich crops required for animal feeds are imported from Brazil, Argentina and the US."
"This problem is clearly outlined in the report on this protein deficit and stringent standards are called for in relation to feedstuffs."
"Imported goods must also comply with quality, environmental and social standards."
"In addition, the raw materials suitable for the production of feed must be used more efficiently."
"It is important that our enormous dependence on third countries should be reduced as this is responsible for price volatility and a lack of transparency in terms of production conditions."
"This will only succeed if we in the EU take the production of protein crops into our own hands again, as this report proposes."
"However, I am clearly opposed to the cultivation of genetically engineered crops in Europe's fields."
"To state that protein crop production currently occupies only 3% of the EU's arable land and supplies only 30% of the protein crops consumed as animal feed is to describe a reality that most people find very difficult to understand."
"The reduction in the supply of protein crops is paradoxical at a time when protein crop production is producing a number of positive effects that are necessary for the agricultural ecosystem, beneficial for the quality of final livestock products and important for keeping market prices in check."
"The debate, which has already started in committee, is fundamental in order to redefine the role that protein crop production will play in the context of the future challenges for European agriculture."
"I refer to the fight against climate change and the correct use of natural resources, which are being given due attention at this stage in the drafting of the framework of the future CAP."
"I supported this report, which I believe symbolises a new phase that must start now in order to reduce the protein deficit."
"I regard as a priority the creation of a specific framework programme for decentralised agricultural research so as to improve cooperation, share best practices and accelerate the process of improved breeding of locally adapted protein plants, making this an innovative area in the various Member States."
"The last decade has seen a decline in plant protein production in the EU."
"Protein crops currently occupy only 3% of the European Union's arable land and supply only 30% of the proteins used for animal feed."
"I support the rapporteur's opinion stating that this situation must change as this will be beneficial for human health, as well as for the environment and biodiversity."
"The European Commission should draft a report on the possibilities and options for increasing domestic protein crop production in the EU by means of new policy instruments."
"It is also useful to establish a mechanism for monitoring the origin of protein crops imported into the EU."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which draws attention to the EU protein deficit and the need to rebalance that deficit, but I oppose measures that would mean increased subsidies for farmers to ensure EU protein production."
"My view is that encouraging domestic protein crop production needs to be done in line with a reformed CAP which sees the EU moving towards sustainable farming and greater market orientation and, importantly, moving away from trade-distorting subsidies."
"The decline in the cultivation of protein rich crops and the replacement of domestic production by cheap imports on a massive scale may ultimately have a negative impact in the form of loss of know-how regarding actual cultivation techniques."
"It may result in a considerable reduction in research into the cultivation of these crops in a domestic environment."
"I also consider it important to retain sufficient variety in terms of the selection or range on offer of these products."
"As is the case with many reports or proposals negotiated by Parliament, the need for high quality products is also mentioned here."
"In relation to the products previously mentioned, it is also necessary to inspect actual samples, and to integrate this with verification of locally used agricultural processes and resources."
"Quality verification should be carried out very carefully and thoroughly when importing, through the use of modern laboratory methods and unambiguous identification of the origin of goods."
"For most EU countries, there are some typical crops."
"In the Czech Republic, for example, it is peas, which have a long-established tradition."
"Cultivation of peas is now in decline, however."
"The opinion of the Czech Republic is generally favourable towards the report submitted."
"The production of protein crops in the European Union is experiencing an ever more significant decline, which makes the situation alarming."
"The protein deficit causes imbalances not only in agricultural production but also in the research and development of agricultural techniques."
"Farmers, in fact, have gradually lost interest in protein crops, resulting in the loss, at a European level, of practical experience related to these crops."
"There is therefore a need to follow up on the urgent situation described in the report and to formulate a truly integrated European strategy."
"It is only possible to respond to new challenges such as climate change or the loss of agricultural biodiversity if there is a more balanced supply and consumption of protein crop products within the EU."
"We therefore hope that the European Commission will examine possibilities for overcoming the current protein deficit emergency via a radical reform of the common agricultural policy, which will make it capable of meeting the new challenges."
"It would also be appropriate to introduce a supplementary payment if farmers use a mandatory rotation of at least four different crops, including at least one protein crop."
"Lastly, it would be necessary to establish a unit for agricultural research at the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development at the Commission, to motivate consumers and catering services to make more environmentally-friendly food choices."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on the EU protein deficit."
"Europe depends largely on imports of protein crops, which are mainly used for animal feed."
"Along with this dependence come increased risks connected to the volatility of prices on the international markets."
"In order to combat this phenomenon, we are proposing that the common agricultural policy reform should include the introduction of new provisions to assist farmers in improving crop rotation systems, investment in research on protein crop seeds, and improved training of farmers in crop rotation and mixed farming."
"The Haüsling report was a good one."
"Increasing the protein independence of the Union, promoting shorter supply routes and helping farmers contributing to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are all measures that I support."
"However, the pro-GMO lobbies and their representatives have succeeded in converting this report into a plea for allowing contaminated food to enter Europe."
"The report also advocates a return to animal meal, with all the risks that it involves."
"It is time to relocate the production of plant protein crops."
"In its new form, this report does not enable us to do that."
"I will vote against this report if GMOs and animal meal are approved by this Parliament."
"It is essential to increase production of protein crops - plants rich in protein - with the goal of reducing dependence on imported soya, maintaining food security and benefiting the environment."
"There are scientific studies available demonstrating the environmental benefits of protein crops in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as of biodiversity and soil quality improvements."
"It is of great concern that only 3% of European agricultural output is of protein crops."
"It is unacceptable that we import 80% of our requirements."
"It is therefore very important that measures be taken to change this situation within the framework of post-2013 common agricultural policy aid."
"The Häusling report on the protein deficit in Europe and the search for solutions introduces some positive elements such as aid to farmers that contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions."
"Despite this, I voted against the report as the text clearly argues in favour of genetically modified organisms and totally opens the doors of Europe to contaminated food and animal-based meal on European territory."
"in writing. - The report asks the Commission to include in the CAP reform adequate and reliable measures and instruments to support farmers in improving crop rotation."
"It requests a legislative proposal which authorises processed animal protein from slaughter offal for the production of feed for monogastric animals (pork and poultry)."
"If such authorisation is provided, what will change?"
"It is impossible to control the banning."
"Why spend time on a report that is unnecessary and not easy to comprehend just to put a 'tick' for a rapporteur?"
"I abstained since I do not vote for unclear, 'cooked-up' initiatives."
"Protein crops are an important part of the animal feed industry and are therefore a significant economic factor."
"However, the cultivation of protein crops is an issue that has generated little positive interest in Europe."
"Over the last 10 years, there has been a decline of up to 30% in such crops, the only exception being soya, where the decline has only been 12%."
"Only 3% of arable land in the EU is used in the production of protein crops."
"As studies show, this not only leads to significant economic disadvantage because it results in an 80% import quota, but also brings disadvantages in the area of agriculture."
"This is because the cultivation of protein crops enriches the soil with nitrogen, subsequently promoting fertility."
"The research sector is also suffering under the low level of demand for seed for protein producing crops."
"The downward spiral has already begun."
"I voted against this report because I fear that it may hamper the cultivation of traditional seed."
"in writing. - The general thrust of this report advocates that rather than import protein from third countries, we should encourage farmers to produce it here in Europe."
"This view ignores the fact that, due to natural constraints, Europe is simply not able to produce the quantities of soya and maize necessary to meet the demand of our farmers at a viable price."
"Affordable imports of protein from third countries such as the US are crucial if we wish to ensure food security and create conditions in which farmers can earn a decent living from agriculture."
"Furthermore, the report refers to the fact that we should explore the possibility of using animal protein as a source of animal feed."
"After our experience with BSE, I do not believe that we should go down this route, nor do I believe that this is necessary if an adequate supply of soya and maize is available to farmers."
"For these reasons, I voted against the report."
"I voted for this report, which highlights a series of significant problems with the way in which European agriculture operates."
"However, I think that we should focus more on solutions."
"In this respect, we need to be more open to using the most recent, state-of-the-art scientific solutions from the biotechnology sector."
"The report supports the use of genetically modified organisms and bone meal."
"In general, animal protein should only be permitted in animal feed if all scientific evidence and controls are in place that prevent negative effects (I would remind you of the BSE scandal)."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The protein deficit in the EU is a relevant and important issue."
"Given the fact that this problem is deeply rooted in the EU and protein shortages are constantly increasing, we must make every effort to ensure that this problem is addressed as soon as possible and the production of local protein crops is increased."
"I believe that this resolution is an important step towards solving this problem."
"The growth of protein crops not only mitigates the impact of climate change, but also has a positive effect on farmers' incomes."
"Furthermore, it is an important factor strengthening the EU's livestock sector, given the fact that it would reduce the sector's dependence on protein crop imports and would increase competitiveness."
"I believe that the Commission must take immediate action to stop crops with even a low presence of GMOs from accessing the EU market."
"We cannot allow even a low level presence of GMOs in protein crops for food and feed imported into the EU."
"I agree with the proposals to support research into the breeding and supply of protein crop seeds and for a framework for rural development measures which introduce improved, decentralised facilities for the production of animal feed."
"I believe that crop rotation must be actively promoted in the EU by giving financial support to farmers and this would reduce the current protein deficit and price volatility."
"I voted for the Häusling report because it advocates a supply of proteins for animal feed, which has been contributing for a long time to a lack of competitiveness in European agriculture."
"There has been a worrying deficit in the production of protein crops in the European Union over the last 10 years and the situation now is one of considerable decline."
"The main dried pulses decreased by an average of 30%, and soybean production by 12%."
"This trend increases the already existing alarming dependence of the Union on imports of protein crops, which are mainly used for animal feed, and carries major risks, especially for the EU livestock sector."
"The problem is made worse by the fact that price volatility on international markets has substantially increased."
"It is a priority for the Commission to quickly ensure an unhindered supply of soya to the EU market by providing a technical solution regarding the low level presence of genetically modified organisms in protein crops for food and feed imported into the EU."
"Insufficient soya imports impose an additional cost burden on the EU livestock and feedstuffs sectors and jeopardise the economic viability of domestic meat production."
"Protein crops currently occupy only 3% of the European Union's arable land (excluding fruit and vegetables)."
"The production of dried pulses fell by roughly 1 million hectares in 2008."
"More than 40 million tonnes of protein crops, mainly soya beans and corn gluten feed, are imported annually, representing 80% of the EU's protein consumption."
"The arable land cultivated outside the EU for protein imports to the EU represents 10% of the EU's arable land, which is 20 million hectares."
"Regarding the EU's commitments to contribute actively to global food security and to combat vigorously climate change, the future agriculture and rural development policy must promote more balanced plant and animal protein production so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the run-off of nutrients into watersheds, as well as motivate consumers, public procurement authorities and catering services to choose a more balanced, environmentally-friendly and diverse range of food in their diet."
"The Commission must present legislative initiatives to reduce food waste throughout the food chain, including slaughter offal and swill, which is still not adequately regulated."
"Yesterday, I voted against the report on the protein deficit in the EU because I believe that this problem cannot be resolved by allowing genetically modified products to be imported into the EU."
"The fact is that 80% of our protein crop requirement already has to be imported."
"The original intention of the report - the instigation of measures to increase the indigenous production of protein crops so as to combat the decline in protein production in the EU - has been fudged."
"The genetic engineering lobby has clearly succeeded in promoting a positive attitude to genetically modified protein imports, which has made its way into the report through amendments that were unfortunately adopted by the majority in plenary."
"Even the rapporteur was forced to vote against his own report."
"As a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, I, along with my party colleagues in Parliament, favour a policy of zero tolerance for genetically modified organisms."
"In today's part session, the report on the EU Protein Deficit by Mr Häusling was adopted by vote."
"The EU is heavily dependent on imports of protein crops, which are used mainly for animal feed."
"This involves significant risks, particularly for the European livestock sector."
"A series of compromise amendments has improved the initial report considerably."
"The report that has been adopted calls on the Commission to opt for a medium- and long-term vision of a policy for protein crops and asks for the reform of the common agricultural policy to introduce new provisions that support farmers in the improvement of crop rotation, as well as to reduce the deficit of plant proteins and price volatility."
"The report also calls for research studies on seeds and their contribution to disease control."
"The report asks the Commission to guarantee an unimpeded supply of soya beans into the European market, providing a technical solution to the low level presence of genetically modified organisms for food and feed imported into the EU."
"in writing. - Key points in the report are: to create a framework for the cultivation and use of protein plants in the EU in order to replace the import of protein crops from third countries; to abandon the Blair House Agreement and to improve crop rotation in the framework of CAP reform; to generate a new scientific approach and to improve training and facilities for farmers."
"The result of votes in the AGRI Committee was satisfying except for the introduction of a number of amendments by ALDE and the EPP 'contaminating' the report with amendments promoting GMOs."
"The interested GM industry had been lobbying to ease the zero tolerance policy of the EU, which does not allow non-authorised GM feed to enter the EU."
"Unfortunately, in plenary, we could not decontaminate the report on protein deficit from the GMO zero tolerance attack."
"But the majorities in plenary were much closer to our position than in the AGRI Committee."
"So it is worth trying hard to reverse majorities in plenary on GMO issues."
"Häusling (Green) resigned as rapporteur."
"The latest estimates on the protein crops sector reveal a disturbing trend over the last decade of reduced production of protein crops in the European Union."
"Each year in Europe, the production of pulses falls by 30% and that of soya beans by 12%, resulting in the need to import 40 million tonnes of plant protein."
"The content of this report shows that the European livestock sector, which is vulnerable to price volatility, is too dependent on the ability to access imports of plant proteins."
"This dependence jeopardises the economic profitability of domestically produced meat and is increasingly weakened by the additional costs for imports of feed, notwithstanding the fact that - in addition to the economic problem and in anticipation of climate targets - the production of protein crops would contribute substantially to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."
"In recent years, the cultivation of pulses has suffered a decline in production, resulting in heavy dependence on imports from third countries, as they are used to feed both humans and animals."
"As well as reducing the European Union's protein deficit, once their products have been harvested, these crops are an excellent additive for the soil, which therefore requires less chemical fertiliser."
"Good farming should include crop rotation, thus reducing the intervention of fertilisers and maintaining species diversity among wild and cultivated varieties."
"The request, which we support, is for the future common agricultural policy to establish measures to overcome the Union's protein deficit by constantly reducing protein imports."
"I voted for this report because it highlights the importance of restricting dependency on imported protein, especially as this dependency poses major risks for the European Union's livestock sector."
"However, I want to point out that GMOs are not the only solution for decreasing dependency on proteins imported from third countries."
"There are substitutes available for genetically modified soya, which could help provide protein requirements such as field peas, broad and field beans, lupins, lentils, chickpeas, not to mention lucerne/alfalfa and clover, which can, at the same time, substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"The potential for growing protein crops, such as soya, in the new Member States, Romania and Bulgaria, should not be ignored either."
"The rapporteur's initial report was better than the text which has now been adopted."
"That is why I voted against the final text."
"Asking the Commission at this time to ensure an unimpeded supply of soya to the EU market by finding a technical solution for the presence of small amounts of GMOs in protein crops intended for use as feed is, to all intents and purposes, handing a major victory to the intensive agriculture lobby."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance advocates maximum development of the EU's own protein crop production."
"Such a policy would be good for farmers' incomes and make a substantial contribution to combating climate change, to the preservation of biodiversity, and to soil fertility."
"What is crucial is to put in place a mechanism whereby we can monitor the origin of imported protein crops and thereby inspect the sustainability of the agricultural practices applied in the country of origin."
"Regular spot checks are absolutely necessary."
"The debate on reauthorising processed animal proteins from slaughterhouse waste to be used in the production of feed for pigs and poultry may only be conducted in terms of (food) safety and public health."
"Bans on intra-species recycling and forced cannibalism are crucial, as are reliable inspections in the animal feed sector and the correct application of existing EU legislation."
"I thank my fellow Member, Mr Häusling, for his important report, even if I am disappointed by the final version, which is why I, like the rapporteur, voted against the report in the end."
"On the one hand, I regret the fact that the report was spoiled by the inclusion of the zero tolerance issue. The call to relax conditions on unauthorised imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) does not resolve the problem of the protein deficit in the European Union and should therefore not have been discussed."
"On the other hand, we absolutely must mitigate the considerable decline in protein crop farming in the Union and thus reduce our dependence, which is already alarming, on imports of plant proteins."
"I would like to make a clear denunciation of the Blair House agreements, the market-oriented objectives of which have contributed to extreme price volatility."
"Furthermore, those agreements completely contradict the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives concerning global warming."
"For the future, in the context of rational and responsible soil management, we need to integrate protein crops into the crop rotation cycle."
"I voted in favour of adopting the Häusling report."
"I am glad that Mr Häusling has raised the issue of the protein deficit in Europe and provided us with important information on this subject."
"It is evident that the matter requires urgent action."
"Protein is one of the most important components of our daily diet, and a lack of protein can lead to serious health problems."
"What is more, as is apparent from the research presented in the report, the cultivation of high protein crops and widespread application of the principle of crop rotation would reduce production costs and cut greenhouse gas emissions."
"Given the poor eating habits of the citizens of the European Union's Member States, as well as European farmers' lack of experience of cultivating high protein crops, I believe that we should concentrate, first and foremost, on education."
"I am thinking here, above all, of making people more aware of the positive impact of protein on human health (the School Fruit Programme is an example of a programme with a similar aim currently being implemented within the European Union), and also of developing an incentive system for farmers cultivating high protein crops."
"I am voting for this annual report on gender equality in the EU in 2010 and the recommendations it includes."
"The current crisis has had devastating effects for women, even though the professional sectors dominated by men have been hit hardest."
"I would also stress that there is still an inequality in terms of salary of around 18% between men and women, even though there are more women graduates than men."
"Of the necessary measures suggested, I would stress the development of equality plans and combating domestic violence by establishing a European year dedicated to the issue."
"Today, we celebrate the centenary of International Women's Day, a symbol of the struggle for the achievement of social equality and of liberation from the discriminatory and oppressive behaviour that women have suffered, and still continue to suffer."
"In every single country in the world, there is a different perception of the female; there is much talk about Islamic countries and the way in which women are judged and treated, which is further influenced by religion."
"Fortunately, even though we in the West have a vision of man and woman being equal, the facts describe a disturbing situation."
"In Europe, many inequalities still persist to the detriment of girls and women, in terms of employment, their private lives, health and their right of access to education and vocational training, and to fill positions in non-traditional sectors and positions that have a high level of responsibility."
"However that is not all: women not only face multiple forms of discrimination, but they are also victims of violence of all kinds, both psychological and physical."
"It is therefore necessary to protect women and put them in a position where they can lead lives which are qualitatively equal to those of men."
"Gender equality is not just a matter of social justice but is one of the preconditions for achieving the objectives of sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion established in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Women from the working and grassroots classes, young people, immigrants and refugees have nothing to gain from the show being put on for them, or from the wish lists and lies being trotted out by the plutocracy, in order keep a grip on the capitalist system of exploitation and cheap labour and increase the profit of capital."
"It is clear from life itself that the plutocracy's claim that equality between men and women is allegedly being promoted within the framework of capitalist barbarity and EU policy is deceitful and insulting."
"The anti-grassroots policy of the EU, of the bourgeois governments, of the IMF and of other imperialist bodies, is striking a blow at the rights won by women."
"Mass unemployment, drastic pay cuts and cuts to social benefits, flexible forms of employment, an increase in the retirement age, flexible contracts of employment and the commercialisation of the social services of health, welfare and education are together exacerbating the living conditions of women and of the working and grassroots family as a whole."
"The EU 2020 strategy, economic governance and the budgetary discipline of the IMF and the ECB hold new anti-grassroots, anti-labour measures in store for women."
"This policy must be overturned."
"We call on women to step up their fight, to join the working class trade union movement, and to rally round the objectives of grassroots power and a grassroots economy."
"I agree with several points raised by this resolution, which I supported during the vote."
"Thus, for example, the analysis which says that countries where men and women are treated equally on the labour market have benefited in terms of their socio-economic development seems to me to be fully justified."
"In my opinion, the promotion of equality between women and men is an obvious requirement from a social, but also from an economic, point of view."
"Equality between men and women constitutes one of the fundamental principles of EU law."
"The European Union's objectives consist, firstly, of ensuring equality of opportunities and treatment between the two sexes and, secondly, of combating discrimination on the basis of sex."
"Despite all the efforts made as regards equality between men and women, even today, inequalities continue to exist in this area in the European Union."
"The employment rate among women (58.6%) continues to be lower than that of men (70.7%), even though the majority of students and university graduates are women."
"Only one in every 10 board members in EU businesses is a woman, and only 3% of executive directors are female."
"The average disparity between the wages earned by men and those earned by women in the EU continues to be 18%."
"In order for Europe to attain its sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion objectives, it will have to continue combating the inequalities that still exist between men and women, which is why I voted for this report."
"The annual report on equality between men and women is an opportunity to highlight the challenges which we face in these times of economic and social crisis."
"This report, which has been adopted on International Women's Day, should be seen together with Mrs Plumb's report on female poverty in the European Union."
"Indeed, women are among the categories of people said to be vulnerable and who suffered the full impact of the crisis."
"Since they more often work part-time than men, because they carry out what can be casual work in the tertiary sector, because they have fragmented careers, because, even today, they are less well paid than men for the same kinds of jobs, and because their pensions are lower as a result, we need to make sure that women are constantly the focus of our attention."
"The most sensitive issue in this report concerned quotas for women on the boards of large companies, both private and public."
"Of course, quotas are not a panacea, and in an ideal society, we would like to do without them."
"In order to change people's mentalities, however, there is no doubt that quotas are necessary."
"In its annual report for 2010, the European Commission highlighted the challenges facing Europe as a result of the recent economic and financial crisis in terms of equality between men and women."
"One important consequence that this crisis has had for women concerns employment: women were affected later than men because more of them worked in sectors that have withstood the effects of the crisis for longer (health, education, etc.)."
"Now, however, even these sectors are at risk of being affected, bringing with it long-term insecurity for working women compared to men."
"Partly for this reason, I believe that equality between men and women in employment should no longer be merely a goal to pursue, but must become a reality."
"The commitment of Member States and of the Commission is therefore necessary not only so that the policy of equality between men and women can be maintained but, above all, so that the budget expenditure allocated to them is not revised downwards."
"Finally, because I believe that the promotion of equality comes through the education and training of citizens and, in particular, of young people, I would draw the Commission's attention to the opportunity for timely renewal of the campaigns to raise awareness on this issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, equality between women and men is one of the fundamental pillars of the development of an efficient social and market economy, as Europe has always loved to call itself."
"I am therefore convinced that we must ensure, by all possible means, that women are offered the same treatment and the same professional opportunities as those that are guaranteed to men."
"However, I cannot support or vote in favour of the strategy proposed by Mrs Nedelcheva because I believe that starting from the central role of the problems experienced by a single ethnic group, rather than from a systemic analysis of all options, is not a methodological approach which is appropriate and decisive."
"I voted in favour of this report and am pleased that the European Parliament has drawn special attention to gender equality issues."
"We must recognise that we still have a lot of work to do to improve women's position in the field of gender equality, in the labour market and in politics."
"Women's rights issues must be included in all areas of European Union policy and fine ideas and initiatives should not simply remain on paper, but must be implemented in all European Union Member States."
"In the European Parliament's report on equality between men and women in the European Union, we therefore established that it is crucial to eliminate the gender pay gap, to stop violence against women and trafficking in women, guarantee maternity leave and create suitable conditions to take advantage of the services of nurseries and childcare centres and reduce female poverty."
"As for gender equality in business, attention should be drawn to the fact that only 3% of companies are chaired by women, because they face discrimination and obstacles preventing them from climbing the career ladder and pursuing leadership."
"An increasing number of MEPs agree with the introduction of a quota system, because if companies themselves fail to introduce changes to improve gender equality in business, there are plans to anchor quotas in legislation."
"I hope that, in future, we will find solutions and measures which will strengthen gender equality and equal opportunities for women in the family and society."
"On this subject, I voted against because, although I agree with a number of the points adopted, there are aspects that should be removed in my opinion."
"Following the crisis that we are experiencing, women's conditions of work and access to jobs have become difficult."
"I therefore agree with the issue tackled in the European Commission's report on the need for gender equality to be integrated into all policies, as well as into the education of European children from the very beginning."
"Violence against women must continue to be combated and prevented through public information campaigns and teaching in schools."
"Nevertheless, I do not agree with quotas in the private sector, lists of vulnerable women, or the guaranteed minimum wage, which I consider impossible to implement."
"On 8 March, International Women's Day, I would congratulate Mrs Nedelcheva on her report on equality between women and men."
"I agree with her assessment that women have been particularly affected by the economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing."
"All the indications are that as regards, inter alia, employment, health, education and social support, women will feel the consequences more and for longer than men will."
"As regards income, working and recruitment conditions, and access to employment, the situation of women seems to be deteriorating more quickly than that of men."
"As such, it is important to create new opportunities and strengthen equality synergies between the genders, which will contribute to stimulating recovery and to economic growth itself."
"As 2010 was European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, I welcome the reference to combating poverty, paying particular attention to the most vulnerable women."
"I find it regrettable that the Left in Parliament has brought the controversy of abortion into this too, without a care for what Union jurisdictions are."
"in writing. - I welcome this report on equality between women and men, which renews the European Parliament's call for the creation of a European Year to fight violence against women, estimated to affect between 20 and 25% of all women in the course of their lives, and calls for a directive on violence against women."
"The economic crisis has serious consequences for women, who are at greater risk of poverty than men."
"Indeed, on average, they are paid 18% less than men for equal work in the EU, a figure that rises above 25% in some Member States, and are more likely to be precariously employed and/or employed part-time."
"Moreover, women are less likely to be re-employed when they lose their jobs."
"As a result, they enjoy lower pensions later in life."
"Tackling gender stereotypes is necessary but not enough."
"Countering such disadvantages obviously requires serious public investment in care facilities."
"However, the Barcelona Council targets for childcare are yet to be attained, affecting lower income families the most."
"We have to empower more women at all levels of political representation in Europe."
"Gender equality is not only a matter of justice but also an imperative for social and economic development."
"I welcome the vote on this report on equality between men and women."
"In terms of remuneration, for example, and despite continued legislative efforts on the subject at European level, women still earn 18% less on average than men for the same work in the European Union."
"I would also like to emphasise that we had to battle for a long time within this Parliament merely to ensure that such a basic right as access to contraception could be mentioned."
"This kind of rearguard debate does little for the reputation of the European right."
"Luckily, the final report is a good one."
"It sets the objective of reducing the pay gap to less than 5% by 2020 and, in particular, calls on the Member States to do all they can to enforce the principle of 'equal pay for equal work', with sanctions for non-compliant States."
"It calls for binding objectives to ensure equality in corporate, administrative and political positions of responsibility."
"Today, 8 March 2011, the centenary of International Women's Day, Parliament had a duty to adopt, by a large majority, this report on equality between women and men in the Union for 2011."
"Although the principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we cannot help but notice that this remains an unrealised objective."
"Whether in terms of jobs, where far more women than men carry out casual work, in terms of pay, where women earn, on average, 18% less than men for positions of the same responsibility, or in terms of career prospects, the female gender is still held back by the famous glass ceiling."
"Women are also penalised when they have children."
"The list of grievances is still a long one."
"The report voted on today includes specific responses such as the establishment of binding objectives for the Member States, and sanctions for non-compliance, and the introduction of quotas (a necessary evil) to increase our aspirations to equality a little."
"Our hope is that one day, it will no longer be necessary to dedicate a particular day each year to more than half of the global population."
"As I have already said in this House, 'Men and women need to be treated fairly, giving them the same rights but taking their respective needs into account."
"In the case of women, this is particularly pertinent in areas such as maternity support, the reconciliation of work and family life'."
"I am therefore pleased to discover here, inter alia, concern for protection of maternity rights and for support for older people at home, which are tasks that often fall to women within the family, making it difficult for them to find work."
"Nonetheless, although I acknowledge that some of the rapporteur's visions are very insightful, I do not agree with her that gender equality can be achieved using quota systems."
"Quotas belittle women, who will end up attaining certain positions simply because of their gender and not on the basis of their skill, ability or aptitude."
"It is therefore unacceptable to want to apply them in private companies."
"Finally, I am a staunch advocate of the subsidiarity principle and believe that many of the subjects analysed in this report, while important and relevant, must remain under the Member States' jurisdiction."
"It is also because of this that I voted against."
"This report aims to contribute to speeding up the process of creating conditions of equality between men and women in the European Union."
"On this day, when we are celebrating the centenary of International Women's Day, I should like to salute all the women who have struggled for acknowledgment of women's rights and for gender equality over the last 100 years."
"I would also express my solidarity for all women victims of violence, and for all those who have recently been fighting in the Middle East and North Africa for the self-determination of their peoples."
"The EU has always been at the forefront of the defence of women's rights, so I welcome the adoption of this report that aims to put an end to many of the discrepancies that still persist, such as wage differences, access to education and employment, difficulties in reconciling personal and professional life, and distance from decision-making positions."
"I therefore hope that the EU will move from theory to practice, and will make it possible for women to show their worth."
"It is particularly significant that the debate and vote on this report seeking to draw attention to the inequalities and discrimination that persist have taken place on International Women's Day, whose centenary is being marked in 2011."
"There have been many struggles fought over those 100 years."
"There have also been many victories."
"However, these have not been enough to eliminate the existing inequalities, the discrimination that persists in accessing jobs with rights, the wage inequality which is reflected in pensions, the difficulty of career progression and professional achievement, and the obstacles to accessing management and decision-making positions in economic, social and political activity; the tendency is for this situation to deteriorate at times of economic and social crisis."
"Women continue to be discriminated against for being mothers and workers, which, well into the 21st century, is scandalous."
"For all these reasons, it is important to continue to demand an end to inequalities and discrimination, which will involve a break with neoliberal policies, and a serious commitment to alternative policies that make the issue of human rights and equality central to EU decision making and policy."
"On this day linked to the struggle of women for recognition and the exercising of their rights, what is striking is the worsening unemployment situation and the number of unstable jobs, along with low wages and discrimination in terms of wages and motherhood that assail women workers."
"These take on expressions that are particularly shocking and unacceptable in the younger generations, as is happening in Portugal."
"The consequences are increased poverty amongst women."
"The situations of disabled, immigrant and retired women, and of low paid women workers, are particularly critical, as well as those of women in rural communities who live alone with their children."
"The majority of the more than 85 million people living in poverty in the European Union are women."
"The poverty rate amongst women has exceeded 18%."
"Preventing the taking, under the pretext of the crisis, of measures threatening women's right to equality, and to the necessary economic and social cohesion, is therefore a crucial issue."
"It is time to prioritise women and their rights, equality, and economic and social cohesion, so that we can have a better society and so that we can truly respect human rights and consolidate the progress that women have helped to build for our civilisation."
"Equality of opportunity and non-discrimination do not mean abolishing and negating the differences and the complementarity between men and women in their natures, their aspirations and their way of seeing the world and life."
"Pointing this out is not peddling stereotypes."
"When pushed to the very limit, your philosophy of not distinguishing between the sexes only leads to absurdity."
"It leads to absurdities such as this 'right', in inverted commas, for women to work nights - or to be obliged to do so."
"This is a regressive step in social terms."
"It is your right."
"It leads to absurdities such as the French decision granting men free terms for their pension, a right which, until now, was reserved for women and which compensated - a little - for the career problems that motherhood and the time devoted to bringing up their children might have caused them."
"This is absurd, because it threatens the very existence of this advantage for women."
"Also absurd is the very recent decision of the European Court of Justice stipulating that statistical differences recorded between men and women must not be considered in the calculation of insurance premiums, even though they form the basis of risk calculation."
"Ladies, this marks the end of the small financial advantage you enjoy for being more careful drivers and for living longer."
"Where will the Talibanism of 'gender equality' end?"
"in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this report, especially since it promotes - in a very determined and concrete way - the fundamental principle of equality between women and men."
"It is disappointing that, despite numerous efforts and studies on the subject, some national law makers are still neglecting the destructive effects of discrimination, further aggravating gender inequalities and endangering fulfilment of the Lisbon strategy goals."
"In light of the persisting gap between men and women in terms of employment rates, working hours, wages and access to management positions, I call on Member States to better implement anti-discrimination and anti-harassment practices."
"It is necessary to engage stakeholders at grass-roots level, through information campaigns, use of NGOs, and also by more formal instruments such as including special provisions in collective agreements and national legislation relating to gender equality."
"I am in agreement with the various issues highlighted in the report, such as strengthening inclusion measures in favour of women and ensuring their presence in positions of responsibility, promoting employment and fair distribution of income, creating higher quality jobs, ensuring access to high quality public services and improving social welfare."
"Having said that, however, I cannot support paragraphs which make reference to the promotion of abortion."
"I am very pleased at the adoption of this resolution on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day."
"Indeed, although the principle of equal pay for men and women is enshrined in the EU Treaties, we can see today that women earn 17.8% less than men."
"This inequality permeates all areas of society: for example, only 3% of major companies are chaired by a woman, and women are most affected by unemployment and casual employment."
"Hence, the alarming observation that in 2008, 17% of women in the 27 countries of the Union were considered to be living in poverty."
"Other measures are still necessary, such as a better distribution of family responsibilities and better protection of women from domestic violence."
"All these figures prove that it is now necessary to introduce binding measures."
"For this reason, therefore, I decided to vote in favour of establishing quotas, even though I was, in principle, opposed to the idea, and establishing policies of positive discrimination in the economic and political spheres."
"We must recognise today that we will not achieve real equality without policies based on a real will to change the situation."
"Each year, International Women's Day provides an opportunity to take stock of women's rights and gender equality in the European Union."
"There have certainly been significant improvements, but it is clear that we have not yet fully achieved this equality, neither in reality nor in people's minds."
"Equality, however, is a prerequisite for realising the EU's objectives of growth, employment and social cohesion."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report, which stresses the need to target the consequences of the crisis for women and to remedy them."
"It also stresses the role of education and calls on the European Union to combat female poverty and all forms of violence towards women."
"I think that another fundamental point in this report can be found in paragraph 66, which affirms the right of women to easy access to contraception and abortion."
"Let us remember that in 11 countries of the Union, abortion is still not fully authorised."
"I agreed with this report, because the current economic, financial and social crisis is having disastrous repercussions for employment, living conditions and our societies at large."
"Women have been severely affected by the crisis, particularly in terms of their working conditions, their access to employment, their place in society as a whole and gender equality."
"Whether on the boards of publicly listed companies or in the world of politics, women must be able to attain posts in line with their skills."
"Women are sometimes denied access to positions of responsibility, leading to a mismatch between their levels of training and their status."
"As 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty, particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of women."
"Specific measures should be taken to stop women who are vulnerable on account of a disability or their status as immigrants from falling into precarious situations, and to facilitate their integration into society."
"The promotion of equality also involves combating violence against women."
"All forms of physical, sexual or psychological violence, however serious, must be combated and condemned."
"As we mark the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, I would like to convey my greetings to all women."
"in writing. - I voted against the call to easy access to abortion in paragraph 66 of the original text."
"Whereas I recognise the individual's right to decide on his/her own body, I underline that any decision to undergo abortion also means deciding to end the life of another human being."
"Furthermore, if this decision is made, it should always include the consent of both parents (except in cases of serious illness, rape)."
"Calling for easy access to abortion is therefore misleading and gives society the message that abortion could be used as contraception and need not take any moral and ethical values into account."
"In today's European society where people are better informed and have easier access to healthcare than ever before, we must support responsible behaviour, which includes taking responsibility for one's actions."
"Calling for easy access to abortion is contrary to taking such responsibility."
"Abortion is too often used as an easy way out of a difficult situation."
"The EU should not support such behaviour, but should give subsidiarity to the Member States."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which notes that there is a need to strengthen the gender dimension in the fight against poverty."
"As 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty, particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of women."
"Specific measures should be taken to stop women vulnerable on account of a disability or their status as immigrants or minorities falling into precarious situations, and to facilitate their integration into society."
"I agree with the conclusions of the report, both as an MEP and as a doctor."
"The damage caused by the anti-social policy of most EU Member State governments will sooner or later become apparent in the health of many socially weaker groups of citizens, and particularly women."
"I was led to support the previously mentioned report by concerns for the healthy development of Europe's current and future population, which is directly proportionate to the quality of health and full social equality of women."
"If we care about Europe's future, in other words, the viability and development of the EU, we cannot try to solve its problems without securing equality for women."
"To underrate this issue is to ignore the rights of 50% of EU citizens."
"Ultimately, this may mean alienating many citizens from the EU, despite the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy includes a solution to these problems."
"The EU is made up of men and women."
"They embody its potential and its creative development."
"As long as poverty and social exclusion apply to almost one in six citizens, as statistical investigations in the EU show, it is up to us, as MEPs, not only to challenge the Commission and the Member States, but also to mount effective pressure for the implementation of the specific measures adopted in the fight against poverty and against anti-social cost-cutting measures, and to limit further decline in the social area, particularly with respect to women."
"The financial crisis that we are currently experiencing is having disastrous repercussions on the rate of unemployment and the living conditions of our fellow citizens in general, and women in particular."
"Just think about their working conditions, their access to employment or their position in our society."
"In its report for 2010, the European Commission rightly highlighted the challenges that await us in the field of equality between men and women, stressing that this crisis must be understood as an opportunity for us to reconsider the specific roles of men and women in our society, particularly through a strategy for their full integration in all policies."
"This ideal of equality should be achieved by means of concrete, lasting measures notably concerning education."
"We stress the importance of the role of women in decision-making positions, which are traditionally the preserve of men."
"The promotion of equality also involves combating violence against women."
"All forms of physical, sexual or psychological violence, however serious, must be combated and condemned."
"Combating gender-based violence entails launching awareness-raising campaigns and teaching children and young people about the horrors of this violence."
"I voted for this report because it stresses the need to prioritise the elimination of wage disparities between men and women, and advocates the 'equal pay for equal jobs' principle."
"I also voted for it because it calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to prioritise support for binding measures instead of non-binding strategies on gender equality, and to pay particular attention to groups of vulnerable women: disabled women, older women, migrants, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals, women belonging to ethnic minorities, and women with little or no education and dependents in their care, disabled women and single mothers."
"It also acknowledges the need for women to have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, specifically through easier access to contraception and abortion."
"I would also condemn all violence against women."
"Unfortunately, this report is necessary this 8 March 2011."
"The annual report on equality between women and men this year focuses on the effects of the economic crisis on the female population, highlighting when they affect existing critical areas."
"Mrs Nedelcheva has chosen to follow the path of the proposal and not merely that of claims and of victimisation."
"The starting point for targeted action is an analysis of economic data from the female labour market, all of it negative."
"The evidence from previous surveys shows that the greater socio-economic weakness of women has an impact on the overall economy and produces quantifiable losses for the system."
"From this there follows a course of action to put in place which, although designed to reduce disparities, is directed at the general public because it contains systemic measures."
"I do not agree with the part of the report about the promotion of sexual rights of women, particularly where it reaffirms the intention to make abortion 'easy' -especially in light of the House's vote against the oral amendment from Mr Silvestris - which aimed to introduce a reference to the protection of the unborn child."
"This is a sensitive issue that cannot be proposed with slogans of doubtful interpretation."
"I do not accept that the freedom of women and the attainment of social progress is achieved through abortion."
"The Nedelcheva report makes a painful observation about the Union's progress in relation to equality between women and men."
"It is sad that we have had to wait until 8 March for it to be remembered that 50% of European citizens are female, and that their right to equality is being flouted throughout Europe."
"I welcome this report on account of its stated desire to introduce binding measures to enforce equal rights."
"Nevertheless, I regret the fact that it boasts about the Europe 2020 strategy and retirement at 64, and that it states that 'the family is a cornerstone of our society'."
"The cornerstone of our society is citizenship and the law."
"I must denounce this process which seeks to make us swallow anti-social and culturally regressive pills bathed in impotent good intentions."
"Today, Tuesday 8 March 2011, I voted in favour of the Nedelcheva report regarding equality between men and women in the European Union."
"This report points out the concern about the insufficient progress made by Member States toward achieving equality between men and women."
"For this reason, the report calls on the Member States to establish mechanisms to combat this inequality."
"Equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the European Union."
"Unfortunately, even today, numerous inequalities persist between women and men."
"Furthermore, the financial, economic and social crisis that we are experiencing has severely affected women with regard to their working conditions, access to jobs, their place in society and pay."
"Equality between men and women in employment really must become a reality."
"Equality policies absolutely must be maintained and, above all, their budgets must not be reduced."
"Equality between men and women must also be included in all policies in the form of specific and sustainable measures, particularly in the areas of education, training and vocational guidance."
"Women must also play an important role in decision-making environments, whether on boards of directors or in political functions."
"Finally, I cannot avoid mentioning the terrible scourge of physical, psychological and sexual violence against women."
"These vile crimes must be combated with all our energy, whatever their level of seriousness."
"On this day, the centenary of International Women's Day, and on the occasion of the vote on this report on equality between women and men, I ask myself what kind of society could deprive itself of 50% of its intelligence and 50% of its energy."
"And yet that is the world in which we live, but we do not want it to be that way any more."
"I would like a general campaign in favour of equality to be announced."
"If we look at the sums invested in the training of young women, we can see that the gaps in people's working life continue to grow."
"That is unacceptable, and it is why I support the report put to the vote: it highlights all the difficulties that women face."
"The battle that we must fight is not a battle of the Right or the Left, but a collective battle in which everyone, women and men, must work together."
"I voted in favour of the articles referring to women's rights with regard to reproductive health and the freedom of abortion."
"As an MEP from a country where pregnancy terminations were banned for more than 25 years, I am fully aware of how important this right is and of the serious consequences of casting any doubt on it."
"What women really need is a genuine freedom of choice in life: They must have the certainty that none of their decisions will be given a lesser value."
"An important step in this direction would be to introduce family tax splitting in all Member States so that the establishment of a family does not become a poverty trap."
"However, establishing women's quotas is the wrong move."
"We need to begin in the areas where women suffer genuine disadvantage: we need to look at the position of unpaid carers, at part-time employment, and at the plight of the many women who work hard to cope with the demands of family and career."
"This report does not deal with any of these issues, which is why I have voted against it."
"The annual report on equality between women and men for 2010 underlines the need for a European commitment to ensure gender equality at a time of economic crisis which threatens to undermine the efforts made so far to support women's rights."
"Unemployment and recession risk widening the gap between men and women in the workplace."
"Therefore, the report from Mrs Nedelcheva focuses on the points where work can be done to prevent discrimination: ensuring financial and economic justice for all citizens, hence, with reference to remuneration, incomes and pensions; working for an increase in women's quotas for better representation and to secure personal rights."
"However, I believe that in so doing, one must respect the principle of subsidiarity and some of the typical national characteristics which I believe should be defended and protected."
"The current situation of generalised crisis that we are experiencing affects the majority of Europeans, but women most seriously."
"In this context, it is to be feared that the great, but slow and painful, victories that women have won in the EU could go significantly backward which, apart from obviously affecting them directly and unfairly, would also affect our societies, which are always healthier and have more robust prospects for development when they ensure gender equality."
"It is therefore important to continue to invest in equality policies, not least by implementing equality between men and women in terms of working conditions, of levels of income, of access to work, and their place in society in general."
"As regards equality policies, action needs to come from two different perspectives, which must be made and kept complementary: one in which, from the outside in, conditions are created for gender equality to exist and another, from inside out, in which conditions are created for the emancipation of women from what is making them inferior."
"That said, and despite agreeing with many of this report's statements, I abstained from the final vote because I do not accept generalised free access to abortion, or the assumption that abortion is a method of contraception, which it clearly is not."
"I voted in favour of this report because it stresses the need to prioritise the elimination of wage disparities between men and women, and advocates the principle of equal pay for equal work."
"It also calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to prioritise binding measures instead of non-binding strategies on gender equality, and to pay particular attention to vulnerable groups of women: disabled women, older women, migrants, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals, women belonging to ethnic minorities, and women with little or no education and with dependents in their care, disabled women and single mothers."
"It also acknowledges the need for women to have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, specifically through easier access to contraception and abortion."
"It also condemns all violence against women."
"This is, unfortunately, a report that is needed on 8 March 2011."
"Positive because adopted: reduce the gender pay gap to 0.5% by 2020;"
"27); application of sanctions for non-compliant Member States (para. 27, originally Greens/EFA amendment in FEMM); binding targets to ensure equal representation of women and men (para."
"53); quota to ensure parity on the management boards of companies, with Spain and France as an example (para. 53); binding targets to guarantee parity between men and women in positions of responsibility in companies, public administrations and political bodies (para."
"Despite being based on assertions which are worthy of endorsement, this report also tends towards a desire to recognise specific categories of citizens, in this case Roma women, who are considered particularly disadvantaged because of discrimination."
"We are opposed to transforming the legitimate demands of women for attention and recognition at work in terms of equal participation in the labour market, wages and access to positions of responsibility, into racial discrimination."
"We do not accept that Member States should pay particular attention to women in the European strategy on Roma inclusion: first, because a measure which deals with equality between women and men has nothing to do with the Roma; and second, because, in our view, if we are talking about people who suffer from discrimination, then it is those citizens who suffer from the often illegal presence of Roma people."
"Accordingly, and also given the demand to facilitate abortion and the imposition of quotas for women, we are voting against the report."
"In relation to paragraph 66: in my opinion, the expression 'easy access' goes too far."
"On the other hand, however, the option of abortion must be left open."
"When voting today, I endorsed many key provisions in the report on equality between women and men in the European Union - 2010."
"I would like to draw particular attention to the issue of parity in business."
"This is an important step towards ensuring that women's positions are equal to men's at the level of company management."
"Our goal is not to make gender the only criterion to be taken into account when appointing people to sit on boards of directors."
"We are, however, interested in ensuring that ambitious women whose qualifications are equal to those of their male rivals are selected for positions normally held only by men, because, as research shows, this may contribute to better and more sustainable management of companies and, as a result, to better financial results."
"I voted in favour of adopting the resolution proposed in the Nedelcheva report since, in my opinion, gender equality is a matter of priority."
"I agree with the conclusions set out by the rapporteur, who believes that measures in the fight against this problem should be stepped up at European level, for example, by creating appropriate strategies and funding instruments."
"I believe that the solutions proposed in relation to education and communication are particularly valuable, as are those which aim to eliminate pay differences and ensure access to managerial positions."
"However, the main initiative in this area continues to lie with the Member States."
"The role of the European Parliament, as the representative of the EU's citizens, is to exert pressure both on the governments and on the European Commission and the EU Council, so that consistent and effective measures are taken in the framework of dialogue with organisations involved in the fight for gender equality."
"The issue of equal rights is being debated ever more widely in Poland, but in spite of the introduction of parity on electoral lists, there is still much to be done, for example, in the social arena."
"In my opinion, impetus from the EU would be particularly valuable for my country."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which aims to tackle gender inequality within Member States."
"It is disappointing to note that on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, my British Conservative colleagues chose not to support this report."
"The report on 'equality between women and men in the European Union - 2010' is of particular importance because today, we are celebrating the centenary of International Women's Day."
"It is quite clear that there are still considerable disparities between men and women in Europe."
"It is necessary to call for binding objectives to be set in order to ensure equal representation of men and women in political positions of responsibility, and also within companies."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report."
"In today's vote on equality between women and men in the European Union in 2010, I voted against, and today is International Women's Day of all days!"
"Several of my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and in other groups also voted against the own-initiative report - each having his or her own reasons."
"Allow me to briefly state my own."
"The most problematic paragraphs as far as I am concerned are those advocating binding targets for the Member States with regard to gender quotas."
"Apart from the fact that this is an infringement of the Member States' self-determination by the EU, I am also opposed to the very idea of quotas."
"As if women are not capable of being judged on their own merit, just like men."
"The text also contains passages concerning minimum income, which, of course, has to be a matter for the social partners to sort out, not for politicians, either at national or international level."
"Altogether, the points referred to above resulted in my choosing to vote against the report, which was nevertheless adopted by the European Parliament."
"I voted in favour of the report on equality between women and men in the European Union in 2010."
"Although 59% of graduates in the EU are women, this proportion is not reflected in political or economic life."
"In the European Parliament, only 35% of MEPs are women, just 15% of MPs in national parliaments are women, and only 3% of boards of directors in the main European companies are chaired by women."
"The representation rates for women are important because this helps encourage women to plan for a career in politics and to apply for a position with political, administrative or financial responsibilities."
"There is a 17% gender pay gap in the EU and there are not sufficient childcare facilities available for children under the age of 3."
"This means that young mothers are exposed more to temporary work contracts or the risk of unemployment."
"I call for measures to be adopted at both national and EU level to promote entrepreneurship among women and also to facilitate access to public and private funding."
"We call on the Commission to encourage Member States to promote in the media, in general, and in publicity and promotional material, in particular, an image of women which will respect their dignity, the diversity of the roles they perform and their identity."
"I voted against the report because it once again seeks to introduce abortion by the back door."
"Otherwise, it is simply a series of platitudes."
"I have voted in favour of the report by Mrs Nedelcheva on equality between women and men in the European Union."
"The equality and equal treatment of the sexes is a fundamental principle for the EU."
"However, permanent public discussion about the number of women in business, the continuing major difference in salary levels and the numerous disadvantages suffered by women in the workplace show clearly that we still have a long way to go until the sexes are equal."
"The Member States are called on to see the crisis as an opportunity to view their policies from a different perspective and to intensify their efforts in this important area."
"in writing. - The ECR Group acknowledges that the fundamental principle of equality between men and women is enshrined in the European Treaties and is something that each Member State of the EU respects and upholds."
"That being said, we were unable to vote in favour of this report for several specific reasons."
"Firstly, we fundamentally oppose the introduction of targets and quotas for women in certain professions being set at EU level; we believe this is something that Member States should do."
"Secondly, we are reluctant to accept issues of conscience in political reports and believe that Member States should legislate on issues concerning abortion and contraception."
"Thirdly, issues regarding employment, such as pensions, retirement age and pay should be determined at national level, and although we are fully in favour of eradicating the gender pay gap, it is not for the EU to set out prescriptive targets."
"I am voting for this report, which stresses the grave situation of 17% of Europe's female population living in poverty, especially mothers and older women."
"It also stresses that in 16 Member States, women are even more exposed to extreme poverty, and to the fact that their contribution to the economy is regularly underestimated and poorly paid."
"It should be remembered that one of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce poverty, and that this can only be achieved through social and employment policies, through reconciliation of family life with work, and through ensuring that all women have the means necessary for a dignified life."
"Women are increasingly exposed to the risk of poverty, especially in the case of groups of women with special needs, such as single mothers, disabled women and older women, who often receive wages and pensions barely above the minimum subsistence level."
"It is not worth repeating that to prevent and reduce the risk of poverty, the equal participation of women and men in the labour market must be guaranteed."
"Unfortunately, European women are four times more likely than men to work part-time, to have fixed-term contracts, and are often part of the black economy, which is characterised by the absence of employment contracts."
"However, the issues related to the feminisation of poverty include not only work but also the lack of childcare and care of the elderly."
"Member States have the responsibility to implement specific programmes to promote the active inclusion or reintegration of women into the labour market and specific opportunities for lifelong learning aimed at providing the required skills and qualifications."
"At the same time, women from disadvantaged backgrounds must be guaranteed equal access to public health systems, as well as gynaecological and obstetric care, and to decent housing, justice, sports and culture."
"This resolution offers an analysis of female poverty that I share."
"There is no doubt that this unemployment is caused by the recent economic crisis, but it is also caused by a variety of factors such as stereotypes, wage gaps between men and women, a poor balance between family life and work life, longer life expectancy, etc. In this respect, I am pleased, as our rapporteur is, that a European micro-financing instrument has been created."
"Its aim is to make micro-financing more easily accessible and available to those women who are finding it difficult to enter the labour market or who wish to become self-employed or set up their own small business."
"Historically, it is women who are most at risk of poverty - especially single mothers and women over 65 years of age."
"It is estimated that there is a 36% poverty level for women, compared with 11% for men."
"In the EU, older women are most at risk - a 22% poverty rate for them compared with 16% for men - because of difficulties they encounter in accessing social security and the pension system."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The rapporteur is correct in saying that the poverty of women is hidden because women comprise two thirds of the 'inactive' population."
"I welcome what the report says about ensuring that women who care for children, patients, the elderly or the disabled do not suffer because of this caring, which is vital for the family and the community."
"There must be proper social welfare provision for those women as they age."
"I agree that the EU's 2020 strategy must improve equal representation and participation in the labour market, and fully support reforms of labour and social policies to ensure economic and social equality for women."
"I supported this report."
"Poverty in the EU remains a huge problem and combating poverty is one of the Commission's five measurable targets proposed for the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The integrated guidelines of the Europe 2020 strategy (promoting social inclusion and combating poverty) are aimed at protecting people from the risk of poverty, and this particularly affects women, one-parent families and elderly people who face a higher risk of poverty than the general population."
"Social security and employment policies play a very important role in reducing the poverty people endure."
"The Member States and the European Commission must agree on more effective measures to guarantee the rights of the most vulnerable groups of society to a proper education with vocational training and university studies, which would allow them to integrate better into the active labour market and halt the risk of poverty."
"I voted in favour of this text."
"This report proposes several measures for combating poverty among women in the European Union."
"I support many of them, such as encouraging the introduction of flexible working hours for women or narrowing the gender pay gap for the same work carried out."
"Women are in a difficult situation."
"They must look after the home, their children and husband, while working at the same time."
"Women are very often victims of discrimination in the workplace or of violence, major problems which are still widespread across the EU."
"The reality is really awful, especially in rural areas and for Roma women."
"In these circumstances, the Structural Funds must be used to set up programmes which will improve women's chances of entering the labour market."
"This action must be backed up by increasing access to micro-finance, as well as by encouraging and developing women's entrepreneurial skills."
"Despite the efforts made in the struggle for equality between women and men, women today are still at greater risk of poverty (17%) than men (15%); this difference is greater in the case of older people (22% of women compared to 17% of men)."
"The greater risk of poverty affecting women is, in part, due to the disparities in wages between women and men."
"This pay gap continues to be around 18% in the European Union, which has repercussions on income throughout life, on social protection and on pensions."
"This report, which deserved my support, calls on the Member States to take into account the gender dimension in their plans for recovery from the recession by promoting and boosting the employment of women, the targeted inclusion in the labour market of flexible hours, wage equality, and the review of tax and pension systems."
"The recent economic and financial crisis has resulted in a series of negative consequences that have affected the standard of living and the working lives of citizens and of women in particular."
"The situation of women emerges clearly from the statistics: nearly 17% of European women live in poverty."
"The year 2010 has been proclaimed the 'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion' so I believe that the activities undertaken during this year should also take into account the risk of social exclusion experienced by women compared with men."
"I also believe that the promotion of a work-life balance, to allow women who wish to pursue their careers or to work full-time, should be a key element in combating women's poverty and in reducing the risks to which women are exposed."
"The Structural Funds and, in particular, the European Social Fund, are key instruments in helping Member States combat poverty and social exclusion."
"Therefore, I draw the Commission's attention to the opportunity to cofinance either specific programmes to promote the active integration or reintegration of women into the labour market or training courses aimed at the attainment of specific professional qualifications."
"I do not intend to vote in favour of this report, not because of its objectives, but because of the methods described by my fellow Member."
"Poverty is a systemic plague for Europe in 2011."
"Faced with the global economic crisis, some groups have surely been harder hit than others."
"However, I am not convinced that an approach based on gender or on separate groups represents the ideal solution to this."
"On the contrary, a problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed by building virtuous circles, which do not favour the few but include all interested parties."
"I voted in favour of this report because we must overcome female poverty that has deepened as a result of the recession."
"Although the economic and financial crisis has had a significant impact on the level of unemployment of both sexes, this crisis has affected women worst."
"During the recession, salaries fell dramatically in sectors dominated by women, or women lost their jobs altogether."
"Furthermore, due to lower salaries, women reaching old age receive lower pensions and consequently, often face poverty."
"Female poverty that has become particularly widespread during the recession, especially poverty among single mothers, has a direct impact on child poverty, because now, around 20 million children in Europe live in poverty."
"Unless specific measures are adopted to help reduce female poverty, it will be impossible to reduce child poverty."
"I would like to stress that we must take the gender dimension into account in both European and national legislation."
"The European Union Member States should develop special programmes for the inclusion of women and to aid their return to the labour market."
"Furthermore, maternity leave must be guaranteed for all women."
"Unfortunately, at present, both motherhood and work in the home, caring for children and elderly or disabled people, are completely denigrated."
"I hope that, in future, the Member States will take appropriate measures to overcome female poverty and value women's contribution to the development of the family, society and the economy."
"I voted in favour of this report, which was approved in this House on the day when we celebrate the centenary of the day dedicated to women."
"According to recent data, even today, 17% of European women still live in poverty and, to make matters worse, they suffer disadvantages in the labour market and in social protection."
"At the same time, women's contribution to the development of the family, society and the economy are regularly undervalued and underpaid."
"According to the annual report of the Commission, women are more exposed to the risk of poverty and, as a result, of social exclusion, particularly older women, 22% of whom were at risk of poverty in 2008, compared with 16% of elderly men and 35% of single parents and other categories of women such as those with disabilities or from ethnic minorities."
"In particular, I agree with the request made by the rapporteur, Mrs Nedelcheva, for a work-life balance or for further measures to be taken to support single mothers."
"I voted for the resolution adopted to combat female poverty through labour and social protection policies."
"However, I would point out a number of repetitions in the text, as well as my disagreement with the points on joint taxation and grants for caring for dependents, which are against the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"in writing. - The ECR Group recognises that a number of points in this report are necessary in order to encourage women into the labour market, for example, flexible working, childcare provisions and maternity leave provision, and we welcome the calls to eradicate the gender pay gap."
"The ECR Group, however, believes that these are policy areas which should be addressed at national level, not EU level."
"The ECR Group does oppose an unnecessary and bureaucratic Women's Charter and any moves towards the harmonisation of social security systems across the EU."
"We have therefore decided to abstain on the final vote on this report and have voted in favour of specific paragraphs which we feel are important, for example, paragraphs 34, 58, 60, 65 and 69."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the authorities need to focus more attention on the vulnerable social groups, which also include women."
"The economic and financial crisis has affected the entire population."
"However, some of its toughest effects have been felt by elderly women, women in rural areas and single mothers."
"The European Union and Member States must consider these factors and help improve the social conditions of these vulnerable groups."
"In this respect, the target of reducing unfair gender pay gaps by 1% every year is justified and must be implemented effectively using a variety of instruments at national and EU level."
"One of the five major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is combating poverty and, as such, it was necessary to analyse poverty amongst women in the EU."
"This report highlights the causes and consequences of poverty amongst women and stresses the importance that achieving gender equality has for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion."
"At the moment, 17% of women in the Union live in poverty, and this figure has increased dramatically in comparison with poverty among men in recent times."
"Therefore, in line with the report, poverty has become feminised."
"The Union and the Member States urgently need, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, to find ways of combating poverty in general, and that of women in particular."
"Efforts need to be made with a view to labour and social protection policies based on gender equality, and with a view to efforts to reconciling family life with work."
"Dialogue needs to be undertaken with social partners and civil society, contributing to achieving an increasingly egalitarian society."
"In 2008, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, aware of the need to raise awareness amongst the public and the Member States of the problem of combating poverty, adopted a decision considering 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"In times of crisis, in war and in genocide, women and children are the ones who suffer the most, so they deserve particular attention from society in general, and from the institutions in particular."
"The European institutions and the Member States are obliged to fight to improve women's living conditions, and to raise awareness in companies so that women are offered better opportunities, as they are a fundamental element of the labour market."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which has confirmed that combating poverty and social exclusion continue to be political priorities of the EU, and I hope that the Structural Funds will be strengthened, in particular, the European Social Fund, so as to combat poverty and exclusion, in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"When pointing out a historic date associated with women's struggle for their rights, the series of social problems faced by women cannot be ignored, particularly those of working women: worsening unemployment and insecure jobs linked to low wages, the pay gap, and discrimination based on motherhood."
"Situations of loss of income are on the increase and women are getting poorer."
"The situations of disabled, immigrant, unemployed and retired women, and of low paid women workers, are particularly critical."
"The impact of austerity measures in some countries, such as Portugal, Greece and Ireland, is having repercussions on the lives of women as workers, citizens and mothers."
"That is the case with wage reductions, the freezing of admissions to university courses, and the blocking of collective bargaining; and with the cuts to healthcare, education, social security and a variety of forms of social support."
"Detailed words and declarations of good intentions regarding the day being pointed out today are not enough."
"What is needed is a real change in the content of the policies from which this situation originates."
"I think that debate, discussion and finding common solutions to the problems of the world of women is always worthwhile."
"However, the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Plumb of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is a constant reference to the Roma community."
"I do not find this tone appropriate and it will certainly not benefit European working women by dealing solely with Roma women."
"I have therefore voted against the report."
"I voted in favour of this report, because we must overcome female poverty that has deepened during the financial and economic crisis."
"Almost 17% of European women are classed as living in poverty; considering the indicators relating to the labour market and social protection, the structural causes of poverty have a disproportionate effect on women."
"During the recession, salaries fell dramatically in sectors dominated by women or women lost their jobs altogether."
"Furthermore, due to lower salaries, women reaching old age receive lower pensions and consequently often face poverty."
"Female poverty that has become particularly widespread during the recession, especially poverty among single mothers, has a direct impact on child poverty, because now, around 20 million children live in poverty in Europe."
"As the contribution made by women to the development of family, society and economy is regularly underestimated and underpaid, it is crucial to adopt measures to reduce female poverty."
"In spite of ubiquitous efforts and information campaigns, women continue to be poorer and discriminated against more frequently than men."
"Such situations occur even in our democratic European Union, which upholds human rights."
"Women earn less than men doing the same jobs and, in addition, they are more likely to be molested."
"They are more likely to be the ones who look after children and, as a result, do not have their own separate source of income or money which they could use for their own development or for a treat in reward for a hard day."
"The people who are bringing up future generations and educating the young people who, in the future, will govern us, provide us with medical treatment, build our bridges and look after us in hospital are not fairly paid."
"First and foremost, legislation should be amended to ensure free access to crèches and nursery schools and opportunities for young mothers to better themselves, and to make it impossible to dismiss women immediately after giving birth or returning from maternity leave."
"Women in rural areas are in the worst situation."
"They live in areas where incomes are much lower than the average for the EU, or even for the country they live in."
"They have no access to cultural services and goods."
"Their work is hard, and they do not always have the opportunity to take a holiday, for example."
"The terrifying spectre of the demographic crisis should mobilise us to take measures without delay in order to improve the situation of women on our continent."
"On such an important day that reminds us how significant the role of women is in modern society, supporting this report can be nothing less than our moral duty to the thousands of women who live in poverty."
"Poverty line, insecurity, inadequate pay, sexual discrimination in the workplace: these are, unfortunately, recurrent expressions which, not only today but every day, we would prefer not to hear and see associated with women."
"Unfortunately, the reality is different and the numbers speak for themselves."
"In all professional fields, in whatever economic activity, one comes across developments that continue to marginalise women through low salaries, social exclusion and a marked difficulty in accessing a normal social life."
"Elderly women, women with disabled children, disabled women, women who cannot find work: they have my support and that of my fellow Members who voted for this report, so that in future, we will not see the expression 'feminisation of poverty' continue to crop up in the media and in European statistics."
"I believe that the Plumb report on female poverty is a huge step towards improving the situation of women in the modern world."
"I therefore voted in favour of adopting the document."
"The issues raised in the report include not only the feminisation of poverty, combining family life and a career, the fight against poverty among elderly women and the impact of violence on the situation of women, but also, and I regard this as extremely important, the use of funding guarantees, employment policies and social protection as ways of fighting poverty."
"in writing. - Although women's poverty is a long-lasting reality, the issue has only relatively recently started to be tackled in a systemic way."
"The current economic, financial and social crisis that affects the European Union, as well as the rest of the world, is generating a series of specific negative effects, directly influencing women's living and working conditions, and their place in society in general."
"This context projected to the top of the European Parliament's agenda the necessity of a gender approach to poverty, in the report on the face of female poverty."
"At global level, women are poor by comparison with men."
"This is also the reality in each and every EU Member State, although one can identify specific differences depending on the country."
"Almost 17% of European women are ranked as living in poverty."
"Considering the indicators relating to the labour market and social protection, the structural causes of poverty have a disproportionate effect on women."
"At the same time, one can say that women's contribution to the development of family, society and economy is regularly underestimated and underpaid."
"The current financial crisis produces specific negative consequences that directly affect the lives of women, their work and their place in society."
"Today, nearly 17% of European women live in poverty."
"Before any political strategy, there should be a comprehensive analysis that considers all aspects of gender: we believe that their integration into the labour market is crucial to tackling poverty and their social exclusion."
"The promotion of a work-life balance, to help women who wish to pursue their own careers or to work full-time, is one of the fundamental factors in reducing female poverty and the risks they face."
"We are asking for further measures to support working mothers, either by making it easier to find flexible forms of work, in terms of working hours, to enable them to fulfil their greater family commitments, or by providing adequate services for children, the elderly and other dependent family members."
"We are convinced that the Europe 2020 strategy will achieve gender integration to improve representation and equal participation in the labour market, breaking the pattern of segregation and ensuring the presence of women in jobs at a higher level."
"On the day when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, we are voting on two reports that address issues why women are still too frequently marginalised and excluded from society."
"Women are traditionally at a higher risk of poverty, especially single mothers and women over the age of 65."
"Among the five measurable objectives proposed by the Commission for the Europe 2020 strategy, there is the fight against poverty, which makes this report extremely topical, especially in terms of gender policies in the light of the economic and financial crisis that is crushing Europe."
"The real vulnerability of the individual woman exposes her to a greater risk of poverty and social exclusion and therefore of isolation, making it incumbent on the institution that we represent to put in place the specific strategies and programmes mentioned in Mrs Plumb's report."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"All indicators show that, at global level, women are poorer than men on average."
"In times of economic recession, people who are at risk of falling into poverty become more vulnerable, and the majority of these are women."
"The report acknowledges that the austerity measures being applied throughout the EU will have particularly devastating effects on women, particularly those already facing numerous disadvantages."
"The pensions of a considerable proportion of European women aged over 65 are a pittance."
"Poverty among women is not just the result of the recent economic crisis, but is also the consequence of other factors resulting from discriminatory gender stereotypes, from the pay gap between men and women, and from barriers to proper reconciliation between family and work life, which is particularly serious in the case of single-parent families."
"These result in the 'feminisation of poverty', which urgently needs to be combated."
"I voted for this report because I find it very difficult to accept that 17% of women still live below the poverty line in Europe."
"The unprecedented economic crisis that has just hit the European Union has only served to make this sad situation worse."
"Time has come, therefore, to underline the importance of this problem and to adopt a package of measures to combat this scourge."
"The European Union and its Member States must put a stop to the poverty and social exclusion of women in Europe, in particular, by ensuring they have access to quality education and jobs, by helping them find a balance between their family life and work life, and by helping to combat the violence to which they, sadly, all too often, fall victim."
"I therefore support this own-initiative report, which highlights one of the failures of our modern democracies: discrimination against women."
"Poverty and equality are two inverse variables in an economic projection."
"Actions aimed at making women fully active also produce a reduction in overall poverty."
"In Europe, more than 17% of the female population lives in poverty."
"The economic and financial crisis has affected - and may further affect - these data, which are already striking."
"The fight against poverty is not always considered part of gender politics and this weakens its importance."
"The work of the relevant committees underlines the importance of taking account of these connections and, on that basis, analyses the possible actions."
"They are located conveniently within the EU 2020 strategy, which defines poverty as one of its five measurable objectives."
"Starting from the three dimensions of poverty - gender, generational and geographical - the report by Mrs Plumb reveals its extraordinary solidity and especially its innovativeness in planning a process that will anticipate the adoption of austerity measures to combat the effects of the crisis."
"The seven areas of interest to facilitate the required systematic approach outlined in the report are well framed in this regard."
"The positive nature of the proposal cannot leave the Commission, the Council or the Member States unmoved, and I expect a well-coordinated response from them."
"Poverty amongst women is a really serious problem that the EU needs to solve."
"The crisis situation that we are facing does not help to tackle this serious problem, but we need to make an additional effort in order to solve it."
"As combating poverty is one of the main objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, everything possible must be done to achieve it, specifically as regards women, less advantaged and older women especially."
"Therefore, what are needed are labour and social protection policies that are concerned with finding solutions for women to be able to reconcile family life and work."
"Dialogue also needs to take place with social partners and civil society in order to achieve a fairer society without differences."
"Today, 8 March 2011, is International Women's Day."
"I voted in favour of this report because preventing and reducing the poverty endured by women is a vital component of the fundamental principle of social solidarity, to which the European Union is committed."
"Female poverty is not only the result of the recent economic crisis, but also the consequence of a variety of factors such as stereotyping, the gender pay gap, the obstacles created by the failure to reconcile family life and work, the longer life expectancy of women and, more generally, the various forms of gender discrimination, which mostly affect women."
"The report urges EU Member States to implement mechanisms to fight poverty, which has a woman's face, and I therefore voted in favour of the text."
"Even though female poverty is a long-standing fact of life, the economic, financial and social crisis has greatly exacerbated this situation and we are witnessing the feminisation of poverty."
"Poverty is one area where gaps between men and women remain."
"The participation of women in the labour market is one means of combating poverty and social exclusion."
"Furthermore, it should be noted that we must, at the same time, encourage equal pay, equal access to positions of responsibility and also the granting of personal rights to pensions and social security."
"Violence against women, including human trafficking and sexual exploitation, is a serious problem that must be eradicated by any means available to us."
"This type of violence is all too often one of the causes of female poverty, after health problems and job loss."
"We must maintain, both at European and at national level, a strong commitment to gender equality and to fighting social exclusion by specific and lasting measures supported by adequate financial resources."
"The problem of poverty in Europe is a persistent negative phenomenon affecting many Europeans and particularly women."
"Ever more women are in need, and up to 17% of women live below the poverty line, according to the latest surveys."
"The position of women in Europe remains unsatisfactory, and the situation is even deteriorating due to the economic crisis and the restructuring of the public sector, which employed the largest number of women before the crisis."
"Within the framework of the EU 2020 strategy, which is principally aimed at reducing poverty by 25%, there should be a greater effort, in my opinion, to look for and develop specific solutions relating to the issue of female poverty."
"I would like to highlight the priceless contribution of women to the healthy development of the family and the raising of children, which must not be unfavourably influenced by discrimination against women, because such undesirable phenomena also have a heavy impact on society itself."
"I therefore support initiatives leading to a reduction in unjustifiable differences and an improvement of the position of women in society, not only within a legislative framework, but also in everyday life."
"in writing. - I have examined the report thoroughly."
"I would like to highlight the main directions in the fight against poverty among women: combating poverty among women by means of employment policy and social protection; the importance of social dialogue and civil society in combating poverty among women; the importance of financial aid in combating poverty."
"It is highly important that on 8 March, Parliament adopted such important resolutions, which give a beam of hope in overcoming injustice!"
"I voted in favour."
"I support the report on the face of female poverty in the European Union as it shows the extent to which women are the first victims of poverty."
"I call on Europe to take practical measures to reduce the pay gap between men and women."
"How long will we have to carry on accepting that women should have lower pay than men?"
"Why should a woman have to work for five years to earn what a man earns in four years, and, above all, why should she end up poorer on the pretext that she has brought up her children?"
"This is not a society I would wish to leave to my children and grandchildren."
"The uncertainties of women's working lives weigh too heavily on them, especially when they reach retirement age."
"Europe must be careful not to further impoverish women by promoting a genuine equal pay policy."
"I am particularly struck by the poverty among lone elderly women."
"They have worked a whole lifetime, contributed to raising a family; if they worked, they receive inadequate pensions; if they only benefit from a state pension, that is even worse."
"Pension schemes have not been kind to them."
"Perhaps they interrupted their careers to raise children and part-time work has reduced their income over the course of their entire working life."
"They could have had to support family members who were sick, elderly or disabled and welfare was not up to the task."
"This is certainly not an enviable condition."
"With the help of the European Social Fund, we need to establish programmes to provide assistance and support."
"Local government - either directly or through non-governmental organisations - should take responsibility for these issues and collaborate with regions to better target their quotas from Structural Funds."
"The fight against poverty should not get stuck on the desks of statistics offices but should go down to the administrative level closest to the women who need them."
"In Europe, there are still too many women with a lower salary than men, in search of work and of services that can help them to raise their children, too many women are victims of violence, too many immigrant girls suffer genital mutilation and there are far, far too many women who are alone, elderly and forgotten."
"Poverty among women is a tragic problem, particularly in developing countries."
"Nonetheless, the indirect approach espoused in this report should not be used as a way of relaxing the migration policies of the Member States."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The European Union needs to take a clear stance and have plans than can be brought in to combat the economic crisis."
"In this case, it is a matter of protecting women from the risk of poverty, stopping them from remaining a basically more vulnerable part of society than men, and therefore less able to respond to the employment crisis."
"To achieve the goal of the Europe 2020 strategy on the fight against poverty, we need to ensure that women are offered greater availability of resources, improved labour policies, increased funding from the European Social Fund and the possibility of achieving a work-life balance, without having to give up their role as mothers."
"As I have already said about other reports voted on today, I do, however, believe that when implementing these recommendations, it is appropriate to respect the principle of subsidiarity and certain typical national characteristics which must be defended and protected."
"I voted in favour of the report on female poverty in the EU."
"In the present period of economic crisis, the austerity measures being applied are also having an adverse impact on women, putting them at a disadvantage on the labour market."
"In Greece, the risk of poverty at work for women is 10%, which is much higher than for men, while in Europe, female poverty is 36%, compared with 11% for men."
"The basic objective is to eliminate the pay gap between the two sexes and the equalities caused by it and to take measures to support working single mothers by making working times more flexible."
"The Member States are now being called on to create new jobs for women, where possible, and to facilitate their access to high-level education, so that they can acquire skills and qualifications and claim high quality jobs."
"Enough study has been done and we have data sufficiently rigorous in order to categorically state that, in general terms, poverty affects women first and most severely in all societies, from the richest - and none has yet been able to successfully eliminate poverty within itself - to the poorest, in which poverty expands like a contagious disease that steals life expectancy and hope of life."
"However, we need a deeper and more specific understanding of this reality in the various Member States of the European Union so as to act in a better adapted and more effective way, with a view to the common goal of preventing and reducing poverty amongst women."
"It is worth stressing poverty amongst women in that we also have specific general indicators that point to its high impact on a community's social fabric: because of women's fundamental and permanent role in the family, it has been proven that the more that is invested in their education and social promotion, the more the community develops socio-economically."
"Combating poverty amongst women is a moral obligation but also a social investment."
"For these reasons, I voted for this report on the face of female poverty in the European Union."
"in writing. - The EU is confronted with a major economic, financial and social crisis that affects us all, men and women."
"But it particularly harms women in the labour market and in their personal lives, since they are more likely to be in insecure jobs, more likely to be made redundant and less likely to have social security."
"The austerity measures implemented across the EU have a particularly damaging impact on women, who dominate the public sector both as employees and as beneficiaries of services."
"Preventing and reducing women's poverty is an important component of the fundamental principle of social solidarity to which the EU is committed by Article 3 of the Treaty on EU."
"This implies equality between women and men, social justice and protection and combating social exclusion and discrimination."
"The Commission and the Member States should take the necessary measures to eliminate gender inequalities in employment as part of the EU 2020 strategy."
"I strongly encourage establishing as an objective the reduction of the gender pay gap by 1% each year in order to achieve a target of a 10% reduction by 2020."
"I would also stress the need for positive action to increase women's representation in political, economic and corporate decision-making bodies."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"All indicators show that, at global level, women are poorer than men on average."
"In times of economic recession, people who are at risk of falling into poverty become even more vulnerable, and the majority of these are women."
"The report acknowledges that the austerity measures being applied throughout the EU will have particularly devastating effects on women, particularly those already facing numerous disadvantages."
"The pensions of a considerable proportion of European women aged over 65 are a pittance."
"Poverty among women is not just the result of the recent economic crisis, but is also the consequence of other factors resulting from discriminatory gender stereotypes, from the pay gap between men and women, and from barriers to proper reconciliation between family and work life, which is particularly serious in the case of single-parent families."
"These result in the 'feminisation of poverty', which urgently needs to be combated."
"in writing. - The Plumb FEMM report was adopted by majority."
"We supported many paragraphs for which a separate vote was requested by S&D/PPE/ALDE."
"These paragraphs were mainly repetitions. The final result is also OK."
"Positive because adopted: eliminate gender inequalities in EU 2020 strategy (para."
"38); full pay for maternity leave as adopted in Estrela report on 20.10.2010 (para. 39); increase female representation in political, economic and corporate decision-making bodies."
"Public services of high standard (para. 43) should also be compatible with full-time working hours."
"But also negative because gender dimension in recovery plans (para. 15) not adopted."
"I endorsed the report on female poverty in the European Union."
"Over the past 10 years, the number of women living in poverty has increased disproportionately in relation to men."
"Over 84 million EU citizens live in poverty, and women account for over half of this figure."
"This is a result both of the economic crisis and of the differences which exist between women's and men's pay, difficulties in reconciling family life with a career, a longer average lifespan and various types of gender-based discrimination, the victims of which are mainly women."
"I would call for decisive measures to be taken at the level of both the EU and all the Member States to combat pay-related discrimination and to ensure access to attractive job offers."
"I would stress the need to strengthen legal instruments aimed at eliminating pay differences between women and men."
"Marked discrepancies continue to exist in this regard, with men earning 20% to 25% more than women on average, and this results in high levels of poverty among single women, retired women and widows."
"It is essential that EU programmes be adopted within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy in the field of lifelong learning and professional training for women, with the aim of increasing employment levels among women."
"These programmes should concentrate, to a large extent, on occupations which will be important in the future and eliminate the stereotypes which exist in terms of areas of education dominated by women or men, as well as eliminating traditional models in teaching programmes."
"The feminisation of poverty is a phenomenon which is observed and encountered ever more frequently both within Europe and outside its borders, and it occurs as a result of age, family responsibilities, ethnic origin and violence against women, among other factors."
"The high percentage of women employed in low paying or part-time jobs means that more women than men live on the verge of poverty."
"Research should be stepped up at European level into this phenomenon, since research will make it possible to establish precise and effective methods for combating poverty and social exclusion among women."
"The basic method used to help women break out of poverty should be the addition of a corresponding focus to employment policy (flexible employment methods, career guidance, ensuring the provision of training to obtain higher qualifications and measures aimed at women living in rural areas)."
"Education also plays a very significant role in combating this problem."
"The EU's financial potential should be exploited to this end, and particular emphasis should be placed on linking gender issues to plans for exiting the economic crisis and effectively implementing the Europe 2020 strategy."
"EU measures in this area should be an expression of social solidarity."
"in writing. - I supported this report which recognises that across the EU, women are more impacted by poverty, and that we need to work together to address this."
"I was disappointed that again, British Conservatives opposed this report on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day."
"Combating poverty is one of the objectives proposed by Europe in the 2020 strategy."
"Female poverty is due, in large measure, to discrimination against women."
"The recent recession has lowered their position in society, increased discrimination against them and pushed them towards poverty."
"In her report on female poverty in the European Union, Mrs Plumb has tried to find effective solutions to improve the position of women in society as a whole, which is why I voted for it."
"in writing. - Women in the EU earn, on average, 17.5% less than men, and this rate has remained constant for the past fifteen years - it is time for action to be taken to cut this pay gap."
"Equal pay for equal work must be properly implemented in Member States in order to get a fair deal for women."
"It is vital we look at the effect the gender pay gap has on pensions for women; in many cases, a woman's right to a pension results from her marital status."
"Equal pensions for women should be guaranteed, and it is for this reason I supported the proposal to ensure the same rights for women in the case of pensions and social security."
"Around 17% of all women in the EU are living below the poverty line, and it is essential that social and labour market policies are adapted to guarantee a minimum income and social justice for women."
"I agree with calls for the EU to provide more funding through the ESF in order to help combat poverty and social exclusion - it is vital that women are fully integrated into the labour market."
"I voted in favour of the report on the face of female poverty in the European Union."
"The Commission's Annual Report for 2010 on equality for women and men shows that poverty is one of the areas where gender-specific differences are obvious."
"The economic, financial and social crisis has led to the 'feminisation of poverty'."
"The successive budgetary cuts and the restructuring of the state sector have particularly threatened jobs in which women are primarily employed."
"At the same time, the measures supported by governments to combat the crisis are primarily focused on areas of the economy dominated by men."
"The analysis of the phenomenon of the 'feminisation of poverty' called for by the rapporteur is therefore urgently needed, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken."
"The two resolutions tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and debated on the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day indicate that Parliament promotes and supports equal treatment for women and men."
"The President of the legislative assembly actually commented that there are too few women in national parliaments, even if the situation is changing when it comes to the European Parliament."
"I can confirm that this is also the case in Romania, which sent a higher proportion of women to the European legislative, compared to the representation they have in their national parliament."
"However, apart from dealing with this situation, which can be treated only as the tip of the iceberg, it is necessary to eliminate the gender pay gap, have more women appointed to decision-making posts, and increase the level of employment among women, as they are affected more by unemployment, using dynamic and realistic policies."
"Analyses show that we are not just talking about the need for equal treatment for men and women, but that these policies would have a major impact on economies, with a 30% rise in GDP."
"The average gender pay gap is still 18% in the EU."
"I welcome the call made to Member States to implement the equal pay legislation."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Preparation of the Eurozone summit of 11 March 2011 (debate)"
"The next item is a statement by the President of the Commission on the preparation of the Eurozone summit of 11 March 2011 (2011/2615/RSP))."
"Madam President, honourable Members, we are currently experiencing one of those incredible moments when the historical process seems to speed up."
"On our doorstep, on the other side of the Mediterranean, a wind of freedom has started to blow."
"This is such an important and urgent matter that I should first of all like to tell you that the College has just approved the Commission's contribution to assist the countries south of the Mediterranean in their transition process and to breathe new life into our relations with our Mediterranean neighbours."
"I shall present this contribution with Baroness Ashton during the Extraordinary European Council next Friday."
"The men and women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, especially the young people, are currently demonstrating their rejection of authoritarian regimes and their aspiration to political freedom and social justice."
"Although we are aware of the extreme complexity of the situation and the challenges and difficulties that it presents, the European Union cannot afford any ambiguity."
"We must stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are demanding political freedom and respect for human dignity."
"We cannot countenance any ambiguity on the part of the European Union."
"A regime which fires on its own people has no place within the concert of nations."
"We are offering these peoples a 'partnership for democracy and shared prosperity' founded on three pillars: democratic transformation, involvement with civil society and mutually supportive development."
"We are aware of the challenges that await us."
"Saying no to dictatorship does not automatically guarantee the rule of law and democracy."
"The road to democratic transition is never an easy one."
"It can sometimes be winding and it is always demanding."
"However, Europe must stand shoulder to shoulder with those who aspire to political freedom and social justice."
"Honourable Members, I would now like to turn to the other meeting to be held on Friday 11 March, the informal summit of Member States in the euro area."
"The crisis has shown just how interdependent our economies are."
"It has shown up certain structural weaknesses."
"That is one reason why we must strengthen our economic governance."
"The Commission has long fought for more coordinated national economic policies and stronger governance in Europe."
"Our proposal is to further develop the economic pillar of our Economic and Monetary Union."
"We highlighted this point in our report on the 10 years of the euro, EMU@10."
"However, the truth of the matter is that some governments were extremely reluctant to espouse a development of this nature."
"Today, everyone admits that there is a need for genuine European economic governance and, moreover, the markets are continually reminding us how essential this is."
"This is the reason why the Member States, in the conclusions of the work of the task force, presided over by the President of the European Council, arrived at a very broad consensus on the proposals presented by the Commission on strengthening economic governance - proposals that are currently under discussion here in Parliament and in the Council."
"Furthermore, we came to an agreement on the implementation of the European semester, which will help to extend economic governance, by including in the early stages not only budgetary policies but also economic policies and structural reforms for each of the Member States."
"It was within this context of strengthened economic governance that recently, the idea of a 'competitiveness pact' emerged, inviting Member States in the euro area to make additional efforts, largely on the basis of their national competences, to become even more competitive."
"It is true that whilst the economies within the European Union are indeed extremely interdependent, those of the euro area are particularly so."
"Gaps in competitiveness are a genuine problem for those countries which share the same currency."
"Their competitiveness and the convergence of their economies are essential in ensuring the viability of a strong and stable euro area, which will be to the benefit of the entire European Union."
"Having said that, we must recognise that this idea has raised a number of concerns: fear of a two-speed Europe (the euro area and the others), the danger of losing sight of certain aspects of the economic recovery that are just as important as competitiveness, and also possibly the calling into question of the Community approach."
"These are all legitimate questions and we must respond to them unequivocally."
"This is a question of mutual confidence and credibility."
"Honourable Members, I was also a little surprised to have to point out, at the last European Council on 4 February, that any specific initiative for competitiveness and for the euro area had, quite obviously, to be in accordance with the Treaty."
"In its conclusions, the European Council decided that 'in taking their inspiration from the new framework for economic governance, the Heads of State or Government will take additional measures with the aim of enhancing the quality of the coordination of economic policies within the euro area in order to improve competitiveness, and this would lead to a greater degree of convergence without harming the single market'."
"Moreover, I was very happy to see that, in the end, these conclusions contained explicit reference to the need for these additional advances to be made 'in accordance with the Treaty'."
"You might think that this goes without saying, but it is better that it is said."
"The European Council therefore gave the President of the European Council a mandate to lead, in close collaboration with the President of the European Commission, consultations with the Member States of the euro area in order to determine the concrete means needed to press ahead with this."
"These consultations clearly showed that, in general, Member States are in favour of adopting the Community approach."
"Now I would like to be very clear on the principles that, in the Commission's view, must necessarily be abided by for such a competitiveness pact, which it might be better to call a 'convergence and competitiveness pact', since it involves measures aimed at reducing differences within the euro area, and indeed within the European Union."
"The first principle is that this pact must be carried out under the conditions laid down in the Treaty and within the existing system of economic governance."
"We can, in this way, be sure of a truly Community approach."
"Because history, and notably the experiences with the Stability and Growth Pact, has shown that it is only through the Community method that we can produce results which are democratically legitimised at European level, and which are binding and can be controlled."
"The pact must, of course, also respect the role of the Commission."
"This is essential in order to guarantee objectivity and independence in monitoring the efforts of Member States, the integrity of the single market and of all the acquis communautaire, and the clearance between the initiatives taken in the euro area and those pursued in the European Union as a whole."
"I will also insist on the role of the European Parliament in monitoring the convergence and competitiveness pact because the Commission, of course, will fully inform the European Parliament."
"The pact must also remain open to other Member States which might wish to take part in it and that are not members of the euro area."
"I think it is important to avoid any kind of stratification in our Union; that stratification will go against the very principles of solidarity that are at the core of our common project."
"To justify such a pact - which involves national measures - it must contribute added value to what has already been laid down in the context of economic governance proposals put forward."
"I would remind you that under Article 121 of the Treaty, Member States must coordinate their national economic policies."
"Such a pact must also take care not to affect adversely the integrity of the single market and should even help to enhance it."
"In addition, it must respect social dialogue and link measures on competitiveness to our central goals, which are growth and jobs, exactly as we have stated in the Europe 2020 agenda."
"Competitiveness is indeed an essential element for our economies."
"It is a necessary condition for entrenching job-creating growth."
"It is therefore important to ensure that this pact delivers real added value and does not take us away from the essential goals of growth and employment."
"My bottom line is growth and employment."
"That is why I emphasise growth, the sort of inclusive sustainable growth which lies at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"That is why I insist so much on the social dimension, since the efforts required must be shared fairly."
"On this point, the Commission continues to work on a proposal for the taxation of financial activities."
"Similarly, if budgetary consolidation and structural reforms are essential for competitiveness, investment in sectors of importance for the future like research and innovation is just as necessary."
"We should also bear in mind that this pact is but one part of our overall response to ensure the stability of the euro area."
"Progress must be made in all the other areas of our response, that is to say, in enhancing the effective financing capacity of the existing European Financial Stability Fund and broadening its scope, in preparing the establishment of a permanent mechanism as from 2013 and in implementing over the coming months tighter stress tests for banks."
"All of this will contribute to greater transparency, greater confidence and greater credibility."
"The convergence and competitiveness pact could thus make a significant contribution if we interpret it as one measure among others within the framework of all the efforts which have been undertaken to ensure the stability of the euro area and which we hope will start to take effect as of March."
"It could constitute a major additional effort towards fair and sustainable growth in Europe if it is coherent with the Community system of governance."
"If that is the case, if this measure is effectively carried out following a Community approach, as is the wish of the Commission and this Parliament, then I believe that the convergence and competitiveness pact will deliver added value and could help to strengthen the economic pillar of economic and monetary union."
"That is what this Parliament and the Commission want."
"The Commission will spare no effort to that end."
"I thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, what lessons have we learnt from the financial crisis?"
"The lesson we learnt from the Second World War was that our nations should work together and stop tearing each other apart."
"From the fall of the Berlin Wall, we learnt lessons about authoritarian and communist regimes and we were able to reunite our continent around the values of freedom, democracy and the social market economy."
"From the terrorist attack of 11 September, we learnt that we had to strike a new balance between security and freedom."
"From this financial crisis, the lesson we must learn is for our Member States to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary, fiscal and social fields."
"I know exactly how far we have come."
"The establishment, this year, of cooperation between the 27 on their budgetary priorities constitutes, in itself, a major shift in attitude."
"The regulations that we have provided ourselves with to make the financial markets more ethical are, also, exemplary, but they do not suffice."
"My group would like to call for an agreement to be reached between Parliament and the Council, before the summer, on strengthened economic governance."
"My group would also like to call for efforts to be pursued on the coordination of social and fiscal matters."
"That is the thrust of the competitiveness pact, the initial version of which has already been revised to be in greater accordance with Community values."
"However, we must go even further still and ensure that both Parliament and the Commission exercise all the prerogatives that they enjoy in this respect, and in this, we are counting on the President of the Commission."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes and supports these proposals as did the national leaders of the party in Helsinki."
"Ladies and gentlemen, how can we explain to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as we are in a delicate financial situation in mid-July each year, most of our Member States should continue to spend as if nothing were amiss?"
"How can it be that the over-indebtedness of our States is more acceptable, more tolerable and more bearable than that of households or businesses?"
"I have witnessed this at company level."
"The crisis has led to job losses and family trauma; the least we can do is to learn lessons from this and tell things as they are."
"The first lesson is that we should no longer treat lightly the obligations placed on States - whatever their size - to respect budget limits."
"The second lesson is this: European solidarity can only operate if, and only if, our social and fiscal regulations are at least comparable."
"They do not necessarily need to be identical - just comparable."
"At the moment, this is far from being the case."
"The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy."
"The fourth and final lesson is that even in a storm, Europe is standing firm and European integration is becoming stronger."
"Our American and Japanese partners have debt ratios far in excess of ours, without, it must be said, being excessively worried by it."
"However, that will probably not always be the case."
"For our part, now is the time to consolidate our economy and our competitiveness."
"Now is the time to work on creating jobs for the future."
"Now is the time to tell things as they are."
"Let us not miss this opportunity!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen - the few of you who are still here, for weeks, we have been discussing a paper from Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy that, apparently, never existed."
"Despite the fact that the paper was non-existent, a press conference was held on the subject during the European Council summit."
"We now know for sure that the paper did exist and made for some interesting reading."
"In the meantime, however, the content of the paper has somehow got lost."
"The key elements of this paper will never see the light of day."
"Nonetheless, in the end, we shall have a result, namely, an expansion of the safety net."
"So, a non-existent paper with elusive content, presented at an artificial press conference, has led to an expansion of the safety net."
"This is great."
"However, the situation is Kafkaesque to put it mildly."
"This is no way to rescue the euro."
"I would like to tell the President of the Commission that I found his statement to be good."
"It was good because you have revealed the lack of social balance in these proposals."
"I am sometimes a little surprised: Germany with its Chancellor, like President Sarkozy, France's prince of the opinion polls, is demanding measures that Germany itself has never taken in this form."
"The Greek budget, and in fact all budgets, wherever they may be, are to be cut."
"Are you in agreement with this, Mr Rehn?"
"What did Germany do in its hour of deepest crisis?"
"It came up with a so-called scrapping premium, in other words, it used the national budget to finance a scheme to stabilise the automobile industry."
"The subvention for reduced working hours, which helped keep unemployment in Germany under control, was an interventionist measure by the state."
"Why should other states be prevented from implementing similar measures to deal with their specific situation?"
"Rating agency Moody's recently downgraded Greece to a ranking below Belarus and Egypt."
"One really does begin to wonder whether there are any signs of green shoots in the economy."
"I do not know."
"The country is ranked even lower than Vietnam."
"This particular drama is always played out three days in advance of a European Council summit."
"Something like this always happens three days before a European Council meeting."
"However, people listen to what Moody's has to say."
"Do you know what Moody's says?"
"It says it is going to downgrade the country because it is no longer able to invest as a result of the cuts and therefore cannot generate economic growth."
"So what we are talking about here is a 'hair cut'."
"If you look at me, you will realise that I am well qualified to tell you that a hair cut will not solve every problem."
"Quite the opposite in fact, because what actually happens as a result of the hair cut?"
"The aim seems to be to improve a country's credit rating by telling those who are to provide the credit that they will lose all write-downs."
"Where will this eventually end?"
"In the safety net, of course."
"That is why it makes sense to increase the safety net and to do everything that we can to stabilise the euro."
"That is why the pact itself makes perfect sense."
"However, an imbalance exists there."
"Commissioner, if your ideas are incorporated in this pact, and the economic and social balance is restored as you suggest, then the pact will be on the right path again."
"That is why I welcome the excellent proposal you have brought forward."
"I do not want to spend any more time talking about the issue of the institutions."
"In institutional terms, the entire concept was wrong from the start."
"If it is now restructured in such a way that all operational decisions will be made by the appropriate responsible authority, in other words, the Commission, ensuring democratic legitimacy through the involvement of the European Parliament, then all is well and good."
"So, although we got off to a bad start and there have been a few alarms and excursions along the way, the safety net is to be extended, which is wonderful."
"The German Free Democratic Party has also come onboard, which is welcome news."
"Madam President, I am sure that your party in Germany will also support this pact, so that we have also gained ground here."
"If we can now succeed in giving the pact an appropriate name, namely the 'Pact for the Euro', then we may perhaps finally have achieved something worthwhile."
"Madam President, first of all, I think that we can now say that after years of not accepting the idea of economic union, we are finally accepting the idea of an economic union alongside monetary union, which does represent a step forward."
"Naturally, this is not the case for Mr Farage, but for everyone else, it does represent a step forward."
"Nevertheless, Madam President, I do not think that the term that has been used is the right one."
"What does the word 'pact' mean?"
"A pact is an agreement between States."
"An agreement between States is not what we need."
"What we need is a Community act, an initiative at the level of the European Union, and not a pact between Member States, which is, by its very nature, an intergovernmental pact."
"Therefore, this is not the right term to use as it is misleading."
"Secondly, there is the approach."
"There is no need for anything at intergovernmental level."
"Intergovernmentalism has never worked within the European Union."
"The Lisbon strategy was intergovernmental and it failed."
"When Germany and France failed to respect the rules governing the stability pact in 2003-4, this proved that the intergovernmental approach was not the right one."
"We must use the Community approach."
"Thirdly, I believe, Mr Barroso, that what is on the table is not enough or it focuses rather on very specific measures."
"Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy's competitiveness pact comprises six specific measures."
"For example, in the case of pensions, it focuses on pension age."
"However, the pensions system is much more complex than that."
"It is not only a question of pension age, there is also the number of years of pension contributions, pre-pension schemes, and the existence or not of a second pillar."
"Therefore, what we need are not six specific measures in an intergovernmental pact, which will never come into being or work."
"What we need is broad economic governance (pension schemes, labour market, wage policy, fiscal policy) within the European Union which is decided upon by the Commission and which, through a convergence code - that is the term you used - is provided to Member States so that they can apply the rules from the convergence code."
"That is what we must do as quickly as possible."
"My request is a very simple one."
"I saw the paper of 25 February that you prepared with the President of the Council."
"I think that it is now for the Commission to prepare its own initiative."
"This must be done now."
"There is still time in the weeks to come for you to prepare these Community acts for economic governance and convergence and to table them at the Council and the European Parliament."
"It will then be up to us to decide and to support you in this respect."
"However, what I think we are doing at the moment is being reactive."
"In this document of the 25th - I have it here - I can read that"
"'monitoring by the Heads of State and Heads of Government', 'the concrete commitments undertaken by the Heads of State and Heads of Government'."
"(FR) That is not how it is going to work."
"The States and the Prime Ministers are not going to regulate themselves!"
"It has never worked in the past, and it will not work in the future!"
"Finally, and this is my last point, I also think that it is time, Mr Barroso, to present, at the earliest possible opportunity, an initiative on a crisis mechanism for banks, not at national level, as stated, but at European level."
"You have the right to do so as you are, in effect, the guarantor of competition rules within the European Union and you are in a position to suggest such an initiative."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I no longer feel compelled to say anything about the somewhat embarrassing history of the competitiveness pact."
"It was quite bizarre to hear that the paper does not exist, even though this paper was distributed in the corridors of Council Headquarters in Brussels."
"As I have already stated in Brussels, the way in which the facts have been disputed in the Council's buildings bears all the hallmarks of a socialist or communist regime in its dying days."
"From my point of view, the fact is that for months now, we Europeans have been experiencing more than a currency crisis, but also a crisis in the capabilities of our national governments to accept shared responsibility for the problem and to follow a joint strategy that could lead us out of these difficulties."
"If we now make the crisis mechanism permanent, however we may have achieved it, then we will have taken one step forward."
"However, if one looks at Greece, then I would say that we may be deluding ourselves if we believe we have the crisis under control."
"It is equally clear in Greece that the one-sided nature of the measures, exclusive concentration on austerity measures and cuts, is not working."
"The country must also be in a position to make investments."
"When a country like Greece cuts expenditure so radically, then it needs to know where its income is to come from."
"I am annoyed by the fact that, in advance of this week's meeting of the European Council and in statements relating to the Council meeting in 14 days' time, we are hearing from Germany that it will not be prepared to discuss conditions for Greece or for necessary changes."
"The same old mistakes are being made again: this unilateralism and insistence on a single method."
"If we are to follow the model described by Mr Verhofstadt, as well as decisions in relation to specific consolidation measures, economic union also requires a readiness for genuine solidarity."
"Hence, Greece should expect more from us than we have given so far."
"I completely agree with Mr Schulz and the previous speakers and I would like to state clearly on behalf of all those in my group who have been working on this issue for many months: the Community method is something special."
"We need genuine, understandable decision-making processes in Brussels, so that citizens from Greece to Denmark, in Germany and in Spain, trust in us."
"If we really were to establish this 'closed shop' proposed in the competitiveness pact as contrived by a small number of Heads of Government, we will lose the debate about trust in the European Union."
"This is really what the crisis is increasingly about."
"I can only hope that we will be delivered from this stupidity and that this Council meeting will show more sense."
"Since you mentioned sustainable growth, Mr Barroso, let me add one more thing."
"I cannot understand why a Commissioner for Energy in Brussels would say that ambitious climate protection targets would mean deindustrialisation in Europe."
"The German Minister for the Environment was in Brussels 14 days ago and presented a study that predicted six million jobs for the European Union if we set a 30% climate target."
"This would mean sustainable growth."
"Mr Barroso, you must stop Mr Oettinger."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, in a crisis, one sometimes has to act quickly - and it is clear that the eurozone is not out of its crisis - but one also has to act intelligently."
"The UK restored market confidence by reforms to control spending and reduce national debt."
"These are now core suggestions under the competitiveness pact."
"Parliament's procedures do not allow it to make rapid decisions, but there are suggestions tabled by MEPs that perhaps the European Council could find helpful."
"On the Irish interest rate, those of us who have lent another country money deserve an interest rate which reflects the risk, but we also want our money back."
"I have suggested a pre-payment incentive, a bonus to reward early repayment."
"Under the economic governance package, Member States will have to be more transparent with their own budgets."
"I would suggest the same thing should happen for taxpayers contributing to the EU's budget."
"I hope that despite this crisis, our national governments will be able to listen to suggestions from this House and work together in a constructive manner."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, I was pleased to note that you have appreciated the social dimension of this issue and have supported a social settlement."
"This will certainly be necessary."
"There is no need to repeat much of what my fellow Members have said as I am in complete agreement with them."
"I am extremely sceptical of the pact that has been presented by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy."
"Why is this?"
"Because their reasons for presenting it are not very clear."
"The fact that it has no validity is quite a different issue."
"They are both clever strategists."
"I cannot accept their claim that things simply happened this way."
"I believe that they mean things precisely as stated there."
"This is the point I would like to return to once again."
"I believe that this is a very serious issue."
"Although they believe that this clause on the indexation of wages and salaries is the right answer, I am not so sure."
"In black and white terms, increasing the pensionable age can also be described as a reduction in pensions."
"It will be extremely hard to reduce debt."
"After all, even countries like Germany find this very difficult."
"I can imagine that Ireland or Greece will find themselves in huge difficulty here."
"I am a little sceptical about what the proposed solution is supposed to achieve."
"I expect transparency in this matter."
"You will receive support from Parliament if you play your part in promoting greater transparency and ensuring that games like this are not played out behind Parliament's back."
"If these people want to make social security cuts, they need say so clearly, rather than taking countless detours to reach an objective that you, Mr Barroso, do not share and that we certainly do not share."
"We are prepared to discuss the concept of coordinated European economic governance with you provided that this economic governance is worthy of the name, in other words, that it is democratic in structure and that it will help establish a sustainable, socially responsible European community."
"We are also willing to discuss amendments to the Treaty, for example, in relation to a social progress clause."
"However, we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation."
"This is the only way that Parliament can monitor this process."
"It cannot be done without information!"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso's view of the world today, but it was perhaps rather more ironic than he had intended."
"He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere, saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy."
"I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then, if you do not like what they do, you can get rid of them, turf them out and put somebody else in."
"It was ironic because his next sentence was 'and that is why in Europe, facing the euro crisis, we must reinforce the Community method'."
"For the public watching in on this - which increasingly they do - the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats - people like you, Mr Barroso."
"I know the European Parliament voted for you, but you were the only candidate that was offered to us."
"That is not democracy!"
"So Mr Barroso is saying, on the one hand, that democracy is good, but on the other hand, that we cannot have it in Europe."
"That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt, who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished - well, perhaps his own will be very shortly."
"He is saying that we want an economic union."
"Nobody has voted for that."
"Nobody has been asked whether they want it."
"He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it."
"What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal."
"After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland, it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message - 'Come in number 3, your time is up'."
"Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6% on Monday."
"Mr Barroso knows that himself."
"It was when yields reached 7% that Ireland had to be bailed out."
"In April, we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt - another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over."
"Let us remind ourselves that, in the last six months, 80% of Portugal's debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank."
"We cannot go on as a European Union buying our own debt."
"If we do, the next debt crisis will not be in a country, but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I am assuming that you will not know the answer, Mr Farage, but I have question for you."
"You constantly refer to Belgium as a non-existent nation."
"You have said this to Mr Van Rompuy and now you have mentioned something similar to Mr Verhofstadt."
"Do you know on what basis the Belgian state was founded?"
"Madam President, I am pleased that Mr Schulz has asked me that."
"The difficulty is that when you form an artificial state that has within it more than one language group - which is clearly the case in Belgium - you may, for a period of time, be able to hold it together, but whether it is Belgium, whether it is Yugoslavia or whether it is the European Union, if you have entirely different languages and cultures, it will not hold together."
"The reason you are so upset about Belgium, and Mr Van Rompuy got terribly upset about it and Mr Verhofstadt never likes it, is that - is this not the truth, Mr Schulz? - Belgium is a microcosm for the whole European project."
"(DE) Madam President, I will only be 30 seconds."
"It is interesting that the representative of a party which calls itself the United Kingdom Independence Party does not know that the Kingdom of Belgium was founded at the suggestion of the United Kingdom."
"(Blue card question to Mr Farage under Rule 149(8)) Madam President, I hope Mr Farage is not offended by a question from a citizen of the Irish Republic."
"Could I ask him what is the basis of the United Kingdom?"
"I understand it consists of the nations of the English, the Scottish, the Welsh and the Northern Irish."
"Is this not a Union of nations?"
"A very proud one, I might add?"
"Madam President, that is a good question."
"Mr Schulz, you are quite right that Belgium was a British invention, and a British mistake."
"We have made many over the years."
"We have got some things right and some things wrong, just as your country, Germany, has."
"Germany's history has not been whiter than white, I think you might agree."
"You are quite right."
"Actually, holding together the United Kingdom has been something that has been deeply troubling."
"Indeed, Ireland went its own way, back in 1921, I think, when independence for Ireland was established."
"You are right."
"It is very difficult to hold together different cultures."
"I do think that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland works, at the moment, because it has consent."
"If it did not have consent, then there would be popular calls for referenda and those nations would be able to break away."
"But my point is that in this European Union, nobody is being given that opportunity."
"(NL) Madam President, the Council wants to see more ambition so that we can strengthen competitiveness and increase convergence."
"That is only to be applauded, of course."
"I would like to join in the tributes paid to President Barroso for the way in which he has picked up the gauntlet and come here to give us an explanation about the competitiveness pact, something which has even managed to keep Mr Martin Schulz sweet today."
"That should not go unmentioned."
"You have picked up that gauntlet, together with President Van Rompuy."
"However, the pact seems to be having some difficulties getting off the ground, because Parliament, in particular, is having to deal with a sizeable legislative package."
"This is the first time Parliament has found itself in the role of colegislator when it comes to economic governance."
"That is why it is so important to link things together, because there is some overlap."
"In this House, ladies and gentlemen, we have tabled 2 000 amendments and, if we look at this, we will find almost all the matters covered by the competitiveness pact reflected in those amendments."
"This Parliament also wants to see more ambition and that is the very thing that worries me."
"How are we going to link the competitiveness pact with the EU 2020 strategy?"
"Moreover, President Barroso, are you going to use our right of initiative actively, to establish a link between the competitiveness pact and the legislative package?"
"If you fail to do that, then this House will pick up that gauntlet itself, in its role as colegislator."
"(PT) Madam President, I come from a country that has existed for eight centuries and, despite this, is interested in the existence in this globalised world of a strong Europe and a Europe that is capable of dealing with China, India and the United States on equal terms."
"The crisis that we are living through is not a crisis in the euro area: it is, as someone was saying, a crisis of the euro area."
"This is because a single currency can only function when there is reliable and persistent work on convergence between the various areas comprising it, in terms of growth rates, of yields and of employment; when there is real convergence."
"Until now, we have been working on indicators of nominal convergence, which is in no way the same thing."
"As such, Europe urgently needs to finish what it started."
"To finish what it started - the single currency in particular - it in fact needs to create a robust Stability Fund: a fund that enables countries in difficulty to undertake this convergence with interest rates that are acceptable and not prohibitive, and does not force them to cut the strategic investment enabling this convergence, so that they can use their growth to pay back what they borrow in times of crisis."
"Mr President, we need a Commission that is active; a Commission that participates in building this Stability Fund, but also in the Eurobonds, and that listens to the message that Parliament has given it again today via the new source of own resources, which will have to be an effective reinforcement of a budget that is clearly insufficient."
"We have just adopted the Podimata report, which clearly advocates a financial transaction tax."
"In order to survive, Europe has to change course now."
"It needs a strong Parliament, but it also needs a Commission capable of acting rather than simply reacting: of taking the initiatives that we are awaiting anxiously, so that this experiment is not lost and so that this experiment bears fruit."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, much has been said with which I agree."
"I should just like to use three words."
"The first word is 'respect': it was not this Parliament that made the European Parliament colegislator with regard to economic governance."
"It was governments that decided this in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As rapporteurs, we do not think it is right to be informed of important discussions relating to the governance package through Google or the English-language press."
"The first thing that I would ask of you, Mr Barroso, and I also ask it of Mr Van Rompuy's colleagues present in this House, is to respect us and to let this Parliament get on with its work."
"The second word is 'democracy'."
"Never, since the eighteenth century, have we seen a democratic system deny the separation of powers in the way that the European Council is doing now."
"In the separation of powers, there are those who decide and those who control."
"The Council, with your collusion, Mr Barroso, is currently taking upon itself the right to both decide and control, in other words, basically to do nothing."
"The third word is 'effectiveness'."
"If we continue to water down the content of our proposals, we will arrive at the lowest common denominator and we know what that is."
"That is the Lisbon strategy!"
"That is the 10 years that have led us nowhere."
"We will get on with our work."
"This Parliament demands to be respected and will defend democracy and effectiveness."
"(PT) Madam President, two weeks ago, the international press analysed your declarations on the possibility that Portugal would turn to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and interpreted them as constituting, or having constituted, encouragement."
"As President Barroso is certainly the person in the Commission who best understands the reality of Portugal, I would put three questions to him for three frank answers."
"The first question is what does Portugal gain through recourse to the EFSF, and the International Monetary Fund, as it currently exists."
"The second question is what changes to the EFSF do you consider indispensable to prevent the repetition of the shameful situation that occurred in Ireland?"
"A loan at prohibitive interest rates, with decreased salaries and continued fiscal dumping in terms of large companies."
"The third and final question is how do you think we will get back to a situation of trust when all monetary policy decisions - and the last obvious ones by the European Central Bank - continue to damage the most vulnerable countries by mortgaging growth?"
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but endorse what has just been said by Mrs Goulard on the basic presuppositions that mean that while we are well aware of the need for effectiveness and speed in the decision-making process, it is essential for Parliament to be involved."
"This is the only way in which our fellow citizens, of whom we are the elected representatives, can understand what is happening and explain it to them."
"I would like to raise one very specific point."
"We are buffeted, on a daily basis, by the financial markets, these financial markets, which stand for everything and for nothing, are most often inhabited by young people who have moved from Game Boy to computer without thinking too much about it, and yet who strike fear into the hearts of our countries."
"The way to bring the markets under control is not to eliminate them."
"I do not belong to a group that seeks to abolish the markets."
"However, what do the markets seek?"
"They seek to avoid risk and the rule of the game in the markets is to pass risk on to someone else."
"This means that an operator will never feel happy as long as there is risk."
"I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets, Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines, not change direction every other day, and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never, subsequently, put into practice."
"If we want to bring this financial aspect under control, and this is vital for the economic stability of our countries, we need to be able - and it is your role, Mr Barroso, to provide this impetus - to set clear goals, clear measures and to show a clear determination in regard to good economic coordination."
"Madam President, deliberate avoidance of economic governance and of banking regulation at both national and European level has delivered us into this crisis, and the crisis is obvious to everybody in terms of jobs, lack of growth, pensions lost, etc. So, President Barroso, and indeed Commissioner Olli Rehn, you do not have to convince me that economic governance is necessary, that it must be strong, and that all Member States, and particularly those in the eurozone, must buy into it."
"But we must convince the people of Europe that it is necessary, and the way we will do that is by ensuring that it is legitimate."
"We ensure it is legitimate by refusing to accept any proposals which are not based on the Treaties and not based on the Community method."
"It will not be acceptable if it is perceived to be in the interests of one, two, three, four or five economically powerful States."
"That is the reality."
"And so it is extremely important for the future of this Union that what is agreed at the informal Council on 11 March, and what is agreed at the end of March, can be supported by the public at large in Europe."
"The Irish Government that has just been elected in Ireland has a strong mandate."
"I quote from the programme which it has just agreed: 'We must step back from the edge of national insolvency (...) the EU-IMF Programme of Support has - to date - failed to restore confidence in the Irish economy (...) this reflects uncertainty over the affordability of the rescue package'."
"I want to conclude on this point if I might."
"It is an important point."
"The failure of the programme contributes to the wider eurozone financial instability."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, every week, the press is filled with news of a new or modified proposal from a country, the European Council and the President of the Commission."
"I commend the President of the ECB because he has paid heed to the discussions and reports in the Parliament and recognises our direction and determination."
"The competitiveness pact and its evolution is a case in point."
"We already have a richer tapestry of ideas in our amendments to the economic governance package, so we will have little difficulty in moving into codecision to merge the outcomes of the positions that we take in Parliament and Council."
"But we should not cherry-pick from the single market, nor continue to get it wrong."
"The single market is not about a fortress with a level playing field inside."
"It is about the external competitiveness that a large single market can generate, so it is intimately mixed with the recovery side of economic governance."
"We also need a permanent financial stability mechanism capable of evolving over time, subject to governance and priorities."
"To the German people, convulsed with the 'transfer union' issue, I say 'look at what accompanies the demands of your own government - recapitalisation of banks and purchase of sovereign debt in a secondary market'."
"Germany's banks will take ten years to recognise their impaired assets from the crisis, and that includes sovereign debt."
"Germany's banks will not meet new international rules for bank capital, so transfer to German banks should also be the issue on your lips."
"That is why you need the mechanism, like all the eurozone."
"Finally, on interest rates, there is a balance that has to be struck between sustainability and moral hazard."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Madam President, difficult times require brave political decisions."
"That is exactly why we do the jobs we do, and also why I would congratulate President Barroso on the ideas he has told us about here."
"The European Parliament has also already taken clear positions in a number of reports on the issue of the euro and the need for stability, as well as on the problem of growth."
"We cannot just look at one side of the argument."
"Emerging from the crisis requires, for example, that the workings of the permanent fund take into account the specific situations of Member States that are currently paying increasing interest rates on their public debt."
"This is a policy that must also be committed to competitiveness, to better credit, to a tax policy that can be positive for attracting investors; in essence, to anything related to wealth creation."
"However, it is also for this reason that we need more European institutions."
"The European Parliament's positions have been set out clearly and not via the media."
"This is not the time for ideological decisions, but to think of the public."
"What they demand of us is sensible and quick decisions."
"Madam President, what we are facing is not a crisis of the eurozone, but a crisis of public finance in some Member States who happen to be in the eurozone - it could equally well be Hungary."
"Why then is there to be an exclusive meeting of eurozone Heads of State - 17 of them - without others being invited?"
"Why create unjustified dividing lines, which we abolished six years ago through enlargement, and why create a two-speed union?"
"The European Commission under you, President Barroso, is the guardian of the Treaty."
"What is the Treaty basis for this exclusion?"
"Why exclude the willing and able?"
"Why not apply Articles 5 and 121 to deepen fiscal and social policy?"
"Why not apply Treaty-based enhanced cooperation within the Treaties, with a central role for the European Commission?"
"The single market includes 27 Member States, as does the challenge of competitiveness."
"The President of the Council and the European Commission should be a leader of the EU of 27 and not the secretariat of a select group of Member States."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, by a large majority, adopted Parliament's opinion on the amendment to the Treaty to introduce a stability mechanism."
"The text proposes a change to the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, setting out a procedure which, while safeguarding the intergovernmental nature of the fund, justifies the inclusion of the rule in the Treaty."
"It also contains some clear proposals regarding the operation of the mechanism, designed to make it compatible with the duties that the Treaty assigns to the European institutions and with the need to have real economic governance, which simply would not work if it were intergovernmental."
"To use a metaphor which you, Mr Barroso, used in the last debate, Parliament proposes putting this intergovernmental wagon on the rails in a Union train and giving the Commission its due role in running this train."
"How does the Commission view Parliament's proposals?"
"Is it willing to help push them in the negotiations over the coming days?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, my country, Ireland, is a small open economy with a heavy concentration on foreign direct investment."
"The twelve and half per cent corporate rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery, retaining our jobs and employment growth."
"As a result of establishing a low corporate tax rate, eight of the world's top technology firms are based in my country."
"Any move towards converging or harmonising the rate of company tax in the European Union would substantially damage Ireland's ability to attract foreign direct investment and hence, our ability to grow to economic recovery."
"It is important to remember that Ireland, like indeed other smaller countries, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe and a low tax rate is a tool, a tool to address the economic limitations which come with being a peripheral country."
"I want to pose a question to the President."
"Can he confirm that under Lisbon, tax competence is a matter for each Member State?"
"(PT) Madam President, today, whilst commemorating International Women's Day, everyone said fine words about women's rights."
"However, now, when we are talking about economic and financial matters, what is predominating is financial interests in so-called economic governance, with its insistence on deepening the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, never taking into account each country's specific characteristics, the profound economic divergences, social inequalities, unemployment or poverty."
"Therefore, what we will have with such a competitiveness pact is the worsening of all the existing social problems."
"However, you will also be faced by the struggles of the workers, of women and of young people, as is already planned in Portugal for the coming weekends, in particular, the demonstration by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) in Lisbon on 19 March."
"That is the hope that we will have the necessary change."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by reminding my colleague, Vice-President Verheugen, that the EU was created through an agreement between independent sovereign states which voluntarily decided to transfer some of their powers to a new institution - the European Union - which they established together for the common coordinated administration of selected powers belonging to the sovereign states."
"If the European countries therefore decide that they want to create a common economic administration within the framework of EU regulations, it must be their free and voluntary decision, and not a directive from Brussels."
"If we are talking about a pact, and therefore an agreement between sovereign states concerning further cooperation under the aegis of the EU, then everything is in order."
"If there is to be some form of closer cooperation in the area of economic management, it should quite naturally be attempted first and foremost by the euro area countries, which have made a commitment to use the common currency."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, let us have no illusions."
"Economic regulations and tax laws differ between these countries, and this process will therefore be very complicated ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, thank you, in particular, for being so fair as to announce the list of speakers in advance."
"Alongside a uniform retirement age, the proposals for fiscal union require sales tax rates and wage policies to be harmonised."
"This is a further step towards economic governance and represents a major intrusion into the tax sovereignty of the Member States."
"It is made all the worse by the fact that the European Parliament will have nothing to say on these matters and that it was possible to fall back on Article 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are likely to be able to force their proposals through, despite opposition from other countries in the euro area."
"On the subject of reinforcing the rescue package, it is clear that speculators will continue to be able to exert pressure on the failing countries in the euro area without bearing any of the resulting risk."
"If there is a crisis, the rescue package will be made available."
"Profits will be privatised and losses will be borne by the public and circulated throughout the entire euro area."
"Mr Barroso, you said that growth must be distributed more fairly."
"I would like to ask you: What is the situation with financial liabilities?"
"The rescue package will result in the burdens being distributed even more unjustly."
"In addition, it will cause social problems and wantonly put the prosperity of the net contributors at risk."
"Madam President, there were some specific questions about Portugal, which I will answer."
"Whether or not Portugal should resort to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is a decision for the Portuguese authorities."
"It is a sovereign decision for Portugal precisely because it has to do with sovereign debt."
"What I can tell you, obviously, is that recourse to the EFSF and to International Monetary Fund aid was seen to be a last resort: ultima ratio."
"It is obvious that if a country can avoid recourse to this mechanism, it should do so, as recourse to these rescue funds has costs, and not only in terms of reputation."
"Therefore, if a country is able, it should be avoided."
"However, I would repeat that it is a decision for the national authorities whether or not to resort to this rescue fund, or at least to request its activation."
"Secondly, as regards what I would like to see in the EFSF, it is not a question of liking, it is a question of policy: we in the Commission are actively working with the Member States, specifically those in the euro area, to reinforce the EFSF's capacity for lending in order to expand the scope of its activities, including greater flexibility."
"Some of these issues are extremely sensitive from the point of view of the markets, so it does not seem prudent to me to be announcing intentions that have not become definite, but it is a work in progress in terms of the euro area."
"Furthermore, as you know, the Commission has clearly set out its proposal for reinforcing the EFSF and expanding its activities, specifically in its annual growth survey."
"As to whether this policy should or can be changed, I am telling you now that it cannot be changed with regard to the most vulnerable countries."
"It would be absolutely irresponsible for countries with such a level of public or private debt to water down their efforts at budgetary consolidation and structural reforms at the moment."
"When a country has such a high level of debt, the markets' confidence has to recover, because if not, its economic situation becomes untenable."
"Therefore, if we want to help the countries that are currently most vulnerable, we must not offer them mirages or something unrealistic: on the contrary, we must support any sensible efforts that they might make toward budgetary consolidation and structural reforms."
"That is the only way to have the markets' trust."
"Naturally, this is not just the effort of the country in isolation, which needs a joint effort from the euro area."
"That is what is being developed with, obviously, different levels of contribution from the various parties involved."
"What I can tell you is that the Commission has been doing everything in its power to suggest greater ambition."
"However, as the honourable Members know, the Commission makes suggestions, but in the end, the decision belongs to the Member States, specifically those of the euro area, particularly as regards matters that are strictly national competences, such as those not provided for in the Treaty, such as the EFSF."
"(FR) In any case, I would like to say to the entire Parliament that many of the criticisms that I have heard here today - even though most supported the Commission's general approach - have been addressed, if I have understood correctly, to specific governments or specific Member States."
"Consequently, it is not up to me to speak on their behalf."
"What I have to say is that the Commission has presented a package of proposals for economic governance."
"We have pushed to the limit our governments' ambitions."
"Even in the case of the governance package that my colleague, Mr Rehn, and I presented, the Member States were not willing to accept the initial level of ambition."
"That is the truth of the matter, for we submitted legislative proposals."
"Now what has emerged is a new idea, namely, the competitiveness pact which we are trying - and here I wish to be very transparent and show my respect for Parliament - to fit as well as we can within the Community approach."
"I have reported to you, in complete transparency, the Commission's efforts to make this idea regarding the impact of competitiveness useful and create added value, either in respect of growth and employment - which, as I have already said, remain a priority for the Commission - or even to strengthen the system of governance."
"Of course, I do not need the Commission to be reminded of its role as guarantor of the Treaty."
"We have unfailingly demonstrated this, be it in relation to issues of the internal market, competition or non-discrimination."
"I can guarantee to you once again that the Commission would not hesitate to resort to all the means at its disposal if we were to believe that any principles or rules of the Treaty were being compromised by decisions taken either by the European Council, or by any other institution."
"That is why the work we do is long-term in nature and, of course, it is serious work that we carry out with a sense of responsibility."
"Obviously, this is an extremely delicate time for us, as you know, a time when the first thing that governments look at in the morning is the spread in their public debts."
"Therefore, what we are saying does matter."
"The hopes that we are creating do matter."
"The Commission therefore owes it to itself to be ambitious and, at the same time, to be responsible in making its proposals, while knowing that they have, at least, a chance of coming to fruition, that it is not merely the case of a publicity stunt followed by a feeling of disappointment."
"That is what I want to avoid and that is what the Commission must avoid."
"We must avoid disappointment, or purely division, whether within the euro area, or even throughout the European Union."
"That is why I can assure you that the Commission will keep its ambitions high."
"The Commission is currently telling all governments that Parliament must be involved in this competitiveness pact."
"The Commission is currently telling governments that it must retain a central role in this competitiveness pact, not out of institutional loyalty, not out of institutional egotism, but because I believe, needless to say, that the Commission, along with the Community approach, are a guarantee if we want to avoid divisions between the euro area and the rest of Europe."
"They are the guarantee if we want to avoid attacks on the integrity of the single market, or if we want to avoid calling into question other mechanisms such as the Stability and Growth Pact."
"They are the guarantee, indeed, that we remain European within the framework of the European Union with European solidarity."
"Therefore, I was extremely frank and extremely open."
"The Commission carries out its work in utter transparency, constructively of course, trying to save an idea that, if it is well presented and carried out within a Community approach, could contribute added value to our efforts at governance, unlike what some of you have said."
"Indeed, the efforts that our governments have intensified, efforts to bring about economic political coordination, have always been part of the Commission's general approach and that of most members of this Parliament."
"This therefore gives us an opportunity."
"If Heads of State or Government are now willing to become involved in the coordination of economic policies, and even in certain domains that were hitherto considered to be of national competence alone, I think that this should be welcomed insofar as it contributes added value to growth and employment, and insofar as it respects systems of Community governance."
"That is what is at stake."
"I think that, from this point of view, the debate has been very useful."
"Furthermore, I believe that the message from this Parliament has reached the European Council."
"President Buzek passed it on the last time he was at the European Council."
"I think that on essential matters, both the Commission and Parliament will be firm in the defence of the Community approach, convinced that this is the only way for Europe to achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves in the euro area, for stability and also for growth and employment throughout the Union."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The drama that we are once again seeing unfold before our eyes is becoming painfully repetitive and revealing of the essence of this European Union: of who makes the rules in the end, and on behalf of which interest groups."
"In this drama, as usual, there is no shortage of main characters, secondary characters and mere extras."
"The so-called 'competitiveness pact', which was drawn up by Germany and France as a despicable imposition on all the other countries of the euro area, and which was initially denied by its creators, is now being presented and advocated in the European Parliament by President Barroso of the European Commission."
"This after President Barroso had weeks previously criticised Chancellor Merkel for failing to acknowledge the role of the Commission."
"It is now clear what, in the end, the role of the Commission and its President is."
"The aforementioned pact, which President Barroso is now telling us not to separate from the goal of employment and growth, is a veritable revanchist crusade against labour and social rights through attacks on wages, through an increased retirement age, through attempts to destroy collective bargaining and through the levelling down of social rights."
"It is also an attempt to impose a veritable sentence of economic dependence in the colonial style on countries like Portugal."
"2010 progress report on Turkey (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010 progress report on Turkey."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me that you have shown such an interest in the matter of enlargement."
"Even though both the Member States and the candidate countries are facing noticeable challenges, I believe that the enlargement process must go on continuously and consistently on the basis of the performance delivered."
"In order to achieve this, both parties must remain committed."
"Knowing the activities of the European Parliament, it is clear that this is the forum where all participants are aware of the significance of our relations with Turkey."
"These are long-standing relations, which are made even closer by the country's candidate status."
"At the same time, Turkey is also an important regional actor, and plays a crucial role in a number of significant areas, such as energy security and regional security, as well as the promotion of dialogue between civilisations."
"Meanwhile, the dramatic international events taking place in our immediate neighbourhood highlight even further the extent of Turkey's significance in the aforementioned areas."
"Accession negotiations with the country are proceeding in line with the relevant conclusions of the European Council and the Council, as well as the negotiation framework."
"Despite the negotiations, which are at an advanced stage and are also becoming increasingly complex, the Hungarian Presidency is committed to making progress with regard to all chapters where progress is possible."
"The work is proceeding even now, and its main focus is currently on chapter eight, that is, competition policy."
"I trust that our Turkish partners will continue with their efforts and that we will soon be able to see results."
"In its conclusions adopted in December last year, the Council welcomed Turkey's continuous commitment to the negotiation process, as well as its political reform programme."
"The constitutional reform package adopted by Turkey in 2010 represents another important step in the right direction, as this package covers several priorities of the accession partnership in the fields of justice, fundamental rights and public administration."
"The most important task at the moment is to ensure that the reforms are implemented in accordance with European norms and through consultations that involve the widest possible scope of participants, that is, all political parties and civil society organisations."
"It is clear that continuing the work on the political criteria remains extremely important."
"Serious efforts will be required in many areas, as has been underlined in the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010, the draft resolution of the European Parliament and the Commission's 2010 progress report."
"Let me highlight some of these areas."
"Turkey must further improve the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the freedom of expression and the freedom of religion, in both legislation and practice."
"Additional efforts will also have to be made in order to ensure full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, in respect of property rights, trade union rights, the rights of persons belonging to minorities, the rights of women and children, the fight against discrimination, gender equality and the fight against torture and inhuman treatment, among other areas."
"With regard to the freedom of expression, the areas giving cause for concern include restriction of the freedom of the press, insufficient protection of journalists' rights, as well as the frequent and large-scale banning of websites, which is also highlighted in Parliament's draft resolution."
"Allow me to refer at this point to the events of the last few days."
"On 3 March, the Turkish police arrested a number of journalists."
"We must monitor this case very closely and we must continuously remind the Turkish authorities of the importance of the continuous assertion of freedoms."
"Concerning the freedom of religion, Turkey must provide both the legislative and the practical conditions for it to be exercised."
"To guarantee religious pluralism in line with European norms, a comprehensive legal solution is required."
"Similarly, the Presidency is concerned about the large number of news reports about torture and inhumane treatment and specifically, abuse committed outside official detention facilities."
"In order to prevent the violation of human rights, the strict implementation of the act on the scope of activities and powers of the police, as amended in 2007, must be monitored."
"As highlighted by the draft resolution of the European Parliament, the affirmation of the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and the fight against impunity represent essential steps in this regard."
"As regards Turkish-Kurdish relations and the issue of the south-eastern territories, we hope that the implementation and continuation of the process of democratic opening will soon deliver the expected results, and can ultimately lead to the economic, social and cultural development of the region."
"Let me also recall that the Council strongly condemns the acts of terrorism committed in the territory of Turkey."
"It must also be highlighted that the Kurdistan Workers' Party is still on the EU list of terrorist groups."
"Moving on to relations between the EU and Turkey, I note with deep regret that despite being repeatedly asked to do so, Turkey still refuses to fulfil its obligations on the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the additional protocol to its Association Agreement."
"This is a core issue and therefore, the Council maintains its 2006 measures, which, on the other hand, clearly have an impact on the pace of the accession negotiations, as we all know."
"The Council continues to closely monitor and review any achievements made."
"Similarly, there has been no progress in relations between Cyprus and Turkey returning to normal."
"The Council expects Turkey to actively support the negotiations under way under the auspices of the UN for the just, comprehensive and feasible settlement of the issue of Cyprus, pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and with respect for the basic principles that represent the foundations of the EU."
"Turkey's commitment and contribution is indeed essential for such a comprehensive settlement."
"Moreover, I would like to emphasise that Turkey must make a clear commitment to good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes."
"Turkey is a key country of origin and a transit country in illegal immigration to the EU, and we therefore welcome the fact that the negotiations for a readmission agreement between the EU and Turkey have been concluded."
"The Council is looking forward to the agreement being signed as soon as possible and then implemented successfully."
"We are well aware that this took place at the latest Justice and Home Affairs Council, and we are now expecting Turkey to sign the treaty."
"Until that happens, the Council stresses once again the obligation to fully and properly implement the existing bilateral readmission agreements."
"In connection with the customs union between the EU and Turkey, I would like to note that it is time for Turkey to finally fulfil the large number of commitments it has failed to address so far."
"These include the technical and administrative barriers to trade, the registration requirements, the import licences, state aids, the assertion of intellectual property rights and other discriminative practices and provisions."
"These are all issues that need to be resolved urgently."
"Furthermore, Turkey must lift all the restrictions that affect trade and transport between EU Member States and Turkey."
"Thank you for your patience and I will be pleased to entertain any questions."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Parliament, and, in particular, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, for her report on Turkey."
"This debate and your resolution come at an important time for EU-Turkey relations, and the draft resolution underlines a number of issues of great importance for the Commission."
"The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey."
"The enlargement process encourages political and economic reform in the country."
"The EU-Turkey relationship is strong."
"Turkey needs the European Union and the European Union needs Turkey - this balance has not changed."
"The European Union is, and will remain, a key player for Turkey."
"The relationship is based on deep economic integration: 40% of Turkey's foreign trade goes to the EU and 80% of foreign direct investments in Turkey come from the EU."
"The European Union efficiently contributes to Turkey's modernisation through technology transfers, Turkey's participation in EU education and research programmes and our pre-accession financial support."
"At the same time, accession negotiations have slowed down."
"Moreover, the negotiating chapters that Turkey can aim to open under the present circumstances require significant reforms and adjustments."
"Against this background, I welcome all the more the progress made recently, in particular, as regards the competition chapter."
"I am confident that we can soon open this chapter, provided Turkey fulfils the last remaining conditions."
"Obviously, the Cyprus issue weighs on the negotiations."
"Positive steps on the implementation of the additional protocol to the Ankara agreement or in the settlement talks would have a positive impact on the accession negotiations."
"Let me turn now to the reforms in Turkey."
"I welcome last year's constitutional reform and the subsequent legislative amendments as a step in the right direction."
"Getting the laws right is important."
"However, only objective and impartial implementation of the new laws will ensure the success of the constitutional reforms."
"Turkey should continue with the constitutional reform."
"The process should be as inclusive and transparent as possible with the active participation of different political parties, civil society, non-governmental organisations and the general public."
"The Commission is following with concern the recent actions against journalists."
"Independence and freedom of the press is of utmost importance for democracy."
"In its 2010 progress report, the Commission has already highlighted the high number of court cases against journalists and undue pressure on the media which undermine this fundamental right in practice."
"Freedom of the press entails that dissent and opposing points of view need to be heard and - more importantly - tolerated."
"Freedom of the press means guaranteeing a public space for free debate, including on the Internet."
"The European Parliament's draft resolution rightly underlines these issues."
"As for the right to freedom of religion, we welcome the initiatives taken in favour of non-Muslim religious communities in Turkey."
"However, further and systematic efforts are needed to address the problems of non-Muslims and the Alevis."
"Let me turn to the issue of migration."
"Two weeks ago, the Council endorsed the EU-Turkey readmission agreement."
"This agreement is beneficial for the EU Member States, as Turkey is an important transit country for migration flows to the EU."
"The development on the readmission agreement also opens up for the first time new and concrete perspectives for further cooperation with Turkey in the area of visa and migration policies, with a view to improving mobility and contacts amongst our citizens and businesses."
"Turkey and the European Union have a shared interest in working closely together in this area."
"There are many good reasons to increase the ability of Turkish citizens, businessmen and students to travel to Europe: to familiarise themselves further with European standards; to enhance EU-Turkey trade to the benefit of both European Union and Turkish businesses, and to give a much-needed boost to our cooperation with Turkey."
"Madam President, I assure you that the European Parliament will be duly involved both on the issue of the readmission agreement and the visa dialogue, in line with the Treaty requirements."
"Relations with Turkey have also to be seen in a wider context."
"Turkey's active foreign policy is a strong potential asset for the European Union, provided it is developed within the framework of Turkey's EU accession process."
"The European Union stands ready to intensify its existing dialogue with Turkey on foreign policy issues of mutual interest."
"Speaking about Turkey today, we cannot ignore the major developments in its wider region."
"The events in Tunisia and Egypt have highlighted Turkey's stability, prosperity, and democracy."
"Citizens in these countries look at Turkey, as they look at the European Union, as examples to follow."
"They watch Turkey advocating standards and values that they are now fighting for themselves and that are associated with Europe."
"Let us be clear: while an example to others, Turkey has still a lot to do."
"Many of these challenges ahead are outlined in your report."
"This is the occasion for Turkey to move even closer towards implementing fully the European Union political criteria."
"The government has a very important responsibility to uphold such a privileged position and to lead by example for the benefit of its own citizens, but also for the region as a whole."
"Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and the report on Turkey comes three months before the parliamentary elections in Turkey."
"More so than in previous years, I have therefore done my best to ensure that the tone of the report is very objective and constructive."
"The 22 compromise amendments for the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs are evidence of that."
"On the basis of the developments over the past year, we, as the European Parliament, want to set our priorities, priorities for the new Turkish parliament and for the next government."
"There are six priorities, it seems to me."
"First of all, a heavy responsibility lies on the government and opposition to seek a compromise and consensus for further reforms."
"The opposition, and the government too, have indicated that they want a complete reform of the constitution and I expect this to happen."
"Secondly, checks and balances are the basis of any democratic system."
"Further steps need to be taken to strengthen an independent and impartial judiciary, parliament's supervisory role and, in particular, freedom of the press and freedom of expression."
"I am particularly concerned about freedom of the press, but I will come back to that."
"Thirdly, minority rights."
"I congratulate Turkey on the symbolic steps it has taken and on the dialogue which the government has explicitly sought."
"However, dialogue alone is not enough."
"The people in the southeast of the country, the Alevis, the Christian minorities, they expect something concrete."
"The statement on Mor Gabriel, in particular, proves that plenty of work still needs to be done and I suspect that it would be damaging for the Turkish Government if this case had to be settled by the Court of Justice once again."
"That is why something must be done about providing a democratic opening."
"Fourthly, women's rights."
"Much has been done in the past year, but laws alone are not enough."
"I have visited women's shelters."
"I have spoken to Turkish women's organisations."
"It is clear that efforts have been made ​​by both the Turkish Government and parliament, at national and local level, but things seem to grind to a halt when they reach the police and the courts."
"That has to change."
"Laws are all very fine, but enforcement is also important."
"Today, on the hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day, I would like once again to make a stand for better representation of women in the Turkish parliament."
"Things have to change in that respect in the coming elections."
"Fifthly, the Ankara Protocol is vital, in my opinion."
"Here, the responsibility lies with Turkey."
"That, in particular, is the source of deadlock in the negotiating chapters: let me reiterate that."
"Sixthly, foreign policy."
"We Europeans are in favour of Turkey playing an active role in the region."
"Having said that, I would point out that Turkey will only be able to play a bridging role in that respect as long as the pillar of that bridge remains firmly anchored on the European side of the Bosporus, too."
"Madam Ashton will, on that point too, have to seek very active coordination with Turkey, more active than has hitherto been the case."
"By the way, these are not just my priorities."
"Everything I have mentioned has been under discussion in Turkish society as well."
"It is now up to the politicians to translate this debate into a consensus and a compromise."
"Briefly, just two more areas of concern."
"We are alarmed by PKK's announcement that it wants to end the ceasefire."
"The Commissioner has spoken about this."
"Freedom of the press: last Friday, I received an open letter."
"Let me say once again that anyone who restricts the freedom of expression in a particular country attacks that country's culture."
"A free and tolerant debate is of crucial importance to any country."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, the continued consolidation of democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey, which should lead to full membership of our European Union, becomes even more important as Arab and Middle Eastern countries just beyond Europe's borders stand in crisis."
"We should welcome the fact that momentum has returned to the reform process in Turkey and, recognising the controversies of last September's referendum, call for it to be a platform for fundamental constitutional reform with all-party support in the future."
"I warmly endorse Commissioner Füle's work in this respect and his uncompromising words this afternoon on freedom of expression, particularly as I, with fellow European representatives, were prevented from acting as legal observers to the KCK cases in the Diyarbakir court only last month."
"But I also ask the Commissioner to make progress on the visa issue, particularly for businesspeople, and on holding Turkey to its promises for the draft trade union law."
"Our Socialist and Democrat Group believes that the accession talks are threatened, not by a train crash, but by death through strangulation."
"No new chapter has been opened for eight months, the longest period since the talks were first launched."
"We will vote tomorrow for the opening of the chapters on fundamental rights and judiciary and on the common foreign and security policy, not because we want to be weak on these issues, but because we want to be strong."
"We do not do so because we want to alter the pressure on all sides to achieve reconciliation on the island of Cyprus."
"Just as momentum is needed in the reform process for Turkey, momentum is needed in its membership talks with the European Union too."
"Madam President, Mr Füle has just made it completely clear that Turkey and the European Union need one another."
"We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union."
"We must show respect for one another."
"I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said."
"I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy."
"I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area."
"When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region."
"All of this is very good."
"Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked."
"It is extremely difficult to open new chapters."
"There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening."
"What will happen when the last chapters are opened?"
"Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another?"
"That surely cannot be the case!"
"Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission's progress report by means of a resolution."
"Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive."
"It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion."
"For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made."
"The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern."
"This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion."
"It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion."
"If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council."
"In diplomatic terms, we need Turkey and Turkey also needs us."
"In democratic terms, there is still a great deal to be done in Turkey."
"Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work in providing rigorously detailed documentation and in drawing up a report in the utmost good faith with the aim of sending clear political messages, particularly on the eve of the legislative elections in Turkey, and I endorse this work."
"This report - unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable - stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media."
"Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer."
"I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution."
"However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors?"
"There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations - in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 - and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner."
"Now, everyone can see that it is not."
"We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition."
"I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey's accession."
"I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation."
"Today, this is very clearly in question."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I recognise that there are differing views on Turkish accession both between and within the political groups in this Parliament, my own included."
"My personal view has always been very supportive of Turkish aspirations towards Europe."
"Of course there are concerns, but I would say that, given the turbulence we are now seeing in North Africa and the Middle East and against the background of a continuing threat from Islamist terrorism, never has it been more important for us to send a positive signal to Turkey that she is welcome in the club of the European democracies."
"I would ask our Greek Cypriot and Greek friends in particular to give up their unilateral approach to the Cyprus problem, to be more even-handed, and to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Turks before it is too late."
"We criticise Turkey over the Additional Protocol - we have heard the same again this afternoon from the Presidency-in-Office - yet no mention is made of the failure to implement the EU Council decision of 26 April 2004."
"Turkey is a key member of the Atlantic alliance, a democracy with a pivotal role at the interface between West and East, and a country that is changing fast with a growth rate that puts her among global leaders."
"Let us get moving!"
"Let us not lose Turkey at this stage!"
"Madam President, I shall refrain from commenting on Mr Van Orden's arguments, firstly, because I do not want to use up my time and, secondly, because he has - and not for the first time - confused the perpetrator with the victim in Cyprus."
"We are in favour of Turkey's accession, if that is the will of its people and provided that it satisfies all the accession criteria."
"In order for this to happen, Turkey needs to find a real political solution to the Kurdish question and to release the hundreds of Kurdish mayors and town councillors being held in its gaols, and it needs to work to establish the rule of law, recognise the Armenian genocide and resolve its problems with Greece, especially in the Aegean."
"On Cyprus, it must stop hiding behind what happened in 2004."
"It is already 2011."
"It must immediately hand the town of Famagusta over to its inhabitants - we are talking about a European town with a European history dating back several thousand years, a town which has been left to the ravages of time for nearly four decades - and it must start withdrawing its occupying troops from Cyprus immediately."
"To close, I would remind you of the protests by Turkish Cypriots calling, Mr Van Orden, for Turkey to give them a say in their own affairs."
"Instead, Eroglu has called for the protesters to be brought to trial."
"Turkey needs to respect the wishes of the Turkish Cypriots, by allowing a census to be taken in the occupied area and by putting an end to colonisation and allowing the names of the towns and villages to be shown on the map as they were for thousands of years."
"Madam President, my congratulations to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on the text which she has presented, which gives a balanced and accurate picture of the situation in Turkey."
"I particularly appreciate the position taken by Mr Füle."
"The message to come out of Mrs Oomen's report is that Turkey must discharge its obligations towards the European Union in full if it wishes to accede to the Union."
"If it does not wish to accede to the European Union, it should say so because, for a large country such as Turkey, I am against batting the issue back and forth and only talking in diplomatic terms."
"However, despite Europe's clear message to Turkey, it is acting in a contradictory manner."
"It is as if there were a problem between the political leadership and the military regime."
"At the same time, it demonstrates good intentions towards its neighbours one minute and makes a 'sieve' out of the Aegean the next, with Turkish aeroplanes and ships passing through and violating Greek land and air borders on a daily basis."
"We respect Turkey and the Turkish people, but we feel that it is high time that Turkey showed some respect for its neighbours and for the European idea set out in the Treaty of Rome."
"(NL) Madam President, we are talking about Turkey here, but Prime Minister Erdoğan would rather have a Turkish-Arabic Union."
"Turkey is a great friend of dictator Ahmadinejad."
"Turkey does not want to be a secular country any longer."
"Turkey continues to occupy Northern Cyprus and Turkey is no longer a friend of Israel."
"Instead, it has opted for the Muslim brotherhood of Hamas."
"Turkey is increasingly focusing on the Islamic world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when are we going to stop this sham?"
"Europe does not want Turkey and Europe does not want Islam."
"Mr Sarkozy has already said that."
"Mrs Merkel has already said that and the majority of European citizens do not want Turkey as a member of the European Union, either."
"Turkey has been humiliating itself for years in exchange for money from the European Union and the promise of EU membership."
"However, a backward Islamic culture has no place in Europe."
"Prime Minister Erdoğan, are you a real man or a subservient coward?"
"How much longer will you continue humiliating the Turkish people?"
"Take the honourable way out and stop doing that."
"Madam President, those who support Turkey's accession to the European Union, or some of them in this Parliament, feel duty bound to support amendments against Cyprus."
"Turkey is running out of chapters and the accession process risks stalling."
"Fourteen chapters are frozen because Turkey stubbornly refuses to extend the Ankara Protocol."
"A successful outcome to the current negotiations on solving the occupation of Cyprus will automatically make 14 chapters available."
"Ban Ki-moon urged all international actors to focus on the efforts for such a settlement."
"Voting in favour of amendments like the one on direct trade of 26 April in a divided Cyprus, unnecessary though in a united one, encourages intransigence, the failure of efforts for a solution and perpetuates the freezing of chapters."
"Picking on Cyprus leads Turkey nowhere."
"(ES) Madam President, I think it will become clear tomorrow that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has sought the broadest possible consensus in Parliament, because we want there to be a predominantly unified approach in all institutions of the Union."
"For years, this negotiating process has been useful in carrying forward political and economic reforms in Turkey: it has had its contradictions, setbacks and steps forward, but overall, it has been helpful."
"This could now be the moment of truth, and we are reminded of that by the changes that are currently taking place in the Mediterranean."
"In his recent appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Commissioner Füle called for a new realism that avoids a strictly short-term vision."
"This new realism is precisely what we need in the negotiating process with Turkey: the utmost caution, but also all the commitment and seriousness needed to avoid momentum and credibility being lost, and excessive insinuation; and to say clearly that agreements and commitments must be respected."
"That this requires a firm approach from everyone involved."
"Hopefully, in the next report, we will find that another step forward has been taken in this negotiating process."
"Madam President, people in Islamic countries today are doing something rather similar to the Turkish people's ousting of the single-party dictatorship in 1950."
"As Egypt, like Turkey, may yet discover, overthrowing the deep state is much harder and that is why the Ergenekon case and similar investigations are so important."
"Liberals in this House wish Mr Erdoğan and his government every success in creating a true democracy and anchoring it in our European club of democratic nations."
"The customs union has been a great success and Turkey's membership of the European Union can be equally successful."
"We regret the stalling of the accession process and, while Turkey must bear part of the blame, the bad faith of certain Member States - as revealed by WikiLeaks - is an embarrassment to our Union."
"Mr Sarkozy no more speaks for Europe on Turkey than he does on his Union for the Mediterranean."
"His visit to Ankara was inflammatory, and it is a pity that German Christian Democrats do not take Max Fischer's advice and look in the mirror, because the AKP today is the mirror image of the German CDU in 1950 - not Christian Democrat, but Islamic Democrat - and that is no doubt why the Commissioner says that he understands and shares Turkey's frustrations."
"This report is honest - too honest for some."
"Turkey has much to achieve, but we have much to lose if we do not welcome and work with Islamic democracies like Turkey and Indonesia."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an interesting and balanced report, although I have my doubts regarding certain matters."
"I have my doubts, for example, as to whether emphasis should be placed on increasing Turkey's involvement in the Southern Caucasus."
"This is a region which requires particularly delicate and well-balanced policies."
"It should be said, however, that the change in attitude to Turkey's efforts is what matters most."
"Everything resulting from the implementation of the Association Agreement, which is a good harbinger of the extension of Turkey's cooperation with the European Union, should be regarded with the hope that it represents an opportunity for the future, and that the doors to Europe are open, for Turkey as well."
"This should be stated very clearly in this House today, particularly since we expect that the consultations and cooperation on events in North Africa may prove to be a key aspect of good cooperation with Turkey."
"The fundamental goal we must achieve today is therefore to show Turkey's value as a partner for the EU in energy matters, and as a political partner for the EU in the future."
"(EL) Madam President, the recession has got worse and this has given new impetus to the fight between the imperialist centres for control of the markets and energy sources and the channels used for their transmission."
"Developments in Libya and the recent discovery of oil in the Mediterranean, and the friction which this has already caused, prove this."
"At the same time, NATO and the European Union are stepping up their interventions in the area."
"Turkey, on the other hand, is trying to improve its strategic position in an area in which conflict is rife and resistance is escalating."
"This purpose was served by the recent reform of the Constitution, which was welcomed with such gusto by the European Union and the United States."
"At the same time, however, Turkey continues with its occupation of northern Cyprus, its violations in the Aegean and its blatant disregard for basic human rights and democratic freedoms."
"The workers in Turkey know that there is nothing positive to be gained from the European Union, because basic rights of the workers and the people are being taken away in the European Union and because the European Union continues, as in the past, to support a series of reactionary regimes in the area."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if the Turkey issue were purely an economic one, I seem to understand that there would probably not be a problem."
"However, there are indeed serious problems, because the Turkey issue is clearly not just an economic one."
"In particular, we would like to highlight the issue of religious tolerance, which unfortunately does not exist in Turkey, not only because we could mention the murders of some priests, including Italian ones such as Monsignor Luigi Padovese and Don Andrea Santoro, but also because the Turkish delegates at a recent Council of Europe meeting sadly voted against a motion condemning attacks on Christians around the world."
"We find that astounding and wonder how we can accept a country that does not consider religious freedom to be a fundamental value."
"We also wonder how Mr Erdoğan's deputy, Mr Babacan, could possibly have said that the European Union is a 'Christian club'."
"What was he expecting to find?"
"Apart from that, does he not think that the problem perhaps is not the 'European Christian club' but the lack of religious rights inside Turkey?"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Füle, there is a Turkish proverb which says: 'People are reflected in their actions."
"Words do not mean much'."
"However, the supporters of Turkey have allowed themselves to be deceived by positive-sounding, empty words."
"The 2010 progress report is, in reality, a fault report."
"It shows that Turkey is many things, but it is certainly not ready to join Europe."
"Fundamental rights often exist only on paper and there are significant restrictions on freedom of speech."
"This has been confirmed by the recent arrest of two journalists."
"There have been no changes in the discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, such as the Kurds and the Christians."
"Prime Minister Erdoğan hypocritically accuses European countries of Islamophobia, despite the fact that Muslims are free to practice their religion here, in contrast to the Christians in Turkey."
"The land dispute over the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one more demonstration of this."
"Despite claiming the opposite, the Erdoğan government is pushing forward with the process of Islamification."
"We know that this is what is happening."
"A recent survey shows how the Turks really see the EU."
"They are in favour of joining the EU, but, at the same time, they regard Europeans with a great deal of mistrust."
"We should break off the accession negotiations as quickly as possible."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Füle, your historical comparisons could not be more wrong, Mr Watson."
"You should not compare the Justice and Development Party (AKP) with the party which returned Germany to democratic government and the rule of law at the end of the Nazi era."
"This is really alarming, particularly as the German party in question was in cooperation and in coalition with the Liberals during the 1950s."
"I am in favour of strong links between Turkey and the European Union."
"Turkey is strategically important to us, but not at any price."
"Firstly, we cannot abolish the conditions for accession, including freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, rights for minorities and freedom of religion."
"This has been made clear in the Commission's reports and in the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"Secondly, we must not put the integration capacity of the European Union at risk."
"We need to find other methods."
"Thirdly, it is Turkey's responsibility to ensure that this process is not obstructed and, at last, to keep the promises that it has made in the context of the Ankara Protocol, for example."
"Turkey is in a position to make it clear that integration within the European Union is possible."
"However, when Mr Erdoğan says in a speech in Germany that Turks who have German nationality owe their primary loyalty to Turkey, we have a serious problem as far as integration is concerned."
"This is the expression of a particular mindset and also a means of establishing it."
"Therefore, I am of the opinion that Turkey is not yet ready."
"However, we have invited Turkey to work constructively with us in the context of the Berlin Plus agreement and in other areas in order to forge closer links."
"The example of Mor Gabriel forms part of this issue."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, around two or three million Germans and British people live in southern Spain, Mr Brok."
"What would these people say if the Spanish Government demanded that their children learn Spanish before they learn German or English?"
"They would, of course, be opposed to it."
"You cannot simply say in Germany that people have to learn German first."
"Of course, they should learn both languages, but Germany still has a long way to go to establish a genuine integration policy."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Watson, people who live in Germany and intend to return to their home country will, of course, have their native language as their first language."
"However, people who want to take German citizenship and remain in Germany permanently must first learn German, so that they have a chance of doing well at school, getting an education and, therefore, having a successful career and becoming integrated into society."
"In this case, the language question takes priority."
"We need to distinguish between people who go abroad on holiday for the winter and those who want to remain permanently in another country."
"The distinction here concerns integration."
"You cannot compare people who go to Majorca on holiday with those who want to take the citizenship of a country and live there permanently."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the process of Turkey's accession to the European Union continues to be of strategic importance, both for Europe and for Turkey itself."
"This process is a measure of Europe's credibility and of Turkey's intentions to carry out the necessary democratic reforms."
"However, the government's stated intention of making democratic changes is belied by the facts."
"We have been following the successive arrests of journalists over the past few days with concern."
"On 20 February, the journalist Nedim Şener, known for his criticism of the police's approach to the murder of the Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink, was arrested along with six of his colleagues."
"They were all gaoled on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, thus bringing the number of journalists in prison to well over a hundred."
"What ultimately appears to be the real offence in these cases is their criticism of the Erdoğan government, rather than any criminal activities."
"The Union supported the government's efforts to stamp out the para-state."
"However, this cannot be used as an alibi for restricting personal freedoms, especially freedom of opinion."
"I call on Commissioner Füle to tell us how the Commission intends to react to these events."
"Madam President, I greatly regret that the Turkish accession process is stalled."
"Turkey fails to make the progress that we want, the Cyprus problem remains intractable, France and Germany are implacably opposed to Turkish membership, and there is clearly a great prejudice against Turkey inside this Parliament."
"We face a giant strategic crisis."
"Europe loses Turkey, and Turkey loses Europe."
"What we need to be doing is to devote 2011 to a genuine new partnership built on a radical reappraisal of where the true interests of both parties lie."
"(CS) Madam President, the report on Turkey's progress in 2010 is surely one of the most complex that we have discussed here."
"Despite all the complexity, however, we should not allow ourselves to be influenced by historically-based prejudices."
"Recent events in Turkey indisputably constitute factors that are unacceptable from the perspective of European democratic principles."
"We must intensify negotiations with Turkey all the more."
"Turkey is of fundamental geopolitical importance to Europe with regard to the complex region of the Middle East."
"This position must not, of course, be abused."
"If we have an open and principled dialogue with Turkey, however, this can lead to an improved understanding of democratic rules."
"The economic development of Turkey over recent years has been truly remarkable, and its industry is becoming a significant partner of European firms in many areas."
"It is therefore important for these economic relations to be matched by corresponding political relations with the European Union, with a clear perspective on the future."
"If Turkey is genuinely interested in joining the EU, it cannot take steps such as those we have seen recently."
"I strongly support, for many reasons, the continuing process of Turkey's approximation to the EU."
"(NL) Madam President, we have to stop using the term 'progress report' when we are talking about the negotiations with Turkey."
"It is a misnomer, because Turkey has made no fundamental progress in terms of meeting the conditions for joining the EU."
"We are completely stuck with the Cyprus dossier because the Turks keep refusing to comply with their obligations and because they are continuing with the illegal military occupation of the north of the island."
"No progress has been made in the sphere of democratic rights, either."
"People are being persecuted for expressing their opinions, websites are being blocked and Christians and other non-Muslims are being undermined in every way imaginable."
"When members of this House ask questions about that, time and again, the Commission responds that it is following the situation in Turkey closely and with concern."
"However, it has not taken any specific actions and negotiations keep dribbling on indefinitely."
"It is an open secret that, in private conversations, many proponents of Turkey's accession within the Commission, within their own Member States, and within Parliament, admit that the whole idea is a disaster."
"Let us therefore stop deceiving ourselves, let us stop deceiving public opinion in Europe and the Turks, and let us finally put a stop to negotiations with Turkey."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the honest and, therefore, critical evaluation of the accession negotiations in the current progress report on Turkey."
"Many promises have been made since the start of the negotiations, but very little concrete progress has been achieved."
"Given the pronounced Islamic nature of the country, all Christian and other non-Muslim faith communities must have equal rights, which means the freedom to practise their own religion without having to suffer discrimination."
"As far as I am concerned, this is essential."
"Turkey must undertake to bring about a complete separation between state and religion and to accept non-Islamic religions."
"The case of the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one example of the problem."
"I would like to remind the Member States of the European Union of their obligation to call forcefully on Turkey to uphold universal human rights and, in particular, freedom of religion in all their negotiations with the country."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that we are negotiating with Turkey about its accession to the EU, not on any other subject, and I am in favour of Turkey joining."
"I welcome the reforms that the Turkish Government has initiated over the last year. However, Turkey must also finally fulfil its obligations and implement the Ankara Protocol, so that progress can be made in the negotiations."
"It must not constantly hold the EU or Cyprus responsible for the deadlock, as you, Mr Erdoğan, are so happy to do."
"Turkey must finally put an end to the practice of arresting journalists who are critical of the regime."
"Ahmet Şık, Nedim Şener and others need protection from the arbitrary nature of the justice system."
"These are just some of the requirements for opening chapter 23."
"Mr Erdoğan, you need to make a clear statement on this and not speak out against the integration of your fellow countrymen and spread your pan-Turkish world view, as you did in Düsseldorf."
"That is what we expect from you."
"Of course, the EU must also make a contribution to the success of the negotiations and show that it is ready to accept new members."
"Both sides have their homework to do. However, one thing is clear."
"The ball is now in your court and it is your turn to take action."
"Madam President, I am conscious that this report is very controversial and that striking a compromise within this House can, at times, become extremely difficult, yet we should still try to keep our debates balanced and factual."
"Firstly, let us remember that the Ankara Agreement provided for the four freedoms of movement and for the customs union between Turkey and the EU."
"Also, several ECJ rulings, as well as existing visa regimes for other candidate states, have proved the point that visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens, especially businesspeople and students, should be clearly endorsed in this report."
"Secondly, we should call for new momentum on the stalled situation in Cyprus."
"Implementation of the Council decision of 26 April 2004 would greatly encourage Turkey to implement the EC-Turkey Association Agreement."
"This would not only lead to economic and political gains for both sides, but would also allow all the inhabitants of the island to trade freely, and it would eliminate the current double standards in the EU."
"It is time to show that the European Parliament can make a difference."
"(NL) Madam President, Turkey's accession to Europe would be one of the greatest historical mistakes ever."
"We would have a country of 80 million joining us and making claims on the European budget, European decision making and foreign policy."
"What this would lead to can be seen from Turkey's relations with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran."
"Turkey's accession would have a detrimental effect on integration, too."
"We are already witnessing that."
"Prime Minister Erdoğan has recently called on Turkish migrants in Germany to learn Turkish, first and foremost."
"To me, however, it makes sense that, if you are living in Germany, you should prioritise learning German."
"Mr Erdoğan's agenda is that of an Islamic party and, on that point too, the balance would shift if Turkey joined the EU."
"We would have to deal with millions of people who, unfortunately, are not familiar with the Judeo-Christian fundaments of Europe and who would want to change them."
"Let us therefore make sure that the 2010 progress report is the last one."
"Let us stop these senseless negotiations!"
"A privileged partnership - that would combine the best of both worlds."
"(NL) Madam President, progress and mutual trust will only come about once both Turkey and the European Union have met their respective commitments."
"The opening of new negotiating chapters will result precisely in the kind of new dynamism, as regards progress on human rights and justice, that we want to see."
"Press freedom is a major concern."
"Protection of this freedom, which has seen some difficult times, is a valuable asset."
"In a democracy, the press has an important role in putting checks on those wielding power."
"Obviously, there is a great onus on Turkey itself to implement EU legislation, but Europe has responsibilities, too, such as delivering on the commitments in the Association Agreement about the free movement of persons and on the conclusions of the Council of April 2004 on Cyprus."
"Finally, on this hundredth anniversary of International Women's Day, I would give some thought to women's rights in Turkey."
"There have been many improvements legally, but I call on the Turkish Government to do absolutely everything to ensure proper implementation of these and - in view of the upcoming elections - respond to Parliament's call for quotas to increase the number of women in representative positions."
"(PL) Madam President, I think it is obvious that Turkey will offer huge potential benefits in terms of our own policy towards the region, with regard to both the Caucasus and the Middle East."
"The new and unusually active Turkish policy towards the region obviously poses the question of whether it will be a Turkish policy under a European flag or whether it will, in fact, be a European policy with help from Turkey."
"Either way, it is a valuable perspective."
"It is my impression that this cooperation should be placed on a much more pragmatic basis as soon as possible, and that very protracted discussions on membership are - entirely unnecessarily - frustrating for both parties."
"There are various reasons why they have lasted so long, and the prospects for their completion are not particularly good at present."
"Today, I would like to express my thanks for the report tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, which is a well-balanced document, as usual."
"In particular, I am grateful that issues relating to the religious freedom of Christians in Turkey have been dealt with so well."
"This issue continues to be a problem, involving the legal personality of the Christian community, the return of property and opportunities for the training of clergy."
"We should remember this."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Oomen-Ruijten who, once again, has drafted a very comprehensive report on Turkey's progress."
"Every year, the European Commission adopts an 'enlargement package', and we draft a report assessing the progress towards accession to the European Union made by each of the candidate countries over the past 12 months on the basis of this package."
"In the Commission's assessment, Turkey fulfils the political criteria sufficiently."
"Recent constitutional reforms have provided opportunities for improvements in many areas, such as the judiciary and fundamental rights."
"The package of amendments to the constitution approved in last year's referendum is a step in the right direction, but the drafting and adoption of these reforms were not preceded by a consultation process involving the political parties and civil society."
"It is very much to be welcomed that the reform creates a basis for appointing an Ombudsman and creating a national human rights institution."
"It will now be of key importance to ensure that these new proposals are implemented transparently and on the basis of democratic procedures in accordance with European standards."
"Unfortunately, Turkey's relations with its neighbours cast an ever-present shadow over the negotiation process."
"I believe that if Turkey shows good will, creates a favourable climate for the ongoing negotiations on Cyprus and supports these negotiations, and if the country makes a tangible contribution to a comprehensive resolution of the problem, Turkey will have a warmer reception on the European and international stage."
"Thank you."
"(EL) Madam President, I wish to comment in particular on the Cyprus question, as presented in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's motion for a resolution."
"One year on and the colonisation continues, the presence of the occupying army continues in Cyprus and, not only that; for about a month now, we have seen Turkish Cypriots protesting against the presence of Turkish troops on the island and against the economic situation in the occupied area caused by the presence of the Turkish occupying army."
"How did the Prime Minister of Turkey respond?"
"By saying that it is in Cyprus not for the benefit of the Turkish Cypriots, but for Turkey's strategic interests."
"The moral values and principles of the European Union will not allow it to sacrifice Cyprus on the altar of Turkey's progress towards accession and I must say, as a socialist colleague reminded the House - and it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck - that it was not Cyprus that invaded Turkey; it was Turkey that invaded Cyprus."
"Let us not forget that."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I would like to join those who have congratulated the rapporteur on a very comprehensive and balanced report, but I join with those who have already mentioned that it is scarcely one of progress: this should be more of a situation report."
"To underline that this is a catalogue of very little progress on the major issues under discussion, she has very carefully listed in paragraph 40 the need for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus; in paragraph 47, as other speakers have done, she deplores Turkey's non-implementation of the Additional Protocol; and then, as others have not mentioned, she refers to the blockage of NATO-EU strategic cooperation beyond the 'Berlin Plus' arrangements."
"I believe it is very important that the Union does not give way on any of the issues or open any more of the chapters of negotiations until such time as we see that Turkey is a willing partner in this discussion."
"Or perhaps in the end, when you look at this whole process, you wonder whether there is the leadership on both sides to complete this or whether it was just an idea of the 20th century, which, in the 21st century, makes no sense at all."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, Turkey is a large country of strategic importance, but is it ready for Europe?"
"No, not yet."
"Is Europe ready for Turkey?"
"No, not yet."
"Has Turkey abandoned its aspirations to accession?"
"No, no yet."
"Three questions and three answers, Commissioner, which realistically set out the critical turning point which Turkey has reached on its path towards accession."
"They also summarise the complicated relationship between Turkey and Europe."
"For historical, political and cultural reasons, this relationship has always oscillated between trust and suspicion, between attraction and repulsion."
"The political expression of this reality is Turkey's long and painful journey towards accession."
"Despite the noteworthy progress that Turkey is making, it is still giving cause for concern on human rights issues."
"It is still haggling over every tiny obligation towards the European Union."
"It refuses to normalise its relations with a Member State, the Republic of Cyprus; it maintains the threat of war against another Member State, Greece, and it refuses to recognise and apply the Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"Recently, the arrogance of the Turkish leadership has even angered the Turkish Cypriots."
"For its part, Europe is still sending ambiguous messages about accession, which are doing nothing to help."
"We therefore need a clearer position."
"Only Turkey's full compliance with the undertakings it has made can and - it is only fair - must guide it towards accession."
"However, if we are to be fair, we must also be strict with Turkey."
"To close, my congratulations to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report, which I shall be voting in favour of, and I call on my colleagues to do likewise."
"Madam President, I am proud to stand up and welcome the progress made by Turkey in its accession to the EU."
"I have long been a supporter of Turkish accession."
"It is in the EU's interest and, indeed, it is in Turkey's."
"We can take a narrow, populist view or we can show leadership and vision."
"That leadership and vision is to bring Turkey into the EU, where it belongs."
"There have been some positive developments, but equally there is more to be done."
"I will offer some constructive suggestions."
"There needs to be more done to combat discrimination and to promote equality on the base of sex, gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age and sexual orientation."
"This should be guaranteed by law."
"Therefore, I ask the Turkish authorities to reinsert the reference to sexual identity into the draft law on combating discrimination and inequality."
"Time is running away."
"I could speak about this issue for a long time."
"It is worthwhile recalling that Turkey is a modern, secular country and that in Turkey, women got the vote long before women got the vote in some parts of the EU - something we should remember as we look back over one hundred years of feminism."
"(SK) Madam President, the transformation of Turkey into a genuine pluralistic democracy based on the protection of human rights and basic freedoms appears to be a continuing challenge."
"Turkey has not made any significant progress compared to last year in implementing reforms and fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, full compliance with which is an essential precondition for EU membership."
"Shortcomings persist, above all, in the judiciary, where the right to a fair and rapid trial is still not secured, in the area of minority rights and women's rights, and also in the issues of freedom of religion, expression, a free press and the fight against corruption."
"The lack of religious freedom is particularly evident."
"Turkey must improve the coordination of its foreign policy with EU foreign policy, and thus show that it shares common values and interests with the EU."
"A specific instance could be support for EU efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, for example, and signing the statute of the International Criminal Court, which Turkey evidently continues to postpone."
"I also expect Turkey to be much more active in resolving the Cyprus issue - as we say in Slovak - by pulling its military forces out of this occupied territory."
"(DE) Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to ask a question."
"Unfortunately, it is now a little too late."
"As you have seen, Mr Cashman has already left the Chamber."
"I have a few important questions which I would have liked to put to Mr Cashman."
"I would ask you to ensure that when a Member takes the opportunity to put a question under the blue card procedure, he or she is given the floor immediately."
"Otherwise, the Member who is being asked the question may leave the Chamber, as has just happened."
"However, perhaps I will have the chance to take the floor under the catch-the-eye procedure and I would like to thank you in advance for this."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten quite rightly says in her report, Turkey cannot join the European Union until the Cyprus question has been resolved, until the occupation has been lifted, until the army leaves Cyprus; it is Turkey itself that is tightening this noose around the accession process."
"That is why, Commissioner, anyone wishing to help Turkey should ultimately listen to what is being said by the Turkish Cypriots, who are currently protesting, not for direct trade or for its translation, as we heard today in the decision dated 26 April, but for Cyprus to be released from the occupation and for them personally to be released and rescued."
"I do not think, Commissioner, that Turkey can accede via a process to destroy Cyprus and anyone who wants to help Turkey needs to stop taking it out on Cyprus."
"This is a basic element that we all need to respect because, if the Cyprus issue is not resolved fairly, it will be disastrous for the European Union itself."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to admit that the excellent, outstanding work done by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten sees us engaged in a debate that is, however, still accompanied by a good dose of hypocrisy when we talk about the subject of Turkey."
"We are not managing to overcome this hypocrisy, but perhaps we could deal with it better if we considered a few general background factors."
"The first is that we must recognise the fact that we have utterly failed, or perhaps we have never even tried, to initiate a real strategy in relation to the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"The Turkey issue is closely linked to that."
"When we went on our mission to Tunisia a few days ago, the only Islamist party, al-Nahda, told us quite sincerely that it found inspiration in Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's AKP, and so in some way, people look to Turkey to be able to have a frontage towards Europe, but they do not know whether the opposite frontage, Europe, is willing to take it into consideration."
"We must ask ourselves what it is worth doing with regard to Turkey: is it worth being thoroughly sincere and moving quickly towards forms of privileged partnership that involve the whole Mediterranean area, or is it worth continuing to play for time and putting off our decision indefinitely, so that the Turks themselves, with their great pride, end up saying 'no' to us once and for all, thus further complicating the situation in the Mediterranean?"
"I believe we are the ones who should decide and not wait for the others to make a decision."
"We have specific responsibilities and we must assume them in their entirety."
"We must have the courage to say 'yes' or 'no', and then we will see that this situation will have a positive outcome."
"(BG) Madam President, I congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the fine job she has done."
"We regard Turkey as an important Euro-Atlantic partner."
"This is why I am sure that, in spite of our contradictions, we all agree that we need a reformed, democratic, secular and European Turkey."
"I personally feel deeply uneasy about the risk of Turkey's domestic and foreign policy taking an Islamic slant."
"We can see that part of Turkey's political establishment clearly has no desire to adhere to the principle of strict separation between religion and politics, as handed down by Atatürk."
"Europe needs to help Turkey overcome the internal division in Turkish society, which includes improving the situation of minorities and relations with its neighbours."
"We cannot, of course, point an accusing finger only at Turkey."
"Its neighbours also need to make their move in this direction."
"I expect us to work in partnership on all the common issues of general interest, especially cooperation in NATO and the energy infrastructure."
"Finally, I hope and expect Turkey to sign as soon as possible the anticipated readmission agreement with the European Union, without any delay and without imposing additional conditions."
"(SK) Madam President, the possible entry of Turkey into the EU would entail extensive economic, political and cultural consequences such as the EU has never faced before in any expansion."
"Despite the differences compared to European culture, tradition and values, however, Turkey is not a fundamentalist country and religion is the free expression of every individual."
"It is not possible to deny Turkey an attempt to fulfil the criteria for joining the EU, even though it is desirable, of course, to take more intensive measures to help settle the disputes between Turkish Cypriots and Greeks."
"A solution to the Cyprus question might then also bring greater stability, prosperity and security to the Eastern Mediterranean, and might help to speed up Turkey's EU accession process to some extent."
"However, I would like to say one thing in conclusion."
"We are here, ladies and gentlemen, just like our colleagues in the Commission and the Council, in order to be honest, and if we affirm that Turkey is gradually fulfilling the criteria, then we must not talk in advance about a privileged partnership."
"It would be better to tell Turkey directly that, despite fulfilling all the criteria, it will not achieve full EU membership."
"In my opinion, that would be honest on our part."
"(SL) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, the dramatic and profound political changes we have seen are a reminder that, while a democratisation process is under way in the Arab world, we are becoming more aware of the vulnerability of energy supply and our energy dependence."
"Turkey is our most valuable, obvious and persuasive example of a functioning democracy in the Arab world and, of course, an example of a booming economy."
"However, both the European Union and Turkey are still being held hostage by the unresolved issue of Cyprus."
"Some important chapters remain blocked for Turkey."
"Today, we need to highlight the urgency of the energy chapter being opened as soon as possible and we need to send a strong message to our Cypriot friends in Nicosia that opening this chapter would be to both our benefit and to the benefit of Cyprus and Turkey."
"Blocking this chapter is detrimental to Cyprus, Turkey and the entire European Union, to stability in the region, and to stability on the world markets."
"In addition, if we opened this chapter this year, we would demonstrate with our actions that we in the European Union are fit for purpose, able and effective in recognising the challenges and pitfalls of the past and future."
"If we fail to unblock this chapter, we will continue to be merely powerless and ineffective bystanders."
"Madam President, Turkey's momentum towards EU accession continues to falter."
"One reason, of course, is the non-compliance with the Ankara Additional Protocols and non-recognition and continued occupation of Cyprus."
"The refusal by the Turkish Government to open its ports and airports to trade from the Republic of Cyprus is unacceptable, but I would also like to mention the fact that they could also have a more constructive approach towards their neighbour Armenia, including the reopening of the shared border with Armenia and an acknowledgement of the deliberate mass killing of Armenians in 1915."
"Furthermore, Turkey's thinly disguised political support for Iran risks impeding the EU's efforts to stop the Islamist theocracy in Tehran from building a nuclear bomb, and that is deeply regrettable."
"I am also concerned by its increasing hostility to Israel, our ally, as witnessed by the Gaza flotilla episode and Turkey's officially published findings."
"Turkey continues to maintain the Greek Orthodox Monastery at Halki closed for no apparent reason, and to deny its ancient Syriac Christians full community rights."
"There can be no doubt in my mind that Turkey must now redouble its efforts if it wants to make further progress towards the EU and its values."
"(EL) Madam President, of all the problems which Turkey faces on its path towards accession, as set out in the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, whom I thank, such as the Kurdish problem, the Armenian problem, freedom of the press and the need to respect women's rights, the Cyprus problem is the most tangible."
"A candidate country cannot occupy European Union territory."
"If it wishes to continue on its path towards accession, it needs to withdraw its troops from Cyprus and end the occupation of Turkish and Greek Cypriots."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by applauding the effort of the Turkish administration to approximate its political structures to a European value system."
"On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore persistent problems in the area of respect for human rights, especially the rights of minorities and women, and the suppression of freedom of religion."
"However, the most serious problem appears to be the fact that Turkey still occupies almost 50% of the territory of one of our Member States - Cyprus."
"The EU is therefore indirectly involved in a military conflict with Turkey."
"This conflict has cost many inhabitants of Cyprus their homes and so far, it offers no hope of a solution to this unlawful state of affairs."
"I therefore think that the dialogue between Brussels and Istanbul requires more openness, so that our Turkish friends can understand that the path to the EU leads only through criteria which cannot be circumvented."
"If it seems to our Turkish friends that they are not prepared to fulfil the demanding criteria of the EU, it would be proper to acknowledge this honestly and put forward a sensible alternative for our common coexistence."
"Madam President, the report is rather given to understatement."
"I quote, 'significant efforts are needed on fundamental rights'."
"The author, Orhan Pamuk, escaped prosecution for a heretical view of Turkish history only because of his international fame."
"The law is still in place."
"Could the EU possibly tolerate the suppression of heretical academic opinion in a Member State?"
"Later, the report says that there is no progress towards normalisation of relations with Cyprus."
"In plain language, this means that Turkey still occupies, with force of arms, the northern part of that country, expropriating the property of Greek Cypriots and desecrating and plundering their places of worship and burial."
"Until Turkey withdraws its troops unconditionally, returns property and repairs damage, there should be no relations with Turkey at all, let alone negotiation for its EU membership."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it has indeed been a good and useful debate, reflecting a number of opinions and views."
"But, as many of you underlined, if Turkey indeed fulfils all relevant accession obligations and we remain committed and serious, then we will be able to avoid most of the frustration some of you referred to and move forward."
"I also agree with those who are saying quite clearly that moving on the Additional Protocol, the Ankara Agreement, and achieving progress on the comprehensive settlement talks on Cyprus, would create a momentum for the accession negotiations."
"I also agree with those who indicated that the rules of the game should not be changed in the middle of the game."
"But let me make it absolutely clear."
"For me, this is not a game; for me, this is a serious process."
"I strongly believe that, at the end of this process, most European Union and Turkish citizens will see clearly the benefits of a new and modern Turkey being a Member of the European Union."
"My second remark would be that this year's report is indeed very balanced."
"What I very much appreciate, and what the rapporteur has managed, to a large extent, to take into account, as has the debate today, is the need to look at the bigger picture and not just present this House with a list of incidents and problems."
"My third point is that I also agree with those who are making it absolutely clear that the key to a number of the chapters is in the hands of our Turkish partners."
"I am one of those who would like to see chapters such as Chapter 15 on Energy and, especially, Chapter 23 on the Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, opened."
"This is very important, particularly Chapter 23."
"I think it would be in the interests of both Turkey and the European Union to work on establishing a track record on these important issues."
"It has been said that 14 chapters are frozen because of the Ankara Protocol."
"Let me make a personal comment."
"I think there is a distinction between those chapters which are frozen unilaterally and those which are frozen based on the recommendation of the Commission, because of the non-commitment of Turkey towards customs union, and then agreed by the Member States by consensus."
"Chapters 23 and 15 are among those being frozen unilaterally."
"As a last point, let me also address an issue which is very much on our minds these days, and that is the situation of media freedom in Turkey."
"Last Thursday, I issued a clear statement to make absolutely sure that a message is sent to our Turkish colleagues that Turkish law does not sufficiently guarantee freedom of expression in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, and to make it absolutely clear that Turkey urgently needs to amend its legal framework to improve the exercise of freedom of the press both in practice, and in a significant manner."
"I raised this issue in very much the same terms with Mr Davutoğlu, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, last Friday."
"But let me also make the following comment."
"I think it is important not to shy away from commenting critically where we see problems."
"But it is also important to help Turkey put the legislation into such a form, such order, that it corresponds to the abovementioned Convention."
"I am thinking about how to involve both the Council of Europe and the OECD in this process, and I will be informing the House about the results of these consultations and the way I recommend we proceed."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this excellent debate."
"A multitude of arguments, both for and against, have been put forward with regard to both Turkey's preparedness and the whole accession process."
"This, too, indicates the complexity of the situation and of how difficult the task of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was."
"I believe that she did an excellent job in creating a report which reflects very well how difficult it is to evaluate the situation and Turkey's preparedness."
"There are, however, points on which we are in agreement, and in my opinion, this was also reflected in this debate."
"I believe that there is not only an agreement here between the parties but also on the part of both the Commission and the Council."
"The first of these points is that we need a European Turkey and it is in our interest to assist with this process."
"We are talking about a strategic partner here."
"I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a country with a small area in Europe as our friend."
"There is also no doubt that this is a process based on conditions, and that Turkey must comply with its obligations, all those it has undertaken, and in order to ensure that we can make progress in the negotiations, it must meet the benchmarks and expectations we have formulated."
"There is also no doubt that Turkey must strive for good neighbourhood relations."
"This is a matter which is not to be questioned in any accession negotiations."
"We could see that there is a debate on how much progress there has been, and how many tasks Turkey has completed."
"I believe that we cannot call into question the achievements of the constitutional reform and that there has also been progress in minority affairs, for example, albeit partial."
"No one questioned the fact that there is still a very long way to go."
"It is enough to refer again to the issue of the freedom of the press, the situation of women or the operation of the justice system."
"If we are looking at how new life can be breathed into the accession negotiations, we should examine our scope of action."
"As mentioned by Commissioner Füle, there are indeed 13 chapters that remain open and we only managed to close one, while 16 have been frozen, where we cannot make any progress at the moment."
"De facto we can work on three chapters, namely, those on competition, public procurement, and social policy and employment."
"The best prepared of these is the chapter on competition, and much has been done during the Belgian Presidency as well in order to enable us to open the chapter, and the Commission is working very hard, with our maximum support, to open this chapter at least during the term of the Hungarian Presidency."
"Again, Turkey must meet a very large number of conditions to that end."
"I trust that there will be progress in this respect, and I truly do not wish to see for months on end that we are still unable to open another chapter."
"Many have asked or indicated that progress in the matter of visas would be welcome."
"Let me be frank with you."
"The Hungarian Presidency would encourage the Commission to commence the dialogue, but we all know that in the Council meeting, the situation was not entirely clear in this regard, and a number of Member States have expressed their doubts."
"I believe, as does the Hungarian Presidency, that it would be in our interest to launch the dialogue."
"There have been several references to the freedom of religion and the persecution of Christians."
"The Council has received its share of criticism for not addressing this issue."
"Although this falls under the competence of Lady Ashton as the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Council, let me tell you that the issue was added to the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in January."
"At that time, there was no agreement, but the February Foreign Affairs Council did adopt a resolution in which the persecution of all religious minorities, and specifically Christians, was condemned, so the Council did actually address this matter."
"Lastly, please allow me to also ask us all a question, because we have been talking about what Turkey has done, whether it has done enough and whether it is working properly towards accession."
"However, let us also think about all that depends on us."
"And if we want to be honest, we will see that Europe is not living a period of inclusion."
"We look at what is happening in North Africa, but if you look at what is going on within the European Union or in our even more immediate neighbourhood, you will see that Turkey is one of the five candidate countries, but there are also four others."
"To what extent can we support these processes?"
"How prepared are we to conclude the accession negotiations with Croatia?"
"How prepared are we to admit Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area?"
"How prepared are we to uplift Europe's hard-fated community, the Roma?"
"Inclusion is on the agenda in a great variety of contexts."
"Europe has now turned somewhat inward."
"Let me state this with a great deal of openness."
"There is an enlargement weariness."
"We must deal with our own public opinions, with how open we are with regard to these issues."
"I believe that maybe we should be thinking in a somewhat longer term."
"If we consider the long-term interests of the European Union, that is, to retain its attractiveness to both EU citizens and our immediate neighbours, whether it be Turkey or all the North African countries, I believe that we should bring back a more inclusive Europe within ourselves, naturally, with the proviso that this can by no means be unconditional, and that we must not save on the work that is expected from all candidate countries."
"It would, in my opinion, be a very grave moment for the European Union if Turkey lost interest in it."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to say once again that I - and we - drafted the report quite carefully."
"The point of order I would like to make is the following: I want to ask colleagues not to come up with new amendments because, if we want to have an un-polarised debate on this, if we want a big commitment by the whole plenary ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 9 March 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the steps which have been taken so far by Turkey, but I want to stress that there is still considerable progress to be made."
"Specific measures need to be taken in areas such as freedom of the press, the status of women in Turkish society, dialogue between the political parties and, in particular, recognition of Cyprus, which is an EU Member State."
"This conflict casts a huge shadow over Turkey's EU accession negotiations."
"This is why Turkey must demonstrate proper determination to resolve the dispute."
"However, I think that Turkey's accession negotiations must advance to encourage reforms in this country, bearing in mind that Turkey provides a model for the Arab countries."
"Turkey would help spread stability in the volatile regions beyond its eastern and southern borders."
"It is also worth mentioning how important Turkey is to the European Union as it is a key player in the energy sector."
"Turkey's integration into the EU can be beneficial to both sides, in the short and medium term and, most of all, in the long term."
"I want to welcome the significant progress made by Turkey with regard to its accession to the European Union."
"I believe that this country has shown that it is completely determined to meet all the criteria to become a full member of the EU, and our role is to support it."
"Many of my fellow Members have raised today the discussion of the fundamental rights issue."
"However, I would like to ask why this report does not call on the Council to initiate negotiations on the justice and fundamental rights chapter."
"This chapter is blocked by the Council, even though it is the most important in terms of Turkey meeting EU democratic standards."
"Fellow Members, tomorrow we must vote for the amendment requesting this chapter to be opened up."
"Otherwise, the European Parliament will send negative signals to Turkey, which will affect our credibility."
"We are two years away from an important anniversary."
"This year, it is 48 years since Turkey became a candidate country for joining the EU."
"It is beyond dispute that much has happened since then."
"The economic development of the country, along with the opening up of EU markets, have certainly played their role."
"However, the country still has a problem over a number of factors which hark back to the creation of the modern Turkish state."
"The treaty of 1924 clearly declares that citizens professing the Islamic faith are Turks, while citizens professing another faith are regarded as Greek Catholics."
"The treaty does not recognise other ethnic groups."
"That which was progressive in 1924, namely, recognition of the fact that someone could be of a religion other than Islam, has quite different connotations today."
"It is by no means a simple matter in Turkey to declare an ethnicity other than Turkish, whether it be Kurdish, Circassian or any other of the nationalities that have clearly existed in Turkey for a great many years, but whose recognition in real life, including the promotion of ethnic rights, will take a long time yet."
"The key issues in the problematic situation over the negotiations at the moment are the failure to resolve the occupation of Cyprus, inactivity over the UN resolution on Famagusta and a failure to fulfil the 'tasks' arising from previous reports."
"The reduced role of the army is positive, but only if secular forces remain in power."
"If this is not the case, it could threaten the stability of the entire region."
"I welcome the efforts made by my colleague, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, in drafting this report, but I reserve the right not to agree with its entire content."
"Firstly, I think that accession negotiations should get under way in the case of the chapters for which the technical preparations have already been completed."
"There is a simple reason for this."
"It could enable us to have a dialogue which will force Turkey to adopt the acquis communautaire."
"While recognising the progress made by Turkey in meeting the technical criteria for opening the negotiations on competition, we must also tell the authorities in Ankara that additional efforts are required in this area."
"I also think that opening the negotiations on the chapter on justice and fundamental rights can provide the ideal context to encourage Turkey to progress along the path of reform in this area, which is our common aim, in my view."
"I also think that we should ask the Council to step up the dialogue with Turkey on foreign policy as, particularly in the context of recent events in North Africa, this country can act as an ally which will encourage democratisation and development in the region."
"Every year, we hold a debate on Turkey's membership of the EU."
"As a general rule, the problems raised are the same - Turkey makes a certain amount of progress in bringing itself into line with EU requirements, but the progress is never satisfactory enough to give a clear indication of an approximate date for accession, or to state whether the country will, in fact, ever join the EU."
"The changes which have already been made are beneficial, but the EU's failure to adopt a clear position on Turkey's accession is a source of frustration for the Turkish authorities and the country's citizens."
"We cannot, of course, demand that the Member States take an identical view of the matter, but our indecisiveness means that the EU appears to lack credibility."
"Support for EU membership is falling among Turkish citizens."
"The country may start to look for new allies and turn away from the West, which would be disadvantageous to Europe."
"Turkey is our strategic partner in economic, regional and energy matters, and it is also a significant military force and a key player in the Middle East."
"The problematic areas are always the same - human rights and civil liberties, the rights of women and national minorities, the rule of law, reform of the judiciary, corruption, freedom of the press and freedom of speech - and they still fall a long way short of European standards, despite the efforts that have been made."
"Whether the negotiation process can be accelerated depends on how quickly and how effectively Turkey can fulfil the conditions imposed on it, and on the form of membership that the EU proposes to the country."
"There can be no doubt about the fact that Turkey's membership of the European Union is a contentious issue, with many opposing accession and many supporting it."
"There can, however, also be no doubt about the fact that numerous democratic reforms have been carried out as part of the process of Europeanisation in Turkey, as a result of which the negotiating framework for Turkey's accession was agreed on 3 October 2005."
"The opening of negotiations can be regarded as a success not only for Turkey, but also for Europe, since the main motive for Turkey to carry out reforms was its European ambitions."
"While recognising the significant progress made by Turkey to date, it should, however, be remembered that there are many problems which are hampering its integration into the EU."
"Above all, these include constitutional reform, freedom of the press, women's rights and the protection of national minorities."
"A modern democratic state must be based on the principle of division of power and a balance between the executive, legislative and judicial authorities, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and, in particular, freedom of expression and a legal framework which guarantees women's rights and gender equality."
"I welcomed the announcement by the Turkish Government and opposition that they are willing to carry out reforms to transform Turkey into a fully-fledged pluralistic democracy, and I hope that all political parties and society will be involved in the entire constitutional process."
"Turkey plays a strategic role as a stabilising force in the region of the Caucasus and Middle East."
"It is also an essential component of the plan for diversifying Europe's fuel supplies."
"Ankara's policies may serve as a model for the Arab countries in the region."
"The European Union should therefore continue to take an active approach to building positive relations with Turkey, inter alia, by increasing funding for joint strategic energy investments such as the Nabucco gas pipeline, and by means of greater support for the development of trade relations."
"Brussels must show that it recognises the progress towards integration with the European Union that has been made by Ankara in recent years."
"Nevertheless, many issues still require the EU to put pressure on Turkey, and further progress with negotiations is out of the question until they have been resolved."
"I need only mention the reconciliation and reunification of Cyprus, acceptance by Ankara of responsibility for the Armenian genocide, and further development of the democratic system."
"European integration process of Montenegro (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European integration process of Montenegro."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will be voting on the resolution on the European integration process of Montenegro tomorrow."
"I consider the commitment of the European Parliament to preserve the openness of the European Union very commendable."
"At the same time, you will also have an important role in winning over the general public of the Member States to the cause of enlargement, of enlargement based on conditionality."
"The resolution you will be adopting tomorrow also confirms the realisation of this responsibility."
"Let me tell you that there is utmost commitment on the part of the Council as well."
"In line with the renewed enlargement consensus approved by the European Council, the Council confirmed in its conclusions of 14 December 2010 that the EU firmly supports the continuation of the enlargement process in the Western Balkans countries on the basis of the principles and conclusions adopted."
"The Hungarian Presidency of the European Council is also deeply committed to this objective."
"I would like to thank you for the excellent work you have done, and for contributing through this resolution to the consolidation of Montenegro's achievements, for which there is a great need throughout the accession process."
"We have confirmed Montenegro's European perspective on several occasions."
"The stability of the country and its orientation towards Europe, which is supported by all political parties as well as the majority of the citizens, and the high degree of consensus between the various ethnic groups, are all features which make Montenegro a stabilising factor in the Western Balkans region."
"Let us not forget that Montenegro achieved visa liberalisation, the conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement, and obtained candidate country status within 12 months."
"These are significant results, and prove that a European perspective acts as a driving force for the preparations of a country."
"The EU must therefore acknowledge the commitment and achievements of the countries intending to join."
"Thanks to the progress made, further steps can be taken in the country's European programme; new commitments can be made and new requirements can be formulated."
"To this end, delegations of the EU institutions and the Member States, at different levels and in different fields, are meeting on a daily basis these days."
"We therefore welcome the current steps taken by Montenegro, particularly the action plan just adopted by its government, drawn up in response to the recommendations formulated in the Commission's opinion, and we also welcome the method employed, namely, that the government held extensive consultations with civil society before the drafting of the action plan."
"Please allow me to give a quick list of the so-called key priorities where progress needs to be made."
"These are also mentioned in the Commission's November 2010 opinion."
"These include the reinforcement of the rule of law, the continuation of the reform of public administration, as well as the strengthening of public administration capacity, the adoption of an electoral law that complies with the constitution, and increased media freedom."
"This is not only important from a legal point of view, but also represents a touchstone for the political maturity of the authorities."
"Furthermore, it is extremely important to guarantee the legal status of persons who were forced to leave their homes and to respect their rights, as is the fight to eliminate organised crime and corruption."
"We are expecting serious progress from Montenegro in this respect as well."
"In order for any subsequent step to be taken in the stabilisation and association process in general, and specifically in the commencement of the accession negotiations, it is very important for Montenegro to make progress in these areas and also to make further efforts."
"It is essential for Montenegro to fulfil its undertakings and to be able to present tangible results."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Montenegro plays an important part in regional cooperation."
"It engages in close cooperation with its neighbours and we honestly welcome the constructive role it is playing in stabilising the region and promoting good neighbourhood relations, particularly as the country holding the Presidency of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process."
"Moreover, Montenegro is home to the new workgroup on culture and society of the Regional Cooperation Council, the Cetinje Parliamentary Forum."
"Integration is inconceivable without regional cooperation, and Montenegro sets an example in this respect."
"The resolution to be adopted by Parliament represents an actual stocktaking of achievements."
"It is an accurate account of the current situation and a useful guideline to the tasks of the candidate country."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, as well as all those who actively participated in the creation of the document."
"Finally, I would like to encourage Montenegro and the Montenegrin authorities to continue their reform efforts and to endeavour to meet the expectations of their own citizens."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is an honour for me to address the European Parliament on the European integration process of Montenegro."
"Let me start where the Presidency has ended in congratulating the rapporteur for Montenegro, Mr Charles Tannock, on his report, and expressing my gratitude to all honourable Members who have contributed."
"Parliament plays a key role in enlargement policy."
"I believe that, with the concerted action of all the European institutions, we can achieve more."
"Montenegro's overall progress towards fulfilment of the criteria for European Union membership has been remarkable."
"There is a growing political consensus."
"The country has made important progress in putting in place its legal and institutional framework."
"It is also strongly committed to regional cooperation."
"There is a solid record of structural economic reforms and progress in most areas of the acquis."
"The European Council decision to grant candidate status to Montenegro is a recognition of these achievements and a strong signal which confirms the credibility of the European Union's enlargement policy."
"The country has entered a decisive stage."
"Candidate status is a great responsibility for Montenegro."
"Tangible results are needed in order for Montenegro to be able to move to the next stage of European integration."
"I am confident that the European Parliament resolution will send the right message to Montenegro of acknowledging past achievements, but also the strong expectation that the reform process will be pursued with determination and that all the key challenges on Montenegro's path to European Union membership will be thoroughly addressed."
"I met the new Prime Minister of Montenegro, Dr Igor Lukšić, last week."
"His commitment to pursuing the reform process and his strong determination to meet the key priorities set out in the Commission opinion are encouraging."
"On 17 February, after public consultations with civil society and talks with the Commission services, the government adopted an action plan to address the priorities."
"It is now crucial to focus on implementation and establish a solid track record."
"The key priorities set out in the opinion are a significant, but achievable, challenge that requires the involvement and commitment of all actors in Montenegro."
"Previous enlargements have shown the importance of addressing key issues under the political criteria, as well as Chapter 23, early in the accession process."
"Early solid achievements in this area in Montenegro, notably, in the politicisation of the public administration, the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and the effective fight against corruption and against organised crime, will later ensure smooth negotiations and integration into the European Union."
"Montenegro must improve its electoral framework, in line with the recommendations of the OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission."
"The Parliament needs strengthening, which is an important priority for both the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Effective compliance with European standards in the field of human rights is essential, in particular, regarding freedom of expression and relations with civil society."
"Further efforts are needed to strengthen anti-discrimination policy, notably, gender equality and the effective protection of vulnerable groups."
"Sustainable solutions are needed for displaced persons."
"Other shortcomings identified in the opinion and in your draft resolution also need to be addressed."
"Montenegro needs to strengthen its administrative capacity and to upgrade its preparation in a number of areas of the European Union acquis."
"The future of Montenegro undeniably lies in the European Union and we should act responsibly."
"The credibility of our enlargement policy is based on the enlargement countries respecting the conditionality towards the European Union and the European Union respecting its commitment towards the enlargement countries."
"It is in all our interests to ensure that the progress of Montenegro towards the European Union is based on solid achievements and concrete results."
"Montenegro's performance this year will be assessed in the enlargement package due in October 2011."
"Only when the Commission has established that Montenegro has achieved the necessary degree of compliance with the accession criteria, in particular, the seven key priorities set out in the opinion, will it be in a position to recommend opening negotiations."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I visited Montenegro twice during the past eighteen months, with my colleague Anna Ibrisagic from the PPE as shadow rapporteur, to form my own assessment of the country's progress towards, first, candidate status and, now, the prospect of EU membership."
"I have been extremely impressed by the diligence and commitment of the entire Montenegrin Government."
"No matter how small it may be, it is certainly one that works extremely hard."
"I would pay very special tribute to the former prime minister, Milo Ðjukanović, and his recent successor, Igor Lukšić, who have both been pragmatic and, at the same time, single-minded in their approach and in their quest to lead their country towards EU accession and NATO accession."
"The onus is now on Montenegro to meet the EU's expectations."
"In particular, the Montenegrin Government needs to address the seven key priorities identified by Commissioner Füle in the Commission's opinion."
"I particularly emphasise the issue of corruption and organised crime, on which there are clear and well-defined benchmarks for measuring progress."
"I am pleased that last month, the government adopted a very well formulated action plan aimed at responding to these priorities and demands."
"In my view, Montenegro is now ready to start negotiating EU membership as an official candidate, and it is curious that the Commission should be insisting on a significant time-lapse between the granting of official candidate status and the opening of negotiations."
"This delay has no real justification or apparent basis, according to my reading of the Treaties."
"More importantly, it is hardly the most positive signal to send to Podgorica, or indeed to countries elsewhere in the region, such as Macedonia, working hard to obtain candidate status."
"I only hope that this enforced wait, which now is inevitable and is frustrating to Montenegro, will not result in a weakening of the country's commitment to an engagement with the European Union."
"Montenegro should be judged solely on merit, facts and achievements."
"Its case should not be tied to the progress in other neighbouring states in the western Balkans."
"Montenegro is a small country but a beautiful country, which has enjoyed remarkable stability and economic growth since its peaceful divorce from Serbia."
"It has few, if any, internal ethnic or religious problems, unlike some of its larger neighbours."
"It has a minor border dispute with Croatia, which it will resolve peacefully before the International Court of Justice."
"It has recently negotiated and ratified extradition treaties with both Serbia and Croatia in the fight against organised crime."
"It is euro-based: it has the euro without being in the eurozone, believe it or not."
"Its economy remains undiversified - sadly - relying mainly on tourism and one aluminium smelter."
"It needs to create more jobs in hydroelectric power for export, and financial services may well be another solution."
"Personally, I remain optimistic for what is essentially a very good news story in the western Balkans."
"Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for Montenegro for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would first like to thank Mr Tannock for his excellent cooperation and a very sound and well-balanced report."
"I would also like to urge my fellow Members to give their support tomorrow to the report that we have before us."
"I would like, in particular, to emphasise the fact that I have a very positive view of the European Council's decision of December 2010 to grant Montenegro candidate status with the prospect of EU membership."
"At the same time, it is important for us not to stop there, but to quickly continue towards the goal, which is EU membership for Montenegro."
"The political and economic stability that Montenegro has continually shown right from the time it became independent is immense."
"This country is often described as a success story - and we heard it today from the Council, too."
"Like Mr Tannock, I also think it is regrettable that candidate status has been disconnected from the right to begin negotiations."
"I therefore believe that the Commission should initiate membership negotiations as quickly as possible and set a date to start these negotiations with Montenegro."
"It is clear that the reform process must continue, for example, within the judiciary and with regard to combating conflicts of interest in public administration, and that the priorities recommended by the Commission must be dealt with, but I would nevertheless like to praise the government of Montenegro for the positive reforms that it has succeeded in implementing so far."
"Today, we have Montenegro's ambassador with us here in the Chamber, and I hope and look forward to the day when we can welcome not only the ambassador, but the whole of Montenegro to the EU and the representatives of Montenegro to this Parliament."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Tannock for his constructive cooperation on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, too."
"I am pleased that Montenegro can now pursue a path towards EU membership."
"I agree that the Commission should initiate the negotiations as soon as possible, provided, of course, that Montenegro continues to move towards the EU's targets."
"The fact that Montenegro has now been granted candidate status sends out a strong signal about the EU's commitment to the future of whole of the former Yugoslavia in the EU."
"Like Croatia, Montenegro can show the remaining countries the way to EU membership."
"Rapprochement to the EU is a key factor for both prosperity and stability in the region."
"That is abundantly clear."
"Montenegro is a small, new and peaceful country that is strongly committed to regional cooperation."
"It has good relations with its neighbouring countries and, hence, good prerequisites for success in the forthcoming membership negotiations."
"However, there are areas that require vigorous reforms."
"The legal and administrative capacity to form a fully viable society based on the rule of law has been strengthened, but more is still required."
"Corruption and organised crime are rife and the legal system needs a great deal of further enhancement in order to meet the EU's requirements."
"I have tabled a number of amendments in order to point out that Montenegro also needs to strengthen the position of women, secure freedom of the press, safeguard the fundamental rights of workers and minorities and, in particular, develop civil society."
"We must not forget that these, too, are crucial areas in the forthcoming EU negotiations."
"I welcome Montenegro's membership of the European Union as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Tannock on his report and on the cooperation he has shown in formulating it."
"If, by adopting the resolution on Montenegro, we wish to renew, in principle, the commitment towards continuation of the process of European Union enlargement and towards enabling all the states of our continent to develop under the aegis of Union membership, then we first need to ensure fulfilment of the following steps, first of all for Montenegro, and then also for Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, not forgetting Turkey of course."
"For Montenegro, this would mean that the granting of candidate status and the decision, in principle, to start negotiations should be followed by the actual opening of negotiations."
"Meanwhile, much more work awaits the Montenegrin Government in terms of harmonising legal systems and enabling administrative capacities."
"The fight against corruption, in all its diverse forms, must continue and must result in the conviction of those who have engaged in corrupt practices."
"Ensuring equality and respect for women is not a task that deserves to be highlighted today only."
"Freedom of expression, media independence and protection of minorities are all values which any candidate for membership in the European Union must unconditionally respect."
"The young Montenegrin democracy must provide an appropriate and prominent place in its society for NGOs."
"Commissioner, I would like to bring to your attention a particular wish which I heard while staying in Montenegro and speaking to its politicians there."
"It is important that relations between Montenegro and Serbia evolve without Serbia attempting to interfere with its neighbour's development through ethnic Serbian parties."
"That school of thought has already done great damage in the history of south-eastern Europe."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank our colleague, Charles Tannock, for a very good and well-balanced report and I am glad we found consensus here in regretting the decoupling of the candidate status for Montenegro from opening the negotiations."
"As previous speakers have said, I would also like Montenegro to move forward with negotiations and I hope the delay will not be too long."
"I am happy also to hear from the Hungarian Presidency that they are strong supporters in the enlargement process."
"So I hope there will be progress this year, at the latest, following the progress report."
"Montenegro has achieved a lot in the past and in recent years, but there are still quite a few areas of concern."
"I would like to mention three: fighting corruption, discrimination and ecological issues."
"In the fight against corruption and organised crime, I am glad that in this report, we also demand from the state authorities that they refrain from pressurising NGOs and civil society organisations that investigate corruption and organised crime."
"They should be free to do their work and support the state in removing corruption and organised crime."
"The second aspect is anti-discrimination."
"There are still lots of groups where, despite good legislation, anti-discrimination is not working: Roma, Ashkaeli and Egyptians, LGBT people; we should also mention gender equality on International Women's Day."
"Finally, on ecological issues, Montenegro defines itself in its constitution as an ecological state, which is great."
"The problem is, despite the beautiful coast and mountains, if good transparent progress is not made by having environmental assessments, then this beautiful countryside is in danger of being destroyed."
"So, I hope that this country will move forward, involve civil society, and have transparent processes in its ecological areas, especially hydro-electric power plants."
"Madam President, I agree with most of the speakers so far that Montenegro has made considerable progress towards EU integration despite a poor starting position."
"In common with the other former Yugoslav republics, it has had to cope with the collapse of Communism, coming together with the collapse of the state, the war that followed, and then having to build a new system on the ruins of the old."
"This is no easy task and some of the negative features of the previous system have lived on in new guises."
"What is important, however, is the emergence of a younger élite that has committed itself to a European future, in which it was certainly helped by the unsuccessful union with Serbia."
"Problems remain, of course."
"We have heard about some of these, the usual ones that former Communist states have had to cope with: corruption, criminality, abuses in the administration of justice, a not particularly efficient public service, and the like."
"The remedying of these and parallel flaws in the political, economic, legal and administrative systems will require a major effort on the part of the leadership, and it should be prepared for both active and passive resistance from the beneficiaries of the existing system."
"Every former Communist country has had to face analogous difficulties."
"The determination of both élites and public opinion to offer a European future is probably the single most important factor ensuring Montenegro's eventual accession to the EU."
"(SK) Madam President, progress in the European integration process is one of the fundamental factors contributing to the further development of Montenegro."
"From an economic perspective, the country has achieved a certain level of macro-economic stability, and has also advanced successfully in the sense of fulfilling the political criteria set out at the Copenhagen Summit, or the Copenhagen sitting of the Council."
"However, we must bring more pressure to bear, especially in the area of strengthening the rule of law - including reforms to the judiciary - and it is also essential to continue the ongoing effort in the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"It is also desirable to see progress in the reform of the public administration and electoral reform, and a stronger role for parliament"
"Emphasis must be placed on the implementation of freedom of expression and media freedom."
"It would also be appropriate to cooperate with civil society, and to try and address discrimination and the social and economic integration of minority groups in the population, including the Roma."
"Regional cooperation and correct neighbourly relations are undoubtedly one of the other preconditions for a successful Euro-integration process."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Montenegro has made a considerable effort in the attempt to fulfil the criteria set out for successful integration into the European Union, and it is therefore time to consider granting candidate country status."
"I believe that this will be achieved."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Tannock, for the excellent report and very good preparation of the relevant resolution."
"Montenegro has made good progress in the integration process."
"The country also plays a constructive role in maintaining regional stability."
"It is on the right track, which was confirmed last year by the Commission and the Council granting Montenegro candidate country status."
"I hope that it will ensure that the remaining criteria for opening accession negotiations are fulfilled soon to enable those negotiations to be started."
"Until that happens, Montenegro's government needs to focus on progress in key areas, which have been clearly indicated."
"Let me summarise them as follows: the rule of law, the fight against corruption and organised crime, election legislation, strengthening Parliament's supervisory role vis-à-vis the government and broader involvement of civil society in interaction with the government, the reform of justice, with continual strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and prosecution, and tackling corruption, which undermines state institutions, economic and social development and the functioning of the public administration."
"Finally, I am glad to see that Montenegro is continuously proceeding further in the integration process."
"That is why I hope that the Council will decide to open negotiations with the country really soon."
"(SL) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner Füle, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Charles Tannock, on the achievement represented by the resolution on Montenegro, on which we will be voting tomorrow."
"Montenegro is a major hope for the process of European Union enlargement across the Western Balkans."
"Montenegro is a state and society without any objective problems which might prevent it from doing what is necessary to attain membership of the European Union."
"However, its neighbours, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia, have not been so fortunate."
"The European Commission's seven key priorities are clear and I would suggest that Prime Minister Igor Lukšić's government addresses them in a determined fashion and in this way opens negotiations on Montenegro's full membership."
"In doing so, the government should rely on Montenegro's civil society, free-thinking intellectuals and non-governmental organisations."
"The critics are not Montenegro's enemies, the independent media are not enemies, but a valuable asset for Montenegro."
"Obviously, combating corruption and organised crime remains key."
"In the words of a Montenegrin folk song: 'Montenegro may be small, but it is honourable and fair'."
"(RO) Madam President, stability in the Western Balkans region will be strengthened even further with Montenegro's recommendation as a candidate country by the European Commission."
"At the same time, I wish to mention how important it is to comply exactly with the Copenhagen criteria, which are key to the progress of EU integration."
"Although a great deal of progress has been made, the Montenegrin authorities still have reforms to implement in key sectors."
"For example, I feel obliged to mention the report from the Commission on the spread of corruption and illegal tax transactions."
"With this in mind, the most important measure is to create a specialist structure for combating these problems."
"On the other hand, the rights of minorities, and I am referring here, in particular, to those of the Roma, still do not have the necessary legislative basis."
"The reference to the status of minorities in the fundamental law, together with their rights, will be a positive sign for European integration."
"I welcome the promotion of Montenegro as a state championing the green movement."
"One of the EU's key objectives is environmental protection."
"On this point, I want to draw attention to the adverse impact which excessive, poorly managed tourism has."
"One consequence could be to extend the future accession negotiations."
"Finally, I wish to mention that Montenegro's prospect of EU integration is helping Europe come to terms with its past in the Balkans region as a whole."
"(HU) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, I am pleased that the Hungarian Presidency considers enlargement in the Western Balkans region one of its priority tasks, and I trust that this will substantially contribute to Montenegro advancing from the stage of candidate country to finally commencing accession negotiations."
"My fellow Members have already mentioned how important the fight against corruption is in the accession of a Western Balkans country, but there are two other key areas."
"One is the quality of its neighbourhood relations."
"In this respect, Montenegro has performed very well by signing agreements with Croatia and Serbia."
"The other is minority issues."
"Montenegro has an exemplary minorities act, which, in many respects, builds upon the experience gained from the local minority government model of my home country, Hungary."
"However, I note with regret that at the moment, the electoral law fell through for the very reason of minority representation remaining unresolved."
"I hope that our Montenegrin friends will solve this problem as well."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating Montenegro on achieving the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union in December 2010."
"The political dialogue between this country and the EU institutions is at a very advanced stage, despite the fact that it has not been going on for long."
"Evidence of Montenegro's high level of commitment and strong political will to make changes can be seen in the way that it has implemented reforms under the Bologna process, for example, or in the improvements it has made to the functioning of the labour market."
"As emerges from the Commission communication on Montenegro's application, however, continuing high levels of unemployment point to a discrepancy between the skills which are available and those which are required, thus revealing the education system's weak points."
"Montenegro should therefore make every effort to ensure that all social groups, including those at risk of social exclusion, have the opportunity to receive high quality general education and training, in order to equip its citizens with skills which increase their chances of employment."
"(PL) Madam President, this debate has shown that Montenegro is increasingly well-prepared for accession to the European Union's structures."
"It goes without saying that this is important for Montenegro itself, but I should like to draw your attention to the fact that there are also two other dimensions to this process."
"The first is a European dimension, demonstrating that the principles and values governing the European Union's actions are still attractive to the rest of Europe."
"The second dimension relates to the Balkans, since this process shows the other Balkan states what path they can, and indeed should, follow."
"It is a difficult path, but one which is not impossible."
"I have one very quick question: would Commissioner Füle mind giving us a timetable for Montenegro's future accession to the European Union?"
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, as a citizen of Romania with a strong belief in the benefits of a prosperous multi-ethnic society based on peaceful coexistence and reconciliation between nations, I welcome Montenegro's efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, as regards the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, and to correspond to European and international standards."
"Montenegro is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitutional and legislative framework for the rule of law, human rights and the respect for and protection of minorities."
"However, there are serious gaps in the implementation of legislation."
"Corruption remains prevalent, organised crime continues to be a serious problem and there are concerns over the efficiency of the judiciary."
"I encourage Montenegro to continue its constructive engagement in regional cooperation and in strengthening bilateral relations with neighbouring countries."
"(SK) Madam President, last week's visit by Commissioner Füle shows that the commitment of the Montenegrin Government to European integration is genuine and is the best path for a country that is moving towards the European Union."
"The social and political changes that have taken place in Montenegro in recent years are a positive sign not only for the EU, but also for the country's neighbours."
"The Montenegrin Government has also won plaudits from the UN over the broad spectrum of problems it has managed to address."
"According to the United Nations Development Programme report, Montenegro is capable of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty, universal primary education and a reduction in infant mortality, by 2015."
"Montenegrin premier, Igor Lukšič, stated during his recent visit to Brussels that Montenegro's priorities are EU and NATO membership."
"I therefore personally consider Montenegro's efforts enormously important, and I fully support the assistance and aid which the EU is providing to the country, and I believe that this country will join the EU in the near future."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although some excellent results have been achieved so far on the road towards European integration, there remain some gaps in fundamental areas for the development of a democratic system and full confirmation of the rule of law."
"Despite the progress made with the amendments to the legislation on criminal procedures and other primary laws, some aspects are still substantially behind schedule."
"I refer, in particular, to the urgent need to ensure the responsibility and efficiency of the judiciary, as well as its transparency, not to mention that of the public prosecutor's office, and their independence from political interference."
"To that end, substantial changes are needed to the system for appointing judges and public prosecutors, putting an end to the practice whereby their appointments only take place in parliament and within the government."
"Lastly, (...) to improve access to justice and to free legal assistance."
"(RO) Madam President, Montenegro's gaining of accession candidate country status is the upshot of the open door policy promoted by the European Union, which has had a beneficial impact not only in Eastern Europe but also in the Western Balkans, as in this case."
"Montenegro is at the start of a journey which will neither be easy nor simple, but it has a prospect of accession and a road map, and it can benefit from the experience of the countries in the region which have completed the path of accession not very long ago."
"It is important that the next country report is positive and allows accession negotiations to actually begin."
"I believe that the European Union has successfully made a crucial contribution to the process of reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia."
"Once all the states formed from the disintegration of the Yugoslav Federation have been admitted to the European Union, this will also close the final wounds of a violent past, which is still an issue for the entire European community."
"I wish the Montenegrin nation every success in its efforts to modernise its country in order to meet the accession conditions."
"(DE) Madam President, the expectation was that visa liberalisation for Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia would encourage tourists and businesspeople to make greater use of this opportunity."
"Instead, we have seen an increase in economic migrants."
"In this context, information campaigns in these countries are undoubtedly important, so that we can make it clear that a visitor's visa is not the equivalent of asylum or a job in the EU."
"The fact that the EU had to exert pressure to close the so-called travel agencies which specialised in emigration to the EU demonstrates the lack of awareness of the problem."
"We will have to wait and see how effective the planned early warning system for mass movements relating to the Roma problem will be."
"Many people seem to believe that their future does not lie in their home countries in the Balkans, such as Montenegro, but want to make use of their newly acquired freedom of travel to enter the EU illegally."
"However, they do not have the right to access Europe's social security systems."
"It is important for Montenegro to make greater efforts to introduce EU standards in areas such as justice, combating corruption and protecting minorities, in order to establish a European perspective."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, our discussion has proved productive in reconfirming the next steps necessary for Montenegro to achieve further progress on its European Union path."
"As acknowledged in the draft resolution we discussed today and in the Commission opinion of last November, Montenegro has achieved a lot but needs to deliver substantially more."
"The country has now entered a decisive stage."
"Tangible results are needed in order for Montenegro to be able to move to the next stage of European integration."
"The momentum created by candidate status should not be lost; reforms should be pursued with determination."
"The objectives are well known: it is up to Montenegro to meet the required priorities and, once ready, to engage in the negotiation process."
"The pace of Montenegro's progress towards European Union membership depends on its own achievements, and that should explain my hesitation in prejudging an enlargement calendar as many of you have invited me to do. But I am positive that with our support, but mainly with the determination of its people, Montenegro can make real progress towards the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you for this extremely fruitful discussion."
"It is encouraging to see that the European Parliament continues to support with all its heart Montenegro's European integration efforts."
"I would like to reassure you that the concerns and tasks you mentioned during this debate are on the agenda of the ongoing dialogue between the EU institutions on the European perspective of Montenegro, and we are making every effort to address them properly."
"There have been multiple mentions and questions as to what happens in the time between the granting of candidate status and the commencement of the accession negotiations, that is, why we are not beginning the negotiations immediately, without delay."
"Perhaps you, too, are aware, and both the Commissioner and I have mentioned it, that now that Montenegro has obtained the status of candidate country, the Commission has set out conditions it must fulfil."
"There are seven such conditions, including the rule of law, taking action against organised crime, the fight against corruption, etc., and the Commission will evaluate the progress made in these areas, which will then be tabled before the Council in autumn, after which we will be able to decide whether we have reached a stage where we can launch the negotiations."
"Once again, thank you for this debate and I believe that this, too, proves that the European Parliament is ready to send out a positive signal to the Western Balkans region."
"A signal which proves that the enlargement process is under way, that it still exists, and that it needs to be credible."
"This means that the progress made with each country in the region is based on a personalised approach and is performance-related."
"In the case of Montenegro, this refers to what has been said here; in the case of Serbia, it means that the answers to the questionnaire received have been prepared and will now be evaluated by the Commission; and in the case of Croatia, it means that the country must finish its homework and prepare in every possible way to ensure that the negotiations can be concluded during the term of the Hungarian Presidency."
"This way, the process remains credible and we can ensure that our immediate neighbours, these true European countries, remain on the right track, and that they will ultimately be able to join the EU once they have reached the appropriate stage of preparedness."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 9 March 2011."
"EU strategy on Roma inclusion (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Járóka, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the European Parliament and also in all the civil organisations for their support and valuable input in drafting this heavy report."
"If you will allow me a personal comment, this is the place and time where I have to thank my colleagues in the office, my political advisor in the LIBE Committee who has been behind this strategy for years, and my head of cabinet in the last few years who has fought with me."
"I also owe gratitude to my family who allowed me to be in the forefront of this fight, a fight which has, in the end, produced a result."
"We have an agreement spanning six political groups, 27 Member States and five very important parliamentary committees."
"In this way, I believe we are able to send a message to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that must be reckoned with and we have therefore made a great step towards an EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of our continent's largest ethnic minority."
"A significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions - almost totally disconnected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights - that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratification but must be handled as bridging one of the most enormous gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe."
"The EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of European Roma must therefore place its primary emphasis on the fulfilment and promotion of the fundamental rights to employment, housing, healthcare and education."
"Let me briefly outline the most important principles and recommendations of my report."
"Above all, the strategy must be an internal EU strategy, the general oversight of priority areas and objectives must therefore be within the Community structures and it should in no way be divisive for the EU, creating splits among the Member States."
"On the contrary; establishing a new body to coordinate and supervise the strategy would be unnecessary and would create a wasteful overhead."
"The role of supervising, coordinating and monitoring must therefore be fulfilled by the Commission and, to this end, it would be worth considering retaining the Roma task force as a permanent body."
"The Commission should report annually on the progress of the strategy, evaluate the results and submit its upgrading proposals to the Council."
"In this regard, the European Roma strategy scoreboard, a mechanism similar to the single market scoreboard, could be developed."
"The appointment of an administrative body or a government official to be the national contact point for the implementation of the strategy's objectives, and furthermore to act as a source of advice and reflection for the Commission supervisory strategy, would also bring significant practical benefits."
"The strategy must also take into account the territoriality of exclusion since the geographic distribution of social disadvantages is not uniform throughout the Member States, but poverty and social exclusion are concentrated in underdeveloped micro-regions, which, in many of the new Member States, are predominantly inhabited by the Roma community."
"Common, comparable and reliable indicators are essential to present a realistic analysis of progress and to meet the requirements of effective monitoring."
"I recommend adopting the Laeken indicators and their complementary components to measure social and territorial exclusion, as well as to evaluate progress."
"An all-European crisis map is necessary to measure and identify the micro-regions by their distinctive attributes."
"Part of the cohesion budget should be set aside in the next multiannual financial framework in a performance reserve for the strategy."
"This could provide vital resources and devise incentives for implementation by allocating funds on a competitive basis defined by the criterion of how the proposed project or intervention supports and implements the objectives of the strategy."
"This way, on the one hand, we could depart from the general practice of large contributions maximising their returns from the unabsorbed funds and, on the other hand, a direct link could be created between the allocation of financing and the reproduction of results."
"These are the principles and the priorities that I believe the European Roma strategy must sustain and I am looking forward to your comments on my report."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency attaches great importance to the issue of Roma integration and is grateful for the active support of the European Parliament in this matter."
"Let us not forget what is at stake here."
"We are talking about the life chances of millions of our fellow European citizens who have the right to the same opportunities as everyone else, and our societies cannot afford to ignore the potential that lies in them."
"Therefore, please allow me to congratulate you on the excellent draft resolution you are about to adopt, and which I strongly support."
"We share your ambition to ensure that promises are followed by deeds."
"On 8 April, the International Day of the Roma is celebrated worldwide."
"On that day, the Hungarian Presidency will be organising the fifth meeting of the Integrated European Platform for Roma Inclusion in Budapest, which I am sure many of you will also be attending."
"As a central feature of this event, the Commission will present its strategic communication on the subject, and we ask Mrs Járóka to present the main points of the resolution there."
"After that, the Hungarian Presidency will draw up draft Council conclusions, which we hope the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will adopt at its meeting on 19 May."
"These conclusions will exclusively deal with the issue of Roma integration, and we will endeavour to strengthen cooperation between the EU and its Member States in respect of the economic and social integration of the Roma."
"Additionally, we are planning to organise exchanges of views on the Commission's ideas in other Council formations as well, and at the end of May, the General Affairs Council will hold a policy debate in preparation for the June meeting of the European Council."
"In order for us to be able to make progress, we must set aside all stereotypes, generalisations and prejudices."
"We must be aware that the living conditions of the Roma are far from being homogenous everywhere."
"Moreover, we must keep in mind the historic reasons for their social exclusion."
"The benefits of the political changeover and the transition to a market economy that took place in Central and Eastern Europe are not enjoyed to an equal degree by all citizens."
"A large number of Roma drifted to the periphery of society in this very period of the past 20 years."
"Today, it is particularly important that we firmly condemn acts of aggression inspired by racist motivations, whoever the perpetrator is."
"In a difficult economic situation, the vulnerable become even more so, and often seek the reasons for their misery in each other."
"However, we possess shared values and means to defend them, as it has been more than ten years now since the Council adopted its directives prohibiting racial discrimination."
"I particularly welcome the fact that special emphasis has been placed on the elimination of segregation."
"Segregation forms a vicious circle and creates fault lines within societies."
"I am also very pleased that the resolution covers gender equality as well."
"Let me remind you of an earlier resolution Parliament adopted in 2006, which deals with the situation of Roma women."
"All women must be allowed to put their abilities to good use."
"We need more Roma women in decision making as well."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur for this subject, Mrs Lívia Járóka, can inspire us all in this regard as well - particularly the women, but also the men."
"I would once again like to thank Mrs Járóka and all of you for participating in this vital process, and I would like to remind you once more that the Hungarian Presidency is determined to achieve substantial results in this area."
"I ask all of you to assist with this effort."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the European Union, as you know, is built on rights and values and these include the protection of minorities, the principle of free movement and the prohibition of discrimination - all these apply fully to the Roma."
"The social and economic integration of Roma is, I think, a moral obligation, but also, as Parliament's report rightly pointed out, an economic interest of our European societies."
"It is a priority for the EU and it needs commitment and the joint efforts of national and local authorities, civil society and the EU institutions."
"I would like to congratulate Ms Lívia Járóka on the wonderful work she has been doing."
"She has been doing it by trying to integrate the whole House and getting a paper proposal which represents the meaningful input of parliamentarians from all political parties, and I think that is a real achievement."
"This will help us, Ms Járóka, to keep Roma inclusion high on the political agenda."
"It will help us to take the necessary steps to improve the situation of the Roma people and their social and economic integration into society."
"Permit me to update you on where we stand."
"As you might remember, on 7 April 2010, the Commission adopted a communication on the social and economic integration of Roma in Europe, which was the first ever policy document dedicated specifically to Roma."
"The communication contained a concrete list of actions to help Member States make their policies for Roma integration more effective and to define the main challenges ahead: discrimination, poverty, low educational achievement, labour market barriers, housing, segregation, and so on."
"This situation is neither acceptable nor sustainable and therefore, the Commission is working on an EU framework for national Roma integration strategies which it will present in early April."
"This House has called for an EU strategy and the Commission is responding to this request."
"We all agree, I think, that we need effective policy planning and implementation, that we need a strategic approach."
"We also agree, I think, that the primary responsibility for Roma populations lies with the Member States in which these Roma populations are moving, and it is for that reason that the Commission is drawing up this EU framework combined with national Roma integration strategies, because we need both: we need to know where we are all going together and we need to know where each individual Member State will go in order to adapt specific policies to the problems of the Roma in that Member State."
"The EU framework to be presented in April will build on your resolution, Ms Járóka, on the work of the Commission's Roma Task Force and, of course, on the wide range of contributions received from Member States and from civil society."
"There is a need for concrete actions, for clear commitments, to make better use of the range of legal and financial instruments available in order to achieve a breakthrough."
"I will not speak for long on this, because my colleague, Mr Andor, is responsible for this dossier, but the Europe 2020 strategy leads to a new path for persistent economic and social actions for those who are marginalised and we know that poverty is a very big problem in Europe's largest minority."
"Here, determined action is needed both at national and EU level."
"The Commission also considers that it is very important to learn from the lessons of the past and to make sure that the efforts of all stakeholders, at all levels from the EU down to the local level, are very well coordinated."
"For this coordination work, we do have the European platform for Roma inclusion, which is a unique mechanism for involving the stakeholders."
"I think it would be important to reinforce the role of this platform in the future."
"I also heard with great interest Parliament's proposal to have a national contact point and we will consider this when we prepare the EU framework."
"I would also like to assure you that in drawing up the framework, the Commission will pay special attention to the need to monitor developments and follow the process and the progress on the ground, and here I appeal to Parliament."
"This must not be a case of a very good report by Parliament and then an interesting framework from the European Union; this must be a work in progress and a measured work in progress, a monitored work in progress, so that we can see where we are going in future and, in this regard, we will continue to work closely with the Member States and with this Parliament, as well as with all the stakeholders."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would also like to thank the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for its excellent work on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion and to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Lívia Járóka, on the impressive support that this report has received from the House."
"The report is both helpful and encouraging."
"It is helpful because it contributes to the ongoing debate on how to further the integration of Roma people into the economy and society."
"It is encouraging because it shows that the Commission and Parliament have moved in the same direction and that our views on the way forward largely coincide."
"Firstly, the Commission agrees that the Roma issue is one of the most important strategic challenges that Europe faces and, at the same time, it provides one of the most promising opportunities for the continent."
"When we speak of opportunities, we also mean economic opportunities."
"There is indeed a social and economic necessity coupled here with a moral imperative."
"Secondly, Parliament's report makes a convincing case for the need to adopt a holistic approach to tackling the socio-economic situation of the Roma."
"It suggests focusing on a number of priority areas, such as education, employment, housing and healthcare."
"These are indeed areas of critical importance for the successful integration of the Roma people."
"Thirdly, I welcome the focus in the report on the importance of using EU funds in the most appropriate way."
"It is essential to underpin policies with sufficient financial resources."
"Although we have made progress in this area, more needs to be done."
"Fourthly, I agree with Parliament that we need to put in place a strong mechanism to monitor national strategies for Roma integration."
"Lastly, I have taken good note that the report advocates focusing on the territorial dimension of poverty and, in particular, in underdeveloped micro-regions."
"The Commission will carefully look into this interesting proposal."
"It is clear that a number of Member States will not be able to make sufficient progress towards the Europe 2020 targets unless they take concrete steps to improve Roma integration."
"It is, therefore, high time for determined action at both national and EU level."
"Although Member States are primarily responsible for designing and implementing Roma integration strategies, the EU can indeed support them."
"We need to ensure that efforts at all levels are part of a coherent and consistent policy framework."
"I am confident that the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies - which, as the Vice-President has already said, the Commission will present in April - will provide the opportunity for the EU institutions and all stakeholders to join forces and make a tangible difference to the lives of Roma people in Europe."
"Madam President, please allow me to begin by recounting a story."
"In 2009, József B and his wife were sentenced by a Hungarian court to 10 months' imprisonment for the endangerment of minors."
"Their crime was that their two children did not attend school."
"While they had gone to school, however, the children had been sent home regularly because they turned up in muddy shoes and covered with dirt."
"In the Gipsy colony where they live, there are no paved roads, and so every day, the children had to cross a meadow and by the time they got to the school, their feet were covered in mud."
"They endured the humiliation of being scolded and sent home for as long as they could, and eventually chose to avoid school more and more often, for which their parents were sentenced to prison."
"The children of József B and his wife did not miss school because they did not want to learn."
"Rather, it was their circumstances that did not allow them to learn."
"Without appropriate clothing and shoes, water and electricity at home, and without school supplies, they did not have a chance to finish even primary school."
"Helping communities with multiple disadvantages to catch up is a complex process, which can only be achieved step by step, in keeping with local needs and over the long term."
"Europe can assist in this by setting goals based on real data, providing the necessary tools, calling the Member States to account for the accomplishment of the goals set, and monitoring the changes in the situation of the Roma."
"It is also designing less bureaucratic, quicker and more transparent methods than before, thereby supporting individual communities in the long run until they can truly provide for their own needs."
"It is not enough to build a school for the children of József B. They also need work to make a living, and the parents need to be able to feed and clothe their children and have them educated."
"Suitable housing conditions are required, where children can prepare for class, and where they have lighting and heating."
"Passable roads are required, which provide access to school and the workplace."
"And there is also a need for compassionate words, which can efface the humiliations."
"The European Roma strategy will not bring about immediate change, but will give an opportunity for change."
"The real question is whether we can create rules and conditions which can help those who are unable to compete for resources and who barely have the capacity to assert their own interests."
"Non-discrimination must be guaranteed, and not only in the labour market but in all areas of social life as well."
"Segregation in towns and schools must be eliminated, real opportunities must be created and Roma communities must be involved at European, Member State and local levels."
"And, above all, political commitment is required from everyone who can contribute to the improvement of the current situation at European level as well."
"It is not enough to provide a framework for Member States' Roma strategies; a proper European Roma strategy is needed, with European level responsibility, while, of course, not calling into question the responsibility of the Member States."
"I call on the Commission and the Council to fully incorporate the contents of the Parliamentary resolution into their documents and to regularly report on any progress to Parliament."
"Madam President, I congratulate Mrs Járóka on her excellent cooperation."
"The integration of the roughly 12 million Roma in the European Union cannot be achieved without the desire to do so from both the Roma and the majority in the relevant Member State."
"Responsibility for the Roma population's integration lies with both Member States and the European Union."
"European resources must be used to improve the engineering infrastructure, build new homes or repair existing ones, provide better education and improve access to the labour market."
"There is no general solution which can be applied in the same way everywhere."
"Different approaches may be required even within one Member State, in its different regions."
"I believe that the beneficiaries of European funds should be involved in building their own home or environment so that they feel a sense of commitment to the solidarity which has been shown to them and they then obviously become good householders."
"The political establishment and business community must rediscover the Roma and ensure better access for them to the labour market so that they can contribute to the European Union's economic development and prosperity."
"I truly hope that this report will be properly implemented and will help improve the Roma's social and economic integration on our continent."
"Madam President, it is quite difficult to get everything prepared in just one minute, but here are a few ideas from the Committee on Culture and Education's point of view regarding this Roma issue, in connection with which Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job."
"When I myself was rapporteur for this Committee, we agreed very strongly there and then that this was a matter of human rights."
"We have 10 to 12 million Roma in the EU, of which they are full members."
"They must also have full rights: human rights in the proper sense of the word."
"That also means that they can participate in the decision making of societies and in the European decisionmaking process."
"When we look to the future, we know that education is the key issue."
"Education is also the right way to integrate the Roma minority into society and encourage them to be active."
"Things need to be improved rapidly, with regard, for example, to housing and infrastructure."
"Above all, it is most important to emphasise the need for a change in attitudes among us other Europeans."
"Segregation and discrimination need to be eliminated."
"We have to create proper opportunities and understand that every child and young Roma person is a unique individual, a unique citizen of the European Union, just like all the rest of us."
"Madam President, today, we are discussing a European strategy for the Roma minority, which is an important step towards integrating the largest minority in the European Union."
"The European Union must face up to the reality of the Roma problem, one which is dictated by the Roma's economic situation in general, but especially by aspects of their own tradition: nomadic lifestyle and low education level and, by extension, a lack of professional qualifications."
"Education represents an opportunity to gain a qualification, a profession and a job, which is an absolutely essential step towards Roma social integration."
"Responsibility for integration does not lie entirely with the authorities."
"The Roma community needs to understand that it has to make the necessary efforts and that it has to really want to become integrated into society, regardless of country of origin or residence."
"The priority areas covered by the strategy must include increasing the level of civic education, adapting the Roma population's culture and traditions to modern society and promoting vocational training and retraining."
"I think that these areas, in addition to education, must be key objectives."
"The Member States of origin must make the biggest contribution to the integration process, but an EU approach also has an extremely important role to play."
"The future strategy devised by the Commission must propose framework programmes adapted to the nomadic lifestyle of some of the Roma community, which will be developed and implemented in a similar manner in all Member States."
"Madam President, my group has visited several Roma communities in Europe and seen the horrendous conditions there."
"It is hard to imagine the way in which these people live in some European capitals."
"This is a vicious circle from which it is very difficult for them to escape."
"I am grateful to both Commissioners for mentioning the issue of poverty."
"I believe that the struggle on behalf of the Roma is, above all, a struggle against poverty and not only amongst the Roma."
"We must make sure that we do not create a new divide, where the poor people outside the Roma communities are critical of the fact that the Roma are suddenly receiving large amounts of money or a great deal of attention."
"We need to make sure that this is a joint struggle which, of course, also aims to combat all forms of discrimination."
"The efforts made on a local level are also important."
"Very often, it is the case that a lot is done by communities or regions, but unfortunately, not always with the support of the national government."
"We need to find a way to introduce European funding at a local level."
"Therefore, we have drawn up an alternative resolution, which I will be speaking about shortly."
"This resolution has been introduced mainly at the suggestion of Mr Enciu, who will also be explaining his position on this subject, in order to highlight the problem."
"I hope that the Commission can come up with a good Roma strategy."
"As both Commissioners have rightly said, this is all about a process for monitoring the situation and providing support."
"In their words, it is work in progress."
"We need to find out what really happens to the funding, because for too long, we have sat by and watched while very little has been done."
"I do not want to say that nothing has happened, but it has certainly been far too little and the funds have not been put to the best possible use."
"We wish the Hungarian Presidency every success."
"We will give you our full support on this issue, so that we can produce a new strategy and so that you can say that this is one of the successful achievements of your Presidency."
"You have our support."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Járóka for her excellent report."
"Because we want to support her report, we will be withdrawing our alternative resolution."
"We simply wanted to highlight the problem relating to local authorities and communities."
"However, we also want to support Mrs Járóka's report as a clear statement from the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, we have finally come to the moment when we will have to vote on this report."
"In my view, this is not necessarily a moment of celebration: I prefer to see it as a moment when we have to be wise and to look at what we have achieved so far and what we want to achieve in the future."
"However, because I am aware of the huge amount of work that has been put into this report, please allow me to congratulate and thank not only the rapporteur and the other Members involved, but also the staff of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and our policy advisers."
"When we first began discussing this issue, we were all hoping that the Union was actually moving towards an EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"Instead, we will have a framework, and then the Member States will decide whether or not to draw up their own strategies."
"I am afraid, given past experience - and please allow me to be pessimistic here - that this may be a process that is very much money driven, funding driven."
"In my view, people in the developed countries 'discovered' the Roma not necessarily because they recognised the bad conditions in which Roma were living in their countries of origin, but because they were bothered by the presence of Roma in the streets and on the margins of cities."
"This is about more than funding."
"It is very much about the basic human rights of this population group."
"The Commissioner spoke of work in progress."
"I hope that we shall see not only work but also some real progress."
"Madam President, unfortunately, every day in the press, we read accounts of discriminative or racist acts against the Roma."
"Therefore, this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves, of course, and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union's fundamental values."
"The Commission will therefore have to develop a framework, a European strategy, for the national action plans."
"Its responsibility will extend far beyond the development of this European framework for the national action plans, because the Member States will make progress on this subject only if they are given a strong incentive by the Commission to commit themselves to it."
"This will require - as the report explains very well - an extremely precise evaluation of the results obtained, with the use of benchmark criteria and indicators."
"It will also require the involvement of all interested parties and Roma communities in the first instance."
"I believe that it is very important to make the connection with the Council of Europe's programme on the training of Roma mediators."
"This is an essential condition if the inclusion projects are to be crowned with success at regional level."
"Next, the European Commission also needs to get involved through its own projects, run by itself, pilot projects - that is what this report proposes - which could be run, for example, in the micro-regions that we have spoken about, so that exemplary, remarkable projects can convince all interested parties to become involved in this inclusion process."
"I believe, then, that the European Commission should also be able to use its right to officially complain when the values, European legislation and national action plans are not as they should be, bearing in mind equal access to all rights, non-discrimination and freedom of movement."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to get right to the heart of the matter, this is all about introducing a uniform, mandatory EU strategy, instead of the 27 individual, differing strategies in the Member States."
"Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens."
"What is it all about?"
"It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone."
"It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe."
"It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services."
"We are not doing these people a favour."
"We are granting them their legal rights."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti."
"We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding."
"There is, though, one thing I would like to add."
"None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe."
"We must see this as one of Europe's central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination."
"We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole."
"We must speak with one voice."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the report where it says that the Commission should dictate policy on the Roma to the Member States."
"This approach does not obey the principle of subsidiarity, if it is true - as indeed it is - that these measures must be conceived and carried out at local, regional and national levels, since their impact is then on the regions and their native populations."
"I completely agree with inclusion, not discrimination, but I am still waiting to hear from Commissioner Reding when Roma camps will finally be allowed in her country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for if I am not mistaken, they are not allowed there."
"This report seems to be a little unbalanced, because so many paragraphs call for support for the Roma, be they men, women, children, the elderly (...). None of them call for any measures to severely punish those Roma who show anti-social behaviour, for example."
"Who stops Roma children going to school, if it is not certain Roma parents?"
"I believe these are topics that we need to have the courage to spell out clearly, defying political correctness."
"It is not the syrup of do-goodism but serious, surgical measures that will enable us to lance the boil of rackets, child exploitation and organ trafficking."
"Madam President, the word on everybody's lips, whatever the subject being discussed, is Roma."
"I blame that Mr Sarkozy for pretending to expel them."
"I took it for granted that they would feature in the debate on the financial transactions tax."
"Every time a Roma horse dealer tried to charge an extra couple of euro a leg, out would jump a bowler-hatted tax-gatherer and sinner and demand one of the poor animal's limbs as tribute to President Barroso."
"When the time for the debate on the EU strategy on the Atlantic arrived, I fully expected it to be proposed that a stretch of that ocean should be reserved for the water-borne branch of that noble tribe."
"They might sell fish hooks to passing boats and promise to cover hulls with a quantity of tarmacadam that they just had left over."
"I think we should find a particular member of the Roma, preferably with disabilities and conflicting sexualities."
"We could then make this person president of the Commission."
"He would start by selling this place off and nobody would dare to complain."
"(HU) Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mrs Járóka."
"Her many years of work have reached an important milestone today."
"After a long struggle, it has now become clear that the issue of the Roma is a European issue, and this holds true even if - as my fellow Member, Mr Borghezio pointed out - we must look for the solutions at Member State level."
"However, a single European area indeed requires a single strategy, too."
"We cannot approach the Roma strategy solely from a cultural perspective."
"This is not just a minority issue."
"Similarly, it cannot be solved solely by means of social policy."
"It is therefore important for the strategy to include comprehensive and targeted measures, and formulate focused objectives."
"Of the key areas of the strategy, education and access to education must be highlighted."
"The reason for this is that education is a fundamental aspect of employability."
"In several Member States, there is a large number of Roma groups caught in the trap of poverty, and there will never be a sufficient number of jobs for them, because without qualifications, they are essentially unemployable."
"The training of Roma girls merits special attention, because it would appear that they tend to become early school leavers more often, and also because girls are exploited to a much greater extent in work at home."
"(SK) Madam President, we are dealing with another highly sensitive topic and, in my opinion, the European Parliament must resolve it, the Commission must resolve it and the Council must resolve it, because Roma inclusion is now no longer possible at the EU Member State level alone."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats has been involved with this issue for a very long time."
"In the past eight months alone, our working group has visited almost all of the Member States where the Roma situation is often very complicated indeed."
"We were able to visit not only settlements where Roma live in extremely poor conditions, but also to see some good examples."
"This includes examples where there has been very good cooperation at the local authority level with the Roma living in these settlements, and we also saw good examples where local politicians had made a real effort to resolve the situation to the benefit of the Roma."
"Our problem is that we also encounter enormous levels of prejudice in our societies - and I mean now in those Member States where the problems with Roma are perhaps worse than in other Member States."
"These are the prejudices of the majority section of the population, and I therefore believe that any action plan that you submit to us, Commissioner, will have to include a way to tackle this huge level of prejudice on the part of the majority population, to explain to the majority section of society that help for the Roma and the inclusion of the Roma in society benefits not only the Roma but the whole of society, and therefore the majority as well."
"Madam President, I very much welcome the Járóka report because it gives us an opportunity to mention some specific points."
"The Roma inclusion strategy must be guided by an insider approach that is designed by Roma for Roma, which means empowerment of Roma, inclusion in the decision-making process, hiring of Roma staff and mediators in key positions at local, national and EU level."
"Unlawful practices which continue with impunity in EU Member States have to stop: violence against Roma, violations of their right to free movement, increasing activities of extremist political parties and politicians, systematic segregation of Romany children in education, widespread residential segregation of Roma, trafficking in human beings, denial of access to healthcare and social services, coercive sterilisation of Romany women."
"Many reasons thus justify this report and many more reasons justify this strategy, so I welcome very much the report, the strategy and, as you say, Commissioner, let us keep up the work."
"(DE) Madam President, while mainstream society in the EU is ageing quickly, the Roma population is growing rapidly in size."
"In Hungary, where the Roma currently make up around 6% to 8% of the population, they will exceed 50% of the working population by 2050."
"Of course, this makes it all the worse that the life of the Roma in the EU is characterised, as it always has been, by unemployment, a level of education that is well below average, organised crime and prostitution, as well as a retreat into a parallel society."
"This report addresses a few of the problems, but in a one-sided way."
"Integration is not a one-way street."
"The Roma must make a contribution to all of this."
"They must send their children to school and become integrated into the labour market."
"Women in Roma communities, which have old-fashioned structures, are often in a particularly poor situation."
"Their lack of education and their exclusion from the labour market, which will only become worse unless we act now, will exacerbate even further the integration problems caused by demographic changes."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure and pride that we are discussing this strategy here this evening: pleasure because Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job, for which I thank her, and pride because it is an initiative that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have very much wanted."
"It is an excellent report because, of course, it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the Roma, and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach."
"We like it because it not only sets out rights but also highlights certain needs."
"We also dealt with it in the opinion that we gave as the Committee on Culture and Education."
"I am thinking, in particular, about the whole part relating to schooling for Roma children, in which we point out that schooling is both a right and a duty, in which the children's families must also be involved."
"I would also point out that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion."
"Alongside the promotion of Roma culture, it is also important to recognise that the Roma should make an effort to learn about the customs and culture of the peoples with whom they live, so as to facilitate real integration."
"Perhaps the only thing missing in this report is a reference to Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens."
"In this regard, we have been waiting for a long time for the Commission to give us an interpretation of how to put it into practice, and we now need to know what it is right and fair to expect the Member States to do."
"For everything else, I again thank the rapporteur for all that she has succeeded in doing."
"(RO) Madam President, I appreciate the particularly fine job done by Mrs Járóka in drafting this report, and I sincerely congratulate her on it."
"However, I want to point out that the reason for the failure of Roma integration policies hitherto has not been for the want of strategies, published plans or even funds."
"Proper integration can only be achieved through involving the Roma community, the Roma themselves, in other words, those people who, along with the local authorities, have the ability and, in particular, the desire to implement the programmes."
"Who is better aware of this community's deep-rooted problems, if not the community itself?"
"Not to mention the local administration which handles the problems on a day-to-day basis."
"Implementation of the future strategy must be based on structured dialogue and cooperation between the Roma communities, the local authorities and the non-governmental sector."
"Roma must switch from the role of spectators to the role of players involved in turning these measures intended for them into a reality."
"The time has come for us to turn words into actions."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Járóka, I very much appreciate your report."
"You have worked very hard on it and you have also taken us on a number of visits to the area in Hungary where you come from."
"Since then, the Committee on Regional Policy has been to Romania in order to witness the situation on the ground there."
"Doing that really allows you to see the state of things."
"You are given a warm welcome and people play music, but there is also another side to it: the backwardness and lack of integration."
"For those reasons, I, as rapporteur, addressed that change at the beginning of last year in the Regional Fund."
"It is now possible to allocate 4% of regional funds to housing for vulnerable groups, in this case, the Roma."
"We must admit that the funding falls short of what is necessary and that the programmes are not primarily benefiting the Roma's housing needs."
"Now, that is really crazy."
"Europe is offering opportunities but, on the other hand, no one is making use of them."
"That also applies to the Social Fund."
"We should definitely conduct that debate together."
"During the upcoming meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, the Romanian Udrea will come to discuss this with us."
"The Committee framework will offer the opportunity for greater governance when countries fail to support regions and local authorities."
"I, indeed, have a lot of expectations on that score."
"Sometimes you even have to resort to coercion, if the usual arguments do not work."
"Your pilot projects would be a very good set-up."
"(RO) Madam President, I, too, join those who appreciate the efforts and work of those who have drafted the report which we are debating today."
"At the same time, however, we must be realistic and realise how many documents we have about the Roma situation which are not always reflected in the concrete results visible on the ground."
"Officially, none of the Member States have any legislative obstacles or discriminatory policies, implicitly or explicitly, which will affect the Roma."
"However, forms of discrimination do exist and have been alluded to in this Chamber, if we refer to the values declared and adopted by the European Union."
"We must also acknowledge that there are cultural differences which sometimes seem irreconcilable."
"I believe that, more than any other policy aimed at social integration, education is the most powerful instrument for improving this community's situation."
"At the same time, we must bear in mind the particular characteristics of this ethnic group, which, on quite a few occasions, are the cause of their problems."
"For example, Romania has implemented positive discrimination mechanisms, which includes reserving special places in secondary schools and university faculties."
"However, many of these places, funded by public money, have disappointingly not been taken up."
"The report puts forward important and necessary measures."
"I hope that they will be implemented by all Member State governments."
"At the same time, cooperation is required from the Roma community, which must assume its responsibility and change its situation for the better."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioners, to start with, I wish to thank, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Járóka, and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent report, which presents Parliament's robust guidelines for building a common Roma strategy for the EU."
"The Commission should draft a strategy with reference to them, one that would supplement and support the Member States' own actions, because it is the Member States that have, and will continue to have in the future, the main responsibility for their own citizens."
"Any future strategy must be built on a comprehensive and concrete approach and cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and, in particular, Roma organisations."
"My own country, Finland, has been prepared to offer its own national Roma strategy for common use."
"It is also vitally important that the Roma should be able to participate in, and actually influence, the planning of measures aimed at improving their position."
"They must not become objects of policy managed from on high."
"Nor will any shortterm project to improve the socio-economic status of the Roma produce any structural social changes, and so the implementation of Roma policy must be closely linked to national developments in different areas of life."
"Similarly, the EU's financial systems must be closely tied to peer review processes."
"I would finally like to propose to the Commission the notion that the monitoring of Roma policy should itself have a permanent monitoring system."
"We need to develop a monitoring system for the Member States for the implementation of Roma issues, one that would have a permanent structure."
"(HU) Madam President, Secretary of State, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Andor, first of all, please allow me to congratulate Mrs Járóka on her excellent report and on all the work she has been doing here consistently for the protection of European Roma communities since 2004."
"I would like to approach today's debate from the perspective of children, because today, all children in Europe should be guaranteed access, in practice as well, to opportunities and upward mobility, whether it be children belonging to a majority community or to a minority one."
"This means that all children should be given the chance of physical and mental development, which involves daily warm meals just as much as the right to education."
"All this, which should, of course, exist today as rights of children, including Roma children, should, on the other hand, exist as obligations and responsibilities of the state and, I stress, of parents."
"Today, the percentage of children living with multiple disadvantages in extreme poverty is 19% at EU level, and a sizeable proportion of these children are Roma."
"Using the Járóka report as its basis, a EU level Roma strategy must therefore strengthen Member States' and social solidarity, for example, by means of crisis maps, and must also encourage local initiatives."
"It is, after all, in the interest of us all to prove that it is possible to change our attitude to our environment."
"I welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency treats the development of this Roma strategy as one of its foremost priorities and is in close cooperation with Mrs Járóka on this matter."
"(HU) Madam President, the issue of the social exclusion and the economic and social situation of the Roma has provided the grounds for debate since the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries."
"However, this does not mean that this phenomenon had not been well known even before that."
"I myself live in a Member State, Romania, where the otherwise diverse Roma community has lived side by side with Romanians and Hungarians for decades."
"Although these relations were never entirely free of frictions, tensions have increased over the two decades since the fall of communism."
"In the former communist countries, it was, in fact, the Roma who were the greatest losers of the transition to a market economy, because the types of activities from which these communities had traditionally been making a living disappeared or have been on the wane."
"We have a shared responsibility; all of us are responsible, but the Roma communities are responsible for their own fates as well, and so is Europe for not having acknowledged the problem until now."
"The key message of Mrs Járóka's report is that the prohibition and complete elimination of discrimination is far from being enough to solve this, I repeat, European problem."
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to commend the very honest commitment of the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioners Andor and Reding."
"Nevertheless, Mrs Reding, we need to clarify the fundamental principles for protecting the rights of national minorities in Europe."
"Firstly, the status of any national minority is not a purely national issue; it is a European issue."
"Secondly, national minorities could be integrated effectively on the basis of the mutual shared, but asymmetric, responsibility of the majority and the minority."
"The majority has more responsibility, but the minority still has some."
"National minorities should be integrated without the need for forced assimilation."
"Finally, the ban on discrimination is not sufficient."
"Only preferential treatment for positive actions can contribute to the real integration of national minorities."
"(RO) Madam President, the socio-economic integration of the Roma population poses a challenge in the majority of EU states."
"This is a diverse population, which is large in number, but which needs to be treated as a whole."
"The fate of this community has become an electoral campaign issue on quite a few occasions."
"To be able to make a proper contribution to the welfare of Roma citizens, the main priority is to use and work properly with resources from the Structural Funds."
"Building new houses and renovating existing ones, improving access to utilities, as well as education, healthcare and jobs, are viable solutions for enabling us to achieve our objective."
"At the same time, we must utilise the particular qualities of the Roma population, their customs, culture and traditional handicrafts."
"By designating a European Year of Roma Integration, we would help raise awareness about this community's problems."
"Grassroots and performance sport is also a definite way to integrate the Roma population."
"Madam President, with about 1.5 million members of this minority, Romania is home to the largest Roma community in Europe."
"The social integration of Roma lags behind, being considered Utopian by many, both in the administration and in the community."
"Actually, the Romanian Government deals fully with the integration of this minority."
"Therefore, we need a European strategy to frame the national efforts aimed at providing socio-economic inclusion for the Roma, education, training opportunities and job assistance, especially for women."
"It is crucial to support efforts to help equip them for continued employment in order to avoid social exclusion and poverty."
"I strongly support the idea that the Commission should present annually a follow-up of EU strategy on Roma inclusion."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Járóka and also Mrs Kinga Göncz, and I welcome the commitment of the Council and the Commission."
"(RO) Madam President, the fact that we are discussing today the drafting of a European strategy for Roma citizens is recognition at last that this problem comes under an EU and not only a national remit."
"With a view to ensuring better implementation of this strategy, I support the idea of setting up a European Roma agency."
"This will enable us to successfully put an end to discrimination on ethnic grounds, with all the consequences this entails."
"If there is going to be a system for monitoring the strategy's implementation, it must be applied to all Member States and not only to those with a large population of this community."
"There is the risk that the EU funds managed by NGOs will not produce concrete results."
"Public authorities should act as beneficiary organisations for the projects."
"I also support the idea expressed in the report about creating a European crisis map, featuring the micro-regions in the EU hardest hit by poverty, social exclusion and discrimination."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am grateful for this discussion in Parliament."
"I believe the Commission will benefit a great deal in the run-up to the delivery of the European framework, and it means a lot to me personally when we develop the future cohesion policy, especially the future of the European Social Fund."
"I understand from this discussion that we have to go forward with simplification."
"We have to go forward with making more room in the ESF for social inclusion."
"We have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most Roma live, and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people."
"I want, however, to clarify two things very briefly."
"Firstly, poverty plays a big role, but we should not believe that the situation of the Roma as a category is identical with that of poor people in general, because poverty and unemployment are much higher among the Roma than in mainstream society."
"That is why I believe Europe 2020 is a good framework and will help in developing the appropriate strategies, policies and financial support."
"Finally, we come to the question of why the Commission is working on a European framework as opposed to a European strategy as such."
"I have no time to elaborate on this, but it is simply because of the diversity of the reality on the ground."
"There is a common European problem but how it appears in various Member States, and how it should be translated into national strategies, differs from Romania to France or from Slovakia to Portugal, and we have to be aware of that."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, just to add to what my colleague has said, the discussion today was very valuable, as was most of what was written in your presentation."
"It will be taken into consideration in the elaboration of the work that the Commission is doing at the moment."
"The EU framework for national Roma strategies will first be presented to the European Platform for Roma Inclusion because we need - as many parliamentarians have said - to include the Roma population in our work and for them to take on their responsibility."
"It is also very important - and here I look to the Presidency - that there will be a follow-up of the work we do in the coming months so that we can see how all the projects will be implemented in practice."
"I agree with the Members who said that the regional funds are unfortunately not utilised as they could be and I also agree with those who say that the local authorities are sometimes the ones who can best find a solution."
"We have to help them to move forward."
"The Free Movement Directive has been questioned by some Members."
"The analysis of the transposition by all Member States has been finalised."
"In 2010, we visited 21 Member States and six visits are planned."
"A significant number of Member States have amended their rules or are in the process of amending their rules, so the Free Movement Directive will be much better applied than it was before."
"Madam President, Commissioners, truly, the timing of today's debate could not have been better."
"This is the best possible timing, because in April, the Commission will publish its communication and we then wish to incorporate that communication into the work of the Council."
"This means that after the debates conducted in the competent Council formations, we will also ask for the support of the European Council in the adoption of the conclusions."
"That is to say, there must be commitment to the Roma issue at the highest level - at the level of Heads of State or Government, on the part of the European Union."
"I would like to add a few thoughts to the debate about the question whether we are dealing with an ethnic issue or rather with some sort of social or economic challenge."
"I would not, and cannot, resolve this debate."
"I believe that we are dealing with both and that it is important that we maintain both approaches."
"As Commissioner Andor has said, it is a social and economic issue in that extreme poverty still represents a general problem in many places in the EU Member States."
"At the same time, there is an ethnic discrimination of sorts within extreme poverty, and we must therefore pay special attention to the Roma when providing opportunities."
"However, if we do not provide any, there is no point in us demanding access, on a human rights basis, to the little to no opportunities, because then there is nothing to access."
"However, if we do provide opportunities, then in the process of creating them, we must pay attention that the Roma, too, have access to them and are not elbowed out."
"I believe that we all need to take a new approach."
"It would be good if we could identify the opportunities inherent in this problem; if we could shift our perception of the Roma issue from problem to opportunity."
"Just imagine what a tremendous workforce base, what a workforce asset and potential this group of people, this crowd, has in terms of internal labour supply."
"As has been said on several occasions, improvements in education are the best investment."
"Indeed, education is investment in the future, and this is a key point when we are talking about people who are inactive, not just because they have no jobs and no opportunity to study, but who are inactive in a deeper sense of the word, because they have given up hope."
"They believe that they would not stand a chance anyway, and therefore no longer expect anything from life."
"Maybe they have reached a point where all they expect from the state is to provide them with aid."
"It is very important to enable these people to change from objects of these measures into subjects, and to participate in this themselves, as partners."
"Little has been said today about good practices."
"I consider it important that we keep a record of good practices, and I believe it is just as important that we do the same with bad practices, because we can often learn more from the faults of bad practices than from good practices."
"I also believe that the examination of funds, the examination of the use of funds, and here I am referring to European Union funds, indicates the presence of both good and bad practices."
"And finally, it is indeed perhaps the most important task for us to convince the majority; to convince the non-Roma majority in Europe, that integration does not exclusively represent some sort of humanitarian dictate, but it is also in their fundamental interest."
"After all, Europe belongs to all of us, and the majority can only feel well if the minority feels well, too."
"Thank you very much for this debate and I trust that we can continue to count on your support."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I will be very brief."
"I would like to thank you very much for all your valuable comments."
"They reinforce my and my very good shadow rapporteurs' view that political slogans will never become a reality without a proper legal basis, financial support and incentives as well as an EU mechanism to coordinate the actions of the stakeholders, ranging from local governments up to the Council and harnessing the advantages of multi-level governance."
"This will place the whole situation in a new light."
"I firmly believe that, on the basis of the tasks, objectives, principles and instruments defined by all the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and furthermore based on the shared competences as well as the supporting, coordinating and complementary actions of the Union, a very strong strategy on Roma inclusion can come into existence."
"To conclude, I would like to express the hope I have formed, over the past six years, that the upcoming Commission Communication will be able to endorse these points and provide a very good basis on which the Hungarian Presidency can pledge its commitment to launching this European Roma strategy."
"I am very grateful for this."
"I am aware that this European strategy is not going to solve the problem;"
"I know that a huge amount depends on us, the Roma."
"Words and promises mean nothing without actions outside of Brussels and in the Roma settlements."
"Governments and Roma must do what they have signed up to: take determined action to deliver tangible results."
"We understand our responsibility in this and we are fully in favour of our common partnership."
"This process for us Roma, and I believe for the whole European Union, is about much more than mutual trust."
"It is also about building a community of values that we can all share, and that we can all enjoy, to be able to really challenge the difficulties that we have been discussing here over the last six years."
"I thank you very much for all your support and I would like to join Renate Weber and the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking the secretariat of the Committee on Civil Liberties and all the advisers who, with us, have been fighting very hard for this."
"The debate is closed."
"I am sorry I have had to be so brutal with the speaking time but we are, as you can see, extraordinarily late in starting the next item on the agenda, which is Question Time."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Last year's events involving the expulsion of Roma from one country to another and the discrimination against this ethnic group and its segregation from society have prompted the European Union to take concrete action."
"This includes the European Union strategy on Roma inclusion, initiated by the European Parliament."
"The inclusion of this ethnic group is not merely an obligation in terms of human rights, but also an economic necessity, and not only is it a moral imperative, but also in the strict financial interest of all the Member States."
"Moreover, given the extent of exclusion, the overall inclusion of Roma is essentially an issue of human rights."
"I would like to underline that by adopting a common strategy for the whole of Europe on Roma inclusion, we in the European Parliament are demonstrating that the European Union is not just leaving Roma integration problems to be addressed by the Member States themselves."
"As we have seen from recent events, these problems are impossible to solve purely at national level, and consequently there is a need for close cooperation between the European Union and the Member States."
"It is also very important for the European Commission and the Member States to mobilise existing EU strategies and measures and to coordinate actions, and find common ground in order to ensure the social and economic inclusion of Roma."
"The strategy will only be actively implemented once a common European approach on issues of European Roma integration has been found."
"Furthermore, we should involve representatives of the Roma community as much as possible in the process of drafting EU policy on Roma issues."
"The report on the EU strategy on Roma inclusion lists the problems and difficulties facing Roma communities in the EU."
"The nature of poverty has changed substantially over the last two decades in Central and South-Eastern Europe."
"The political and economic changes have led to the break-up of traditional communities, and the Roma have thereby lost the option of being mobile, and have become the most excluded and least educated subgroup in society."
"The Roma population has, moreover, displayed the typical trait of demographic growth."
"While the majority of society is ageing, the proportion of Roma in society is rising through high population growth."
"All this makes it clear that, unless employment levels can be increased among the Roma, and unless they are better integrated into the majority of society, the costs of maintaining the situation at a bearable level will constantly rise, including costs for social assistance and benefits, essential costs for education, additional costs for providing security, administrative costs for supervising social spending and also higher costs for healthcare."
"Roma integration is therefore not merely a moral duty and a duty in terms of human rights protection but, above all, an economic necessity as well."
"Most of the measures implemented so far are so-called legally unenforceable regulations."
"However, if there is to be progress in this matter, the EU strategy on Roma inclusion must go beyond this so-called soft law and must be included in the instruments established through primary law."
"I believe we all now know that the Roma issue is not just a problem for some Member States or potential candidate countries."
"It is a pan-European problem, which must be resolved without delay."
"The biggest barrier to Roma inclusion with the majority society is poverty and low levels of education."
"Education is the key to raising living standards and to the constantly sought-for creation of civil society."
"Job creation is extremely difficult and, as a member of numerous youth organisations, I know what the current situation is for young people on the labour market."
"The situation is many times worse among the Roma population, resulting in the marginalisation of the Roma and increased criminality, which only further exacerbates the situation."
"It is not so long ago that France deported the Bulgarian and Romanian Roma."
"These actions came under scrutiny not only because of a suspected breach of basic human rights, but also EU regulations."
"I therefore fully agree with the Commission statement that it is necessary to contribute to better cooperation between the interested parties at the domestic, international and especially European levels."
"Despite constituting the largest ethnic minority, the Roma community in European Union Member States still suffers discrimination and segregation."
"I agree with a number of my fellow Members who said that it is very important to create a strategy on Roma inclusion at European level."
"In every Member State, we have excellent examples of how we should reduce Roma exclusion in various areas: education, culture, employment, healthcare or even Roma participation in political and civil life."
"However, such initiatives are not visible enough."
"In my opinion, the European Union would therefore be an appropriate platform to improve cooperation between the Member States, to pool and disseminate good practice and experience, or to provide funding."
"Although the EU level is very important, I believe that the most effective results can be achieved by acting at local or regional level."
"Only in specific localities or towns will we gain a better understanding of those areas' problems, needs and social environment and, as a result, projects being implemented will be closer to those for whom they are intended."
"I am following the Roma issue very closely because I live in Eastern Slovakia, where there is a Roma majority."
"I support the draft resolution concerning the strategy on Roma inclusion."
"Today, on 8 March, we celebrate 100 years of defending women's rights."
"We are also debating discrimination against women today, and when debating this strategy, it is therefore also necessary to talk about discrimination against women from minority groups in particular."
"The Roma are among the most disadvantaged population groups throughout Europe."
"I have read the statement of Mrs Járóka: 'Poverty threatens the new generation - not on account of their Roma origins, but on account of their parents' unemployment'."
"I would like to add that this is also on account of social exclusion."
"Unemployment will continue, particularly for the Roma population, but we know how to integrate Roma into cultural activities and into civic life immediately."
"The gender equality problem is worse in minority groups."
"In relation to Roma inclusion, we must therefore not forget dialogue with Roma women, who have a greater emotional influence on their children and on the future generation."
"First of all, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the fact that the Hungarian EU Presidency included the issue of Roma inclusion among its priorities."
"It stands as eloquent proof of the Hungarian Government's commitment in this regard that the rapporteur, Mrs Lívia Járóka, who is the only Roma Member of the European Parliament, is one of the Hungarian delegates of the European People's Party, and that Mr Zoltán Balog, the presenter of the case, head of the newly established State Secretariat for Inclusion, is engaged in supporting the betterment of the Roma people, who suffer from multiple disadvantages."
"Based on these facts, we can rightly conclude that the Hungarian EU Presidency is leading Europe by good example in the settlement of issues relating to the Roma."
"With regard to the Roma strategy, I believe it is important to stress that the integration of the 12 million Roma living in the EU is a common issue for Europe, whose resolution shall require the contribution of both the individual Member States and the EU institutions."
"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán aptly pointed out that if we do not wish to 'export' the problems of the Roma - who live in extreme poverty and social and ethnic exclusion - through 'nomadisation,' that is, emigration to the developed EU countries, then we must find a solution to their current, untenable situation through joint action and with combined efforts."
"I wish the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council and, last but not least, the Hungarian EU Presidency, successful work in developing and bringing to a final conclusion this momentous strategy for the integration of the Roma by June this year."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0019/2011)."
"Before I start Question Time, because we are so late, I want to say a couple of things about the manner in which I will be conducting Question Time."
"I would be grateful if everybody would pay attention, including, if I may ask politely, the Commissioners who will be responding."
"I will take, by way of supplementary questions, only the author of the question because we do not have enough time to do more if we are to get through enough questions."
"I would ask the Commissioners who are responding or delivering their first answer not, please, to read us a long essay."
"We would like a very nice answer and an informative answer to our question, so that you can have some dialogue with the questioner."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"(DE) Madam President, I must admit that I support your arguments about the time available."
"However, I would like to ask you to take one thing into account."
"The Members who want to ask questions are not the ones who are responsible for the fact that we are running so late."
"My problem is that I put a question to the Council concerning a matter which will now be dealt with as Question No 2."
"My question to the Council was identical to this, but Question Time with the Council has now been cancelled, without a replacement."
"This is, of course, rather unfortunate, and I would like to ask you to review your otherwise completely logical and understandable approach with regard to this one question."
"I have no alternative in the circumstances we find ourselves in tonight."
"I am very sorry for all the questioners, but the best I can do is to get through as many questions as possible and let questioners have their moment."
"It is not a position I relish, and you will know, I think, that we are taking steps to move to a new more real form of Question Time to reflect the new situation we find ourselves in after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The sooner that happens, frankly the better, but let us now proceed."
"Part one"
"Subject: Framework directive on minimum income in the EU"
"Last year, Parliament adopted a report on the role of minimum income in combating poverty and promoting an inclusive society in Europe, in which it maintained that a minimum income should be guaranteed in the EU under a framework directive."
"Given that there are already more than 85 million people in Europe living below the poverty line, does the Commission not consider it necessary to draw up a framework directive on a scheme to guarantee a sufficient minimum income in Europe as a whole?"
"Member of the Commission. - People have often said that societies should be judged by the way they treat their weakest members."
"Clearly, if we fail to provide adequate support for persons in need, we are likely to exclude them even further, and so make it harder to integrate them into society and bring them onto the labour market."
"The Commission believes that, in addition to acting as automatic stabilisers, minimum income schemes can play an important role in protecting the most vulnerable from the worst effects of the crisis by providing safety nets."
"The Commission recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market and the EPSCO Council Conclusions of 17 December 2008 on common active inclusion principles to combat poverty more effectively both highlight the importance of access to adequate resources, alongside quality services and inclusive labour markets."
"The recommendation calls on the Member States in particular to 'recognise the individual's basic right to resources and social assistance sufficient to lead a life that is compatible with human dignity as part of a comprehensive, consistent drive to combat social exclusion'."
"The approach outlined in the recommendation has proved to be a step in the right direction, especially during the economic crisis."
"But more needs to be done to fully implement active inclusion reforms."
"As the Commission announced in its communication on the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, it will report in 2012 on the implementation of the common principles on active inclusion, focusing, inter alia, on the effectiveness of minimum income schemes."
"It will propose action based on that assessment, including ways in which EU financial instruments could support active inclusion."
"(LT) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply, but you did not answer my question."
"My question was worded thus - does the European Commission intend to initiate a framework directive on ensuring sufficient minimum incomes, because otherwise, we definitely will not overcome poverty."
"Even last year, during the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, poverty grew in individual Member States."
"Commissioner, one other point - since a really high number of elderly people are falling into poverty, how would you feel about the Commission initiating uniform criteria as regards a minimum pension at European Union level?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission has advocated a minimum income and also a minimum wage, but we are speaking here about Member State competences and Member State responsibilities, and the subsidiarity principle comes into this discussion very strongly."
"In the crisis period, I agree, we have to pay specific attention to members of the vulnerable groups in society, especially those who are left without an income because they are also out of work, but we have to encourage the Member States to use various means - and this is just one option - to prevent people falling into poverty."
"So the room for legislative initiatives here is extremely small, even though, at certain times, the political demand for them is very significant."
"With regard to the poverty of older people, this is a very complex subject, on which we have to work in the fields of employment, social services and social protection, and this leads me to the campaign next year on active ageing, which will be supported by policies in the areas of healthcare and preserving health, and lifelong learning, because we believe that the biggest progress we can make in terms of the living conditions and social inclusion of older people will be in enhancing participation in the labour market."
"We can then build additional policies on to that."
"Subject: Energy-saving light bulbs"
