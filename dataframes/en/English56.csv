"It can be found in the Treaties. Nowadays, we refer to territorial cohesion as well as to economic and social cohesion."
"Economic cohesion may be achieved in a number of ways. It can be achieved through fiscal policy, by making those who have more pay more."
"One of these is combating social exclusion. Another is establishing the principle of equal opportunity for all citizens."
"Territorial cohesion has long been the subject of debate. There has been much discussion of areas with permanent structural difficulties that make it difficult for them to compete in this market."
"It has been stated that such areas should receive aid and solidarity from the remainder, regardless of the level of their GDP."
"This applies to agricultural policy, as Commissioner Fischler is well aware. When we help agriculture we do not enquire whether a particular farmer is rich or poor."
"We simply help agriculture. We wish the whole sector to be competitive."
"Territorial cohesion policy must be based on this approach too. Islands have to be helped."
"They find it difficult to compete on equal terms with large urban areas, because the latter always attract those people with the highest level of income. The sparsely populated areas of northern Europe have to be helped, as must the mountain areas."
"The latter need a wake-up call, to ensure the Pyrenees do not become depopulated. People living in areas with geographical difficulties must not be forced to emigrate."
"For all these reasons, it would be appropriate to send out an appeal to the new Europe created by the accession of ten new Member States. It has to be borne in mind that our contribution to general cohesion must remain at 0.46% of GDP."
"A number of initiatives have been very successful."
"I have in mind programmes such as Equal, Leader, Urban, Interreg and especially the Cohesion Fund."
"To date, four countries have benefited from the latter, namely Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These four countries have proved that when they grow, the whole European Union grows too."
"It is essential to keep in mind that the extra effort needed to receive the ten new Member States should not be borne entirely by the four countries that have benefited from the Cohesion Fund so far. Solidarity is called for."
"I should like this to go on record. I therefore formally endorse the statements made by previous speakers."
"Essentially, we agree with the basic approach drafted by the Commission further to Mr Barnier’s proposal."
"We agree with the minimum 0.45% for the three objectives."
"We agree with bringing Lisbon-Gothenburg and employment under cohesion."
"We also agree to the College of Commissioners’ 1.24% proposal."
"It is regrettable that he is not prepared to defend the 1.24% proposed by the Commission. Our proposal is therefore lower than the proposal made by the College of Commissioners."
"I find this most disappointing. I simply cannot understand why this is the case, when we tabled so many amendments on this subject."
"There is agreement in principle with the Commission’s proposal."
"I should like to emphasise two key issues."
"The first concerns the ultra-peripheral regions."
"It is important to try to ensure these regions retain substantial aid, regardless of their per capita income."
"Seventy-five on mainland Europe does not mean the same as 75% at a distance of 3 000 km from the mainland."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise how important it is for this House to stand up for fair criteria. A case in point is the need to ensure that the statistical effect does not have a negative impact on any institution in receipt of European funding."
"We have argued this strongly. Indeed the College of Commissioners made a proposal along these lines for the regions."
"Parliament has no objections."
"Anyone who maintains the opposite is not speaking the truth and is sending out the message that the statistical effect cannot affect Member States reducing the Cohesion Fund either."
"I know of one country at 83% of average income. This is set to change to 92% because of the statistical effect."
"The limit is 90%."
"I urge you to be flexible between now and when the vote is taken, Mr Hatzidakis."
"– Mr President, I too, on behalf of my group, wish to thank Mr Hatzidakis for his commendable report."
"I also want to thank the Commission for having drafted its proposal along the lines Parliament requested earlier on."
"Our group supports the committee’s line, that there should be adequate funding for cohesion policy and reviews made of state aid policies, that there should not be any renationalisation of regional policy and that areas with permanent difficulties, islands, sparsely populated and mountainous regions, and regions subject to the statistical effect should receive special treatment."
"An effective regional policy, however, means that other policies have to support its aims alongside aid policies."
"A certain freedom is also required in regional development, for example in state subsidies, without competition necessarily becoming endangered or distorted."
"I am pleased that progress is being made in the simplification of administration."
"Let us make the Member States responsible for functioning effectively."
"It is especially important to maintain the good practices we have learned from the Leader, URBAN and EQUAL Community initiatives."
"To justify the work of the EU there is an urgent need for a certain regional approach to issues and an understanding of the user’s point of view."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wishes to add its thanks to the rapporteur, who has really taken pains to produce a balanced report, a particularly difficult task in view of the short time at his disposal."
"The report largely endorses the Commission’s proposal."
"It does not, however, go beyond that."
"Essential aims for which Parliament has been campaigning are underemphasised, aims such as sustainable development or consistency between structural policy on the one hand and environmental legislation and the Commission’s environmental targets on the other."
"The Commissioner distinctly emphasised – and I certainly registered this – that Gothenburg ranks alongside Lisbon."
"I consider that very important, and I would be pleased if the Commission actually succeeded in having it enshrined in the regulation on the structural funds."
"To give but one example, the common policy on climate change must be a component of the future cohesion policy, and this must also be reflected in the choice of projects."
"The increase in unemployment and emigration from disadvantaged regions must be halted."
"Here too, clear differentiation is essential."
"The regulation on the structural funds must not be organised from above – and this is particularly important, in my view – but in cooperation, on a basis of equality, with local players. Lastly, I very much hope that the Commission will really keep the Commissioner’s promise and enshrine binding rules on partnerships in the regulation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this third report on cohesion undoubtedly rounds off Mr Barnier’s activities now that he is leaving office as a European Commissioner."
"We owe it to his tenacity and his great powers of persuasion that we can justifiably say that the logic of a policy of mere renationalised charity confined to the poorest has not carried the day."
"While recognising the need to give priority to the least developed regions, this progress report and the Hatzidakis report largely agree that all the EU’s regions potentially have a need for convergence, competitiveness and cooperation."
"A policy of achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion by 2013, as required by Article 3 of the draft constitution, therefore seems within reach."
"This policy is part of the idea of the EU bringing old and new members together in a common project."
"Even on the territory of the present Union of the 15, there are still areas deserving of aid from the Structural Funds and they must still be shown such solidarity."
"The Structural Funds’ involvement in the French overseas departments until 2013 strikes me as generally encouraging, but I await the forthcoming report that the Commission is to adopt on the implementation of Article 299(2); this will provide greater detail on the specific funds and the action plan for the , which ought to benefit the outermost regions."
"The battle of figures that some are beginning to use polemically in fact masks a fundamental debate about our ambitions for Europe, something which requires a constructive and rational interinstitutional dialogue."
"That debate cannot be confined to setting a particular ceiling for Community resources; we must calmly reach agreement on the European Project’s actual purpose."
"Our common objective must therefore be to commit the EU to a sustainable regional policy, as opposed to one which is strictly in response to economic circumstances."
"Mr President, from 2000 to 2006, my Member State, the UK, will have received over EUR 9 billion in direct EU structural fund support, topped up with match funding and private sector support."
"No-one can deny the benefits funds have brought to poor communities in industrial, urban and rural areas."
"The Hatzidakis report and the Commission proposals prove that the Jeremiahs who say that enlargement is bad news for UK regions have got it wrong."
"I want to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with proposals which, in a spirit of solidarity, provide funding for those areas of the EU-15 – including the UK – that are still in need."
"The devil will be in the detail, of course, and we still have a long way to go to agree a new round of regional aid programmes."
"However, this report and these proposals indicate that our poorest regions could win twice over from enlargement, with a bigger internal market and a continuation of regional aid."
"Labour MEPs have worked closely with our regional representatives, with local councils and with trade unions to identify our priorities."
"We welcome proposals for the convergence fund, in particular the inclusion of so-called 'statistical effect' regions, and we hope that regions being phased out will not be left high and dry, but will find a soft financial landing."
"We welcome the proposals to assist regional competitiveness in former Objective 2 areas and we look forward to hearing more details on how this will be allocated and on the indicators used to identify those areas."
"I would ask the Commission to further elaborate on its proposals, as requested in the Hatzidakis report on state aid."
"It is important that we have equality in the provision of state aid for all convergence regions, including the statistical effect areas."
"We need a reform of state aids which enables more public private partnership activity in regeneration, particularly of urban areas, of derelict land sites and of buildings."
"I wish today to endorse Mr Hatzidakis' proposal."
"I hope that Member States, the Commission and Parliament will now come up with a comprehensive budget and a regional aid package which will be a good deal for taxpayers and a good deal for our poorest regions."
"Mr President, I wish to use the short time available to me to express my surprise and dismay at the lack of interest and the contempt shown in the debates in this Parliament to the harsh reality that, in a Union of twenty-five States, cohesion policy will lose its character."
"It will be drastically impoverished."
"Indeed, following enlargement and if the financial perspective imposed by the Council for the period after 2006 remains in place and even if the financial perspective submitted by the Commission is implemented, the funds earmarked for education policy per capita in objective 1 territories will be only 50% of those applied in the Union of Fifteen."
"I would recall that, with the enlargement to ten new States, the population living in territories with a per capita income of less than ...% of the Community average, will rise from the current 73 million people, or 19%, to 153 million people, or 32%, of the Union of twenty-seven Member States."
"This round of enlargement will increase the population by 28% whilst GDP will increase by only 6%."
"For those of us who believe in the need for a Social Europe, and for me, as a Galician, this is totally unacceptable – all the more so because income in the enlargement countries stands at only 40% of the average income per inhabitant of the Fifteen and because in the current Member States there is still a clear need to maintain the Structural Funds levels of previous years."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in the third report on economic and social cohesion, the right path has been chosen, leading to a reformed European cohesion policy with a new architecture and targeted interventions."
"The fact that 78% of the financial resources for the reduction of disparities and the improvement of competitiveness factors have been earmarked for the least advanced regions shows that this is a move in the right direction – away from the scattergun approach to support funding towards the targeted use of resources."
"Equally right is the decision to accord equal treatment to the regions that are subject to the statistical effect in the framework of the new convergence objective."
"We particularly welcome this proposal, provided that it also guarantees adequate funding as envisaged in the communication from the Commission for the period after 2006."
"For the sake of fair treatment of the areas subject to the statistical effect in relation to the traditional Objective 1 regions, there must be no further budget cuts or dilution of support."
"I therefore wish to refer at this point to last September’s parliamentary resolution based on the Mastorakis report. The resolution not only emphasised the need to pay special attention to the level of support given to those regions suffering from the statistical effects of enlargement but also stressed that the Commission should focus the same attention on the administration of aid to these regions."
"Parliament voted by a large majority in favour of aid under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, and that should be taken into account."
"We therefore expect the Directorate-General for Competition, even before presenting the drafts for the regulation on the structural funds, to present its proposal for guidelines on regionally targeted aid, which should take due account of the parliamentary vote, for we must beware of narrowly focusing aid and support measures on the acceding countries, which would ultimately subsidise tax dumping in those countries and would only lead to job losses in the existing EU Member States as companies moved their production facilities from the West to the new Member States in the East."
"It would be unacceptable to invest European resources if a one-sided aid regime meant that the only return was the relocation of existing jobs."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I am convinced that people have good reason to look forward to enlargement."
"It remains true, though, that they also harbour many fears, and we must take those fears seriously and allay them wherever we can."
"Regional policy is an important means of dispelling such fears."
"It can and must help to prevent or eliminate inequalities, injustices and anomalies within the EU."
"It must not, however, encourage or sow the seeds of new injustices."
"For this reason, we take a similar view to that expressed by the previous speaker, Mr Berend, in opposing any European regional policy that simply induces companies to relocate."
"People will not understand or support a Europe that rewards companies for shifting jobs from one region and then only providing the same number of jobs elsewhere because we are subsidising the relocation."
"Another point we have to bear in mind is that EU support funds must not be used to subsidise drastic tax cuts in recipient countries."
"Solidarity is a noble value, but it must be mutual, and some of us will quickly recognise that, by promoting tax dumping, we could well besawing off the branch on which we sit."
"I would like to congratulate you once again on your report, Mr Hatzidakis. You must be aware that we are 99% in agreement with you."
"In particular, I must thank you for keeping your word and ensuring that ageing will be taken into account somehow in connection with the development of funds. It has yet to be determined exactly how this will be achieved."
"This issue is mentioned in the latter’s report also. It appears, therefore, that you are both fully aware of what ageing and low population density can entail."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no cohesion without development. There can be no development without a productive population."
"There cannot be a productive population if there is low population density and ageing. Ageing is not a territorial problem."
"It is a horizontal problem affecting all regions of Europe. It affects all Member States too, and will become ever more significant in the years to come."
"It is a major contributory factor to lack of development in regions where this is the case."
"I therefore call on the Group of the Party of European Socialists to withdraw Amendment No 8, as this amendment could make it difficult for ageing to be taken into account as a negative factor as far as development is concerned."
"– Mr President, especially as the former mayor of a regional island town, I too wish, from this position, to thank the outgoing Commissioner, Mr Barnier, for his efforts to serve the idea of economic and social cohesion in the Europe of the regions."
"Of course, I also thank Kostas Hatzidakis, my colleague and fellow countryman who acted as rapporteur for the report being debated, for his work which, as we all know, is manifested in more than just this report."
"It is very positive to note that our Parliament accepts by an overwhelming majority firstly, that any renationalisation of regional policy would be devastating even to the very existence of the European Union, of which it is a basic connective fabric, secondly, that the so-called statistical effect of enlargement – of any enlargement – would be addressed in such a way as to ensure continuing support for the regions for which it was considered necessary before enlargement, in order not to interrupt their progress towards development, thirdly, that the special regions from the point of view of natural disadvantages will also need to receive special treatment and finally, that the cohesion policy, which is indeed an essential tool to enable the Union to achieve the Lisbon objectives, has provided important results to date."
"It is therefore worth our while to continue this balanced, balancing, reliable and effective policy."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Hatzidakis for his usual constructive cooperation."
"Firstly, a European cohesion policy is necessary."
"In the enlarged EU, we need a distribution policy that shows solidarity, in order to reduce disparities and to compensate regions situated far from the large markets."
"Secondly, on the matter of the budget, we must come up with the resources that are required to make EU enlargement a success and make headway with growth in Europe."
"The funds must be used wisely."
"Thirdly, the sparsely populated regions in the extreme north of Sweden and Finland lose their Objective 1 status under the proposal, and this must be called into question, as their geographical disadvantages exist regardless of the situation in the rest of Europe."
"We must ensure that these parts of Europe obtain the aid they need."
"Fourthly, the Commission must ensure that the extreme, sparsely populated regions take their rightful place in the future Structural Fund Regulation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, as you know and as you see, the European Parliament remains very vigilant about the future of regional policy, one of the most important policies in the eyes of the citizens."
"Despite the work done by our rapporteur and our committee, one crucial point is still outstanding: the amount of funding to be allocated to this policy."
"It is essential that the future expenditure ceiling should allow this policy to be strengthened after enlargement."
"There is a very great difference between the Commission’s proposals for 1.24% of gross domestic income (GDI) and the 1% proposed by six States, and regional policy runs the risk of being used as a balancing item for European politics."
"We remember the commitment shown by Mr Barnier, who steadfastly opposed the six countries that want a reduced European budget."
"Now that Mr Barnier is a government minister, I therefore hope he will continue to show in the Council the commitment he had as Commissioner and that he will be able to get all his colleagues to change their position with regard to the Commission proposal."
"The Structural Funds are in fact essential to European solidarity."
"The Union needs a real cohesion policy, the financial resources to implement it and therefore income equivalent to at least 1.24% of GDI."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my sincere thanks for this debate and particularly for the many constructive contributions I have heard here."
"We shall certainly endeavour to ensure that, when we formulate the specific legislative proposals we have undertaken to deliver in July, various additional points will be taken into account if possible."
"I intend to be brief and address only a couple of points, one being the question of how we propose to deal in future with the so-called Community initiatives."
"The idea is that the number of these Community initiatives is to be reduced, which will naturally mean that various specific programmes, such as Leader or others, will no longer be available."
"This does not mean, however, that the measures covered by these programmes will no longer exist. The intention is that measures previously implemented in the framework of individual Community initiatives will be integrated into the mainstream programmes."
"In this way, we can ensure, for example, that the Equal programme or measures designed specifically to promote equal treatment of both sexes are given their rightful place in the main programmes."
"As far as the outermost regions are concerned, there are, of course, specific treaty provisions of which due account must be taken in the implementation of the relevant measures."
"I know that Mr Barnier always attached great importance to the task of looking after the outermost regions, and I can guarantee that they will continue to receive the same level of attention."
"The question of the territorial aspect of state aid and the necessary definition of areas eligible for support is indeed a highly sensitive issue, and then there is the concern in some quarters that there could be difficulties in areas bordering on supported regions."
"The Commission will devote particular attention to this matter."
"On the other hand, however, I cannot subscribe to the view expressed by one Member that our policy will lose its cohesive character after enlargement."
"That is quite simply untrue."
"Care will still be taken to ensure that the cohesion target we have set ourselves is actually achieved."
"Indeed there will also be more funds available for that purpose."
"It is not as if all the resources were to be taken from the present 15 Member States and given to the new Member States. There will be more money."
"I fully agree with you that we still need a European – and I emphasise European – cohesion policy."
"A mere financial adjustment of the type that some are seeking or have mooted will not, in my opinion, achieve our aim."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
". – The report acknowledges enormous disparities between regions, which will inevitably worsen as a result of this round of enlargement, that strengthening economic and social cohesion is an obligation under the Single Act, and that structural investments in the cohesion regions benefit the Union’s other economies."
"It does, however, deem 0.41% to be an acceptable minimum level for the allocation."
"The report insists on retaining the 'expenditure target' system and on the N+2 rule, it issues warnings about industrial restructuring and relocation; it states that companies that have benefited from Community aid should not be entitled to receive new funds when they relocate, and that State aid should not be an incentive for companies to relocate. It also calls for more effective monitoring of the ways in which the Funds are used and for a more focused strategy with regard to industrial restructuring and its social impact."
"It confirms support for regions that have suffered as a result of the ‘statistical effect’, it has adopted amendments that we tabled to eliminate the expression ‘temporary phasing-out’ and to provide phasing-out support for current Objective 1 regions; it calls for the special status of the outermost regions to be preserved and for specific programmes to be kept on, even if they are no longer in Objective 1 regions."
"It has adopted our proposal for regions that suffer permanent handicaps."
"It seeks to ensure specific proposals and suitable funding for employment as well as support for small and micro-businesses and for training, particularly for adults."
"We insist that the ‘statistical effect’ should be extended to the Cohesion Fund."
"The next item is the report (A5-0269/2004) by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2005 Budget: the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy report (APS)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the start of the final budgetary procedure in plenary in the current legislature."
"The composition of the House due to vote on this report tomorrow will not be the same as that of the House that will vote on final adoption of the 2005 budget in December, assuming that stage is reached."
"I trust that at least my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets and I will be able to vote in December along with our new colleagues from the new Member States."
"I would like to thank all colleagues and officials for the spirit of cooperation they have demonstrated towards me thus far."
"An innovative step forward has been taken with regard to modernising the budgetary procedure."
"Further to the debate on stock taking and the change to activity based budgeting, the European Parliament is doing away with the former budgetary guidelines. These are replaced by a resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy Report."
"One objective is to render the legislative procedures more appropriate. It is also hoped to influence the drafting of the Commission’s preliminary draft budget."
"We therefore urge the Commission to take account of our political and budgetary priorities when negotiating with the various Directorates-General."
"We set out to draft a shorter resolution this year. Unfortunately, I fear we have failed in our endeavour, as we did in previous years."
"Nonetheless, I am delighted with my colleagues’ contributions."
"I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising that the opinions of the other parliamentary committees will be taken into account at first reading of the budget."
"Commissioner, this draft 2005 budget is characterised from the outset by a special feature. I refer to the budgetary restriction affecting categories 3, 4, and 5."
"This budgetary limit will affect many programmes and will call for a particular effort to improve the distribution of appropriations between ongoing functions and new priorities."
"We believe that the new needs will require additional resources."
"Concerning agriculture, we call on the Commission to make a statement on the pilot projects and on the initiatives launched in the 2004 budget."
"With regard to the Structural Funds, we point to the improved implementation of appropriations in 2003, despite retaining a very high RAL."
"Your rapporteur intends to set the final figure for appropriations by reference to Member States’ forecasts."
"Turning to internal policies, the European Parliament is concerned about meeting the mid-term objectives set at Lisbon."
"We therefore request that budgetary resources be focused on the key actions in 2005."
"Special attention will be paid to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the drivers of growth and employment."
"Parliament is also concerned about implementation of communication and information policy."
"The new Financial Regulation must not hinder the development of the latter."
"This budget’s main aim will be the consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justice."
"It will pay particular attention to the common immigration policy and to speeding up implementation of the integrated Schengen and VIS Project systems."
"Substantial budgetary resources will be required in both cases. Parliament must deal quickly with these priorities, however, if it is to be seen to respond to concerns expressed by European citizens."
"We shall stand shoulder to shoulder with you on this, Commissioner."
"We shall also respond appropriately to the challenge posed by terrorism, particularly in the wake of the terrible attacks perpetrated in Madrid on 11 March. All our efforts to ensure no such outrage can ever take place in Europe again will be dedicated to the victims."
"This is why we shall endorse the pilot project for aid to the victims of terrorism. We shall also support strengthening Europol and Eurojust."
"In addition, we are in favour of your directive on compensation for victims of crime. We shall support similar initiatives brought before the House also."
"To summarise, in the case of the fight against terrorism, the House will go beyond supporting the Council and the Commission. It will actually try to take the lead."
"With regard to external affairs, Parliament will become ever more involved in the reconstruction of Iraq and the consolidation of democracy in Afghanistan. The traditional priority areas for the House will not be neglected either."
"New additions for this year are the neighbourhood policy, the creation of a European diplomatic service and of a European external action service."
"The general principle applied throughout will be that new external needs must be financed with new resources so as not to detract from our traditional priorities."
"Lastly, we have taken note of the 700 posts you request from us, Commissioner. We very much hope that you will in any case try to arrange some redeployment."
"I shall conclude by saying that we will be very vigilant as far as the various agencies are concerned. We shall ask them to provide a mid-term programme."
"The Commission should be able to include this in the draft preliminary budget in May on the development of these agencies."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget for 2005 will be the first budget for the enlarged Union to be adopted by an enlarged budgetary authority."
"The Commission will adopt the preliminary draft for the 2005 budget within the next few weeks."
"At the first reading by the Council in July, under the Dutch Presidency, 25 Member States will be represented, and the MEPs from 25 Member States will take part in the first parliamentary reading in October."
"The budget of 2005 will thus be presented to a host of new faces, not least within the Commission."
"There can, however, be no doubt that the budget will be dominated by enlargement, and this is also emphasised by the general rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, in his report."
"May I offer you my very sincere thanks for your report, Mr Garriga Polledo, particularly since you were under pressure to produce it within a very short time because of the postponement of the communication from the Commission on the policy strategy for 2005."
"One of the aims of the 2005 budget is to implement the agreements contained in the Treaty of Accession."
"In concrete terms, this means that direct payments to farmers are to be entered in the budget for the first time."
"It also means an increase in the financial commitments from the Structural Funds, as agreed in Copenhagen."
"The Structural Funds are the main instrument with which the European Union gives financial assistance to the new Member States in order to narrow the prosperity gap, and they should remain the principal instrument of cohesion policy in the future too."
"At the consultation before the first reading of the budget for 2005, I shall report to you on the latest progress in the programming of the Structural Funds for the new Member States."
"The political priority attaching to enlargement is also reflected in administrative expenditure: the Commission will, as stated in the communication of 2002 and reiterated a few moments ago by your general rapporteur, apply for the next batch of additional posts for enlargement."
"This will involve the establishment of 700 new posts, about half of which will be assigned to the language services."
"As far as administrative expenditure is concerned, special efforts and particularly close cooperation will be required from all the institutions if we are to operate within the ceiling which is set in the financial plans and which has turned out to be lower than previously calculated because of the reduction in the appropriation for exchange losses. Mr Kuckelkorn, of course, has dealt with that very thoroughly, and may I extend my thanks to you too, Mr Kuckelkorn, for your report."
"Lastly, for the priority task of enlargement, the Commission is also proposing an increase in pre-accession aid to Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, as decided by the Council with the support of Parliament."
"Lending new dynamism to economic growth in Europe is a task for the Member States and the Union, a task that will help to shape the next few years."
"Enlargement itself will generate economic impetus."
"Additional efforts are, however, needed to tap the full potential of the enlarged single market."
"These efforts receive financial backing from the EU budget, not only through the Structural Funds but also, for example, with the funds allocated to the trans-European networks, and provision has been made for an increase in these funds next year."
"The funds earmarked for measures such as the creation of a chemicals-testing agency are essential expenditure if we are to ensure that the new approach to chemicals policy, which involves testing old substances for their impact on the environment and public health, does not become a bureaucratic impediment to the chemical industry but should actually speed up the innovation process."
"The dreadful events of 11 September 2001 and the savage terrorist acts in Madrid have clearly emphasised the danger emanating from terrorism."
"In the European Union we need more cooperation, more effective cooperation, in order to protect our citizens from such dangers."
"The measures envisaged in this domain are another priority for the 2005 budget, and I note that all the institutions are in agreement on this point too."
"The internal security of the European Union and its role in the field of foreign policy are inseparable."
"As far as the foreign-policy budget is concerned, we face another significant challenge in 2005."
"The adjustment entry is lower than the rate of inflation."
"This means in practice that the budget for the common foreign policy will be reduced in real terms."
"This is in stark contrast to all the political pronouncements as well as being glaringly inconsistent with the spirit of the draft constitution, which we hope will be adopted within the next few weeks."
"There is simply no escaping the fact that the ceiling on the foreign-policy budget was set too low."
"This mistake must not be repeated in the next round of financial planning."
"Nevertheless, we must safeguard the appropriations for the main priorities, such as combating poverty and honouring our commitments in Afghanistan and in the Balkans too, commitments to which Mr Garriga Polledo also referred in his speech."
"For next year we need a contingency reserve again to enable us to make funds available for Iraq."
"Let us hope, and let us all play our part in ensuring, that next year’s Iraq agenda really can be devoted to reconstruction."
"2005 is the sixth year of the Financial Perspective that is now in force."
"When a planning period nears its end, the room for manoeuvre becomes increasingly limited as more and more funds are tied up in advance by decisions made in previous years."
"Next year will be particularly tight, because the adjustments, as I mentioned, have turned out to be smaller than originally envisaged."
"For 2005 the current financial plans provide for EUR 119 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 114 billion in payment appropriations, which corresponds to 1.09% of gross national income."
"The cost of implementing decisions of previous years – those taken in the framework of Agenda 2000, the Accession Treaty, the multiannual programmes, the roadmaps or even the agricultural reform package, the full impact of which will be felt next year as its cost rises to about EUR 1 billion – swallows the bulk of the funds within each of the ceilings."
"There will be a need for close and fruitful cooperation among all participants if we are to reach a timely agreement on the budget for 2005."
"As in past years, the Commission will cooperate closely with the rapporteurs and the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets and with the Council’s Economic and Financial Committee under the Dutch Presidency."
"On a personal level too, I shall naturally make it a point of honour to cooperate very closely and effectively, as in the preceding years, so that we can draw up and adopt a budget that will help significantly to achieve the aims of the enlarged Union."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the general rapporteur for his report. I must also make the Commission aware once again of the long-standing position of the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I am glad Mr Garriga Polledo has also endorsed this position, inasmuch as we cannot continue financing new priorities to the detriment of other parts of the world such as TACIS, the Mediterranean, Latin America and Asia. This is simply not possible, Commissioner."
"These are to combat poverty and promote human rights. The committee also shares the priorities of the European security strategy, namely combating terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and preventing organised crime and regional conflict, as well as dealing with failing states."
"I have noted with some concern the adjustments needed to bring the 2005 Budget into line with the requirements of the Financial Perspective. Commissioner, I trust the offer of cooperation you just extended to the Committee on Budgets and to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council can also be extended to the Committee on External Affairs, as we are all working together in the interests of effective and visible European external action."
". Mr President, our main goal should be to be successful for our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I believe the main point is that we must safeguard existing jobs and businesses and create new ones, and to this end we need, more than anything else, the small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"These enterprises are experiencing fairly serious concerns at the present time with the introduction of the Basel II package."
"There is quite simply an urgent need for the European Commission study on the implementation of the Basel II agreements, including a detailed impact assessment."
"It is also a matter, ultimately, of creating new financial and guarantee instruments for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"These SMEs should be operating successfully on behalf of Europe in the global marketplace, which is another reason why I believe that the WTO assembly and parliamentary conference proposed by the European Parliament are a matter of the utmost priority, and I ask the Commission to incorporate this proposal from the European Parliament into the programme too."
". Mr President, we of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are very pleased with Mr Garriga Polledo’s report."
"He has the most difficult period of tenure as rapporteur that we have, because it falls in the period that Parliament is in temporary recess."
"There are always all kinds of forces at these times, especially in the Council, that try to draw matters within their own sphere of influence, but I think Mr Garriga Polledo can be trusted to withstand these assaults."
"We had three main priorities in our committee."
"One of them has been fully adopted in the report and that is Lisbon."
"Lisbon is the solution for better competitiveness, better employment and a better economy."
"We need to put even more emphasis on this than we have in the past."
"For Lisbon to succeed, we also need to name the social partners."
"This will involve a very small sum, but it is really extremely important."
"It would be good if that were still to be brought up for debate in some way or other in the resolution."
"Another point is health and safety and that is going to be very important in the near future, especially in relation to the new Member States."
". Mr President, the budgetary year of 2005 will essentially be characterised by two issues from an agricultural point of view: on the one hand, a European Union of 25 Member States from the beginning of the budget, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, and, on the other, by the implementation of certain provisions adopted in the reform of the common agricultural policy and which will now enter into force, such as, for example, direct aid to milk producers, or aid for rice without the former penalties, and aid for dried fruits, the quality of durum wheat and energy crops."
"It has, therefore, become necessary for the Commission, in the preliminary draft budget, to anticipate some of the consequences of this enlargement, providing for sufficient funds, for example, for intervention measures for certain products, such as butter or beef, in the event that the new Member States cannot bring their prices into line quickly or, for example, veterinary funds to combat animal diseases, which could increase following the disappearance of the current borders."
"I would finally like to stress that the Committee on Agriculture, in its opinion in this report, has expressed its firm support for the introduction of a pilot project for the funding of Community insurance intended to alleviate the consequences of disasters caused by extreme climatic phenomena."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, two hours ago, in my role as spokeswoman for the Committee on Fisheries, I expressed my confidence that European fisheries do indeed have a future."
"I shall now continue where I left off by emphasising that these future prospects depend on systematic pursuit of the reform efforts and on the implementation of decisions."
"I therefore call for due consideration in the 2005 budget of at least the main areas of action of the common fisheries policy."
"Firstly, we need better staffing of the relevant services if the aims of the CFP reforms are to be achieved. Secondly, we need the provision of a solid financial basis for the planned creation of the regional advisory bodies, and, thirdly, we need a solid financial basis for the establishment of the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"Fourthly, we need sufficient resources for the new fisheries agreements as well as for EU participation in international fisheries organisations and, fifthly, we need adequate funding to compensate the coastal regions hit by the effects of recovery plans and emergency measures."
"Our decision to reform the CFP made good sense."
"In the budget for 2005, the aim must now be to build a robust and sustainable financial substructure that will finally enable the fishing industry to become profitable again."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the new annual policy strategy instrument allows the legislative and budgetary cycles to be combined and makes a political reading of our budget easier."
"We believe it is essential that policies that have been codecided should really be entered in the budget without sacrificing other European policies; this will require a higher income than proposed."
"I will, however, stress that more funding needs to be budgeted for the Lisbon objectives."
"At the half-way stage we have not reached our targets."
"It is therefore imperative that budget resources be concentrated on employment, innovation and social cohesion policies."
"We must in that way ensure that the social partners take part in modernisation talks."
"All the budget lines allowing progress to be made with the Union’s economic governance must also be funded."
"We are agreed in recognising the essential part played by small firms in modernising employment."
"They play a recognised part in the creation and preservation of jobs."
"We must continue to help them by improving their environment, however."
"It must be made easier to support non-governmental organisations in the social sector and we shall have to find a way to put an end to their financial insecurity."
"Finally, I agree with our rapporteur that information and communication are areas to which the Commission needs to give greater priority and on which it must take action."
"Not only must these budget lines be funded, but more especially the Commission must fully realise what its role is in this information policy because all policies must come back to and finish with the citizen."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ‘gender budgeting’ must become more than a mere linguistic monstrosity."
"I ask and urge you to ensure that the principle of gender equality permeates this budget."
"Gender mainstreaming must be put into practice and must be made quantifiable in terms of euros."
"In the European Community, more women are victims of violence within the family than are victims of terrorism."
"For this reason, we call for 2006 to be declared the European Year against Violence."
"We want the Beijing +10 review to be used as a means of fleshing out the Beijing Platform for Action, and we want the results of the World Conference on Women to be implemented by a European Conference, for example, which would develop additional strategies."
"We also call for a European Gender Institute, which would compile reliable data as a basis for our political decisions."
"We expect the Commission to apply gender mainstreaming in all areas of political activity, and the 2005 budget, the first in the greater European Union, should provide us with the main indicators of its application."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, who has presented an excellent report in difficult circumstances, given that all of us are already either preparing or waging an electoral campaign. The report does this House credit."
"Allow me to pick out a few points from the report for brief comment."
"I should certainly like to express my astonishment that the Commission has apparently agreed with the Council – or so the documentation seems to suggest – on a cut of EUR 100 million in the special programme for the removal of bottlenecks in the framework of the trans-European networks."
"I find that procedurally and politically unacceptable."
"With regard to the substance of this apparent agreement, it is evident, particularly in my own region, that we are not prepared for enlargement as far as the transport infrastructure is concerned and that there is an urgent need for funding here. It is therefore unacceptable that an important project proposed by the Commission under parliamentary pressure should now be ditched."
"I wish to emphasise that clearly and may I also say that the Commission should rethink its political approach to the adoption of preparatory measures in connection with its visa policy, the Schengen information system and its refugee policy."
"Various directorates-general have adopted very different political approaches in this matter, and the Commission is surely duty-bound to pursue a coherent overall approach."
"What various parts of the Commission are putting out at this time cannot be accepted and is, in some cases, self-contradictory."
"Lastly, allow me to refer to the establishment of new posts."
"Let me forewarn you clearly that we shall be examining very carefully whether 700 posts are really needed."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, in discussing the budget for 2005, we have, of course, merely set the ball rolling."
"It will be a matter for the next Parliament to bring the process to a conclusion."
"In this respect it is an unusual budget."
"It is also unusual in that it is heavily influenced by the particular context in which it is being prepared."
"On the one hand, we want to make enlargement work and must therefore create the appropriate conditions."
"In addition, everything to do with enlargement is all about the future and about the availability of financial resources too."
"We shall also discuss the budget in the light of the debate on the financial perspective, because this 2005 budget will be the last but one before the new financial perspective."
"It goes without saying that the figures we estimate represent choices for the future, and they will also be one of the foundations of the debate on the financial perspective, whether we like it or not."
"At the same time, Europe is not an island."
"We Europeans must engage in international politics, whether in the field of foreign policy, where we must work to prevent conflict, or in the sphere of internal security, to which you have referred, where we must play our part in a concerted effort to combat international crime."
"Lastly, we must rise to the challenge of global competition and ensure that our businesses and our economy can hold their own."
"As in the preceding years, we shall try to ensure that the budget on the table in front of us is a tight one, even in the conditions I have just described."
"It must, however, also be adequate."
"We shall not let anyone cry ‘miser’ at those who advocate great prudence and thrift, nor shall we tolerate any accusations of extravagance against those who point out that more money is needed in particular areas."
"In the process of drawing up this budget in the conditions I have described, which make it no easier to reach agreement, we shall continue to adhere to the line we have always taken in the past, pressing for the adoption of a tight but adequate budget, so that the public know that they can rely on the European Parliament to deal responsibly with budgetary matters."
"–Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for an excellent report."
"Next year’s budget will be a difficult one, with the accession of ten new Member States, bringing with them nine new official languages."
"This will be a very hard test for EU administration."
"The new Member States have to be included in the work of the EU as a whole."
"This means they also have to receive their rightful share of employees and officials to work in the EU’s different institutions."
"This is a massive recruitment and training exercise."
"The Commission’s request for 700 new posts is right, even if it is a huge number."
"At the same time, however, we have to guard against too much bureaucracy with regard to administration."
"The downward devolution of responsibility and power should continue, as should the clarification of personal accountability."
"Administration must move more in the direction of activity-based management, where what is most important is better productivity and cost-effectiveness."
"There should be special attention paid to improving internal security."
"This will mean, among other things, stepping up the fight against drugs and other international criminality, as well as illegal immigration."
"This will bring pressures for budget heading 3, ‘Internal Policies’, in particular."
"Regarding structural policy, we must once and for all be in a position to reduce the figure for outstanding commitments."
"Regarding the structure of the budget, we have to improve its degree of informativeness: it must be clearly evident what the costs and achievements of individual policy areas are."
"Members of Parliament must be able to see clearly what EU money has achieved or can achieve."
"Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Mr Garriga Polledo for his work and I also look forward to fruitful cooperation in connection with the budget for 2005."
"The comment I would like to make is of a more general nature, as both Terry Wynn’s report on the financial outlook and also the report before us now speak of the Lisbon process, the need to achieve greater economic growth."
"I ask myself why there is no mention anywhere of the promises made in Gothenburg?"
"Then the issues were the quality of the growth that we are bringing about, sustainability and biodiversity."
"There must be more investment in clean sources of energy and energy saving and that must also manifest itself in the budget."
"The Member States seem to want to achieve the objectives of Lisbon mainly through a kind of management by speech, as money and real social policy are not being put on the table."
"Hollow statements are made, but we hear no more about sustainability and the promises that were made about that, they are being forgotten."
"I want a Europe of people and the environment, not of the market and currency."
"In other words, not only a Europe of Lisbon, but also of Gothenburg."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Garriga for the work that he carried out and also for the cooperation that we had in the Committee on Budgets."
"My thanks also go to Mr Wynn, for the whole period that we have worked together, to Mr Walter and all the Members of the committee."
"2005 will, perhaps, be the first full year for the new Europe of 25 Member States – and I believe that the Commissioner, whom I thank, must not forget this."
"It will, therefore, be the first year in which the EU budget will be fully drafted taking into account 25 Member States."
"We are faced with new challenges, given that spending levels must, anyway, be maintained in order to guarantee a certain level of growth, while taking into account new requirements, always and in any case on the basis of financial discipline that must be respected, above all through parliamentary control."
"We hope that all this is realised and in the near future too, even more so in an enlarged Europe of 25."
"The debate is closed;"
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0236/2004) by Mr Wilfried Kuckelkorn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2005."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's preliminary estimates for 2005 have been deliberated in detail by the Committee on Budgets and the groups have reached agreement, by an overwhelming majority, on the report before you."
"I would like to extend my warm thanks to everyone involved for this good cooperation."
"I will therefore only focus on a few specific aspects here."
"The 2005 estimates are based on the following key parameters: full 12 months of enlargement-related expenditure with nine new languages, and of course, if the outcome of this week's referendum in Cyprus is positive, a tenth new language will be added; 44 working weeks, of which three constituency weeks, 12 ordinary part-sessions and six additional part-sessions; a 2.7% salary adjustment, and a 7% standard abatement for posts."
"Due to the specific situation arising in the drafting of the estimates for 2005 this year, with the forthcoming enlargement on 1 May and the European elections in June, a number of issues and uncertainties are still outstanding which cannot be resolved until shortly before the first reading in September this year."
"Political priorities: the priority is to satisfy the needs relating to enlargement despite the financial constraints in Heading 5 in 2005."
"I view the main objective for 2005 as achieving sound financial management and budgetary rigour and providing value for money for the European taxpayer."
"The estimates for the 2005 budget, taking into account the budgetary constraints and uncertainties, must therefore be based on sound assumptions and real needs."
"The general framework: the preliminary draft estimates have been set at 20% of Heading 5, namely EUR 1 272 million."
"Of this figure, an amount of EUR 1 007.6 million is foreseen for standard operational expenditure and EUR 173.4 million for enlargement-related needs."
"In light of the positive experiences with capital injections and accelerated repayment of buildings, which have produced major savings in recent years, it would seem sensible to use a part of the appropriations available in the budget for an advance payment for the D4 and D5 buildings in 2005."
"Expenditure related to Members and political groups: no appropriations, on the line or in the reserve, are foreseen for a Member's Statute, but chapter 102 (Reserve for the Member's Statute) is maintained with a token entry (p.m.)."
"This House should continue to support the adoption of a Statute for Members' assistants."
"Furthermore, the level of the Secretariat allowance should be assessed, and a Code of Conduct governing the use of the Secretariat allowance should be produced."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn now to one of the four amendments which have been tabled."
"Unfortunately, my fellow Member, Mr Balfe, whom I greatly respect, is not here."
"I would therefore ask our fellow Members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE Group) to bring their influence to bear on him once more so that he withdraws his amendment."
"The reason is that there are still a number of financial issues to be clarified."
"We can reach a consensus on the matter itself, but it is ultimately inopportune to take a decision based on a report which does not show all the appropriations."
"That is the reason why I would ask you to bring your influence to bear so that this particular amendment is withdrawn tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur who dealt with the issue of Parliament's preliminary estimates for 2005 with his customary flair. I wish to thank him particularly for his efforts, from the outset, to achieve a consensus across the groups."
"It is very important that on the one hand, we jointly contribute to ensuring that in terms of its administration, the European Parliament is able to master the challenges of enlargement fully. After all, we are the institution which is most affected, because all the languages must be available from 1 May and we have very different working methods from the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors."
"On the other hand, we must also make a contribution to strengthening the European Parliament itself, and the public's 'ownership' of it, on a long-term basis. To this end, the rapporteur has put forward a number of sound proposals – he has just outlined the various points – and I would like to thank him particularly for that."
"Mr Kuckelkorn, as regards Mr Balfe, I would point out that the amendment concerned was not tabled by the group, which is why the group is unable to take any action here. The amendment comes from at least 32 Members – I am not sure of the precise number of signatures – who have tabled this motion."
"That is permissible under the Rules of Procedure and I would ask you to respect that."
"Let me, however, also make it clear that I am one of the Members who has opposed Mr Balfe's proposals most vigorously."
"Let me be blunt: it is not the European Parliament's task, faced with a situation in which healthcare in some Member States – I shall phrase it very carefully – is not entirely satisfactory and legal restrictions apply, to solve problems in this area for a few specific and privileged Members at the European taxpayer's expense."
"I say this quite frankly, and I have said the same thing to Mr Balfe himself. At the moment, we are being bombarded with e-mails explaining why we should definitely vote in favour of this amendment."
"Members from three Member States are involved."
"What these Members should be doing, quite simply, is helping to ensure that the health system in their own countries functions effectively, then they would not need any over-provision at European level."
"Let me be blunt about that too."
"I hope, Mr Kuckelkorn, that after the European elections – I am assuming that the voters will be merciful and draw the line at number 30 on your party list so we still have the pleasure of your company, whereas I am in a position where I can be rather more confident – we will be able to adopt this budget jointly, for it is extremely important that in our capacity as the representatives of Europe's citizens, we address this task very seriously and thus help ensure that Europe does not drift away from its citizens."
"That is this Parliament's honourable task."
"We are committed to it, and we intend to remain committed to it after 13 June as well."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
". Mr President, the Commission would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity to clarify once more the actions that it has taken after being informed in May 2003 about the serious events at Eurostat and at some of its contractors, most of which had occurred – as investigations have shown – in the period up to 1999."
"As soon as the Commission had evidence of the problems in Eurostat, it took action."
"The Director-General and all the directors were moved to advisory posts while the Commission conducted a thorough investigation into who was directly involved."
"The Commission launched an Internal Audit Service examination of Eurostat contracts and grants."
"Following the reports by the IAS and the special task force, contractual relations between Eurostat and other Commission departments and certain organisations were brought to an end."
"OLAF (European Anti-fraud Office) was encouraged to conclude, as soon as possible, outstanding enquiries there."
"The Commission was determined to rectify and strengthen its relevant rules and practices, and to fully implement the staff and financial reform begun in 2000."
"As the House will know, on 25 September 2003 Commission President Prodi presented his action plan to a meeting of the Conference of Presidents, enlarged to include members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"This action plan had three basic components: first, thorough restructuring of the Eurostat Directorate-General; second, consolidation of the reform regarding relations between Commissioners, their private offices and services, and centre-periphery relations in the area of control and audits; third, revision of OLAF's legal framework, with the presentation of new legislative proposals."
"Mr Prodi provided further clarification of his undertakings when, in November 2003, he presented the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2004 to the European Parliament."
"In the meantime, the Commission has further discussed matters concerning this case with Parliament and its bodies and has expanded on its plans."
"One main forum for these discussions involved the Committee on Budgetary Control when the follow-up to the 2001 discharge was dealt with and when information was provided on the Commission reforms."
"However, the continuing concern of the Committee on Budgets as to the progress of the reform has been of considerable help, most recently at its meeting in early April this year."
"The Commission welcomed the efforts made by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, to help ensure better understanding of the causes for concern."
"The work undertaken by Mrs Avilés Perea, Mr Casaca, Mr Bösch and other members of the committee helped the Commission to implement suggestions that have improved our action."
"On 1 October 2003, with these proposals in mind, the Commission adopted the new Eurostat establishment plan."
"That plan was put into operation, as planned, on 1 November."
"On 21 January 2004, the Commission was informed of the action plan for Eurostat's activities in 2004, put in place at Mr Solbes' initiative."
"On 9 February 2004, the Commission adopted the communication providing a progress report on its financial and administrative reform, which includes a specific section on the measures that the President had presented on 18 November 2003, as well as proposals for two regulations amending the legal framework of OLAF."
"The Commission acknowledges the careful and thorough monitoring work undertaken by Parliament and its bodies in the discharge process, and in its other monitoring activities, with regard to the Eurostat case."
"It is grateful for the concern and commitment that the Committee on Budgetary Control continues to demonstrate in relation to the implementation of the Commission reform."
"Both are essential."
"With comprehensive modernisation of structures, systems, internal controls and management and personnel policy now in place, the Commission will continue to review actions taken and improvements made, so as to maximise the safeguards against any repetition of the practices detected in Eurostat or any similar conduct."
"We are being aided by the sustained and shared commitment of Parliament to that end and we are grateful for that support."
". Mr President, we are all very well aware that we are dealing with a task – the discharge of the budget – which, as stated in the Treaty, falls within the exclusive competence of Parliament."
"I would also like to point out that at the moment the jobs of thousands of officials in the Commission and other institutions are at stake, but this is also an opportunity to highlight the most significant events which have taken place in the field of financial management."
"I would also like to point out that the issue before us is financial management and not each of the specific issues arising from that management and, furthermore, any potential irregularities are dealt with by the various courts or judicial authorities."
"For all of these reasons, the report for which I have the honour of being rapporteur consists, as usual, of three important documents."
"On the one hand, the discharge of the accounts is submitted to this plenum and, secondly, what is proposed is that the management should be discharged, rather than postponed, accompanied by recommendations which make up a resolution covering very diverse aspects, some of which I will comment on very briefly."
"Firstly, we have the problem of shared management."
"In accordance with the Treaties, the Commission has exclusive responsibility for financial management, but it is also the case that eighty per cent of that financial management is in the hands of, or carried out with the crucially important cooperation of, the Member States or third States."
"It is therefore proposed that the Treaties be interpreted as granting and recognising the Commission’s primacy and pre-eminence in this area, in order to provide it with instruments which may require particular action on the part of the Member States."
"Furthermore, the report deals with the issues of Commission reform."
"This concerns substantial reform in the field of financial management which involves its decentralisation and the allocation of responsibility to the Directors-General which is reviewed every year in the annual statement of activities."
"This mechanism has been updated over the years and this report suggests further improvements."
"Within the reform of the Commission, the issue of Eurostat is raised."
"We have just heard a statement from the Commission and unfortunately this issue is not closed. Instead, it is in the hands of the judicial authorities, which could raise issues of political responsibility in the future, and we must therefore remain vigilant."
"It is also the case, however, that Eurostat has also served as an incentive for certain important reforms undertaken by the Commission, including detecting some of the defects which existed, such as the relationship between the Directors-General and the Commissioners, which has been considerably enhanced in the Commission’s third progress report and in relation to which we must expect further substantial improvements."
"Within the context of this general reform of the Commission, we are also seeing a reform of accounting procedures, an important reform which must reconcile a dual system of budgetary management based on both cash-based and accrual-based accounting."
"We believe that the general approach which is being applied and proposed to be satisfactory."
"We must wait until 2005."
"Improvements have been made, such as the invoice register or the contractors’ database."
"The report also addresses problems of coordination between the various control structures and, fundamentally, the establishment, within the Directorates-General, of the relationship between the internal audit service and the Commissioners."
"The internal audit service is the responsibility of the Presidency and it is proposed that it remain with the Presidency."
"It is also proposed to link, to some extent, the Internal Audit Capabilities with the Internal Audit Service."
"Furthermore, it suggests a separation of the functions of the budget and those of budgetary control."
"With regard to the various policies that are analysed, in the field of own resources a more direct connection is proposed which reduces the tension that exists between net contributors and the other countries."
"The existence of a tax, the existence of a direct link between the European citizens and the Commission and the European institutions would promote awareness of the European Union and would reduce that tension between what some people give and what others receive."
"In the field of agriculture, a critical view is taken of the prefinancing of exports, which represents free financing, and, with regard to the Structural Funds, underutilisation, which is the result of the Member States’ overestimations in their calculations is criticised."
"With regard to external measures, it is requested that external audits are undertaken on the basis of objective criteria and that food safety and aid not be subsumed into the framework of a general development programme."
"Finally, in relation to administrative expenditure, the report addresses the problems of invalidity pensions and sick leave."
"I would also like to thank Bent Adamsen and Marianella Martínez, who have helped me, and the Executive Commission and the Court of Auditors for their cooperation."
"Mr President, I drafted the report on the discharge for the European Development Fund."
"In our discussions on this in the committee, we had a broad consensus on our analysis of the development of the European Development Fund, and also on our decisions regarding the report."
"I have also enjoyed very constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Court of Auditors, and I should like to thank the institutions for that."
"Looking at the Court of Auditors’ Statement of Assurance on the European Development Fund, we can say that the expenditure has been approved, but only with reservations, as the Court of Auditors is not prepared to give the green light with regard to direct budgetary support, which in 2002 constituted approximately a quarter of aid."
"This is important because, according to all plans, more and more aid will in future be given in the form of direct budgetary support."
"If these funds are used correctly and if we are to be given the opportunity of examining whether or not they are being used correctly, there must be a sea change in the quality of budgetary control and monitoring in the beneficiary ACP States."
"A great deal of work remains to be done in this regard by the Commission before we can be given proper accounts for this."
"This is a key factor in the future auditing of the European Development Fund."
"The Court of Auditors is also very critical regarding the annual declaration of the Director-General of the competent Directorate-General."
"The Court of Auditors does not believe that he was in a position to make this declaration on the basis of the information at his disposal."
"The Commission should take this criticism on board, and my judgment is that it is very serious."
"It indicates that the control system is still not working properly."
"When we asked the Commission for actual reports evaluating various projects in various ACP States, it took a very long time to procure these reports."
"This confirms much of what we feared during this work, namely that Headquarters in Brussels has an inadequate overview of the work in the Delegations."
"If it does not have the reports and cannot give them to us, even though they are on the lists, it is hard to imagine that there is proper monitoring in place."
"We are of the opinion that this is something that the Committee on Budgetary Control must continue to examine and look at next year."
"As a whole, then, we recommend granting discharge in respect of the European Development Fund."
"I should also like to say a few words about the other reports, which have also largely caused more controversy than mine in this debate, chiefly the reports by Mr van Hulten and Mrs Stauner."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and I shall not be voting in favour of granting discharge to the Council or the Committee of the Regions and, in our opinion, the votes on discharge for these two institutions should have been postponed."
"The main issue with the Council is its attitude and unwillingness to cooperate with Parliament."
"The Council was sent a schedule, a questionnaire, which it is in effect refusing to answer."
"Such requests for answers to questions are in fact fully in line with the Financial Regulation in force."
"In reply, the Council refers to a kind of gentlemen’s agreement from the 1970s, which is completely obsolete."
"In reply, the Council of Ministers deigned to give answers to certain selected questions to certain selected Members; this is in no way binding and is secretive."
"I think that this runs counter to the spirit of this discharge process as a whole, which should be open and transparent."
"Nor can we vote in favour of discharge in respect of the Committee of the Regions."
"As much as a year ago, the whistle was blown on very serious cases of maladministration in the Committee of the Regions, especially regarding travel expenses and a great many other points."
"It is quite evident that the Committee of the Regions still has not taken this in hand in earnest: quite the reverse."
"The committee still rejects several of the main conclusions from OLAF’s investigation."
"As OLAF had expected, it has failed to put into operation the disciplinary procedures that it should have instituted."
"It is quite clear that the Financial Controller who blew the whistle on the maladministration has been badly treated and has not received the apology he was due, as his actions were fully in line with his duties."
"Concerning the report by Mr van Hulten, we are of the opinion that this is a very good piece of work."
"It is of high quality, thorough and very specific."
"On the subject of Parliament itself, it is time to push for the abolition of the Strasbourg sittings."
"There is no excuse from the point of view of budgetary control for spending nearly EUR 200 million extra per year commuting between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Now is the time, before the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, to put forward this point of view, and we have the opportunity to do so tomorrow."
"The matter of reimbursement to MEPs will be an issue in these elections whether we like it or not, but Parliament only has itself to blame."
"There is no way of justifying to the man in the street the various systems of reimbursement we have and the fact that it is we who have granted ourselves them."
"Instead, we must bring in a new system of reimbursement and salaries that is justifiable and transparent."
"For this reason, together with Mr Blak of the GUE/NGL Group, I have tabled a number of amendments intended to clean up the system of privileges."
"This relates in particular to our belief that travel expenses should be reimbursed on the basis of the actual costs incurred rather than the distance travelled."
"We are also of the opinion that the existing system for taxi fares should be revised."
"Parliament has free cars at its disposal, and thus there is no reason to also have a system for reimbursing taxi fares; we can pay these ourselves out of our subsistence allowance."
"We have also put forward a number of proposals intended to tighten up the system for obtaining the daily subsistence allowance so that it is more closely linked to the meetings we actually attend."
"Finally, I wish to comment on the Eurostat affair, and also on the Commission statement, even if the Commission seems to be leaving."
"I think that the proof is overwhelming, as the whistle was blown on the maladministration within Eurostat long before the Commission chose to act."
"The whistle was blown by Parliament and the internal audit service, but the Commission was too slow to act."
"This is a matter of political responsibility."
"At the start of the Commission’s term of office, its President emphasised that the Commission should require individual Commissioners to accept political responsibility, and now, when it finds itself in a situation where it should have done so, it is saying it is not necessary."
"This is a great disappointment given the aspirations the Commission had when it took office."
"In our opinion, this is not good enough."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must now make the following point with regard to the agenda. The Commission's statement on Croatia is due to start at 6 p.m."
"I propose that I call the two speakers at the top of the list as well – which means that we will overrun slightly – in the hope, and with the request, that these Members will be brief so that we can then proceed according to the agenda and deal with Croatia."
"The timetabling has been extremely tight recently and we are having to improvise a great deal."
"I would ask for the indulgence of the three Commissioners who are now present so that we can overrun slightly and take the two speakers on the list."
"Then we will pause for Croatia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the following comments to make on my report concerning discharge for the other institutions. As Mr Sjöstedt has already pointed out, the Council has indeed largely withdrawn from control and cooperation with Parliament, in contrast to the other institutions."
"We cannot accept this situation."
"It also cannot be justified on historical grounds or in terms of a 'gentlemen's agreement’."
"That is why we have called, in my report, for a response no later than 1 July 2004 to the outstanding questions contained in our questionnaire."
"The increases in remuneration resulting from the system of 'weightings' which the Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are granting to themselves must be condemned."
"Whereas the Commission was sensible enough, in this case at least, to vote in favour of suspending this illegal practice for its Members from 1 January 2003, the Court of Justice has reintroduced these increases in remuneration retrospectively on the basis of an internal administrative ruling."
"This cannot be regarded as a ruling in its judicial capacity, which means that these payments are still illegal."
"This gross violation of basic rule-of-law principles is especially regrettable when it is committed by the supreme guardian of European law, namely the European Court of Justice."
"The Court of Justice should set an example and be particularly scrupulous in the conduct of its internal affairs."
"The same applies to the provision whereby Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors can use official cars for their private purposes to a quite excessive degree."
"However, as the Court of Justice and – in its wake – the Court of Auditors, unfortunately, have failed to come into line, we are calling for any transfer of funds to the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors to be suspended until these practices have ceased."
"Only under these circumstances can I genuinely uphold my recommendation that discharge be granted to these two institutions."
"Nor will I conceal the fact that once again, as has already been mentioned, problems have arisen with financial management and staffing at the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"However, I believe that both institutions have demonstrated to the committee that they are on the right track, and that to some extent, they are still trying to cope with longstanding problems."
"I believe, however, that discharge can be granted in these cases."
"I would like to make a positive comment about Mr Mulder's report concerning the agencies."
"We now have twelve agencies."
"That is a great many and as we all know, the number is likely to increase further in line with political objectives."
"However, I believe that as long as we are successful in avoiding duplication of work and setting appropriate priorities, the efficiency of these agencies will be guaranteed to a greater extent than is the case with the Commission, which is a mammoth bureaucracy."
"The heads of the eleven agencies are highly qualified and have demonstrated their responsibility for their particular agency."
"I would like to pay tribute to that."
"I really cannot say the same of the Members of the Commission, and the agencies make a refreshing change in this respect."
"After the Eurostat scandal, the dismissal of the Chief Accountant and the discovery of a completely inadequate accounting system deployed by this Commission to manage – or should I say mismanage – a budget of some EUR 100 billion, I will not be voting in favour of discharge for the Commission."
"Commissioner Fischler's comments a few moments ago about Eurostat also did not tell us anything we did not already know."
"I would like to find out from the Commissioner responsible why this Commission statement has just been delivered by the Agriculture Commissioner – have you concluded that Eurostat is an agricultural problem as well, or was there some other reason for this?"
"I am sure you will be able to enlighten us."
"Combating fraud must of course continue to be a priority."
"Mr Bayona's report contains a number of points on this issue."
"In my view, the Commission should proceed very cautiously when amending the OLAF Regulation."
"In paragraph 90 of our esteemed colleague Mr Bayona's report, we have therefore clarified a number of points to ensure that OLAF can operate independently in future too, that it can focus on internal investigations, and that the rights of persons affected are protected."
". Mr President, since I am leaving Parliament this is my last speech and I would like to take this occasion to thank everyone who has helped me here over the past five years, in particular my own staff, my assistants and the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on the result that we are hopefully going to deliver tomorrow, which would be a positive discharge for the European Parliament."
"The cooperation has been excellent and the Secretary-General, together with all his staff, has done a very good job of running the Parliament over the last five years in the face of mounting challenges, not least of which is enlargement."
"The criticism contained in my report is not aimed at Parliament's staff or the Secretary-General."
"My criticism is aimed at us, the politicians, who give political direction to Parliament."
"In 1999, I was elected in the Netherlands with a very low turnout of just 29%."
"The main reason why people did not go and vote in the European elections was that they did not have faith in the EU institutions."
"This is bad in itself, but it is also a great danger to European integration because if people do not have faith in the institutions it is very unlikely that they will support further steps in European integration."
"My mission for the last five years has been to try to reform the institutions to make them more legitimate and credible in the eyes of our citizens."
"We have come a long way, in particular with regard to the European Commission."
"Here I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Schreyer and her colleagues who have done a great job over the last five years, again in the face of very difficult challenges."
"Parliament has made progress."
"People who say that this institution is just a 'gravy train' are wrong."
"We have made excellent progress in modernising the institution, in modernising the administration and even the rules governing Members."
"But two big eyesores remain."
"One is our system of expenses, which is still not based on the actual costs incurred."
"This system is indefensible to the outside world."
"No matter how big the differences in salary between MEPs from different countries, and no matter how unfair that is – especially when the new Member States come in – we cannot continue to justify this system."
"The vote tomorrow will be an opportunity for this House to show that we are in touch with the real world, that we are prepared to put our own House in order and to clean up our act."
"The second question concerns Strasbourg."
"This is a beautiful Assembly and an even more beautiful city, but we should not meet here for only four days per week."
"The Commission and the Council are based in Brussels."
"If we are to be a credible democratic assembly, defending the interests of the citizens of Europe, then we should be where the other powerful institutions are – with the Council and the Commission."
"It was natural to come to Strasbourg when this Parliament was still a part-time Parliament, when the memories of the Second World War were still fresh and we needed a symbol of reconciliation."
"But today Europe's citizens are not looking for signs of reconciliation between France and Germany."
"I do not believe that anyone doubts those two countries get on together – perhaps a little too well at times!"
"The citizens are looking for efficient, modern institutions that are capable of managing European integration and the policies we have agreed together."
"Without a doubt, the time is right for a move to Brussels."
"Clearly we must find a purpose for Strasbourg."
"It has been built on European institutions and we must give them something in return."
"We have suggested the idea of the first European university."
"The buildings would be perfect for that."
"Another suggestion is to let the European Council meet here rather than in Brussels."
"These are the key issues that we need to address."
"I hope that tomorrow we will also give President Cox a mandate to go to the Intergovernmental Conference and say that we need to change the Treaty in this respect."
"We need to give Parliament the right to decide its own seat."
"Today a number of MEPs held a press conference organised by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform."
"We signed a reform pledge which commits the signatories to the reform of our expenses system and to work for a single seat for Parliament in Brussels."
"I hope that when we vote tomorrow we will all sign this pledge by voting for the amendments that have been tabled by a number of Groups."
"I am grateful to them for having done so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Before we discuss the two Commissioners' statements on Croatia in line with the agenda, I have a motion from President Pat Cox to read out."
"He pointed out on Monday that the inclusion of additional items on Wednesday's agenda could have an impact on the time available for Question Time."
"Parliament has now included additional items, namely statements on the situation in the Middle East and a debate about the vote of non-confidence, on the agenda."
"Under these circumstances, and having spoken with the Council, I propose that in agreement with the groups, we cancel tomorrow's Question Time with questions to the Council."
"In other words, the agenda would now continue with the debate about Croatia."
"Question Time with questions to the Commission would then take place at 6.30 p.m."
"– It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to welcome the diplomatic delegation from Croatia, headed by the Croatian Foreign Minister, which is seated in the public gallery."
"– The next item is the European Commission's Opinion on the application of Croatia for membership of the European Union."
". Mr President, I am delighted to be here today with my friend and colleague Commissioner Verheugen to present the Commission's on the possibility of opening accession negotiations with Croatia."
"The Commission is also publishing today its first European partnership with Croatia, which sets out priorities for both the short term and the medium term."
"In politics we very often overuse the word 'historic', but this is indeed a historic day for Croatia and this is an occasion which I know gives both Commissioner Verheugen and myself considerable personal pleasure."
"Croatia is the first of the Western Balkan countries to get to this stage, although I know that – perfectly understandably – Croatia would prefer a rather different description."
"Geography, as I have often said in the past in Zagreb, is not destiny."
"It is not a surprise that Croatia has reached this stage well ahead of any of its neighbours."
"Had it not been for the legacy of war, it might well have got to this stage on the road to membership a great deal earlier."
"Croatia applied for membership in February 2003 and the Council asked us to prepare our opinion in April of that year, so it has taken us a year of hard work."
"I do not apologise, however, for the time that we have needed."
"Assessing a country's readiness for candidate status is one of the most important institutional duties that the Commission undertakes."
"I do not want to keep honourable Members in suspense, so let me tell you straight away that the College has decided today to recommend to the Council that accession negotiations be started with Croatia in due course."
"I think the applause is deserved, and if the occasion was less salubrious we could have managed a standing, rather than a crouching ovation!"
"Commission Verheugen and I would like to set out a little of the thinking behind the Commission's decision, and I am sure you will agree that it is important for us to say rather more clearly why we have arrived at this extremely welcome conclusion."
"From the very beginning, it became clear that the most important areas for consideration were the political criteria set out in Copenhagen in 1993."
"There are a number of considerations which we had to bear in mind and I will touch on the main ones."
"The Croatian judiciary is – unhappily – poorly trained and organised and a huge backlog of cases is waiting to be considered."
"However, the independence of the judiciary is not in question."
"Croatia has a lot of work to do in improving the quality of judicial decision-making but it has – and we are convinced of this – a strategy for doing so and it now needs to implement that strategy."
"Second, Croatia's relations with its neighbours have not been entirely smooth recently."
"There have been difficult border disputes with Slovenia, as well as disputes over fishing rights in the Adriatic which were not helped by unilateral action by Croatia last year."
"However, since the election last December, the Croatian Government has shown a willingness to resolve these disputes in a sensible way based on mutual understanding."
"Third, there is the question of minority rights."
"This is extremely important to the Parliament; it is extremely important to all of us as Europeans."
"It is important that Croatia implements properly its legislation on minority rights."
"The OSCE has also reported to us that more needs to be done to ensure that Serbian refugees currently living in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia are able to return to their homes."
"However, the present government has concluded an agreement with the Croatian Serb leader, Mr Pupovac, designed to achieve that effect."
"There is still much to be done, however, but progress is being made: we welcome that and we are assured that it will continue."
"Perhaps the most difficult issue, as it is throughout the region, has been the question of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia – ICTY."
"Our position is straightforward and it is well known: in line with regular conclusions of the European Council, we require that all the countries of the Western Balkans cooperate fully with the tribunal as a non-negotiable condition for progress down the Stabilisation and Association Process."
"We rely for our assessment on the opinion of the tribunal itself."
"Until recently, Croatia's record was far from perfect – though I recognise that efforts were being made."
"However, in recent months, cooperation has been greatly improved."
"It is particularly worthy of note that two groups of indictments involving eight people, both Croats and Bosnian Croats, were dealt with speedily and without fuss by the Croatian Government."
"All eight were transferred to The Hague within a week or so of their indictments."
"There remains the question of former General Ante Gotovina."
"He has been indicted for very serious crimes and remains at large."
"Commissioner Verheugen and I consulted the chief prosecutor of the tribunal and she gave both of us very clear advice."
"She concluded that Croatia was fully complying with the tribunal, and saw no likelihood of that situation changing."
"As far as the Gotovina case was concerned, she indicated that the Croatian Government was doing all it could to help locate him and turn him over to The Hague."
"We asked the referee, the referee gave us her decision and I do not believe that it is for us to try to second-guess her."
"So, both our criteria have been met in full and the way is now clear for a positive assessment on this crucial issue."
"I must just add one thing: as we say in the , it is extremely important that Croatia continues to cooperate fully with the tribunal and that, in particular, the Croatians demonstrate very clearly that they are doing everything they can to locate and apprehend the remaining indictee."
"It is a matter for the Irish presidency to choose the date for the Council's consideration of our ;"
"I know that Member States will be watching this question very closely between now and then."
"I repeat that this moment gives me considerable pleasure."
"I would like to congratulate all those with whom we have worked over the past few years, and who have laid the foundations for this decision."
"I would like to congratulate the present government on what it has done, and I hope this moment will be one for celebration in Croatia."
"With that I will hand you over to my colleague Commissioner Verheugen, who will indicate to the Parliament some of the other parts of the and give you some indication of the next steps."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my immense pleasure and gratification that the great ideal of European unity has once again exerted its powerful appeal."
"Yet again, we see that it is the prospect of European integration and membership of the European Union that is the most powerful force driving forward the process of political and economic reform in a country which, until recently, was being torn apart by war, civil war and violence."
"My friend and colleague Chris Patten has already spoken about the political criteria."
"I would like to add a few words about the other, equally important, accession criteria."
"First of all, there is the issue of Croatia's economic performance. The question is whether the country meets the requirements of a market economy as we expect it to do and whether it has the capacity to cope with competitive pressure within the internal market."
"The findings of our analyses are very clear and very gratifying: Croatia is already better placed than most of the countries joining on 1 May at the time when their accession negotiations opened."
"Croatia can already be regarded as a functioning market economy, and provided that the policies of economic reform are continued, it should be able to cope with competitive pressure within the internal market in the medium term."
"The Croatian economy is already very strongly intermeshed with the economy of the European Union and is clearly outperforming the economies of Bulgaria and Romania, for example, whose accession is envisaged for 2007."
"From the economic perspective, we therefore see no problems or risks arising if accession negotiations are opened with Croatia."
"As regards the extremely difficult criterion concerning progress in adoption and implementation of the Community : by their very nature, my comments can only be a prospective assessment."
"After all, adoption of the is the subject of the negotiations, not the prerequisite for their commencement."
"Nonetheless, our prospective assessment for Croatia is very positive, and we believe that Croatia will be able to undertake the necessary legislative alignment in all chapters of the within the medium termwhile at the same time strengthening the structures that are necessary for its genuine and effective implementation."
"Here, Croatia will rely on our help, and it goes without saying that the Commission is prepared to grant Croatia the same support and advice that it has provided over the last few years to the countries which are due to accede on 1 May."
"Here too, then, our assessment is positive."
"As regards the next steps, as Mr Patten has already said, it is a matter for the Council to decide whether and when the accession negotiations will open."
"Before these negotiations can formally begin, a comprehensive screening exercise needs to be undertaken. This entails a full review of the entire and the extent to which it has been adopted and implemented in Croatia, so that we know exactly what needs to be covered in the negotiations."
"In other words, this is a normal procedure which is likely to take some time."
"Only then can the negotiations on the various chapters begin."
"A tailor-made pre-accession strategy will also have to be developed for Croatia, and the Commission is already dealing with this."
"As regards timing, my advice would be that it is premature to talk about timetables at this stage: we should not take the second step before the first."
"The pace of the process will depend on Croatia's capacity and determination to achieve real progress, both during the preparation and in the negotiations themselves."
"The Commission will assess progress fairly and objectively and will measure the progress of the negotiations on this basis."
"I believe that the Commission's recommendation sends an important and powerful signal not only to Croatia but to the entire region."
"It shows the other countries in the region which, for a variety of reasons, still have a long way to go before they come close to fulfilling the criteria, that intensive efforts pay off and that the European Union responds appropriately to the efforts of a country wishing to join the EU, and recognises that country's achievements."
"Many thanks, Commissioner Verheugen, for providing such a precise analysis for the benefit of the delegation from Croatia."
"In line with the system, I have now noted down four requests to speak."
"I draw your attention to Rule 38, which states that after a statement by the Commission, Members ‘may put brief and concise questions’."
"Please note that in this instance, ‘concise’ means one minute."
"– Mr President, my congratulations to Commissioner Patten, Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Zuzul, who has worked hard over the last several months to make up the large amount of ground lost by Croatia."
"My question is a very simple one, Mr Patten: do you think that Great Britain will take steps to cooperate more effectively with the Hague tribunal by using its troops stationed in Bosnia?"
"It is in fact now clear that its argument that Croatia was not ready to become a member of the European Union is no longer valid since Mrs Del Ponte has given you and Mr Verheugen assurances that Croatia is cooperating fully with the Hague tribunal."
"Can we also expect the United Kingdom to call for the setting up of an international tribunal for Chechnya so that it can further demonstrate its desire to strengthen international justice?"
"Mr President, I welcome the prospect of Croatia's accession, not only in itself, but also, as Commissioner Verheugen said, as a practical demonstration of the EU's commitment to the eventual accession of other Balkan countries."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has received assurances from Croatia that it will help other countries in the region qualify for EU membership."
"I note in Commissioner Patten's report on the assessment by Carla Del Ponte that Croatia is complying in full with ICTY and doing all it can to find General Gotovina."
"Until recently we could not be sure that such efforts were genuinely being made."
"Is it the understanding of the Commissioner that the UK and the Netherlands will now ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement?"
"The UK Minister for Europe has now declared himself convinced of the efforts to find General Gotovina."
"Previously this was not the case and he pointed out, for instance, that General Gotovina's lawyer knew how to find him, but nobody else did."
"This is very important, because if we do not carry on the search for General Gotovina, how can we push for the capture of Radavan Karadzic and General Mladic?"
"– Mr President, as rapporteur for the report on the relevant recommendation to the Council, I am well satisfied today by the positive opinion of the committee on the accession of Croatia to the European Union."
"My question, Commissioner, is not difficult, but I understand the difficulty which you have in giving a specific reply."
"Will there, in your opinion, be some timetable up to the final stage of the accession of Croatia?"
"I also have a question for Mr Verheugen: does he believe in the light of his experience that, by the time Romania and Bulgaria join in 2007, Croatia will be ready with these countries to become a member of the European Union?"
". Mr President, perhaps I could answer the first two of those questions, since the third was put directly to my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, and in the light of his experience in dealing so successfully with enlargement I can refer that to him – although I will have a go if he likes!"
"In response to Mr Dupuis, I say with all modesty – and it perhaps reflects the failures of my political career – that is a good 12 years since I have been able to say 'speaking on behalf of the British Government'."
"So my ability to respond on behalf of Her Majesty's administration in London is somewhat limited."
"I am sure that the United Kingdom Government will, as ever, take close note of what the honourable Member has said and I am sure – this also relates to the point that Baroness Ludford made – that both the government in the United Kingdom and the government in the Netherlands will want to reflect on the issue of ratification in view of the comments of the chief prosecutor at The Hague."
"I had noticed what the British Minister of State, Denis McShane, my old school mate, said yesterday in the region."
"He felt himself able to announce that we were going to make this very positive decision today, so we welcome his support."
"I would like to respond to what the honourable Member said about regional cooperation."
"In the last year there have been one or two difficulties, for example the dispute with Slovenia, which we regret and which we hope can now be resolved."
"It has, however, been a consistent feature of the way that governments have behaved over the last few years."
"Both Mr Racan's government and the present government have played an extremely positive role in working to resolve the problems in the region."
"I would like to pay a personal tribute to the former Foreign Minister, Mr Picula, who did a great deal to work constructively with the region, and I know that his successor will not mind me doing this."
"I am sure Mr Zuzul will follow that lead and I know that he and the Prime Minister have already taken steps which have encouraged others in the region to regard Croatia as an extremely cooperative partner."
"My colleague Commissioner Verheugen may wish to add to what I have to say on the question of the timetable, but in my experience from watching him deal with enlargement over the last few years, the timetable depends above all on the efforts made by the states concerned."
"If I may offer one word of advice to the Croatian government it is that it should concentrate its energies, as it has done in the last few years, on substance rather than process."
"It should concentrate on getting on with making changes which will still be required, rather than focusing its energies on asking about dates and speculating about dates."
"Mr President, as there is so little time, two very short questions."
"First, the reservation of the British and Dutch Governments up to now has already been referred to."
"I know how convincing Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen can be, so I assume that the people in The Hague and in London also listen to them."
"May I assume for the time being that negotiations with Croatia will not start as long as the Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not been ratified?"
"To be certain, I would like to put this question to the Commission."
"Second, I am pleased that the chief prosecutor, Mrs Del Ponte, is positive now, but it seems to me important that she also remains so in the future."
"Is the Commission willing to recommend that this very specific tribunal, the chief prosecutor herself, continues to be involved in the future with monitoring Croatia's cooperation with this tribunal?"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to say how delighted I am that this day has arrived."
"As Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South-East Europe, and on behalf of all those who have no opportunity to speak today, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two Commissioners."
"I think we should all be more than satisfied by Mr Patten's and Mr Verheugen's statements, including the factual information they have supplied. They have amply justified why Croatia can now be granted accession candidate status."
"My question is this, and it has already been asked several times: what opportunities do the Commission and, indeed, this Parliament have to persuade the Council that it should grant this candidate status swiftly so that negotiations can be opened soon?"
"I endorse the points made by Mr Lagendijk."
"Can we do anything to prevent the failure so far to sign the Stability Pact from being viewed as an impediment to the opening of negotiations?"
"This is an important issue, and we would very much appreciate a response from one of the Commissioners."
"Once again, my warmest thanks and my congratulations on today's momentous decision."
". Mr President, on the question of cooperation with the Tribunal, I would confirm again that the judgment on whether Croatia is cooperating fully in this regard can only be made by the Tribunal itself."
"We are not in a position to make a judgment from our own knowledge and experience, and as Mr Patten has just said, we have agreed that the International Criminal Tribunal will be the referee on this issue and we do have a clear picture at present."
"Should this clear picture change in future as a result of statements by the Tribunal, this would impact on the process that we are initiating with Croatia today."
"That is understood, and that is why I reiterate that this cooperation with the Tribunal must be viewed as satisfactory not only on one occasion but of course on an ongoing basis."
"On Mrs Pack's question, all I can say is that to my knowledge, the European Council plans to deal with this issue in June."
"However, that is a matter for the Irish Presidency."
"The Commission will not intervene in any way."
"We have timed the presentation of our report so that the Council has enough time to prepare itself before reaching a decision at the European Council meeting in June."
"In my experience, the European Council is always grateful for guidance and advice from the European Parliament."
"That is not meant at all ironically."
"Such guidance from the European Parliament would undoubtedly be helpful."
"Mr President, as Co-Chairman of the Social Affairs Section of the Stability Pact for the countries of South-Eastern Europe, I am naturally delighted about the fact that Croatia has prospects of accession."
"I have always been surprised, especially with regard to the social-economic aspects, that Romania and Bulgaria would be able to enter in 2007 and Croatia, that is further on socially and economically than both these countries, not."
"I have two concrete questions."
"First, the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Office for the Western Balkan countries is supposed to have become operational in March."
"My question is: has that now finally happened?"
"Europe has been promising to do a number of things for so long now, but it usually takes a very long time."
"My second question concerns the regional coordination centre for social policy for the Balkans."
"That was also supposed to be set up somewhere this year."
"My question is: where will this be, when will this happen, etc?"
"Mr President, first of all, I too would like to voice my very great pleasure at the Commission's Communication, the prior deliberations, and the positive decision."
"Above all, I would like to express my thanks to the two Commissioners who are here today."
"I believe, and I say this also in my capacity as Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee – Slovenia being Croatia's immediate neighbour – that we have taken a major step forward, and it is a positive step."
"I have one specific question: are any efforts being made by the European Commission to assist the two countries of Slovenia and Croatia to resolve their border issue in the Piran Bay so that a solution can be reached here as swiftly as possible in a European spirit?"
"Let me make one further comment in conclusion, which refers back to Commissioner Verheugen's statements: we have duly noted that the Council is grateful for guidance."
"As Parliament, we often wish that the Council would show greater receptiveness to the House's guidance."
"However, this comment is directed at the Council itself, not at you."
". The TAIEX operation has been up and running for about six months, and a seminar for the countries in the region was held last autumn."
"It is an extremely important part of the strategy we have been developing since the Thessaloniki European Council."
"We have worked with both Croatia and Slovenia to try to facilitate the settlement of their disagreements."
"Clearly, this is principally a matter for them, but we stand ready to use our good offices where these might be helpful."
"This is something that both Commissioner Verheugen and I have already been involved in."
"In my experience, parliaments always want to be taken even more seriously than they are, and sometimes even more seriously than they deserve."
"That was at least true of a parliament of which I was once a Member."
"However, this Parliament in particular deserves to be treated very seriously, not least as its mandate draws to a close."
"That concludes the item."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0071/2004)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Given that disparities between the arrangements applicable in the different Member States lead to imbalances and expose the Member States, which have set specific time limits on concessions, to competitive pressures which are hardly bearable in an asymmetric market, with the risk of jeopardising part of the process of liberalisation of the electricity sector, will the Commission indicate whether corrective measures are being considered?"
"Given that the deadline set by some provinces in Italy for takeover bids is very soon (2005), will the Commission state whether it considers that efforts should be made to achieve an overall harmonisation of arrangements?"
". Mr Ebner, the Directives establishing the internal market in electricity include general principles and lay down minimum legal provisions."
"Nevertheless, the Member States are free to apply these Directives in the manner they consider most appropriate to satisfying national conditions and needs, and also to establish stricter minimum rules provided that they conform to Community rules and, in particular, the principles of the Treaty."
"In other words, we are leaving a margin for subsidiarity in order to adapt and apply the Directives in the most appropriate way in line with the reality and diversity of the various Member States."
"The Commission considers it essential to guarantee a common level of true openness of the electricity markets of the various States and under equal conditions."
"Within this context, following the adoption of Directive 96/92/EC, that is, the first Directive on electricity, the Commission published an annual comparative evaluation report in which it examined the application of the internal market in gas and electricity in all the States of the Union."
"These reports demonstrated a significant difference between the true levels of openness of the market."
"This led the Commission to propose a second package of legislative measures to complete the internal market in electricity and to prevent the tensions and distortions which were arising and these measures include Directive 2003/54/EC and Regulation 1228/2003, which Parliament and the Council adopted last June and which will enter into force in July 2004."
"The new legislation lays down common minimum rules on market openness which are much higher both in quantitative terms, that is to say, the minimum level of openness of the market, and in qualitative terms: legal separation, regulated access for third countries etc."
"With regard to the quantitative measures, two stages are proposed: a first stage, July 2004, when the consumer market other than homes has to be opened up to competition, and in July 2007, 100% of the market."
"In any event, this will result in a reduction of the current asymmetries between the various European Union markets, and will make it possible to achieve what has been the aim since the first Directive: to integrate the European area into a single electricity and gas market, doing away with the borders that remain today and preventing something we do not want: 15 markets, or 25 markets from 1 May, in electricity and gas."
"This is not our aim."
"Our aim is to create a European market, an integrated single market in electricity and gas."
"Commissioner de Palacio, first of all my thanks for the information provided."
"Could the Commission, though, let us know how this control of the application of these minimum standards takes place and to what extent counter-measures are being adopted where these minimum standards are not being observed?"
". Guaranteeing minimum standards depends on the transposition of Directives, and now also the Regulation, on the part of the various States of the Union, which is carefully analysed by the Commission in order to ascertain whether they are complied with and whether that transposition is carried out in such a way that those minimum standards are applied."
"In any event, we are going to continue carrying out periodic analyses of the true picture of the implementation of the measures adopted and naturally – I repeat – if any Member State fails to implement the Directives and Regulations properly and does not put them into practice appropriately, Mr Ebner, I have no doubt that we will bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg, as we did in certain cases in which there was a delay, for example, in implementing the gas Directive or, simply, a transposition not complying with the content of the Directive."
"In both cases we referred the matter to the Court of Justice and we resolved them amicably with the States in question without the need for an arduous procedure."
"I can tell you that we will naturally use all means available to us to ensure that the markets are indeed opened up to competition but also that they are integrated into a European market."
"Commissioner, I wish to ask, what is your assessment of the integration of the Iberian electricity market, given that it has recently experienced some setbacks and that the agreement entering into force will only be provisional?"
"Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the integration of the Iberian electricity market, which is, when all is said and done, our closest market?"
". I hope that, although some months late, this integration can be carried out."
"Integrating the Iberian market is a very ambitious task."
"There is also a merging of certain bodies and, furthermore, I believe that recently a certain well-known person has been appointed or selected, who is going to do an excellent job of his new responsibilities in relation to development, specifically on the Portuguese side, as the former Portuguese Minister for the Economy is well aware, and I hope that it will soon be a reality."
"Furthermore, I hope that this will serve to facilitate not just an integrated Iberian market, but also the incorporation of that market into the European market as a whole."
"In this regard, we have already talked about other chapters, both the infrastructures for interconnecting the Iberian Peninsula with the rest of the Continent via France, which are needed, and also the regulation we have adopted, the application of which I hope will facilitate trade."
"The voluntary agreements which have been implemented are functioning in a very positive way and are facilitating exchanges in the electricity sector to an enormous degree."
"Our new goal is gas, which is the issue we are currently working on in Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"Furthermore, I am glad to see this Iberian brotherliness in relation to the electricity market."
"This is always good news for Europe."
"The European Multistakeholder Forum on CSR will release its Final Report and Recommendations for Action in late June."
"Can the Commission indicate the timetable following this report, when a response from the European Commission to move forward with these recommendations can be expected, and what form the response will take?"
"Additionally, when may the European Parliament expect formal reception of both the Forum report and the Commission's response thereto?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the final high-level meeting of the European Union Multistakeholder Forum on corporate social responsibility will be held on 29 June 2004, when it will approve its final report on its work and on its conclusions and submit it to the European Commission."
"The Forum's report is expected to contain three main sections."
"A confirmation of the principles agreed at international and European level, an analysis of the factors which hamper and the factors which contribute to the success of corporate social responsibility and a series of recommendations on corporate social responsibility for the attention of the members of the Forum or the institutions of the European Union and other agencies."
"The report will be based on the results of discussions and the knowledge acquired from a series of round table events held between January 2003 and March 2004 in order to analyse some 50 multilateral case studies."
"As stated in the Commission communication on corporate social responsibility in June 2002 and in the interim review of the social political agenda in March 2003, the Commission will evaluate the results of the Forum and will issue a new communication a few months after the submission of the Forum's report."
"The European Parliament has been involved in the Multistakeholder Forum procedure since the outset, with the MEP Richard Howitt acting as observer."
"Consequently, he will be invited to the high-level meeting on 29 June and will receive a copy of the Forum's report as soon as it has been approved and submitted to the Commission."
"The new communication on corporate social responsibility will be addressed to the institutions of the European Union."
"I therefore expect the dialogue on this matter to continue and to bear fruit."
"I understand it must be difficult for the Commission to give more precise answers in these final months."
"However, I want to make it clear that to many Members of this Parliament, across many different committees – I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation – this piece of work on corporate social responsibility is extremely important."
"We would like to see a clear timetable emerging in June, and not postponement to some vague point in the future."
"I am very pleased that the Commissioner responsible for development has come in at this point as I wish to ask which Commission department – Social Affairs or other – will continue to lead in this area, and how coordination will continue within the Commission, because this issue cuts across many different departments there."
"I would also like to ensure that a range of parliamentary committees are also involved in the follow-up."
"This is an issue of extreme importance to Members of this Parliament and, if we are re-elected, we will keep pushing it forward."
". First of all, with the Forum, the Commission wagered on the willingness and ability of the various sides to cooperate in a constructive manner and to develop a joint approach to European corporate social responsibility and, of course, the Commission will endeavour to make the maximum possible use of the results of the Forum's discussions and report."
"It is very positive that all the agencies invited to take part in the Forum accepted the invitation and that significant progress has been made and that everyone has agreed, as you said, for the process to continue."
"Of course, the Commission sees the Forum not as an advisory committee or as an opportunity for friendly professional discussion, but as a challenging experiment and as an excellent opportunity for the various interested parties to develop a joint approach to this issue."
"The Forum's objective is to give credibility to this entire process."
"The Commission is therefore waiting for the specific results and, moreover, for a roadmap to be drawn up with the action which needs to be taken not only by the European Commission, but also by the members of the Forum themselves, either alone or jointly with others. A study is due to be submitted in about October 2004."
"Following on from the question about the timetable, I should like to make a comment."
"Commissioner, you mentioned quite correctly that it has been helpful to have a representative from Parliament and how glad you were that Mr Howitt could be there."
"I am glad that Mr Howitt was there for some of the time because he was rapporteur for the Green Paper."
"However, I hope that you were also glad that I was there for some of the time as rapporteur on the White Paper."
"The intention is that I will be the parliamentary representative on 19 June, as an observer, to which I look forward."
"I believe that formal invitations will only be sent on 17 May, which is after Parliament has risen."
"It would be helpful if the invitations could be officially sent earlier."
"It would also be helpful – and perhaps the Commissioner could confirm this – if the invitations were accompanied by a draft of the proposals that will be discussed in June."
"I am sure that those who attend – and not just the observers – would wish to have as much notice as possible of the proposals for discussion rather than just find out what they are on the day they arrive."
". We shall try to comply with the requests for invitations and draft proposals."
"The Canadian group Bombardier has recently announced its intention to close seven of its European production plants: those at Amadora (Portugal), Derby Pride Park, Doncaster and Wakefield (UK), Ammendorf (Germany), Kalmar (Sweden) and Pratteln (Switzerland)."
"Such closures are part of the company's restructuring plan, which involves the dismissal over the next two years of 6 600 workers in various parts of the world, though principally (86% of the total) in Europe."
"In Portugal, closure of the Bombardier factory in Amadora will put nearly 400 people out of work and will also affect jobs at, and the economic viability of, various related companies."
"At a time when Europe is preparing to launch vital railway projects, strategic intervention is called for in order to ensure that Bombardier and other, similar companies continue to operate in EU countries, thereby safeguarding jobs and furthering technological development."
"What action is the Commission proposing to take in this area?"
"Is the Commission not concerned at the serious implications which closure of the Bombardier plant in Portugal will have?"
". First of all I should like to say that the Commission wishes to express its deepest concern about the consequences which the factory closures announced by Bombardier will have on job losses."
"I must tell you that the vice-president of the company sent me a letter informing the Commission of its restructuring plans."
"In the reply which I sent a short while ago, I express our acute concern and repeat the basic principles which we consider are of fundamental importance in managing restructuring."
"Restructuring can have serious repercussions on the social fabric of any region, especially in those regions in which there is already little potential for job creation."
"The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it is using all its powers in this sector."
"These powers are, first, the legislative measures which exist."
"We have various directives which seek to guarantee that the workers are fully involved in the decision-making procedure in the event of restructuring."
"The directive on collective redundancies, the directive on European works councils and the more recent directive on informing and consulting workers constitute the legal framework for protecting workers' rights and safeguarding equivalent conditions."
"Secondly, there are the Structural Funds, which provide important economic support for economic and social change in areas with structural difficulties."
"They support the adaptation and modernisation of education, training and employment policies and systems, mainly with the objective of increasing the adaptability and employability of workers."
"Furthermore, in 2002, the Commission requested the opinion of the social partners on a text entitled ‘Anticipating and managing change – a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring’."
"The document in question advocated an approach to corporate restructuring which balanced the interests of businesses facing changes with the interests of workers in danger of losing their jobs."
"The Commission accepted with satisfaction the joint text submitted to it by the social partners in October 2003."
"Restructuring is also included as a key topic in the joint programme of work approved by the social partners in November 2002."
"The social partners' text is based on experience gleaned from certain case studies on modern restructuring conditions relating to issues of vial importance to successful change management."
"We need to make use of these guidelines in order to respond better to the challenges which we face in this particular sector."
"They include: the need for changes to be explained and for the reasons for them to be stated, the importance of maintaining and developing workers' skills, the importance of complementarity and cooperation between the various factors when restructuring affects an entire region, the particular situation of small- and medium-sized enterprises and the practical aspects of managing restructuring, which include the importance of investigating all possible alternative solutions in order to avoid redundancies."
"I should like at this point to inform you that the Commission started consultations with the social partners today on how the European works councils established by Community directive about ten years ago can respond more effectively to the challenges of a changing economic and social environment."
"Finally, we must not forget our important work on corporate social responsibility and the European Observatory for Industrial Change."
"I honestly hope that, in the case of the restructuring which concerns us today, every effort has been made to restrict the social repercussions in the area."
"Commissioner, I am sorry to say that you have taken refuge in broader issues to the extent that you have almost glossed over the behaviour of the multinational as regards the industrial restructuring it is carrying out."
"You call it industrial restructuring, but I would call it a ‘process of industrial cannibalism’: in other words, bought companies as going concerns, absorbed them and then closed down some of these industrial units in various European countries – so far in six, including my own country, Portugal."
"I believe, however, that behaviour of this kind is unfair."
"The Commission and the European institutions must, of course, concern themselves with ensuring freedom of competition – this is one of our golden rules – but legislation must also be enacted against the behaviour of multinationals or companies undertaking restructuring operations that sometimes border on the criminal because they will destroy the extremely important industrial legacy of knowledge, skills and know-how, as happened at , in Portugal. Rules must also be drafted to protect against the practice of relocation itself."
"We are entering a new phase and the Commission must have an industrial policy and protect its industry, without indulging in protectionism."
". I am not trying to hide behind general observations, I simply have to say and to make clear that the Commission does not have the authority either to prevent or to postpone the closure which, from what I have understood, has already taken place."
"It is up to the social partners and other third parties to negotiate a possible re-examination of the closure with the company."
"Nonetheless, the Commission does hope that it will be possible to find an acceptable solution in order to moderate the significant impact on the regions affected by this restructuring."
"As for whether or not these actions by the company are legal, I have to say that the legislation of the European Union on these issues consists of directives which have been properly transposed into national legislation and specific national laws."
"It is therefore up to the national authorities, including the judicial authorities, to assess the extent to which national legislation has been duly and effectively applied."
"Mr President, I wish to start by providing some background to this case."
"In a memorandum dated 17 March, the executive board of informed the workers in its factory in Amadora, Portugal, about the restructuring of the group, in particular involving the termination of 5 680 positions in various European countries by the end of 2005."
"In Portugal, 400 direct jobs will be lost, not counting the indirect jobs that depend on ."
"The Portuguese Government has made every possible effort to keep this factory in the country and above all to ensure that jobs are not lost."
"Investment in the railways and in high-speed trains has been planned and yet the Amadora factory announced its definitive closure for the end of May, citing a lack of orders for rolling stock."
"The situation facing Portuguese workers is of enormous concern and the following questions, therefore, must be asked: is the rolling stock industry crucial to the European Union or not?"
"Is the Commission or is it not willing to adopt measures, specifically under its transport policy, which will not only save this sector, but also stimulate its development?"
"These measures must not only ensure that jobs are preserved in this sector but also prevent Europe from becoming dependent on other countries."
". Of course it is only logical that we should worry when factories or businesses close and when workers are laid off because, apart from the resultant social problems and unemployment, we also have problems of certain products going out of production, such as the specific products manufactured by this company, which are very important technologically and can, of course, also contribute to technological progress in the countries of Europe."
"I must also say that this specific company, Bombardier, has 35 factories in Europe, a large number of which are, of course, closing. It is closing seven factories, six in the European Union and one in Switzerland, but it nonetheless continues to maintain numerous factories in various areas and employ several thousand workers."
"That being so, no one can disagree with what you said earlier about our needing to try to make our industry competitive so that we can also maintain high standards of technology and keep employment at as high a level as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to say the following to you: there have been many relocations by multinationals in Portugal; unemployment today stands at alarming levels, with more than 500 000 people unemployed in a country whose economically active population is less than five million."
"I think that this demonstrates the seriousness of the situation."
"The case of in Portugal, however, formerly known as , constitutes a real economic and social crime because this is the only company that we have in the railway carriage manufacturing sector, which uses high technology that has been developed over the years, because its closure renders our country entirely dependent on other countries and because, with these workers becoming unemployed, we will lose knowledge that has been built up over decades."
"This is an economic and social crime."
"I wish to ask, Commissioner, how can the European Commission claim to be committed to combating poverty, to creating jobs, to building railways and to environmental, economic and social development, when it allows this to happen with a Canadian multinational in a country like Portugal, which is experiencing serious economic and social problems?"
". I think what you say demonstrates and underlines the need to make a success of the Lisbon objectives."
"We should make our economy more competitive because only if industries and businesses are competitive can we have better technology, produce all the products you mentioned previously (whether technologically advanced or not) and have more and better jobs in the European Union."
"I should like to point out to the House that significantly more jobs are being lost in four plants in the United Kingdom as a result of this closure than anywhere else."
"I am glad, therefore, to have the opportunity to ask some questions and to send our sympathies to those people involved."
"My questions are actually directed to Mr Bolkestein, and I hope you will allow him to answer them, as the issue is about how well the European rolling stock market is really operating and whether public procurement rules really are operating successfully ..."
"..."
"I hope in that case that Dimas will be able to pass my questions on."
"They are important and highly relevant to this discussion."
"In France, for example, there is not, according to my information, one single piece of rolling stock running on railways that is not manufactured in France, and yet in the United Kingdom a large number of rolling stock units are imported from across Europe."
"I do not mind that because the single market for rolling stock should be allowed to work."
"However, it is seems to me that the public procurement market is not working satisfactorily in the area of rolling stock."
"We should ask the Commission to look at this."
"We should also ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to ask your Observatory for Industrial Change to look at the whole scenario for employment in the railway rolling stock industry, as it is already doing, for example, in the automotive industry."
". Yes, I shall ask the Observatory to have a look at unemployment in the railway sector and the industries connected with it."
"Thank you very much, Mr Dimas."
"We have completed the half hour of urgent questions and we will now move on to the second part."
"The Commission has accepted just one question to Mrs Schreyer and then several to Mr Bolkestein."
"Mr Färm has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I have expressly put a question to Mrs Schreyer about the future financing of Info-Points and Carrefour offices."
"However, even though she has only one other question to answer, she does not want to have a debate on my question."
"I have contacted our services to ask them why."
"They tell me that they have been in touch with the Commission and the reason is that this is not the responsibility of Commissioner Schreyer but of Mr Prodi."
"The problem is that Mr Prodi never comes here to answer questions, so I will simply receive a written reply."
"I would really like to question what the Commission says about whose responsibility this is."
"The Info-Points problem is caused by the new Financial Regulation, which is the responsibility of Mrs Schreyer, and the solution will have to be found in the next budget, which is also the responsibility of Mrs Schreyer."
"Therefore, it seems to me that this is only a way of avoiding a sensitive debate."
"That is not acceptable, and I would ask the President of Parliament to look into this."
"I would be very happy if Mrs Schreyer would comment on this."
"We cannot open a debate on this matter now."
"The President has taken very good note and we will forward this communication to the Commission."
"You are aware that questions in Part III are not replied to orally but in writing."
"We shall return to the agenda, and I promise you that we have taken very good note, and Mrs Schreyer will reply to the next question."
"What general criteria does the Commission take into account when assessing the convertibility of pilot projects into preparatory actions and multi-annual programmes?"
"For those pilot schemes which have been entered in the budget for the two financial years 2003 and 2004, can the Commission confirm that it will submit to Parliament in the preliminary draft budget for 2005 an assessment of the results and follow-up envisaged for each of these pilot projects?"
". The criteria that the Commission takes into account for converting pilot projects into preparatory actions and then into multiannual programmes are essentially based on the evaluation of the results of the project or action, the response from the specialised sectors involved and the political will expressed by the budgetary and legislative authorities to pursue the action."
"A pilot project may start some three to five years before the possible adoption of a legal base, provided that the results of the pilot scheme are positive and that the preparatory action decided by the budgetary authority is successful."
"E-learning and Daphne are examples of this process."
"In 2001 the Commission shared with Parliament the idea of proposing a preparatory action to stimulate and accelerate integration of the use of information and communication technologies in education and training, in developing synergies amongst public and private stakeholders."
"The results of the preparatory action were positive with regard to the opportunity and convenience of sustained support for these innovative synergy projects, and the e-learning programme was born."
"The Daphne programme came into force in 2000, after the Commission had implemented pilot and preparatory actions in 1997, 1998 and 1999, in which year a legal base was proposed and adopted."
"Under Daphne, measures were funded to support non-governmental organisations and the voluntary sector active in combating violence against children, young persons and women."
"The European Parliament strongly supported both these programmes."
"As provided for in Article 49 of the financial regulation, the Commission will, when the preliminary draft budget for 2005 is published, also provide the budgetary authority with an assessment of the results of pilot schemes and preparatory actions entered in the budget for 2004."
"The same assessment was provided last year in the preliminary draft budget for 2004."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I understand the point you are making in terms of preparatory action, but I wondered whether you could comment on whether actual budgetary provision will be covered under the action taken in the 2005 budgets."
"Pilot schemes, as you say, are being carried out and I was interested not so much in assessments but in whether proper provision within the budgets for preparatory action will be included."
". The means for continuing the preparatory action on the pilot project, which had started, will be in the budget proposal."
"As you know, the Interinstitutional Agreement contains clear provisions as to how much can be made available for preparatory actions."
"We will leave a margin for this purpose in Category 3, so that when there are new preparatory actions as a first step for pilot projects, there will be the means and a margin available."
"In the last two years there were good preliminary discussions between the Commission and Parliament on ideas for preparatory actions and pilot projects."
"That exercise was successful and I hope that we can continue in this way."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer."
"At the Barcelona European Council in March 2002, the Commission was requested to carry out a study on the consequences of Basel II for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Because of problems with the invitation to tender, there were delays last year."
"The Commission gave an assurance in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the results would be submitted by the end of 2003."
"The results have still not been made known (March 2004)."
"Why have the results of the SME study not yet been officially made known?"
"Have they already been submitted to the Commission?"
"If so, why is the Commission holding off publication?"
"What are the results?"
"When will the proposal for a directive on Basel II be submitted?"
"What are the critical issues on which there is still no agreement on the Basel Committee?"
". As Parliament knows, the European Union process to review the capital requirements rules is taking place in parallel with the review of the international rules being carried out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision."
"As I recently told Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission continues to make good progress on this matter."
"It is intended to put forward a proposal for a directive to be adopted shortly after final agreement is reached in Basle by the middle of this year."
"Furthermore, in response to the request by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, the Commission commissioned an impact study and report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers."
"The final version of this report has now been made available to the Commission."
"Its conclusions are positive."
"The new risk-sensitive framework will be good for financial institutions, good for consumers and good for the economy as a whole, with a more efficient allocation of capital."
"The report also identifies some defined areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be further improved."
"That work is under way."
"Arrangements are also in hand for the report to be discussed with interested Members of Parliament very shortly."
"The key factor is that the report should be made available in good time to inform the European legislative process."
"That will be the case."
"The last part of Mr Karas' question concerns the issues on which there is still no agreement in the Basel Committee."
"As regards the Basel Agreement, only a few issues remain to be finalised by the middle of this year."
"These include the question of the treatment of undrawn credit card lines, recalibration in the light of the Madrid decision to move to an unexpected-loss-only approach and what is termed the 'stress loss given defaults' question."
"I am confident that those issues will be resolved by June."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive will be complete and stable."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, I cannot imagine that you feel very comfortable answering my question, for if I have understood you correctly over recent years, you yourself would probably have liked to see more dynamism and more professionalism in the preparation and implementation of the SME study."
"You are fobbing me off."
"You say that the findings of this study are available."
"In that case, why have we not received them?"
"You say that the report identifies some areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be amended."
"What are these amendments?"
"You say that we will receive the report in good time."
"However, today is officially Parliament's last sitting."
"It seems to me that omissions have been made here and I urge and request you to make the latest information and the findings of the study available to the market, the Council and Parliament as swiftly as possible."
"I am certainly not aware of any arrangements for interested Members to discuss the report with the Commission."
". The timetable I discussed with Parliament at various times will be adhered to."
"The Basel Committee expects to reach a conclusion by the middle of this year."
"Shortly thereafter the Commission will put forward a proposal for a directive, to be discussed under the system of codecision."
"The report by Pricewaterhouse Coopers has now been made available to the Commission and it will be brought to the notice of Parliament very shortly."
"It is indeed true that time for the present Parliament is short but I can do no more than tell Parliament that the results of that study will be brought to the attention of Parliament very shortly."
"I am afraid that Mr Karas and other Members of Parliament will have to take it as it is."
"I cannot work on the study any faster but I look forward to discussing these issues, if not before the parliamentary elections then after the summer, even though personally I would be more than happy to discuss with interested Members of Parliament, elections or no elections, the implications of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers study."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, I would also like to thank Mr Karas, because the Basel II agenda is naturally very important for us and the study by PricewaterhouseCoopers is an important basis for the amendments that we can still make to the Basel II rules."
"For us in this House, however, it is especially important to find out how the introduction of Basel II will impact on our small- and medium-sized businesses in particular and which tasks still have to be addressed by the finance ministers and others in order to ensure the successful introduction of Basel II."
"I think that here, the Commission should demonstrate, with some form of best-practice/benchmark impact analysis, how the successful introduction of Basel II can be guaranteed."
". As I said earlier in reply to a question from Mr Karas, the Pricewaterhouse Coopers study will be made available very shortly and its results are positive: it takes a positive view of the impact of the Basel agreement on small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"For example, there are discounts in the capital charges for lending to smaller entities."
"SME loans below a certain threshold – namely EUR 1 million – may be included in the retail portfolio, which has lower capital requirements."
"The results of the third impact study show that the new rules are good news for loans to SMEs."
"As far as venture capital is concerned, there is wide acceptance that such investments have a higher level of risk, which is why it is called risk capital."
"The capital requirements proposed in our third consultation paper reflect that higher level of risk."
"At the same time, we have been working with industry to see whether there are data that may suggest that for certain types of investment lower requirements may be justified."
"We have not yet finalised our proposals in this regard, but, overall, it is recognised in many circles that the results of the Basel exercise – as it is now known – are beneficial for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Bolkestein to go ahead with this initiative and that the work relating to the study and the proposed directive begin as soon as possible."
"We must remember that SMEs are the greatest providers of work in the European Union and, specifically in my region, Valencia, are the biggest employers."
"We believe that all measures aimed at enhancing the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union are necessary and we would therefore ask the Commission that this proposed directive – which, amongst other things, should deal with the tax differences between the Member States, with a view to harmonising them – clearly benefit small- and medium-sized businesses, which, I repeat, are the biggest employers in our European Union."
". I agree entirely with the statement that employment depends on the health of SMEs."
"The Commission will do its best to bring the proposed directive to the notice of Parliament as quickly as possible."
"Therefore, we shall do what the honourable Member has just asked."
"I would like to remind you that today is the last Question Time of this legislature, and, like you, I am very concerned to ensure that all questions can be replied to."
"I would therefore ask you, in general – I am not referring to anyone in particular – if possible, not to make statements, because if you refrain, all questions will be answered."
"Otherwise time will run out and four or five Members will not receive replies to their questions."
"Is the Commission willing to propose a directive which would require any organisation in the Union, private or public, to notify by e-mail or by letter every private individual whose personal data (such as name, social security number, driving licence number, bank or credit card numbers) may have fallen into the wrong hands?"
"Such a law took effect in California in July 2003, and it is reported that a US senator is introducing a federal bill modelled on the Californian law."
". The Commission has taken note of the relevant Californian law on the disclosure of breaches in security by businesses maintaining encrypted computerised data that contains personal information."
"On the basis of its current assessment, the Commission does not, for the time being, intend to propose a directive along the lines set out in the above-mentioned Californian law, since it has not been demonstrated that there is a need for European legislation on that issue to supplement Member States' legislation, in particular penal law."
"However, the Commission will follow closely the developments in this area as part of its policy to safeguard the free movement of personal data within the European Union and the protection of individuals' fundamental rights."
"Thank you for that reply, Commissioner."
"I am very pleased that at least you have taken note of the idea."
"I suggest that the Commission's reluctance to take any further steps and propose legislation will now encourage businesses across Europe that are rather slapdash about protecting private data, as they will now be able to say that there will not be any legislation to punish them so they can easily let this slip."
"I fear that our exchange in the Chamber now creates the need for legislation to stop lazy companies from letting private data fall into the wrong hands."
"Do you agree?"
". To expand on what I said a moment ago, I should like to add that the Commission does not consider it appropriate for the time being to proceed with legislation similar to the Californian law."
"There is no information suggesting that theft of unencrypted personal data stored in computer systems represents a serious problem for the proper functioning of the free flow of personal data in the internal market, or for the protection of such data."
"Before introducing new legislation which puts additional burdens on business, it is suggested that business itself should enhance security of personal data by using security systems such as encryption."
"So, while understanding the philosophy behind the question the Commission wants to be certain that it is absolutely necessary to pass this into legislation."
"We want to be careful with new laws; businesses complain of too much regulation."
"We all want to deregulate, so let us be careful in this area and only legislate where it is absolutely essential to do so, but not before."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I have a proposal to make, because I can see the problem the honourable Member brought to our attention."
"Could the matter of safeguarding a person’s privacy become part of the job description of the European Network and Information Security Agency which is now being set up, so that the agency would follow developments in the area and afterwards say whether legislation is needed or not?"
"It would be a professional authority that would do this at pan-European level."
"Could this be possible?"
". I would like to thank the honourable Member for his suggestion."
"If he agrees I shall discuss it with my colleagues, but certainly there is merit in asking that agency to come up with an opinion on this matter."
"In the recent ruling on the 'Gambelli' case, the European Court of Justice upheld the rights of EU gambling service providers to operate or provide cross-border services in other Member States."
"Indeed a number of Member States are, at the same time, attempting to restrict private gambling service providers while vigorously promoting participation in games of chance via monopolies or licensees of the State."
"Can the Commission confirm that the 'procurement of finances for public funds' cannot constitute a justification on the basis of which freedoms established by Article 43 and 49 of the Treaty can be restricted?"
"If the Commission does agree, can it indicate what initiatives it will take to remove unjustified restrictions on gambling service providers?"
". In response to the first question, the Commission notes that it is settled case law that the reduction of tax revenue is not one of the grounds listed in Article 46 of the Treaty."
"It does not constitute a matter of overriding general interest which may be relied upon to justify a restriction on the freedom of establishment, or the freedom to provide services."
"On the honourable Member's second question, the Commission has indeed received a number of complaints from gambling service operators, who contest the application of existing national restrictions to cross-border services."
"The Commission will analyse complaints in that area in view of recent rulings of the European Court of Justice."
"It will proceed with appropriate action in order to ensure that the principles provided by these rulings are respected."
"In addition, the Commission intends to launch a study this year to collect the information required to examine the need for and scope of a possible new internal market Community initiative in the field of gambling services."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner for a very positive reply."
"However, I should like to put a couple of other issues to him."
"Firstly, would he agree that it would be desirable for the proposed directive on the internal market for services to cover gambling in this way?"
"The issues raised by this judgment and by the complaints strike at the very heart of the issues and barriers that he is proposing to sweep away with his excellent proposal."
"The second issue – which he did not touch on – was the ability of governments to try and include public interest and consumer protection issues to prevent gambling operators from setting up in their jurisdiction while, at the same time, actively promoting their own state lotteries and gambling businesses."
"That seems to be entirely inconsistent and is also an issue that was covered by the Gambelli case."
"I would also be interested to have his view on that aspect."
". On the second question, I agree with Mr Harbour and in fact I proposed legal action in a case that concerned Denmark, so we see eye to eye on that matter."
"On the first question about gambling and the directive on services, this directive includes for gambling services an exemption to the country-of-origin principle that would no longer apply if a Community harmonisation instrument were in place."
"The Commission will assess whether it should present a proposal for harmonised EU-wide rules on gambling services on the basis of a report that it will put in hand this year."
"The directive also requires Member States to screen, through a process of mutual evaluation, barriers to cross-border establishment of service providers to ensure that authorisation requirements or licensing conditions are transparent and based on objective criteria, but it does not call into question the existence of state monopolies as such in this field."
"At its sitting of 20 November 2002 Parliament adopted a resolution on media concentration, in which it called on the Commission, among other things, to draw up a Green Paper by the end of 2003, assessing the development of new technology and new communications, the impact of mergers, alliances, and joint ventures in particular on the internal market and media pluralism, and the current legal position and future developments in both the Member States and the applicant countries."
"It also urged the Commission, within this parliamentary term, to consider what regulatory options might be used to safeguard freedom of expression and pluralism in the media and, in addition, to submit a proposal to enable the principle of media freedom to be established on a stronger basis in the Treaty."
"Why has the Commission done nothing to prevent media concentration, in spite of the calls from Parliament?"
". The questions that have been raised by Mr Paasilinna cannot be the subject of an initiative of the Commission based on the fundamental freedoms of the internal market, provided for in Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty, because the purpose of those provisions is to regulate situations with a cross-border element."
"They cannot be used to adjust purely internal situations within Member States."
"As mentioned, existing Community instruments foreseen by the Treaty have the aim of ensuring a certain equilibrium between economic operators."
"They may therefore directly affect the media, but as an economic activity."
"These instruments do not affect the media as an information conduit to citizens, or they do so only very indirectly."
"For example, the Merger Regulation assigns the task to the Commission to establish whether or not media concentrations with a Community dimension are compatible with the common market."
"The Merger Regulation thereby enables the Commission to ensure competitive medium markets and only indirectly to protect media pluralism."
"It should furthermore be recalled that the Commission supports the inclusion in the draft Constitutional Treaty of Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which establishes the principle of respect by the Union of the freedom and pluralism of the media."
"However, as we all know, that is not yet law."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I really have to say I am very unhappy with this old-fashioned reply, which is totally irrelevant to the age we live in."
"First of all, mobile communications are by their nature cross-border communications."
"Their content are products offered by different media companies and they therefore move along the borders of the European Union."
"This is the roaming policy."
"One cannot avoid the issue with answers like this."
"On the contrary, these companies are so big that they operate beyond Europe, offering content that is in a very limited number of hands."
"I could name such companies but the Commissioner might be able to think of some of them himself."
"This is a modern day threat, and it is not merely a matter of printed communications."
"What position are you going to take on this modern form of communications so that you might address the problem?"
". Mr Paasilinna is unhappy."
"In return may I say that I am also unhappy."
"However, the Commission cannot lift a finger if it does not conform with the Treaty, if its action is not based on the Treaty or if it is not supported by the Treaty."
"The Articles that I mentioned concern activities carried out under the economic aspects of the Treaty and not purveyors of information to citizens."
"Therefore while the plurality of the media is obviously an important subject, it is not covered by the current Treaty."
"If Mr Paasilinna wants to call that an old-fashioned approach, so be it."
"However, I cannot step beyond the bounds of the Treaty."
"Perhaps the Intergovernmental Conference will result in a new Treaty which offers more scope in this area than the present one."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein, for your excellent cooperation this evening and throughout the legislature."
"The Commission replied in writing to two oral questions relating to Cuba – the Havana Biennial (H-0733/03(1)) and the visit by Patriarch Bartholomeos (H-0045/04(2))."
"The answers given are unsatisfactory and contain statements which I find disrespectful."
"In reply to the first question the Commission states that it was incorrect to say the EU had withdrawn its funding for the Biennial, when this is not what I said."
"I referred to the assistance that was being provided, without specifying that this was financial assistance."
"More serious is the claim that it was misleading to say the EU had decided to freeze cultural relations with Cuba."
"The Commission's answer to the second question, concerning the visit by the Orthodox Patriarch, reiterates that there were no such EU sanctions – letting it be understood that it was Cuba that was the sanctioning power."
"Moreover, it also talks of the insults made by high representatives of the Cuban Government against European Heads of State on 26 July 2003."
"How would the Commission describe the cultural measures established by the European Council in respect of Cuba in response to the events of the past year?"
"Which European Heads of State were insulted on 26 July?"
". The Commission did not intend to be disrespectful in its replies to oral questions 733/03 and 45/04."
"Indeed, the honourable Member did not state that the EU had withdrawn funding for the Biennial; he quoted media reports which the Commission indicated were incorrect."
"As to the two new questions, firstly, the Council decided on 5 June 2003 to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events."
"This measure implies limiting the presence of Member States' representatives in cultural events taking place in Cuba and has to be seen as a symbolic gesture."
"It is not designed to reduce cultural activities in Cuba, or limit their funding."
"Member States with established cultural programmes continued their activities in Cuba."
"Only the Spanish Cultural Centre ceased to function in August 2003."
"This, however, was not a decision of the Spanish Government but of the Cuban authorities."
"Secondly, it would have been more correct to speak about insults towards heads of governments rather than heads of states."
"The Spanish Prime Minister was insulted in a speech by President Castro on 26 July and Prime Ministers Aznar and Berlusconi were insulted in a demonstration on 12 June led by the President and First Vice-President of Cuba and directed at the embassies of those countries."
"Insults were also addressed to them by President Castro the previous day, according to press reports."
"I would firstly like to thank Mr Nielson, because for the first time we have had a reasonable reply acknowledging that a series of measures were in fact adopted in the field of cultural cooperation, the first time I have received such a reply following three other questions, to which the reply was that such measures did not exist."
"I would therefore like to thank you for making things absolutely clear."
"I still believe that these measures restricting cultural relations are pernicious, but now we can return to the tone with which we have spoken over all these years."
"He has acknowledged that these measures exist."
"I believe they are absurd."
"I would just like to make one small point: when he says that it would have been more correct to say that Heads of Government had been insulted, it is not that it would have been more correct, but that it was absolutely incorrect to say that Heads of State had been insulted."
"And it is the Commission’s responsibility not to confuse a Head of State with a Head of Government."
"It is true that two Heads of Government were insulted."
"One of them has now been relieved of that position by the sovereign population of my country and he will therefore no longer be Head of Government when any insult is directed at him."
"Thank you, Mr Nielson, for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed over the last five years, including on the issue of relations with Cuba."
". I would like to stress again that it is not totally correct to talk about limiting cultural cooperation or limiting cultural activities."
"What has been decided relates to limiting the presence of Member States' representatives in cultural events in Cuba."
"So the non-participation in Cuba of the formal representatives from the different Member States and the Commission is not directly aimed at limiting cultural activities."
"– I agree with the comments made by Mr Martinez and I should like to take advantage of the debate about Cuba to raise a matter again and ask the Commissioner if the European Commission or the European Union in general intends to intervene, at long last, in order to put a stop to the embargo which the USA has imposed on Cuba for over forty years, an embargo which has caused and continues to cause immense damage to Cuba and its people."
"Please do not tell us that this has something to do with respect for human rights because we know that, if there is anyone who cannot talk about respect for human rights, it is the Americans themselves who, apart from what they are doing throughout the entire world, Iraq being a typical example, are also trampling over human rights in their own country with daily executions and keeping the five patriots whose only crime was to uncover terrorist action against Cuba and its leaders organised by the USA in unacceptable conditions."
"I therefore request an answer so that this saga can stop in which, more importantly, the European Union appears to assent to this sort of …."
"Before the Commissioner speaks, I would like to point out that this question is not supplementary to the previous one."
"It is an analysis of another issue relating to Cuba."
"In any event, you have asked your question, Mr Korakas, and please allow me, as President, to interpret the Rules of Procedure."
"The Commissioner will reply."
". I find this supplementary question totally unnecessary."
"The European decision against that embargo has been clear for many years."
"There is no new line whatsoever on that point, and there has never been any need for Europe to say anything new."
"We have had this line all along and the disagreement between Europe and the US stands, as has always been the case."
"– Mr Nielson, a public debate was held in Greece a very short time ago about possibly inviting Fidel Castro to Greece within the framework of the Olympic Games."
"Fidel Castro himself has stated that, were he to receive such an invitation from the Greek Government, he would accept it."
"I ask you, Commissioner, to tell me if, first, the European Commission would encourage the Greek Government to invite the President of Cuba to Athens during the Olympic Games and, secondly, if the European Commission sees such an invitation as a positive action."
". I do not intend to get involved in the issue of participation in the Olympic Games in Greece."
"I wonder, however, what discipline Mr Castro would be participating in!"
"I would request that we all respect the agenda because, as you are aware, we are running late and the interpreters are working overtime."
"We shall take the questions and the supplementary questions."
"I would ask the whole House to behave responsibly, please."
"Given EC concerns with how IMF programmes can conflict with the EC’s overall objective of poverty eradication, can the Commission clarify EC policy on linking disbursement of EC budget support to compliance with an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)?"
"In particular would the EC continue to disburse budget support if a country were off track solely on non-core elements of an IMF PRGF e.g. a condition to privatise a state body?"
"Would the EC continue to disburse budget support if a country were off track on an IMF PRGF programme where the EC judged the IMF’s programme to be overly restrictive and to prevent the country from maximising poverty reduction spending?’"
". In compliance with Articles 67 and 61(2) of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission only provides general budget support for poverty reduction in low-income ACP countries when the beneficiary country implements a macroeconomic reform programme that is supported by one of the major international donors."
"In practice, this requirement is usually linked to the existence of a national reform programme which is subject to support through the International Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility."
"The PRGF is designed to contribute to the reduction of poverty and the creation of economic growth."
"Such a country being 'on-track' with the IMF's conditions is generally considered as one of the general conditions for EC budget support."
"Disbursement of one annual 'fixed tranche' is usually preconditioned by a satisfactory periodic PRGF review of the ongoing reform programme."
"During such a review IMF staff examine whether agreed benchmarks and other performance criteria have been respected by the government over a given period of time."
"Since the Commission entrusts the periodic review of macroeconomic performance to the institution that is best equipped and holds a natural assignment to do so, it is important that close coordination between Commission services – especially the delegations – and IMF staff is ensured."
"In case of diverging opinions on particular issues related to this review, Commission services and IMF staff must enter into a technical dialogue to try to reach a common position – I say a technical dialogue, but politics is also involved, of course."
"Should the Commission maintain a position different from the IMF's, it may decide to disburse its budget support, despite the fact that the PRGF review may not be conclusive or that the country in other words goes 'off-track'."
"However, such a decision will only be taken in exceptional cases, for instance when the Commission is convinced that the IMF assessment is clearly too restrictive – or based on relatively minor elements of the reform programme – and that non-disbursement of budget support may jeopardise the government's poverty reduction efforts."
"In other words, despite linking part of its budget support disbursement directly to these PRGF reviews conducted by the IMF, the Commission takes its own case-by-case decision on whether to carry out a disbursement."
"A similar approach is followed in relation to Community assistance to countries in other regions where general budget support for poverty reduction is linked to the same type of PRGFs."
"In general, we are satisfied that this cooperation also includes the World Bank."
"We are not totally enslaved into this."
"It is a partnership and in recent years a more balanced, two-way, equal basis for these discussions has emerged."
"Today this partnership works."
"History has also proved that for the many formerly very badly managed economies in the Third World, a lot of progress has been achieved, despite the costs involved."
"I would have liked the Commissioner to be much more willing to disburse budgetary support to a country despite it not being on track as regards certain non-core elements of the IMF/PRGF and where IMF programmes are judged to be too restrictive."
"The Commission has expressed concern over recent years about the IMF's macro-economic framework for low income countries."
"From your answer, Commissioner, I did not get the impression that you were saying you would continue to disburse budgetary support."
"You seemed to say that it would only be in very exceptional circumstances."
"How exceptional would those circumstances have to be before you would continue to disburse budgetary support?"
". It is not possible to give a clear answer – it is a long story."
"There are cases in post-conflict situations where budget support is simply necessary – even if a country is not even discussing being on-track or off-track – simply because if we and other donors did not step in, everything would simply break down."
"That is one case."
"It is also a factor that the IMF and the World Bank have changed in recent years; not that we always agree on everything with them, but we are not discussing this in the context of the 1980s or early 1990s."
"The partnership we now have reflects a more poverty-oriented, more socially-responsible view compared to that held during those times."
"I would like to thank the honourable Member and the Commissioner, together with whom we make up this institutional dialogue during the final Question Time of this legislature."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 35 to 76 will be replied to in writing (3)."
"Mr President, it concerns two matters. It concerns a number of agencies that we have looked at and, in particular, it concerns the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao."
"I was extremely surprised when I read the Court of Auditors' report, because the Court of Auditors accuses this agency of having carried over far too much. On closer examination, it turned out that this was in connection with an SME programme that we here in Parliament had resolved on."
"It took some time to reach agreement with the Commission about where this programme should be implemented, but eventually it was decided to give it to the agency in Bilbao. That, of course, is no fault of the agency in Bilbao, but nevertheless the Court of Auditors made a very negative comment about this."
"You ask yourself sometimes: is that so?"
"It would nevertheless be good if the Court of Auditors did not only look at the first level, but also went into things a bit deeper. That is my opinion on this matter; apart from that there are no problems with the agencies that we are dealing with."
"There is always a problem with that and that is the problem that Member States always over-estimate how much they can get out of the Structural Funds. That leads to a budget that does not balance, and that leads at the end of the year to money that has not been spent."
"It would be good, of course, if we could do better than this in the future. This point should be organised better in the future than it is now, otherwise it means that we never learn anything from the past."
". – Mr President, the fact that the security situation in Kosovo continues to be precarious prompted the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to give particular attention to the deficiencies in the conduct of the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo, which the Court of Auditors has highlighted. These include the amount of cash held in reserve, the need to avoid making payments to unauthorised persons, and the need for better coordination between the Agency’s accounting officer and the competent directorate of the Commission."
"The Foreign Affairs Committee is well aware of the difficult circumstances under which the Agency does its work."
"Let me say by way of conclusion, though, that the amount spent by the EU on aid must be rationally proportionate to its political benefit. The discharge report offers an opportunity to make that point."
"Whilst giving the agency discharge for the year 2002, we do expect the extension of its remit to the management of EU aid in Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia to result in long-term improvements in efficiency and hence to the political stabilisation of the region."
". Mr President, Commissioner, speaking on behalf of the Home Affairs Committee, I note with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors has been able to establish with the proper certainty that the accounts for the financial year ending on 31 December 2002 are reliable, with the end result that it has been confirmed that our three agencies in this area have done their work properly and done an outstanding job for the European Union."
"As regards the criticisms levelled at the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, I would like to announce that I will, at midnight tonight, again have the opportunity to respond to these."
"It is my hope that we will, tomorrow, be able to adopt a directive for the Monitoring Centre in order thereby, jointly with it, to prevent and avoid many things."
"I am therefore happy to be able to make this announcement on behalf of my committee."
"Mr President, expecting Parliament to discharge the 2002 budget in the face of all the evidence of fraud, corruption and mismanagement endemic in the European Union is akin to our being asked to accept the Enron accounts as a true and correct record. The European Court of Auditors rejects the EU's accounts on an annual basis and has done so for the last nine years."
"There comes a time when we have to stop routinely nodding things through like clockwork monkeys in a tired charade of parliamentary scrutiny. The EU has no money of its own, but is spending taxpayers' money from all the Member States."
"We have a moral duty to those taxpayers to see that their money is spent wisely, not frittered away in a seemingly endless stream of abuses that line the pockets of unscrupulous civil servants and their cronies."
"I ask Members to set an example and vote against formal discharge."
"As for the Eurostat affair, it is high time that Mr Brüner, Director-General of OLAF, resigned for having instigated the arrest of the investigative journalist Hans-Martin Tillack on baseless grounds."
"The Ombudsman accused Mr Brüner of maladministration in November 2003, yet he has not had the grace to resign."
"Meanwhile, Messrs Franchet and Byk, accused of massive fraud, have been allowed the privilege of stating their case at length to OLAF."
"However, Hans-Martin Tillack – innocent until proven guilty – has still not been heard by OLAF. Mr Brüner should go!"
"The next item is the report (A5-0271/2004) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (COM(2004) 190 – C5-0162/2004 – 2004/0064(CNS))."
". Thank you very much Mr President, thank you very much Commissioner for your detailed explanation."
"We are all agreed that we have to combat terrorists, but that must not be allowed to become a licence for things that we ultimately cannot justify. I have to say to you, Commissioner, you have not convinced me this evening."
"First of all, you said that the transfer by the customs bureau is a matter of concern to you. At the moment the Commission, in recital 20 of the decision, refers to passing on to other government bodies, including foreign government bodies."
"A few days ago we heard for the first time that it is a matter of concern to you how this is organised. A few months ago you asked Parliament for an adequacy finding.Meanwhile, both Mr Bolkestein and yourself have informed us that there is no adequacy finding as yet in fact."
"This means that we are legalising something that we wanted to avoid all this time and that is the reason for asking Parliament now for a real agreement, that has the consent of Parliament. You say this is not necessary, because the legal basis that the Council has chosen is Directive 95/46/EC and this agreement would not change the content of the Directive."
"This is an agreement about which Mr Bolkestein says that many matters have still not been resolved. I have not mentioned the connection between this agreement and CAPS II, but the undertakings to that also state that this agreement will shortly also be linked to the new, advanced CAPS II system in the United States."
"Unfortunately, he has not kept this promise. Indeed it is much worse than that, the European Commission and the Council have deliberately tried to sidetrack Parliament."
"Under the Treaty, Parliament was required to give its consent, but you have chosen not to do that. That was also the reason why I argued the case in Parliament and got President Cox to recommend through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that an appeal be made on the grounds of Article 300, paragraph 6, of the Treaty to have this agreement tested by the European Court of Justice."
"That is the only way left to us to do something about this agreement and to adequately protect our citizens. At the moment they are not adequately protected."
"I agree with you that terrorism is appalling, but just to use all that as a licence to ride roughshod over our laws and give the Americans access to our data without legal protection, because the American Constitution and the Privacy Actdo not apply to European citizens, is going too far. I beg you therefore once again to withdraw this agreement and to come to Parliament with a real agreement."
"The next item is the report (A5-0230/2004) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the risks of violation, in the EU and especially in Italy, of freedom of expression and information (Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights)"
"The President has received a letter from Mr Ribeiro e Castro, expressing doubts as to whether this debate is permissible."
"I shall therefore give Mr Ribeiro e Castro the floor for two minutes in order that he may explain this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I tabled a motion of inadmissibility on this report, as regards issues that I had occasion to raise in committee."
"I also asked in committee, on the date of the debate, for a legal opinion to be issued by its secretariat, by Parliament’s legal services or by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market, on serious issues concerning the legality or otherwise of this report; issues that I raised and tabled at the time."
"I was under the impression that my request had been accepted but to date I have still not heard this opinion."
"In fact, the report makes some legal and factual observations that are inadmissible in Parliament."
"In particular, statements are made for which the Commission has never produced any proof, such as, for example, paragraph 50’s accusations about a Polish publishing company; comments on the composition of , which I admit are true but no evidence has been presented in paragraph 57(1); or paragraph 58(1), on the division of advertising revenue in Italy, about which I know nothing."
"Even more seriously, the report raises points of law that are completely inadmissible in Parliament because they would force us to discuss the laws of Member States and furthermore, the legislative powers of Member States and even the rulings of Member State courts."
"An example of this is the reference in paragraph 49 to a ruling of Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court on a legislative proposal introduced by the ."
"I am shocked: how can we possibly question the legislative process pursued in Germany’s , or determine the legality or otherwise of certain facts in light of Italian national law, or of Law 249/97, of the deliberations of the Italian national authorities or of the rulings of the Italian Constitutional Court?"
"These are all matters which I am not in a position to discuss for one simple reason: they do not fall within the sphere of Parliament’s competence and I would therefore ask that this report be deemed inadmissible or referred back to the Commission until a legal study in the true sense of the word is submitted on these issues, which are serious ones."
"– Mr President, despite appearances – that is, the almost 200 amendments I tabled in committee – I am actually not passionate about this debate at all; on the contrary, I find it somehow depressing, because right from the start the subject of the debate has not really been pluralism and freedom of information in Europe but simply an utterly ideological and specious attack. I find it depressing that a certain part of the Italian Left, blinded by their need to indict the Italian Prime Minister and thus the whole government – which, I am pleased to recall, was democratically elected by a majority – should concoct and consent to an inquisitorial report like this, devoted to the situation ‘especially in Italy’, as it says in the title, with the sole purpose of discrediting Italy itself."
"I will not accept the unscrupulousness or the pretence at morality of this kind of constant anti-Italian crusade, which is also supported by certain Members of the European Left who first attracted attention for having insulted Italy during the Italian Presidency and then attracted even more attention for falsifying signatures in the attendance register, as suspected by their own party colleagues."
"I will not accept moral lessons from those who have still not had the courage to condemn the Commission properly for the disgraceful Eurostat scandal."
"In conclusion, I should be pleased if this Italian and European Left could find the time and, especially, the courage to devote an equally detailed report to the conflict of interests of Mr Prodi, who is President of the European Commission in his spare moments and Ulivo leader in Italy full-time, and who, to further his political fight with Italy, has, despite our efforts, only succeeded in weakening and damaging the image of the European Commission itself."
"Mrs Angelilli, I think it is worth saying that there are no documented instances of any Member of this House, or of any observer, signing themselves in with a false signature. I owe it to the Members here present to say that."
"I heard Mrs Angelilli refer in her speech to certain Members, whose names she did not give, and she stated that these persons falsified signatures in the European Parliament register. I should like you, Mr President, to make her say to whom she was referring – their full names – and to ask her to provide evidence for the statement made in this Chamber."
"This is not acceptable."
"Mr Cox has already had occasion to state quite clearly what the position is and what the rights are of the Members who work in this Chamber."
"This cannot be accepted, Mr President."
"I call on Mrs Angelilli to name names."
"Mr President, let me speak in English to spare the interpreters."
"I can only be dismayed and also somewhat amused by the very odd performance in this House by my honourable colleagues in the Berlusconi group."
"There are very serious parliamentarians – grave to the point of sounding ponderous – like Mr Podestà, who is also Vice-President of this House, suddenly behaving as if they have gone into a rhetorical spasm, with Mr Tajani transformed into the Incredible Hulk and many other respected Members of this House beating their chests like King Kong."
"What has happened?"
"Obviously, the gentleman in Rome has issued some very precise orders to his group, which he is quite entitled to do, and the order is to stop the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak at any cost."
"Filibustering is more than understandable and more than justified, even as some acceptable form of obstructionism; but I wonder whether we have not gone too far, beyond the rules and traditions of this House, with these continuous attempts – and we will see many more before tomorrow, because rumours circulate very fast in this House – to postpone consideration of this report and take it off the agenda. Let me say that I disapprove of this behaviour – not because I belong to a nostalgic Communist group or am a Bolshevik, as I have been called, but because I still respect this House, its traditions, its standards and its rules."
"Mr President, I believe the debate we are holding is not exclusively an Italian one."
"I am from Valencia and, historically, the Valencians have close relations with the Italians – in fact two Valencians (Calixtus III and Rodrigo Borgia) were Popes in Italy during the Renaissance – but I believe that this is a fundamental and European issue and I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and the rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, for their speeches."
"I believe that, by means of subsidiarity and also the Commission's initiative, we should regulate and act on the structuring of pluralism, the media and, above all, neutrality."
"I am not talking now about , which is a flagrant case, but about , Valencian television, which is a textbook example of how a public television station is used for party political purposes. Neutrality means not being party political, nor being subject to governmental use, to manipulation of information or being used by a political party in the case of a public media organisation, as in the case of Valencian television."
"In this regard, we admire models of public television such as the BBC and we would like, as Valencians, both and , our Valencian television, to be neutral, and, in the future, to have a neutral television company which gives space to all parties. A party such as mine, which is the third biggest municipal political force in our country, has no presence on our television and I believe this issue is fundamental to European integration."

"– Mr President, I have just become aware of a communication from the services of the sitting which tells Members – and it appears that it was announced at midnight last night – that, in relation to the Boogerd-Quaak report, on freedom of expression and information, in view of the large number of requests for roll-call votes, separate votes and split votes, the vote cannot take place today."
"You will remember, Mr President, that you and I spoke on the telephone last night at 10.30 p.m., and that I expressed my concern about all the incidents surrounding this case."
"I really must say now that this decision, taken by I do not know whom – and we should know this and whether you support this decision – goes against all the practices followed in this House."
"My group, and I do not know about the others, has not been consulted and I would request that at the beginning of the vote at 12 noon, we vote on including this item once again in the vote."
"As we spoke yesterday evening, the House was in session discussing the Boogerd-Quaak report."
"I was informed yesterday evening, as you have been informed, so there is no policy of exclusion in the question of the information loop."
"I was informed yesterday evening that given the volume of votes and the number of requests that have been received for split votes, roll-call votes etc., the sessional services, between the time the debate finished last night and midday today are simply incapable of producing the required documentation for the vote on the report."
"This is not an issue of my political preferences."
"I have here a 51-page list containing details on the vote."
"This issue of procedure is not a question of expressing some kind of political preference."
"I am prepared to take procedural points at midday today but I am informed that it is physically impossible for the services to prepare the vote on this by midday."
"Other procedural questions have been put to me."
"I will deal with those at midday and make rulings."
"However, it is my own belief, notwithstanding various requests, that the House will have to deal with and vote on this matter."
"How and when is rather complicated."
"I will work my way through this with the services in the course of this morning to see what we can do."
"Mr President, this report is not about Silvio Berlusconi."
"It is a report about media concentration in all countries of the European Union, which is a matter of legitimate public concern."
"It is a report that has been drawn up in accordance with the normal procedures of our House and, in recognition of the electoral sensitivities of some, the rapporteur has offered to delete Mr Berlusconi's name from the report."
"Nonetheless, some colleagues are seeking to delay, to filibuster, to disrupt our procedures in order to evade the harsh searchlight of an unpalatable truth."
"My group calls on the PPE-DE Group to withdraw these wrecking amendments; and if it will not, we are ready to vote on all 350 of them."
"We ask you to allow the House to decide whether to proceed and we welcome your assurance that we will have a chance to vote on this report."
"I seem to be blessed with many friends in many Groups in this House!"
"I should like to thank my many friends for the amount of unsolicited advice that they have showered upon me in the past 24 hours on this issue!"
"Let me assure you that I will act as is appropriate."
"We will need to deal with this at midday today."
"In fact, I had not intended to rise, but I must respond to what Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, has just said."
"He urges our group to withdraw its amendments."
"Let me point out to Mr Watson that there are 338 amendments, 157 of which have been tabled by our group."
"That means that 181 come from other groups."
"It is unfair to imply that our group is solely responsible for all the amendments."
"A great many Members are unsatisfied with this report, and that is why 181 amendments have been tabled by other groups."
"I would urge you, Mr President, to ensure that speakers do not only refer to amendments from our group."
"Mr Poettering, you can be as sophisticated as you like – the disgraceful conduct of your group colleagues in committee was not the disgraceful conduct of other Members from other groups."
"If you had been there and heard the reports, you could have witnessed this for yourself. That is my first point."
"Secondly, Mr President, Mr Watson has asked a straightforward question, and we want an answer."
"We want to vote at 12 noon today on when we will vote on the report."
"Our group is prepared to vote on this report at 2 p.m., at 3 p.m., at 5 p.m. or tonight at midnight, whenever."
"What is going on here is scandalous!"
"The degree of collusion between two groups, aimed at evading a vote on an important report, is a scandal in itself, and this House should respond honourably to this scandalous state of affairs by taking a vote this afternoon or tonight, whenever, in order to demonstrate that these shenanigans will not prevent us from voting on this important report."
"We want to vote at 12 noon, so that a vote on this report is held today."
"I will deal with the voting issue at midday."
"Thank you for your advice."
"I refuse to be instrumentalised in this House during my Presidency."
"I want to work systematically through the volume of amendments to see if I can find ways to reduce them."
"I need time this morning to do so."
"I will come back and, with as much good faith as I can, report to you with regard to the possibilities."
"In the meantime I refuse to be bounced by anyone into prematurely announcing when we will vote."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would not dream of trying to bounce you into making an announcement, but I am offering advice."
"You will find that, certainly in the committee, when the two Groups called for a separate vote in order to keep the amendments on the plenary agenda, they did not vote against a single one."
"Although the Rules of Procedure allow any Group to call for a separate vote on any amendment, we ought to try and flush out which ones they wish to vote truly separately on."
"I do not think we will find that there is a single negative vote in the two Groups against the amendments."
"There is a high degree of collusion, as others have said, in terms of one Group calling for split votes on all the others' amendments and that Group calling for split votes on all their colleagues' amendments."
"It is an attempt to subvert democracy and filibuster to a degree which is ludicrous."
"Mr President, you have your responsibilities, but you and your services are in danger of being subverted."
"Thank you for your concern for me and the services."
"Let me be quite clear."
"The House debated this issue until midnight last night."
"I have been in the House since 7 a.m. this morning trying to prepare the way for today."
"You may rest assured that this will get my undivided attention, but between 7 a.m. and now it has not been possible to resolve some of the questions that you have put to me."
"Between now and midday it may or may not be possible."
"At midday I will report to the House on such progress, if I can make any in the meantime."
"Mr President, I have an extremely urgent and quite unusual question for you."
"I have invited Mr Akhmed Zakayev, who, as you know, is Deputy Prime Minister in the Maskhadov Government, to a meeting to be held this evening and tomorrow morning right here."
"Akhmed Zakayev, as you also know, lives in London, and I have asked the French Minister of Foreign Affairs to speed up the visa procedure."
"Mr Zakayev has been refused a visa on the grounds that he is facing a request for extradition."
"Now, you know that the extradition request has already been rejected by the Danish and British Governments and that Mr Zakayev was also recently able to visit the Bundestag in Germany."
"I am therefore asking you please to intercede with Mr Michel Barnier, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, so that Mr Zakayev and his son, who acts as interpreter for him, can attend the meetings this evening or tomorrow morning, or both, which would be ideal."
"I would ask you to supply my office with the relevant details and we will try to follow it up for you."
"Mr President, I wanted to rise in connection with the previous item."
"I also have no wish to pass comment on the debates and events that took place in committee, nor on what apparently happened here last night."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to voice my support for your endeavours and simply make the point that we want a vote to be held on this issue."
"We believe this topic is far too important to vanish from the agenda, however that might happen."
"– Mr President, I wish to say something on a different matter."
"Thank you for giving me the floor."
"On Mondays, when the session is resumed, we generally have half an hour on the topical issues which each member wishes to raise."
"This Monday, for procedural reasons, you pushed this half hour to the end of Monday's sitting, to midnight and perhaps even later."
"However, this debate and this possibility are given to members so that they can, as I said, raise topical issues which, at one o'clock in the morning, are no longer topical."
"I should like to protest because I had requested the floor on a very serious issue."
"You did not allow me to speak and you did not accept the debate."
"I would ask that this sort of procedure not be repeated."
"I am very conscious that Members use this new possibility of intervening at the beginning of sittings wisely and well."
"As you saw when you were here and wishing to speak at the beginning of the part-session this week, I found myself in a dilemma."
"We had an important exchange of views on another matter, so at 6 p.m. – one hour into our session – we had not yet started our debates on an evening when we had already extended the sitting to 11 p.m."
"I extend my apologies to those who wished to speak and had to do so either later in the day or in writing, but it was exceptional."
"I hope it is not something I will be obliged to repeat."
"Mr President, a few weeks ago in Parliament we voted on the Maat report on the welfare of animals during transport."
"The Irish presidency has proposed a compromise on this issue and the House needs to be aware that this compromise is completely unacceptable if the way Parliament voted is taken into account."
"I was not happy with the end result in the Maat report. people concerned about animal welfare felt that it did not go far enough."
"At the very least the Irish compromise should have taken into account the will of Parliament, particularly in relation to a number of crucial issues, for example the temperature of the vehicle in which animals are transported and the fact that it will not be mandatory to unload them temporarily at ports."
"The most important and crucial issue is that Parliament voted quite clearly for a maximum overall journey time for slaughter, which was also reflected in the declaration signed by over 400 Members of this House."
"The compromise proposed by the Irish presidency completely ignores the will of Parliament."
"Many animal welfare groups that are very concerned about this have contacted me."
"They feel that, if this Irish compromise goes through, it will be a retrograde step in relation to animal welfare."
"The Irish compromise should at least take into account the transport of animals for slaughter with a maximum overall journey time."
"– Mr President, I give such a reduction in journey time my wholehearted support. As far as I am concerned, eight hours must be the absolute maximum."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the prospects for unification of Cyprus before its accession to the European Union."
"I should like, in starting this debate, to quote UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, as he spoke to the Security Council at the end of last week. He said 'The plan is complex and delicately balanced."
"Inevitably, as in any negotiation, it is a compromise. The presentation of the contents of the plan to the public has not always been equally balanced.'"
"I am bound to say, in following the debate with great intensity I very much share the concerns expressed by the UN Secretary-General in that regard."
"I should also like to add a personal concern: we should note, in particular with regard to broadcasting in Cyprus, that there is an evident degree of manipulation of prime time slots; that there has been a deliberate exclusion of foreigners, such as Commissioner Verheugen – who will be the of our Cypriot colleagues in the next few weeks; and that this represents an unwholesome spectacle unworthy of a state that otherwise seeks to, and should, fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"I would greatly welcome it if those comments, as a modest suggestion of an alternative view, were to be broadcast in the place in question, despite the lack of balance there as regards broadcasting."
". Mr President, I am sure all Members, as well as the President, will be aware of the significance of this debate."
"I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Council and the presidency."
"Our discussion this morning comes just three days before a truly significant date for the people of the island of Cyprus."
"On 24 April they will vote in separate but simultaneous referenda on the text of the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem which has been presented recently by United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in an agreed negotiating framework."
"The European Union is deeply grateful to the Secretary-General, and in particular to his Special Adviser, Mr Alvaro de Soto, for their tireless efforts to bring about a settlement."
"They have worked closely with the parties and in collaboration with the governments of Greece and Turkey."
"They have created a unique and historic opportunity for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem."
"If the people of Cyprus vote 'Yes' in the two referenda on Saturday, a united Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May, along with nine other new Member States."
"The accession of a united Cyprus remains the strong preference – I emphasise the strong preference – of the European Union."
"Let me recall today the commitment, made by successive European Councils, that the Union is ready to accommodate the terms of the settlement in line with the principles on which our European Union is founded."
"The origins of the European Union are in the most terrible war in human history, which almost destroyed our continent."
"The Union was born of a deep desire to encourage European nations to work together for the betterment of all their peoples and to resolve their differences peacefully, without resort to conflict."
"Membership of the European Union has enabled nations and divided communities in Europe to bridge deep and bitter divisions between them."
"I am confident that, over time, this will be the case also for a united Cyprus within the European Union."
"The accession of ten new Member States in just nine days' time will formally end the tragic post-war divisions of the continent of Europe."
"There is now an opportunity to end yet another division in Europe."
"The decision on the Settlement Plan, presented by Secretary-General Annan, now rests ultimately with the people of Cyprus."
"The choice and the decision is theirs."
"They should be assured of the solidarity of the European Union as they contemplate, individually and collectively, a decision which will have a profound effect on their future and indeed on the future of their children and their children's children."
"As the people of Cyprus exercise their democratic rights, they will be fully aware of the historic nature of this decision and of the opportunities at hand for Cyprus, for its neighbours and, indeed, for the rest of Europe."
"They will have heard – as we have done – the words of Secretary-General Annan, that the plan 'is the only available and the only foreseeable route to the reunification of Cyprus'."
"The European Union and the wider international community stand ready to assist in the implementation of that settlement, both politically and economically."
"The commitment and the hope of the international community was evident at the high-level preparatory donors conference chaired by Commissioner Verheugen last week in Brussels."
"I was at that conference and successive speakers expressed their readiness, their wishes, their hopes and their desire to provide financial assistance for the implementation of this plan."
"A number of very significant and definite commitments have been made."
"Should the plan be approved, the European Commission has already earmarked significant funds for the economic development of Cyprus and for the betterment of the people of Cyprus."
"Many Member States, including Ireland, have stated that they will announce significant and specific funding in support of the implementation of the settlement at a full donors conference which we hope will take place in the autumn."
"The results of last week’s international conference have been welcomed in a significant statement issued by the President of the UN Security Council on 16 April."
"In noting that it is now for the Cypriots to take a historic decision concerning their future, the members of the Security Council gave the commitment that, should the plan be approved, they stand ready to take further actions as provided for in the plan, including the establishment of a new UN operation in support of its swift and full implementation by all parties."
"The members of the Security Council would also be committed to helping ensure that the parties fully meet their commitments under the settlement."
"The United Nations has been deeply involved with Cyprus for the past forty years."
"The UN Force in Cyprus was established in 1964 and is one of the longest running peacekeeping operations in the history of the UN."
"Member States, including my own country, have been proud to contribute military, police and civilian personnel to the force in the interests of all the people of Cyprus."
"The European Union has stayed the course with Cyprus."
"Now, on 24 April, the people of Cyprus will make their democratic choice – and it is their choice – on the settlement proposals before them."
"They have a unique and historic opportunity."
"The choice is theirs, and it is theirs alone."
"We wish the people of Cyprus well in making those choices."
"It is a difficult time."
"We understand that."
"We understand the history."
"We understand all the passion that goes into this, but the choice is theirs and theirs alone."
"We will respect whatever choice they make and hope that the decision is one that will allow for the peaceful integration of a united Cyprus into our Union on 1 May."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental principle underlying European unification is the common desire to work together and pursue policies which guarantee peaceful coexistence among the nations of Europe."
"That is the reason why we have united, and that is the reason why we are gathered here this morning."
"What we expect, first and foremost, from all our Member States, and what we expect above all from the countries which are due to join the European Union in less than ten days' time, is full endorsement of this basic principle of European unification as a peace project."
"That is what I expect from the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as well."
"Cyprus is the last country in Europe that is still divided."
"Cyprus is the last country in Europe whose capital is divided by a death strip with barbed wire and minefields."
"Never before, since this conflict started, have we been as close to achieving a solution as we are today."
"Centimetres separate us from our goal, and yet I must tell you that I now have very little hope that we will progress this last few centimetres."
"Let me explain why."
"The situation which has now arisen is as follows. To everyone's complete surprise, the Cypriot Government led by President Papadopoulos has said that it fundamentally rejects the United Nations peace plan and is urging the Greek Cypriot community to vote against it."
"From my perspective, this is a deeply depressing situation for two reasons."
"Firstly, when we changed our strategy on Cyprus in 1999 and, at the urgent request of the Cypriot Government, pledged to the Greek Cypriot Government that the solution to the Cyprus conflict would not be the precondition for the island's accession to the European Union, this was based on the clear understanding that we would do everything possible to facilitate Cyprus's accession, and, by the same token, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus would do everything in its power to achieve a settlement, and that under no circumstances would a settlement fail as a result of Greek Cypriot opposition."
"I have held dozens of talks with ex-President Glafkos Clerides and President Papadopoulos on this basis."
"There can be no misunderstanding."
"We had a clear agreement: we would arrange Cyprus's accession, and they would ensure that no settlement collapsed on account of the Greek Cypriots."
"We could not speak for the Turkish Cypriots."
"I urge President Papadopoulos to fulfil his part of the deal now."
"The second point that I wish to make is this: the negotiating process launched under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General was paralysed for a very long time by the outright opposition of the Turkish Cypriots."
"Thanks, not least, to the European Union's efforts, this blockade has been overcome and at every stage of the process, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus reaffirmed that it endorsed the basic framework of the Annan Plan, saying that it wanted minor points to be amended, but within the parameters of the plan – I quote: ‘within the parameters of the plan’."
"President Papadopoulos's statements after the end of the talks in Switzerland amount to the fundamental rejection of the basic principles set out in the plan."
"Based on what President Papadopoulos said, I can only conclude that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus now rejects the federal solution to the Cyprus problem, which is based on the coexistence and equality of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots and is endorsed by the United Nations and the entire international community."
"Let me be quite undiplomatic. Ladies and gentlemen, I feel personally cheated by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus."
"For months – for months – I have done my utmost, like everyone else, in good faith and trusting in the promises made by the Greek Cypriot Government, to establish parameters which would enable the Greek Cypriots to endorse this plan. Sadly, this has not been achieved."
"The very least, however, that can now be expected from a country which wants to join the European Union in less than ten days' time is that it must ensure, at the very least, the provision of fair and balanced information about the objectives and content of this plan."
"Never before in the history of the European Commission has a member of the European Commission been banned from making statements on a key European issue in a Member State on the grounds that it constitutes interference in its domestic affairs."
"I call upon President Papadopoulos to ensure that in his country, the basic freedoms of information and opinion are strictly guaranteed, and that from today onwards, free access is granted in the Cypriot media to all those who are able to provide a full explanation of this plan in line with the United Nations' intentions."
"As before, I am willing to do so."
"Let me make one point in conclusion. The solution is not intended to be a transaction in the interests of trade."
"I think it is very regrettable that in the many statements I have heard from the Greek Cypriot side in recent days, the word 'peace', the word 'reconciliation', the word 'mutual understanding', and the word 'different communities and religions living together' are hardly ever mentioned."
"The focus is almost entirely on trade aspects."
"Let me make it clear: our objective is to provide a model, in this part of the world, that demonstrates that the concept of European integration is strong enough not only to avoid conflicts but also to resolve existing ones."
"That would send out a very strong signal, especially in this region, where the coexistence of communities from different cultures and religions has produced the most profound and difficult global crisis that we have faced for some time."
"That is why the importance of this issue extends far beyond Cyprus itself."
"The Commission has fulfilled its pledge."
"As envisaged, we presented a file to the Council in which the provisions of the UN plan are adjusted in line with the ."
"After careful analysis, we ascertained that the new Republic of Cyprus, the United Republic of Cyprus, can speak with one voice, meet its international commitments, will not block international forums, and will be equipped with structures which are robust enough to enforce international law."
"We have stated that in our role as the guardian of the Treaties, we will apply stringent monitoring to ensure that these provisions are upheld."
"Finally, we have made pledges to assist with financing the costs arising from this agreement, and these pledges are very far-reaching."
"Let me make one thing very clear to the Greek Cypriots: there will never be a plan which fully satisfies either one of the parties."
"That is impossible to achieve."
"What we can do is come as close as we can to such a plan, and there will be no better plan than this one."
"To those who now argue, ‘yes but then too many Turkish soldiers will remain on the island’, let me say this: rejecting the plan perpetuates the presence of 30 000 Turkish troops in Cyprus."
"Another complaint is that too many Turkish settlers will remain on the island."
"Let me tell you this: rejecting the plan opens the door for a further 100 000 Turkish settlers to come to Cyprus."
"This plan offers a solution which is in the interests of the Greek community and in the interests of the Turkish community."
"It is a solution which is in the interests of the European Union, and I send out a final appeal to the citizens of Cyprus to make a decision on Saturday which will enable this country to join the European Union with an entry ticket testifying that it is a country that stands for peace and understanding in Europe and the world."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for the frankness of your observations."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, at the request of the Conference of Presidents, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has drawn up a report, based on Mr Poos's work, which is intended to provide assurances from our perspective too that guarantees will be upheld and that the Annan Plan can indeed be implemented without any major problems for citizens."
"We must understand that on issues of this kind, the people will ask questions, and that this type of solution cannot regulate every aspect to every individual's full satisfaction. This is true, for example, of property issues, resettlement, or the compromises on the stationing of troops."
"It must be clear that everyone can exercise their rights, and this includes the lodging of complaints to the courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg."
"However, we must also make it clear that a positive solution to these questions and the unification of the island will generally improve conditions for people on both sides of the demarcation line, and therefore no individual issue should stand in the way of this chance to achieve an overall solution."
"I believe – and this is the view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which I have the honour to represent – that a compromise had to be found, and that under the present circumstances, the compromise put forward is fair. However, as the European Community, we must also ensure that the people have confidence in this plan, and we should work actively to ensure that this confidence is underpinned on our side too."
"That is why I think it is important that paragraphs 13 and 14 of Mr Poos's motion for a resolution clearly urge all the international institutions which have a stake in this process to provide guarantees that the Annan Plan will indeed be implemented, and that the European Parliament, through its permanent bodies, will monitor implementation to ensure that these guarantees are being upheld, thus ensuring that the reunification benefits the people themselves."
"I myself became a Member of this House at a time when my country was still divided. The situation is not entirely comparable."
"Cyprus is not a divided nation; here, there are two different nations in one country."
"That is the difference."
"Nonetheless, I believe that we must recognise that although problems may arise with this type of reunification, overall, the benefits for both sides far outweigh the costs."
"For this reason, we are saying that the citizens of Cyprus have the right to decide for themselves on an independent and sovereign basis."
"We must also recognise that in a community such as Europe, we must support each other in order to ensure that we can live together within our community on the basis of trust, and that means that pledges must be honoured."
"On that basis, we are asking the people of Cyprus to endorse the plan."
"We can do no more than that."
"At the first donors conference which took place last week, we agreed substantial sums of money and signalled our willingness to support this process by appropriate means."
"I hope that on this basis, and in the spirit described by Commissioner Verheugen, who has been highly committed to this issue for years, a positive outcome can still be achieved on Saturday."
"Mr President, in the history of a nation, there are moments when citizens are faced with a fundamental choice."
"It is as if they were halfway across a ford."
"They can carry on towards the far bank or turn back."
"In front of them lies the path to reunification, reconciliation and civil peace, drawing a line under the past."
"This is the path which the European Parliament has always favoured."
"We put our hopes and trust in the negotiating and mediating skills of the Secretary General of the United Nations. We are not about to abandon him with the end in sight."
"Since the resumption of negotiations, the European Parliament has also set out some fundamental conditions: the ability to speak with one voice, a single legal status and no permanent derogation from the Treaty."
"The Commission has assured us today that these conditions have been met in the final version of the Annan plan."
"Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the plan conforms with the Treaty."
"The second path open to the Cypriot electors is to reject what Mr de Soto has called the culmination of thirty years of striving for a political solution."
"This means turning back."
"If the plan is rejected, the island will be divided indefinitely."
"It is actually an illusion to believe that the final document will be opened up for renegotiation in three months or in three years."
"Who with?"
"Under whose auspices?"
"With what international support?"
"It is also an illusion to hope that, if the plan is rejected, the difficult problems surrounding the return of refugees, property, Turkish troops, etc. will be able to be solved. The opposite is the case."
"The present situation will be frozen."
"Not a single refugee from either side will return to his or her home village and not a single Turkish soldier will leave the occupied zone."
"Our draft resolution delivers a clear message."
"We hope the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot electors will have the courage to go forward right now."
"Before you join the European Union, we say to you: Leave nationalism behind you,"
"the European Union will help you overcome any difficulties arising during the construction of a united Republic of Cyprus."
"Mr President, on Saturday, Cyprus votes on the Annan Plan and its future."
"Cyprus stands at a historic juncture."
"European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have consistently urged all parties to support the plan and we do so again now."
"The Annan Plan offers Cyprus a chance for reconciliation and renewal."
"It is a door to a better future on an island that has endured too much for too long."
"The plan makes important concessions to both sides."
"With goodwill on both sides it could be a first step away from years of partition."
"My Group thanks Commissioner Verheugen for the leadership he has shown in this matter."
"We regret that more EU leaders have not expressed the same commitment more volubly."
"The European Union will underwrite a huge amount of the reunification process and the Court of Justice will provide a legal framework for its resolution."
"This is the last, best hope for a unified Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May."
"We salute the leaders on both sides in Cyprus who have supported the Annan process and have commended it to their fellow Cypriots."
"'No' would have been the simple choice: the answer which rhymed easily with resentment and suited political expediency."
"'Yes' took courage."
"There are many Cypriots, particularly on the Greek side, who ask what business it is of ours to be having this debate at all."
"In the face of all our concern and consternation they offer simply the shrug of self-determination."
"They can and will vote as they please and they have the right to vote 'no'."
"But I believe it would be a sad and sectarian choice, the wrong choice for the wrong reasons."
"Moreover, if the purpose of self-determination is the freedom to go on nursing old resentments and the right to weigh the money in your pocket today against reconciliation tomorrow, the Cypriots who have turned their faces against this process are welcome to it."
"I would just ask them to reflect on this. What if the West Germans had chosen that kind of self-determination in 1990?"
"On our scarred continent with its crowded history there are some old scores where restitution and compensation can only ever be relative."
"Only the historically illiterate can believe that we can somehow fix what has happened in Cyprus, anymore than we can fix Kosovo and Serbia or Israel and Palestine."
"What Cyprus needs is a : some way of living that looks forward rather than backward."
"The Annan Plan is a ."
"If it is lost on Saturday it could put back the reunification of Cyprus by a generation."
"The European Union would have to face up to a new reality on the ground: the possibility for a peaceful transfer of land will be lost; the Turkish army will continue to guard what will remain a militarised border;"
"The English writer Lawrence Durrell, who lived for many years on Cyprus, recorded a Greek Cypriot proverb that says there is no fire in old ashes."
"Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House hope beyond hope that Sunday will not find Cypriots stirring the cold old ashes of a sad history."
"Mr President, I visited the island for talks last week."
"The process of EU accession has raised hopes of a solution to the conflict, but many expectations are still unfulfilled, especially among the Greek Cypriots."
"The fact that negotiations have been taking place in New York and Switzerland has barely been reported to citizens in the towns and villages of Cyprus."
"The efforts made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan merit great respect, but it is difficult to communicate 9 000 pages of treaty text to both communities on the island within a matter of weeks, and this has clearly failed due to the different political interests at stake."
"There are different interpretations of the plan even within the governing coalition of the Republic of Cyprus, as the statements made by the President and the coalition partners demonstrate. These different assessments cannot be ignored, Commissioner."
"For the reasons I have stated, there have been serious calls for the postponement of the referendum in order to gain more time for information and opinion-forming."
"The governing party, AKEL, which is affiliated to my group, is not opposed to the Annan Plan, but given the situation, it is deeply concerned about the possible failure of the referendum, as has already been discussed here."
"Now there is a need for clear signals from the EU and the UN again. We should not downplay the situation."
"The country has undergone a war."
"Northern Cyprus has been under Turkish occupation for thirty years."
"In view of the concerns that exist, signals on peace and security must be sent out more clearly, and with these concerns in mind, it must be made clear there are no unilateral advantages for either side."
"Even with the 100% that you rightly question, there is still a problem, namely that these concerns exist at all."
"Politics is not about finality and eternal truths – the process of German reunification has taught us that."
"It is about constantly evolving processes, which can be mapped out to some extent in advance but which require a pro-active and very level-headed approach at every stage."
"In this critical situation, the EU has an obligation, together with the United Nations, to be a reliable partner for the Republic of Cyprus, but also for the two communities, in resolving the conflict."
"Not only Cyprus, but Europe as a whole will be the winner if we manage to heal this wound."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do indeed face a situation which is not only difficult but also very sad."
"For years, we have argued here in this House that we could not let a Turkish nationalist position prevent Cyprus's accession to the European Union. We were always resolute in our position."
"However, this has led us into a trap which the Greens warned about years ago. We asked what guarantees there were that, with a radical change on the Turkish side, the guaranteed accession of Greek Cyprus would not take place at the expense of the northern part of the island."
"This debate has always been neglected in this House, and we are paying a high price for this neglect today."
"The situation is irreversible, and when they vote in the referendum, the Greek Cypriots will not be deciding their own future."
"They will decide on the future of the Turkish Cypriot community in the northern part of the island."
"The Greek Cypriots are already about to join the European Union."
"And then you talk about the plan."
"Mr Modrow, please think about it for a moment: the situation is like the Sudeten Germans saying: ‘We refuse to let the Czech Republic join the European Union until our claims in the Czech Republic have been settled.’"
"This House made it clear that that is unacceptable."
"As a left-winger, please convey that message to the Greek Cypriots as well."
"This is an historic plan."
"On the left and the right, up and down, we are always saying that the UN should do this and the UN should do that … Now, the UN has decided."
"Of course a plan is a plan; it does not reflect the Greek Cypriot or the Turkish Cypriot position."
"This UN plan is an attempt to remove the last barbed wire border from the EU."
"What is our response?"
"The sophists – for we are dealing with Greeks here – are back in power; they say, ‘Yes, it is moving in the right direction, but it could be better’."
"Yes, the world could be a better place, I admit that."
"The world could be a much better place, and even if the Greens secure an absolute majority in Europe …"
"… the world will not become a better place!"
"You see, you were too quick off the mark again, but I know what I am saying."
"I am convinced that the message we must send out is this. If there is a 'no' vote in the south and a 'yes' in the north, the European Union should open political relations with the north."
"As a first step, we must lobby for the lifting of the embargo against the north of the island."
"The citizens in the north should not be held hostage by the south."
"We cannot allow that on grounds of political decency."
"Then we will see what happens. One thing is certain, however: there is not a 'possible' UN plan: this is the only one."
"There is not a 'possible' future: this is the only one."
"Very many of you are religious."
"I believe in miracles. I believe in the miracle that the people in the southern part of the island really will prove to be more intelligent than their self-appointed leaders, including the Green parties in Cyprus."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Europe had the idea of holding out to Turkey the prospect of accession to the European Union in Helsinki without making it an essential requirement that that country put an immediate and unconditional end to the illegal occupation of northern Cyprus shows almost criminal frivolity on the part of the European Council."
"In Cyprus, Europe is going ahead and putting on ice the sacred principle of the free movement of persons on which our Union has been based for decades."
"I can only sympathise, then, with the intransigent position of the Greek Cypriots and their President, Mr Papadopoulos, who reject the UN Secretary-General’s half-hearted compromise, and in three days’ time will be voting ‘no’ in the referendum on the reunification of their island."
"This is not reunification, however, as the Turkish occupation would continue."
"The military border would remain, the hundred-thousand Turkish settlers would be allowed to stay in Cyprus, the Turkish army would stay, and Cypriots would not enjoy the same rights as other EU citizens, as their property rights and right to do business would be restricted."
"In short, the Annan Plan perpetuates and legalises the Turkish occupation."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to pledge my wholehearted support to the Greek Cypriots and reiterate that, as far as we are concerned, Islamic Turkey must never join the European Union."
"Mr President, the exceptionally gloomy statement by Commissioner Verheugen is particularly shocking to us all in view of the fact that we are on the point of reaching a solution, by means of the Annan Plan."
"We had previously thought that the slogan ‘the solution is not a solution’ could be attributed solely to Mr Denktash."
"We now see, however, that this slogan is also used by the President of the Greek Republic of Cyprus."
"That is of course unacceptable."
"Personal interviews with Mr Papadopoulos, along with other indications, have always given me the unpleasant feeling that we were being deceived, that the Republic of Cyprus lacked the genuine will to do its utmost to reach a solution for Cyprus."
"Yet the assumption that the Republic would do its utmost to arrive at a solution and that it would not fail in this formed the basis for that country’s accession to the European Union."
"There appears to be the presumption that it is also possible to trick one’s way into membership of the European Union."
"That is unacceptable."
"We also heard just now that matters falling within the Copenhagen political criteria, in particular, such as freedom of the press and access to the media, are closed off not only to our Commissioner Verheugen and to foreigners, but also to national opposition parties."
"When this happens in other countries we take umbrage and tell them that we are breaking off negotiations with them, as we did with Romania, for example."
"We are thus now on the threshold of the membership of a new Member State that has achieved this by deception."
"In my opinion, we cannot accept this on any account, indicating as it does a lack of respect for the European Union."
"We have also experienced this in the past with Slovakia, which told us that we were interfering in its internal affairs."
"Yet membership of the European Union means becoming heavily involved in each other’s internal affairs."
"This particularly goes for matters of the Copenhagen political criteria, and particularly for matters relating to the willingness to cooperate with the European Union in good faith for the purposes of reaching a solution capable of being of extremely great benefit to the inhabitants of both the northern and the southern parts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May."
"We always hoped that the accession process could serve as a catalyst to end the division of Cyprus."
"In three days' time, the Cypriots themselves must decide whether they wish to live in a unified state after almost 30 years of division, and whether after almost 30 years, they wish to join the European Union as a unified state."
"Since the Green Line was opened for Cypriots on 23 April last year, we have seen very clearly that Cypriots from both communities are willing and able to coexist peacefully."
"The Annan Plan which will be voted on by both communities on 24 April is a compromise between the wishes and legitimate demands of both sides."
"The plan may not be totally balanced; perhaps it does have weaknesses as regards the power of central government, and perhaps the guarantees for the implementation of individual measures are not clear enough."
"Are these doubts really a reason to reject the plan?"
"Are the undoubted weaknesses an adequate reason to reject the opportunities that the proposal offers?"
"My twenty years of experience in working towards a solution for Cyprus, for its accession and for unity, tell me that the opportunities far outweigh the risks."
"We are not the ones who have to decide on 24 April."
"Even if we hope for a positive outcome, we will accept the democratic decision of the people of Cyprus."
"What the European Parliament can say with certainty, however, is that this year is 2004, not 1964 or 1974."
"A united Cyprus will become a Member State of the European Union, and as a Member State, it will not only enjoy the full protection afforded by membership. It will also see that the responsibility of the European Union as a whole for ensuring the successful implementation of the Annan Plan guarantees this opportunity for peaceful coexistence."
"Today, the European Parliament will commit itself to monitoring the entire implementation process through its committee work."
"We are currently witnessing many fears, especially on the part of Greek Cypriots who look back at the past."
"However, looking forward to the future is the better option."
"Turkey in 2004 is a country with a European perspective. It is no longer the Turkey of 1974."
"The Turkish Cypriots showed back in December that they have largely thrown off the legacy of Rauf Denktash."
"New opportunities are unlikely to present themselves soon."
"The only alternative to the plan is the ongoing and entrenched division of the island."
"This plan offers an opportunity and should not be gambled away due to false or inadequate information."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we are today sending a message to our soon-to-be fellow citizens in the European Union."
"Statements by a European Commissioner, by the European Parliament or by individual Members do not constitute interference in Cyprus's domestic affairs or pressure from outside."
"They are well-intentioned advice. They are information which is being passed around within the family in which we must shape Europe's future from 1 May."
"I hope that accession day on 1 May will be a genuine celebration of reunification in Cyprus – the unification of all Cypriots with almost 450 million people in the European Union."
"Mr President, the Commissioner said that he felt cheated by the Government of Cyprus."
"He was too polite."
"His good faith has been betrayed, as has that of our rapporteur, Mr Poos."
"Under international law, the entire island of Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May, regardless of the result of the referendum, and Turkish Cypriots will become EU citizens."
"However, if the Greek Cypriots reject the Annan Plan, Turkish Cypriots will be EU citizens who are denied recognition and representation and who are being kept impoverished by economic sanctions applied by the EU."
"Turkish Cypriots are trapped in a pincer: they are threatened on the one hand by Turkish settlers and on the other by the economic strength of the Greek Cypriots."
"They have been poorly led for years."
"However, the tide has now turned and if they vote 'yes' in Saturday's referendum, they will have done everything that we and the UN have asked of them."
"Under such circumstances it would be completely unacceptable for economic sanctions to be maintained."
"We cannot persecute our own citizens."
"The presidency and the Commission, with the UN, must take steps to lift their burden through the means of transport and trade, and must do so without delay."
"– Mr President, allow me to say something different from what we have heard so far."
"I think that a distorted picture has been given."
"The majority of political forces in both Greece and Cyprus consider that the Annan plan may help to resolve the Cyprus problem, especially with the prospect of the integration of a united Cyprus into the European Union."
"That is the truth of the matter."
"A distorted picture is being given."
"There is the question of how one part of public opinion is taking this affair on board, how it feels."
"There is a problem there, a huge problem from the past, as to whether this plan can really be applied absolutely in time, fully and reliably to all the details, which are particularly complicated and particularly difficult."
"We have a lot of experience here of violated agreements."
"Instead, therefore, of looking for some sort of miracle, as my friend Mr Cohn-Bendit suggests, let us do what we can."
"Let us desist from exaggerations, insults and criticism of one another."
"What we can do is to call for there to be now a serious and reliable guarantee from the UN and from the European Union that the entire Annan plan, as it stands, will be applied to the end and there will be no tricks and circumventions after one year or after eight months or two years."
"Let us call for that."
"It is the only thing we can do now, before the referendum."
"We will see to the rest later."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, two peoples and two cultures living in one country is often a delicate matter."
"Reason is required, but feelings also come into play."
"The Annan Plan is a good plan, but it is a solution born of reason."
"Yet Cypriots choose not only with their minds, but also with their hearts."
"Thirty years of occupation is a long time."
"I heard a Turkish Cypriot girl being interviewed on the radio."
"She said that, in her youth, she thought that only men lived on the other side."
"We are asking Cypriots to say ‘yes’ to the Annan Plan, as we are confident that it will bring them peace, reconciliation and prospects."
"However, does the population have sufficient trust in the countries that are to ensure the implementation of that plan, for example?"
"Have Turkey, Greece and the United Kingdom not had their own agendas all along in the history of Cyprus?"
"Has sufficient work been done on trust between human beings in those thirty years?"
"We are calling for Cypriots to vote ‘yes’, but let us remember, with a view to the accession of some Balkan states, that it is important to win the trust of the population."
"I have just heard Mr Verheugen saying that it is we who are organising the accession of Cyprus to the EU, but Greece that must enable unity in that country."
"I find that rather shocking: where is the people of Cyprus in all of this?"
"Well, that people will have its say."
"We are calling on it to say ‘yes’, but equally, if it does not yet have sufficient trust to do so, we must further build this trust and ensure that the unification process is a success, and that what is not possible today is possible tomorrow."
"– Mr President, our position, in a word, as President Karamanlis of Greece has also described it and as my friend Mr Brok described it a short while ago, is that the positive elements of the yes vote outweigh the negative elements, especially when the yes vote to the reunification of Cyprus is considered from the European perspective, in other words that Cyprus will be a member of the European Union."
"Nonetheless, the question is: how can we help the yes vote, how can we try to bring about a yes vote in the referendum?"
"If we are to do this, however, we need to understand why the no vote had and has such resonance among the Cypriots."
"Let me give you some examples."
"Why would the thousands of refuges vote yes when their future looks uncertain, when they will not all return to their family homes and they will not all acquire their property, while at the same time they will also be deprived of the basic human right of the judicial protection of the European Court of Human Rights?"
"Similarly, maintaining Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union, under a regime of guarantees by third countries, one of which is not even a member of the Union, goes against the principles of the European Union and weakens the development of the European security and defence policy, quite apart from the fact that the permanent presence of Greek and Turkish troops on the island goes against the principle of demilitarisation which is established in the plan."
"I could expand on numerous other reasons which constitute the causes for the resonance of the no vote among Greek Cypriots."
"If, therefore, we want to promote the yes vote, we need to recognise and note some of these causes in the text on which we vote, even though these are wish lists, while at the same time demonstrating that European reality also means the European Parliament, where human rights held, hold and will hold a central position."
"We are therefore trying, with this text, to impart the idea that there will be, as Mr Papayannakis said, guarantees on security issues for the application of the plan and that we shall lend our ear here to human rights issues."
"Only thus can we convince of the importance of the yes vote, based henceforth on the European perspective."
"That is why I call on us to ensure that we vote for certain amendments which improve the text and show that the European Parliament is here to support the yes vote."
"– Mr President, first of all I should like to say that I am sorry that Commissioner Verheugen has left."
"Obviously he had some other pressing business."
"I endorse everything Commissioner Verheugen said and I share his disappointment on this issue, because he really was one of the protagonists, who worked very hard to bring things to maturity, to the point at which we can initiate material reconciliation between the Greeks and Turks in Cyprus."
"When I was young, I suffered in my own country from the suppression of the freedom of the press and I feel pain and shame that today Greeks seeking their freedom are depriving Commissioner Verheugen of the right to address them and try to persuade them of what he considers to be right, he who fought so hard for things to reach a satisfactory situation."
"We want a yes vote."
"Politicians in Greece, all of them, have said that they want a yes vote, with Mr Papandreou leading the way."
"We want the guarantees heard here to be given with emphasis, but the greatest guarantee lies in changing the global situation."
"The Cypriots divided because they were divided by a now bankrupt colonial regime, because they were divided by the cold war."
"These no longer exist."
"The European Union has refuted all this and is inviting them into its fold so that they can live differently."
"Not in order to keep them divided."
"The greatest guarantee is within and they must bring it forth from within themselves."
"I shall end by reminding my compatriots in Cyprus of the words of the great Greek politician Eleftherios Venizelos, who said that the every nation seals its own fate and that whatever it does on its own whim is one less thing for its enemy to do."
"Mr President, I understand why Commissioner Verheugen feels cheated on the 1999 deal that the Greek Cypriot Government would facilitate a settlement if accession were unconditional."
"My own view in 1999 that accession was not feasible without unification."
"We should have kept both sides guessing in order to keep up the pressure."
"I was criticised for that view and accused of bias."
"However, it looks as if communication with Turkish Cypriots – convincing them that Europe is friendly and welcoming – has paid off."
"That kind of effort has also been undertaken by the European Commission in the face of legalistic objections."
"The EU institutions have perhaps let down the Greek Cypriots by failing sufficiently to challenge their version of history or to encourage them to realise that a compromise would be necessary – not a return to the pre-1974 situation."
"This House bears some of that responsibility."
"Mr Poos calls on Cypriots to leave nationalism at the door."
"I welcome that call."
"I just wish it had been made consistently on both communities over the last five years."
"If indeed the north votes 'yes' and the south 'no', the status quo cannot endure and a new assessment will be needed."
"Ways will have to be found to bring Turkish Cypriots out of their political and economic isolation."
"For instance, we must drop the requirement for Cypriots to have Greek mother tongue in order to be officials in the EU institutions."
"There must be a European Parliament delegation to Northern Cyprus."
"I am getting ahead of myself."
"I still hope very much that Greek Cypriots, as well as Turkish Cypriots, will vote 'yes' on Saturday."
"The World Bank predicts a huge growth spurt of 5% per annum if they do so."
"– Mr President, first I wish to express the full support of the Communist Party of Greece for the unsubmissive Cypriot people who, unlike the European Union, do not throw UN resolutions on the Turkish invasion and occupation into the waste-paper basket."
"As I followed the debate, I remembered the words of the poet: how often came my enemies dressed as friends."
"Indeed, some people in Cyprus trusted the European Union."
"They believed that the much vaunted acquis communautairewould result in the resolution of the problem."
"It turned out that the acquis communautairewas a deception, a rag bag of no value, while erstwhile friends are now pressuring, coercing and threatening, including you, Mr President, and Mr Verheugen, who is showing his disdain for us by his absence."
"It is unacceptable and wrong of Mr Verheugen to accuse the President of Cyprus of deceiving him."
"Mr Papadopoulos and the Greek-Cypriot leadership never promised to accept any monster cobbled together by the UN Secretary General."
"What is the Commissioner afraid of?"
"The obligations which derive from the fact that one part of a Member State of the European Union will be under the occupation of a candidate country?"
"Who does the Annan plan serve?"
"The Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots or more general imperialist plans?"
"What sort of state is it that will operate as an umbrella for two practically independent states, which will even be able to send representatives to European Councils and diplomatic missions, two states which will need special agreements in order to regulate their relations, while being at the mercy of the guarantor powers and foreign courts?"
"How secure will the Cypriots feel without their own army, but with the military presence of Turkey, Greece, the United Kingdom, perhaps even ΝΑΤΟ?"
"How do you judge the fact that the military agreements between the occupying regime and Turkey are being converted into primary Community law?"
"How do you judge the fact that Cyprus is obliged to support the candidature of Turkey under any circumstances?"
"Leave at long last the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to assess the situation, to take a decision on the basis of their own interests."
"Respect their history, respect their dignity, shake off the arrogance and haughtiness of the suzerain!"
"Mr President, as a friend of the large Cypriot community which I represent in London, I have always supported peaceful reunification of Cyprus."
"However, I have never underestimated the practical and political difficulties created over the 30 post-invasion years in which Turkey has moved 120 000 mainland settlers into the north, when they do not share the common historical heritage of the island and generally do not speak English or Greek, previously the bicommunal languages."
"The Annan III Plan has gone a long way towards settling differences in a fair way."
"However, I have received hundreds of e-mails from my Greek Cypriot constituents who are concerned that this plan offers no guarantees on Turkish implementation of troop withdrawal and territorial and property restitution."
"It is interesting that even the Greek Cypriots – the lucky ones who have been promised the return of their homes – seem to oppose the plan."
"They also object to mainland settlers being granted citizenship, as this would appear to reward the aggressor and violate the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit the settlement of outside populations by the occupying power."
"Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has rejected the proposals and called for a 'no' vote by the Greek Cypriot community."
"I personally believe it is best for outsiders, including Members of this House, not to put any pressure on a referendum process as this would be perceived as interference in Cyprus's sovereign affairs."
"Furthermore, if both communities do not give their free consent and the arrangements break down in the future, blame will be apportioned to the players who leaned on the Cypriot people to get a 'yes' vote."
"The British Government is prepared to cede some of the sovereign base territory surplus to its needs, if this will help."
"I, like many of my colleagues, wish the referendum process well and will support the outcome of the vote on the 24 April, whichever way it goes."
"– Mr President, in three days the referendum will be held in Cyprus on whether or not to accept the Annan plan."
"A yes or a no vote in the referendum will not be two sides of the same coin; it will be different sides of different coins."
"The next day will not be the same as the previous day."
"Today's debate confirms the vital role of the European Parliament in this entire lengthy development of hope on the Cypriot question and the exceptionally positive role of Commissioner Verheugen, of Mr Poos, and of all sides of the European Union in general."
"Now is the time for responsibility on the part of all the political leaders in Cyprus, of both the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots, in Greece and Turkey and in the entire European Union."
"The party to which I belong, PASOK, and its President, Georgos Papandreou, are and have been protagonists throughout developments in Cyprus as regards the resolution of the problem and its integration into the European Union."
"It is the time of truth."
"We must all respond to the challenges of history, by looking the dilemma straight in the eye and responding responsibly and positively."
"A yes vote, with all the concerns but which operates in the new environment of the European Union, opens a window to the future and to hope."
"A no vote requires an answer."
"In all events, the answer will be given by the Cypriot people."
"The European Parliament and the European Union give both their support and their capabilities as security guarantees of the full exploitation of all aspects of the Annan plan."
"We must ask the same of the UN."
"Our resolution today reflects precisely this perspective."
"I, as a Greek MEP, whose first contact with politics and political awareness was in the demonstrations and fights of the Cypriots to escape English colonialism and then in all the dramatic events in Cyprus, consider that a yes vote will result in an historic balance with prospects for a positive, historic reconciliation, in which everyone can trust in a positive future of prosperity and security for all, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and the area in general."
"I should like to finish with an ancient Greek motto: time waits for no man."
"– Mr President, I wish I could also say Commissioner but Mr Verheugen has left us very early and I am sorry about that, nearly all the political parties in Greece and the most important parties in Cyprus have come out in favour of the Annan plan."
"However, they share the concerns and doubts of the Cypriot people, who are not following the parties in this instance."
"The negative reaction which has developed in Cyprus is due, I think, to extreme pressure of time, which has not allowed the people to be informed calmly and analytically."
"But how could they be informed within a fortnight of the submission of the last Annan plan?"
"They could not."
"On the contrary, the inciting of passions and misinformation have prevailed, thereby exacerbating fears and doubts."
"If the referendum were postponed, as proposed, then the people could be informed more calmly and more substantially and, at the same time, clear and persuasive guarantees could be given that the full text of the plan and the agreement would be respected and would not again be violated by some of the guarantor powers."
"Because that is where the problem lies, with the guarantor powers."
"It was they who caused most of the disasters in Cyprus."
"These guarantees must also be given by the Security Council and by the European Union and by the European Parliament which, with its resolution, improved by the amendments proposed by the PPE-DE, the socialist party and Mr Papayannakis, will, I think, strengthen the tendency and desire of the Cypriots to say yes."
"The European Parliament must not appear to be exerting pressure."
"Blackmail, with threats of sanctions, which have, unfortunately, also come from official lips, have incited the negative stand of an uninformed and terrified people."
"That is why, in addition to security guarantees, the prospect of a second referendum must be left open after the referendum in three days' time, which looks like being a no vote."
"Better informed Cypriots and stronger security guarantees could change the climate and thus, in two or three months' time, bring in a positive result, for which there is a great deal of hope."
"I do not understand why repeating a referendum, which other Member States of the European Union are allowed to do if there is a no vote, as happened in your country, Mr President, should not also be allowed for the Cypriots."
"Please vote for my amendments, which make the European Parliament resolution encouraging, reassuring and friendly towards the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots and will, I am sure, encourage them to give a more positive response to the Annan plan."
"We thought the Nice Treaty was so good we should vote on it twice!"
"– Mr President, without doubt there are practical problems with the Annan plan."
"It does not put both sides on an equal footing and it makes provision for painfully long transitional periods for transposing the acquis communautaire."
"Nonetheless, we unreservedly support the Poos motion and its constructive proposals, because on the basis of the resolution, first, the illegal Turkish occupation is removed from the northern part, further colonisation is prohibited, certain Greek lands are returned and a number of refugees can return."
"This positive position depends, as has been emphasised numerous times today, on a strict system of guarantees of respect for the entire Annan plan."
"Secondly, it also depends on an express declaration that we agree in advance to respect any result, as the President-in-Office of the Council wisely emphasised here today."
"– Mr President, first I should like to congratulate Mr Poos on his work, Mrs Mechtild Rothe on her efforts all these years as Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, Mr Oostlander, Mr Brok who is not here and, of course, Commissioner Verheugen, who unfortunately had to leave."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that we are at the moment holding a general political debate on the prevailing climate in the run up to the referendum on Saturday rather than on the content of the Annan plan, because a debate on the content of this plan, despite the fact that its positive points far outnumber its negative points, could turn into a detailed debate lasting several hours."
"The positions of my fellow Members and of the Commissioner and the President-in-Office, and all the disappointments expressed in this House about the climate prevailing at the moment in Cyprus, bring me to the conclusion that, apart from the yes or no vote which has been debated closely here too, we should also hold an analytical debate on the proposal by the speaker of the Cypriot parliament, Dimitris Christofias, to postpone the referenda, especially in that postponement would need to be accompanied, on the one hand, by the clarification of certain points in the plan which are creating problems, such as security issues – I would ask Mr Patten to convey to Mr Verheugen the question of primary law and of people taking recourse to the courts – and, on the other hand, by work being carried out in the Security Council on the new resolution we want, which will include guarantees."
"I think that these two poles will certainly help to reverse the climate."
"Finally, I want to finish by saying that, of course, an opinion needs to be expressed and this opinion of the European Parliament is being expressed through the resolution tabled by Mr Poos, together of course with all the amendments which have been proposed."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their contributions."
"Mr President, you and I both come from a divided island and we understand something of the passion that a debate of this nature will engender on the island of Cyprus."
"We also understand that conflict which is rooted in history and ingrained for generations is not easy to resolve."
"However, we also understand, as practical political people, that every now and again – perhaps once in a generation, or even more rarely than that – an opportunity comes to really change things."
"The agreement produced by Kofi Annan offers such an opportunity."
"As I said earlier, this is a decision for the people of Cyprus – both North and South."
"It is their decision, their decision alone and we will respect that decision."
"In short, I can only repeat what the President-in-Office of the Council, the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, said last night."
"I should first point out that we need to weigh our words very carefully, as we can all understand the hurt and concerns involved and need to be very careful that nothing is said or done in the next 72 hours to make a grim situation worse."
"Last night Mr Ahern summarised the position of the European Council as follows: 'These are crucial days for Cyprus and for its people."
"On Saturday the people of the island – North and South – will vote in referenda on the plan for a settlement presented by the United Nations Secretary-General."
"Through their patient and determined efforts in cooperation with the parties, the Secretary-General and his hard-working team have created a unique and historic opportunity for a settlement of the Cyprus problem."
"In his report to the United Nations Security Council, which was released yesterday, Kofi Annan stated clearly that the plan is the only available, the only foreseeable route for the reunification of Cyprus."
"The decision now rests with the people of Cyprus and is for them alone, freely exercising their democratic rights."
"The people of Cyprus know that the strong preference of the European Council is for the accession of a united Cyprus to the Union on 1 May."
"The European Union is ready to accommodate the terms of the settlement in line with the principles on which this Union is founded."
"As President of the European Council over the past few months I have had discussions on Cyprus with political leaders across Europe.'"
"And this is the important point, Mr President: 'It is only right to say that the view of the overwhelming majority is that the proposed settlement would be good for both communities in Cyprus and good for the European Union'."
"Those are the views of the President-in-Office of the European Council and of the vast majority of the democratically elected leaders of the Member States of the European Union."
"I said at the outset that we need to weigh our words carefully."
"We do not want to cause any difficulties or be seen to be intruding in decisions that are ultimately decisions for the people of Cyprus."
"We wish the people of Cyprus well in the remaining hours before they make their decision and hope that it will be the decision that best serves the people of the island of Cyprus as a whole – both North and South."
". I should just like to say one or two words about this subject, which is not my normal beat."
"Firstly, I should like to apologise, on behalf of Commissioner Verheugen, that he had to leave before the end of the debate."
"He had another extremely important engagement, and this debate was scheduled to have ended a good deal earlier."
"However, I understand why the debate has run on so long: it arouses considerable passions and great interest in all parts of the House."
"We were questioned about what would happen if there was a 'no' vote on the Greek side of the island and a 'yes' vote among the Turkish community."
"I should underline that the Commission has already announced that we will soon be putting forward proposals to assist the Turkish community in that unhappy eventuality, which we still hope will not happen."
"Clearly we cannot allow the Turkish community to be punished economically and socially because of decisions made by others, so we would have to try to find a solution to the problem of Turkish economic isolation as effectively and rapidly as we could."
"I should like to speak briefly about the 1999 Helsinki European Council – the first European Council that I attended."
"As I recall, we always knew that the policy we endorsed then had about it an element of risk."
"It does not come as a surprise."
"We thought it was important to try to decouple the Cyprus conflict from the integration of central and eastern Europe into the European Union."
"I believe we made the right decision then and I believe it was the right way to proceed."
"But against that background, and in the light of some of the things Commissioner Verheugen said, you will understand why it is not just the Commissioner who feels very strongly that we have been badly let down in the last few days and weeks."
"It is a sentiment that is strongly held within the Commission and one that is held way beyond the Commission."
"I still hope that we will not be let down."
"However, one cannot ignore the fact that there is that sense that we have been cheated."
"I have received one motion for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"With regard to the referendums in Cyprus, Parliament’s primary objective should be to apply to itself the principles which it is shouting from the rooftops: observance of human rights and respect for democracy."
"On the first point, the Annan plan raises fundamental objections."
"How could the European Parliament endorse a proposed settlement which denies refugees the right to recover the property taken from them, which constitutes a permanent restriction on people’s freedom of movement and establishment, which perpetuates the presence of occupying troops and which does not provide any recourse against violations of human rights before the Strasbourg Court?"
"On the second point, Parliament must not go along with the scandalous pressure being piled onto the Greek Cypriots by both the United States and the European Commission – and in particular by Commissioner Verheugen, one of the keenest advocates of Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"The rule of democracy means that the decision of the people must be respected, especially if expressed in the most undeniable way in this respect: a referendum."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East."
". Mr President, following the targeted killing of the new Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi, the President of the Council issued a statement on 18 April expressing his deep concern at the ongoing and seemingly endless cycle of retaliatory violence involving Palestinian groups and the Israeli authorities and defence forces."
"The statement condemned both the assassination of the Hamas leader and the suicide bombing at the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip which took place on the same day."
"The statement went on to say that such violence should end immediately and pointed to the self-evident futility of such violence, either as a means of freeing Palestinians from occupation or bringing long-term peace and security to the people of Israel."
"The President of the Council once again reminded the Israeli Government that extrajudicial killings are contrary to international law and pointed out that respect for international law should mark an immediate distinction between democratically elected governments and terrorist groups."
"Meanwhile, at the conclusion of the foreign ministers' informal meeting in Tullamore on 17 April, the President of the Council issued an important statement on behalf of his colleagues concerning the current situation in the Middle East."
"The EU foreign ministers reaffirmed certain basic principles of European policy towards any settlement in the Middle East conflict, including its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution agreed between the parties."
"This would result in a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian state, existing side by side and in peace with an Israel living within recognised and secure boundaries."
"The ministers reaffirmed that the roadmap represented the only route to achieving such an outcome."
"The Union is determined to pursue vigorously the course set out in the roadmap and calls on both sides to fulfil their obligations under the roadmap."
"The established position of the European Union, restated by the European Council of 25 and 26 March, is that the Union will not recognise any change in the pre-1967 borders, other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties."
"The Union has emphasised that no declared views on the possible shape of the final settlement can pre-empt the negotiations of that settlement."
"Ministers pointed out that the refugee question, and the manner in which the right to return may be realised, are also final status issues."
"The roadmap states that a final and comprehensive permanent status agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must include an agreed, just, fair and realistic solution to this question."
"In this context, the Union has noted President Bush's reaffirmation of the United States' commitment to the roadmap and to a negotiated settlement."
"The Union emphasises the principle, shared by President Bush, that final status issues are a matter of negotiation and agreement between the parties themselves and that they must not be prejudiced."
"Ministers also agreed with the President of the United States that secure and recognised borders should emerge from negotiations between the parties in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 242 and UN Resolution 338."
"These and other relevant Security Council Resolutions must form the basis for a just and lasting settlement of the conflict."
"In other words the conflict will not be sorted out by unilateral action."
"The prospect of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is welcome."
"The European Council has stated that such a withdrawal should represent a significant step towards the implementation of the roadmap, provide that it is carried out in accordance with certain conditions."
"This is an opportunity which the international community, led by the Quartet, should seize."
"The proposed withdrawal should be properly orchestrated with the international community, so as to ensure that an orderly situation in Gaza results, which would permit the maintenance of security as well as the rehabilitation and the reconstruction that is so urgently needed in that area."
"The Union urges all parties urgently to undertake preparations towards that end."
"On this basis the European Union is ready to support the Palestinian authority in taking responsibility for law and order, as well as to continue the Union's existing aid to the Palestinian authority and to examine possible future needs that may arise in the context of a new situation in Gaza."
"Ministers also stressed the need to avoid a political vacuum and the dangers that it would involve in the interim period between now and the beginnings of any withdrawal."
"They recalled that there are a number of measures which need to be adopted in the period immediately ahead in the political, security and humanitarian spheres in order to prevent further deterioration and in order to resume progress."
"An end to violence and terrorism, as well as the resumption of the ceasefire embracing all of the parties and all of the groups, is essential."
"Both sides need to resume negotiations on the peace process without further delay."
"We all know from past experience and from history that resolution to difficult and complex issues invariably comes through negotiation, and in fact only comes through negotiation."
"A just, lasting and a comprehensive peace must meet the legitimate aspirations of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people and must include Lebanon and Syria."
"All states in the region must exert every effort to promote peace and to combat terrorism."
"The European Union looks forward to the forthcoming meeting of the Quartet at principles level."
"The Quartet should play an active role in pursuing the goal of a comprehensive regional peace and encourage the parties to move ahead vigorously on the basis of the principles outlined above."
"The ministers will have a further discussion on the Middle East process at the meetings of the Council on Monday."
"They will consider the position to be taken by the European Union at the meeting of the Quartet, which will take place in New York on 4 May."
"I hope that I have succeeded in giving the Members a clear impression of how actively focused this presidency remains when it comes to the very difficult situation in the Middle East."
"We will, by the same token, listen with great attention to the views of Parliament on this important issue at this time."
". Mr President, I do not wish to repeat or intend to repeat what the presidency has just said about recent discussions on the Middle East by the Council or how it has reacted to the statement made by President Bush in Washington last week after his meeting with Prime Minister Sharon."
"The statement surprised many people, whether understandably or not, and one cannot disguise the fact that it seems to have caused great concern in the Arab world."
"Some have subsequently argued that it should not have done so. They have said that it offers a way into the implementation of that roadmap, rather than a tearing-up of the roadmap."
"They have argued that we should seek out the positive, like the promised and welcomed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, rather than focus on the negative."
"So be it."
"I do not seek to second-guess the doubtless well-intentioned interpretations of others or to undermine efforts to make the most of the present, exceptionally difficult, situation."
"Some of course always see a glass as half full when others believe it is half empty."
"Others find it rather challenging to believe that a glass is half full when they cannot see very much liquid in the glass at all."
"I guess that like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder. I do not wish to dwell on those matters."
"I will just make five points which we must address if we are to draw anything positive from the present grim situation."
"First, as the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the European Council has said again and again, a final settlement can only be achieved as a result of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, resulting in two viable sovereign and independent states based on the borders of 1967, perhaps amended by agreement, living side by side in peace and security as laid out, for example, in the roadmap."
"This has been the main thread of European thinking, from Venice in 1980 to Berlin in 1999, to Seville in 2002 and right up to the latest European Council conclusions of last month."
"It is not surprising that we have agreed with what for 37 years has been the consistent American position, that settlements beyond the 1967 borders are illegal and represent 'obstacles to peace'."
"We all know what the ingredients for a final settlement will be."
"They are contained in the Mitchell report and in subsequent documents, including the Arab League peace initiative of 2002."
"They are also in the roadmap that has been endorsed by the international community."
"A settlement does not await some heavenly insight."
"It awaits the exercise of political will by both sides – Israeli and Palestinian."
"It is in my judgment a tragedy that the courageous proposals of the representatives of civil society who negotiated the Geneva initiative do not seem to be shared by the political leadership in their communities."
"Second, we deplore the violence which postpones reconciliation and any chance whatsoever of peace."
"We have always deplored without reservation and condemned with all our strength the suicide bombings that take innocent lives and the dark propaganda that clouds the minds of so many."
"We are also profoundly critical of heavy-handed military retaliation which destroys lives, homes and livelihoods, the sort of retaliation which increases extremism and does not increase security."
"We believe that targeted assassinations are wrong, illegal and counter-productive."
"One of the Palestinian politicians whom I most admire, a voice of sanity and reason, referred recently to the deafening sound of war drums on both sides and to the bitter fact that both communities seem to be locked in an embrace in which all that seems to matter is causing pain to the other side."
"There is plenty of pain on offer, but not much promise of peace."
"Third, whatever the criticisms of the European approach to the dispute, we can say that we have sustained, throughout the weeks, months and years of bloodshed and hopelessness, institutions which can one day form the basis for a reformed Palestinian Government."
"That has been the policy of the European Council, endorsed by this Parliament."
"We have been congratulated for what we have done by, among others, the World Bank."
"Only recently I received a letter from the Palestinian Finance Minister, Salam Fayad, which noted that with the help of the European Union the Palestinian Authority has now delivered on all of the reform commitments it had made to the Palestinian Legislative Council a year and a half ago."
"There is now a high degree of accountability, with transparent budget procedures."
"There are no more cash payments to Palestinian security personnel, whose salaries are now transferred through bank accounts."
"We have been encouraged, in private, to do more – to give more help."
"We have been criticised in public for doing anything at all."
"Some have argued that there could actually be a no more serious accusation than that the attempt to promote reform and sustain some sort of life in Palestine has bankrolled terrorism."
"Parliament has held its own inquiry into these matters and OLAF has investigated these allegations."
"I have no more to say on the subject, save to pay tribute to my officials who have tried to implement a difficult policy honestly, transparently and with integrity."
"When I look at what has happened in the last few years I can see all too little else that has achieved as much as they have."
"Turning to the future, it is said by some – perhaps a trifle glibly – that after the promised withdrawal we will rebuild Gaza and try to create the foundations for a new Palestine."
"What they presumably have in mind is a Palestine which is genuinely viable, not a collection of isolated bantustans divided by tanks, settlements and walls."
"We are certainly prepared to continue our humanitarian assistance and to support the rebuilding of the infrastructure of those areas from which the Israeli defence forces withdraw."
"But I have to say that this time we should seek certain guarantees from the Israeli defence forces that they will not destroy again what we build."
"They should take into account the five points made by the European Council of 25 and 26 March, notably, the anchoring of the withdrawal within the roadmap and the facilitation of economic life in the territory that the Israeli defence forces leave."
"It was the World Bank that noted that the biggest obstacle to economic revival is lack of access and a lack of sufficient freedom of movement of persons and goods."
"Access to the outside world is essential for reviving the Palestinian economy."
"We should also seek to ensure that humanitarian assistance can be provided as it would be elsewhere."
"At present it costs more to provide the assistance than in most other places because of the behaviour and activities of the security forces."
"If we are to find a way back into implementation of the roadmap then we need to discuss very carefully with the Israeli Government the terms of withdrawal and see how we can associate the management of the withdrawal with the objectives of the roadmap. Our aim must be that Israelis recognise again the Palestinian Authority as their partner in the peace process."
"The objective should be to hand over Gaza and parts of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority, not to Hamas, and to ensure that the handover takes place in an orderly fashion, not in a way that leads to more chaos and more violence."
"Finally, there are still – thank heaven – some moderates in Palestine, Israel and the Arab world."
"I ask this question as quietly and diplomatically as I can: how much support are we giving those moderates today?"
"If we are not prepared to be courageous for moderation, how can we expect them to be?"
"It is not hyperbolic to say that the outlook today in the region is more worrying than it has been for some time."
"It certainly seems to me a good deal more disturbing than it looked, for example, at the beginning of last year when we were being told that the road to peace in the Middle East lay in the military liberation of Baghdad and the installation of democracy in Iraq."
"Maybe one day Iraq will be stable and democratic and maybe it will be a beacon for other countries in the region."
"How could one hope for anything else?"
"Whatever one's views about the past, what else is there to work for?"
"However, if we are to have any chance of achieving that outcome and of encouraging modernisation and democracy in the whole region, then we have to avoid words and policies that alienate large parts of the Islamic world and threaten the very clash of civilisations which all sane men and women should want to avoid at all costs."
"It has been a deeply depressing feature of my five years as a Commissioner that the world I look out onto today seems to be far more dangerous than it was in 1999."
"We must always try to work for a better world and not throw in our hand in introverted despair."
"Today, among other things, we must see what we can rescue from what is left of the Middle East peace process."
"It is not a very encouraging prospect, but what alternative is there?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I think the start of the Commissioner's speech has made it clear that recent events require some interpretation."
"Do we regard the course set out in the roadmap as dead and buried following the meeting between Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush, or should we see new opportunities that can be exploited over the coming days, weeks and months?"
"I must admit that the Irish Presidency's initial reaction tends towards the first position, whereas the stance adopted by a number of foreign ministers in their statements leaned towards the second."
"I myself endorse the position adopted by the foreign ministers, including the German foreign minister, who said that this initiative brings movement into the process which we should now exploit."
"Despite all the scepticism that we might feel at the proposed withdrawal from Gaza that was outlined to us yesterday and again today by the two representatives of the Geneva initiative, the European Union should bring its influence to bear on the parties to the conflict, especially Israel, and make it clear that this withdrawal must be the first stage in its withdrawal from all the occupied territories."
"In that sense, the withdrawal is the right move."
"That being the case, a Prime Minister who is affiliated to the right wing in Israel and who may soon be responsible for ejecting settlers from their homes in Gaza by force needs a broader framework in which to explain his position."
"If the withdrawal from Gaza is indeed successful and the orderly handover to the Palestinian authority takes place as demanded yet again by the Commissioner a few moments ago, and if many of the homes currently being used are then offered to people from Gaza, and if the infrastructure is not dismantled but handed over to the Palestinian authority, this may well offer a fresh opportunity for peace."
"If we take the attitude that the whole thing is pointless and doomed to failure, we will have no chance of influencing the process. However, if we see this as a positive opportunity and work within it, I believe that the roadmap can be revitalised."
"Reading the US President's letter to the Israeli Prime Minister carefully, we see that the Israelis are also expected to play their part. The President himself refers to UN Security Council Resolution 242."
"The President himself also says that only negotiations can ultimately produce a solution."
"We should emphasise these passages of his letter in our further positions on this conflict."
"Let me make a second point. I believe that it is indeed the case that a solution to this conflict, which is not restricted solely to Gaza, can only be successful over the long term within two viable and independent states."
"The Commissioner also referred to the work of this Parliament in relation to the deployment of European funds."
"We have adopted two reports on this issue, a majority and a minority report, but there was 80% agreement on the findings."
"One of these findings can be shared with the House today: the accusation that the European Union has funded terrorism cannot be proven and is untenable."
"On the issue of whether the decision to provide direct financial assistance was right or wrong, we can adopt various positions."
"However, the decision was taken by the foreign ministers, not the Commissioner."
"The Commission has done its utmost to contribute to the reform of the Palestinian authority. It has been at pains to exercise control over the use of European funds, and we can confirm today that the situation in the Palestinian authority has indeed improved compared with three years ago."
"We must thank the Commission and Commissioner Patten for their work on this issue, notwithstanding the divergent political views on whether the decision was right or wrong."
"Mr President, paragraph 51 of this Parliament’s recent Resolution on the results of the European Council states that ‘without strong pressure on the two sides, the Road Map will remain ineffective’."
"Naturally, I believe that the Road Map is still ineffective and I wonder what has happened to the pressure on Israel."
"Parliament also calls on ‘the United States Administration to assume their responsibility vis-à-vis the present crisis’."
"In my opinion, that government has not only failed to assume its responsibilities, but has given in to the Israeli Government."
"Powell’s comments of last Thursday are, in my view, a mixture of absurd wishful thinking and cynicism, when he said that the meeting between Bush and Sharon has produced positive results for the Palestinians and their aspirations for a State."
"This is demonstrated by the fact that the minister without portfolio of the Israeli Government, Gideon Ezra, stated on Friday that Powell’s comments, intended to soften Bush’s pro-Israeli tone, do not reflect the opinion of Bush himself."
"Parliament’s Resolution also calls for both parties ‘to make a serious effort to resume genuine negotiations’."
"In my opinion, the Palestinian National Authority has been waiting for months for the resumption of those negotiations, but it is clear that Israel does not want to negotiate with the Palestinian National Authority and is prepared at this point, with the full support of Bush, to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza outside the framework of the Road Map."
"It has become sufficiently clear, in my view, that it is not a question of Gaza first and West Bank second, but of Gaza only."
"Following so many events we should remember another two paragraphs of our Resolution; paragraph 48, included following the killing of Sheikh Yassin, which: ‘calls on the Council and the Commission to consider acting in full compliance with Article 2 of the Association Agreement with Israel should the policy of extrajudicial killings continue’."
"Well, the extra-judicial executions are continuing, most recently of Abdel Aziz Rantisi."
"I therefore believe that Parliament must reiterate its request to the Council and the Commission."
"Also, finally, in paragraph 49 Parliament ‘asks the Council to invite the Member States in the UN Security Council immediately to table a proposal for an international peacekeeping force at the 1967 borders, with the mandate to protect both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples from terrorist attacks, military incursions and interventions’."
"We must also reiterate that demand."
"Mr President, after President Bush's endorsement of Mr Sharon's prejudgment of final status negotiations – ruling himself out as an even-handed peacebroker – it is easy to be discouraged about the prospects for the coexistence of a secure Israel and a viable Palestinian state, but that is the only real solution via the roadmap."
"It may well be that Israel keeping some key West Bank settlements and Palestinians accepting that the return of refugees will be to a Palestinian state – with which I personally agree – would indeed be part of an eventual negotiated settlement."
"The Quartet, with EU leadership, must disprove, however, Mr Sharon's claim that his plan constitutes a critical blow to Palestinian hopes of statehood."
"I am absolutely committed to the existence of Israel as a Jewish homeland and state – though one in which Arab Israelis have full, equal rights – and Israel's right to live in peace and security within recognised boundaries."
"My dismay at the occupation is not only about the misery of ordinary Palestinians but also how the role of colonial occupier is damaging Israel's integrity and its commitment to the rule of law."
"I condemn all terrorism against Israel and I do not see suicide bombers as purely the product of desperation among Palestinians – real though that desperation is."
"There is also exploitation of young people and a despicable culture of martyrdom in a perversion of Islam."
"The wall or fence might be capable of justification if it were on the Green Line – but it is not."
"The Bush-Sharon policy of military defeat will not ensure Israel's security."
"Hamas is a dangerous and uncompromising organisation dedicated to Israel's destruction, but the recent illegal assassinations of its leaders simply create more bitterness and recruits for terrorism."
"I am deeply worried about the rising incidence of anti-Semitism in Europe and take a strong interest in combating it, as well as other kinds of racial and religious prejudice."
"The delay by the EU Monitoring Centre in producing timely work on the threat to Europe's Jewish communities naturally fed suspicions about bias."
"We need renewed vigour in exposing and rooting out anti-Semitism and in establishing the dividing line between legitimate criticism of the policies of the Israeli Government and the demonisation of Jews."
"I understand the shock that Israelis must have felt at the poll last year that said that 59% of Europeans considered Israel a threat to world peace."
"I believe that many respondents read that question as being about the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, but it was deeply unhelpful to pose it in that way."
"However, the result was a wake-up call. We need a more intense EU-Israel dialogue."
"That is why I personally oppose any calls in the European Parliament to boycott Israel, and calls for cutting academic links are completely counterproductive."
"I have equally resisted moves to eliminate EU funding for the Palestinian Authority."
"I welcome the fact that it is Palestinians themselves calling for a clean-up of corruption, but Israel needs a negotiating partner and the sub-Saharan poverty level of Palestinians would be even greater without EU support."
"Finally, it is unworthy of Israel and its tradition of justice to persecute Mordechai Vanunu in a vindictive manner after his release."
"He has served his sentence and he should now be free."
"Mr President, today, Mordechai Vanunu is to be released."
"He is one of the heroes of our time, the man who confirmed that Israel has significant stocks of nuclear weapons that could turn the whole of the Middle East into a nuclear desert."
"For this achievement in the service of peace, his reward was to be kidnapped by the State of Israel and sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment."
"The surrounding world largely forgot him."
"Israel is allowed to possess its nuclear weapons in peace, while Arab and Muslim states that attempt to obtain protection for themselves against the threat of Israel’s nuclear weapons are bombed to smithereens and destroyed."
"Why does the world community not intervene in regard to Israeli nuclear weapons?"
"Why does the same not happen to Dimona as happened to Ossirak?"
"The unbalanced approach on the part of the world community is one of the reasons for the despair that now prevails in the Middle East, a feeling confirmed here in Parliament yesterday by two of the area’s foremost peace campaigners, Abraham Burg and Yassir Rabo."
"In , Egypt’s President Mubarak stated that hatred of the United States in the Arab world has never at any time been as strong as it is today."
"The United States backs Israel 100%."
"For that reason, the United States cannot bring about peace on its own."
"A better balance is needed, and the EU could bring this about by backing the Palestinians as strongly as the United States backs Israel."
"The EU could translate its words into deeds and implement Parliament’s call for the association agreement with Israel to be suspended."
"The EU could despatch troops to protect Palestinian areas."
"The EU could demand that Israel dismantle its stocks of nuclear weapons."
"The EU could issue an invitation to Vanunu and grant him asylum in the EU country of his choosing."
"The EU could go still further."
"Some years ago, I met Shimon Perez."
"He proposed that both Israel and Palestine should be offered EU membership, on condition that they had achieved a stable peace."
"Clearly, the EU has an attraction beyond its borders that it does not always have among its own Member States."
"Let us make use of the fact."
"Offer EU membership to Palestine and Israel as a reward for achieving a definitive peace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Vice-Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, I feel vicarious shame for the unilateral policy of Prime Minister Sharon, who is adding more and more fuel to the fire in the Middle East; indeed, throughout the world, as this is not a case of an isolated conflict; quite the reverse."
"The illegal executions of Hamas leaders will have a boomerang effect, and new leaders are always waiting in the wings."
"Sharon is only able to do this because of the unconditional support he obtains from President Bush."
"Things agreed in Washington are an affront to its partners in the Quartet, and the EU in particular."
"To my knowledge, the European Union has not been consulted once."
"We, the European Parliament, must demand that Javier Solana puts his foot down in his dealings with the Quartet."
"If the USA now wants support for Iraq, it must in turn come up with support for an international force in the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal, and in the West Bank as the following step."
"Solana could also put the Geneva Accord on the table."
"After all, Colin Powell has approved this, and it has his support."
"This must also be clarified."
"Avraham Burg, who was present in this House yesterday, once said that the roadmap had to be produced in Geneva."
"I think that, as a signal to the Palestinian people, we can demand an increase in the humanitarian aid we give to this impoverished people."
"Mr President, one thing I would like to emphasise in the few seconds that I have here today is that the European Union must be more forceful in its presentation of its position vis-à-vis the Middle East."
"It must make clear to Israel, to the Palestinians and indeed to the United States that we are serious about finding a solution."
"For that to happen, the international community, via the Quartet, has to act as an even-handed broker for peace."
"It is deeply regrettable that the United States administration, for purely electoral reasons, has decided to ditch the roadmap."
"We have to try and revive that, insofar as we can, and I wish the presidency luck with its efforts to achieve that over the next few weeks."
"However, we have one weapon in our hands which we have consistently refused to use or even to threaten to use, and that is the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel."
"What other weapon do we have in order to pressurise Israel to take its responsibilities seriously in that region?"
"There is no other way in my view that we can bring the Israelis to the negotiating table in a serious frame of mind."
"Certainly the decision of the US Government last week to play to the Sharon government has not resulted in the ending of its assassination policy."
"It has not resulted in the ending of its 'apartheid wall' policy or of its policy of strengthening settlements in the West Bank, all of which is a recipe for continued pain and disaster in the Middle East."
". I should like to thank all Members for their contributions to what has been a very important debate."
"I listened to the weariness in Commissioner Patten's voice when he was speaking."
"It is a weariness shared by us all in that we have to return the same issue over and over again."
"It saddens me to note that, in the three short weeks since we last debated this issue, the situation has become worse, not better."
"We are all depressed by the endlessly grim sequence of events in the region."
"This debate, however, gives us an opportunity to continue to remind all of the players and parties in the Middle East – to take up the point made by Mr De Rossa in his final contribution – that people must behave even-handedly and within the acceptable limits of international law."
"We should also take the opportunity to remind other parties that there is no alternative to full and impartial negotiation of a two-state solution, that this solution should result in a viable, contiguous and sovereign, independent Palestinian state, and that the roadmap is the only available way of achieving that."
"If I correctly heard Mr Laschet, he raised two points."
"First, I believe he suggested that the presidency views the roadmap as somehow dead."
"That is emphatically not the case."
"That is certainly not the view of this presidency."
"We have said time and again that the roadmap is the only viable way out of the current morass."
"Mr Laschet also seemed to suggest that we see no opportunity for movement arising from the Israeli plans for withdrawal from Gaza."
"That does not accurately reflect either the presidency's position or the position I stated at Tullamore."
"I reject the notion that European Union Member States are in any way disunited on the matter."
"There is absolute agreement within the Union on this."
"The Council of Ministers made that clear."
"The important, substantial and final statement unanimously agreed by the 25 ministers last weekend makes the position very clear."
"Questions arise as to whether the roadmap is dead."
"The roadmap remains the only framework; it is the only option available."
"There is nothing else available. That point has to be made clear."
"I am confident that not only is the roadmap as valid and as centrally relevant now as it was when it was first put in place, but its relevance, importance and significance must also continue to be reiterated, particularly when the Quartet meets – probably in New York on 4 May."
"The question was raised as to the plans to dismantle the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip."
"Again, the foreign ministers and the general affairs ministers made it clear that there are five elements in this area: first, withdrawal in Gaza must take place within the context of the roadmap; second, it must be seen as a step towards a two-state solution; third, it must not involve the transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; fourth, there must be an organised and negotiated handover to the Palestinian Authority; fifth, Israel must facilitate the humanitarian reconstruction of Gaza, in which the European Union has invested very heavily."
"The issue of anti-Semitism was raised."
"The ongoing difficulties in the region must never be allowed to become the basis for anti-Semitism to raise its head in Europe again."
"I agree with Baroness Ludford on that particular point."
"Her point has been taken. Last autumn the European Union took an unprecedented initiative at the UN General Assembly in proposing a stand-alone resolution condemning all manifestations of anti-Semitism."
"At the OSCE conference that will take place in Berlin on 28 and 29 April the Union will play its full and appropriate part in addressing and condemning this appalling phenomenon."
"Mr De Rossa has said a great deal on this issue with which I agree wholeheartedly."
"The European Union must be an even-handed player."
"Mr De Rossa is absolutely consistent and right about that."
"He is also right about the need for all the players to take a balanced view."
"However, I am not so sure that he was correct when he suggested that suspension of the Association Agreement is an appropriate tool."
"Suspension is not on the agenda at the moment."
"Consensus within the Union would be required for such a step."
"Those arguing that such an action should take place would have to consider the undesirable consequences arising from it."
"Article 2 of the Agreement reinforces obligations already incumbent on the signatories in respect of human rights."
"Perhaps we should emphasise that responsibility."
"Meetings of the Association Council with Israel provide the European Union with an opportunity to emphasise our concerns – and those stated so many times by Mr De Rossa – to the Israeli authorities."
"It is better to have a channel to do that."
"It would be wrong to let the debate pass without mentioning suicide bombings and terrorist attacks against Israel."
"The Israeli viewpoint, all too often, is that we are not mindful of their concerns."
"That is not the case."
"Suicide and terrorist attacks against civilian targets are condemned."
"They are an abomination. We all condemn them."
"Suicide bombings advance no legitimate agenda and can only do damage to the interests of the Palestinian people as well as causing further untold mayhem, damage and suffering to the Israeli people, which has suffered far too much in the past."
"We have to be even-handed in this."
"I believe that Europe is even-handed in this."
"I agree with Commissioner Patten that, if Europe yet again rebuilds what has been put in place to support the Palestinian people, the least we can expect is that the Israeli authorities should support, respect and protect that infrastructure."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations."
". Mr President, the transatlantic relationship is a co-element in Ireland's presidency programme and we are working very hard to reaffirm the strength, depth and the significance of that relationship, which will come as no surprise to anybody."
"Politically and economically the European Union and the United States have never been more interdependent."
"While it is not possible to be in full agreement on all issues – friends very seldom are, and a sign of mature friendship is that they can differ even on significant issues – it is important that any differences that exist are managed in a way which avoids damaging the overall relationship."
"We all know that the European Union and US relationship has been through a difficult period, not least over the policy on Iraq."
"There have been tensions and disagreements both across the Atlantic and indeed within Europe."
"It is good to remind ourselves from time to time that nobody has an absolute monopoly on wisdom."
"Similarly, on the way forward in the Middle East there have been differences in approach between the United States and the European Union."
"We are nonetheless prepared to keep working on the basis of the roadmap, including through the mechanism of the Quartet."
"For too long now, a negative image of the transatlantic relationship has been portrayed in certain circles and media."
"It often seems to be an iron law of the media that disagreement is more noteworthy than agreement."
"I suppose, in a sense, it is easy to see how disagreement makes good news – or certainly good copy."
"It is important, therefore, that we, as elected representatives, should inform our citizens that, overall, the transatlantic relationship is extremely productive and remains positive."
"In January the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, said in this Parliament – and we should remind ourselves of his words – that 'the world is a better and a safer place when the European Union and the United States work together, when they pool their considerable energy and resources to achieve our shared goals based on our shared values.'"
"The Irish presidency is focusing on pragmatic cooperation with our US partners and pragmatism, rather than ideology, should inform our approach."
"We are trying to work closely together on many foreign policy areas, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, Afghanistan, the Middle East and the western Balkans – to single out just a few of the dossiers in which we have a common interest and to single out just a few of the areas where we are working closely together."
"We will not agree on all those areas, but at least we are working along similar lines."
"On economic and trade issues in particular, it is important to put any transatlantic differences into perspective."
"Ireland, during its presidency, is seeking to focus on the positive economic agenda between the United States and the European Union, while effectively managing the small number of outstanding disputes which account for slightly less than 3% or of our overall trade policies."
"I want to take this opportunity to address one particular point of immediate concern in terms of our relationship with the United States."
"I followed very closely the debate in this Parliament on the international agreement with the United States on the transfer of passenger information."
"I am conscious of the concerns that have been raised, including the concerns about the need to protect citizens' rights to privacy and to redress in the event of error."
"I fully understand the point made by Members that it important to have a way of addressing errors in the PNR area."
"I am also conscious of the need to address the very real concerns that exist in the US about the terrorist threat."
"This time last week I was in New York and, for the very first time, went to the scene of the horror at the World Trade Center."
"I have been in New York four times since 9/11 and I have always avoided going down there, because I, as we all did, watched what happened on the television, and I did not wish to see the pain."
"So I understand in that context why the United States and why certain factions of people within the United States see the need to adopt a very stringent role and attitude in their response to terrorism and, in particular, why they are concerned about this issue."
"Let me make myself clear: I believe that the Commission has worked long and hard to ensure that the draft agreement strikes a balance between the rightful concerns to protect personal privacy and the need to increase security in the air for all passengers across the Atlantic."
"I accept and respect that not all Members of this House think that the balance has been properly struck."
"However, I would make the point to them that the Commission has to be commended for its work."
"Mr Watson mentioned another agreement and said that this is an agreement which may be the best-worst solution, but it is the solution that is available."
"He was talking about Cyprus."
"These words may well apply also to the agreement on which this House will vote shortly."
"I believe the Commission has done as well as it could be expected to do and that the agreement on offer is the best we are going to get; certainly much better than we will get if we enter into some form of stasis and stand-off situation with the US authorities on this in the next few hours, because in reality they will take the decisions that they believe are necessary for their security."
"I do not believe that if a European citizen on holiday in Florida has to queue for 18 or 19 hours in the heat of the day waiting for clearance they will thank any of us if we take an ill-informed decision."
"That is not to say that I do not respect the views of Members – of course I do."
"I have listened and I have read a great deal of the correspondence that has been exchanged over the last 48 hours here."
"I have discussed the issue and my concerns with Members."
"I understand fully and I appreciate the concerns."
"Of course people want to protect civil liberties but we also want to protect the reality and the reality is that if we make the wrong decision very few people in Europe will be thanking us in a month's time."
"Having said that, I respect any decision that this Parliament makes."
"The deal which has been worked out by the Commission is a necessary one."
"In the circumstances it is a good deal."
"The status quo is unsustainable."
"Failure to support the draft agreement opens the way to uncertainty, particularly uncertainty for the airline industry."
"It will be detrimental to the interests and the needs of passengers."
"That is the important point."
"I accept the concerns and the anxiety that we should have safeguards, certainly that there should be a finality on information that is transferred, but we need to take practical political decisions."
"We are politicians in a political assembly and we should take decisions."
"A balanced deal and the opportunity to work and put in place a good and balanced deal as soon as possible are things that we should all work for."
"The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Brian Cowen, led the European Union Troika for the successful EU-US ministerial meeting in Washington on 1 March."
"It met with US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and with the National Security Adviser, Condoleeza Rice. Their discussions were extensive and frank and they covered a range of international issues of shared concern."
"In fact anybody who knows Minister Cowen will know that any discussion he enters into is usually frank, vigorous and to the point."
"It is in the same spirit of partnership that the Taoiseach looks forward to welcoming President Bush to Ireland for the US-EU summit in June, a summit meeting which I know will bring added value to the relationship."
"It is a summit which has been criticised in some places, but the reality of it is that the United States exists and Europe exists and it would be foolhardy in the extreme if we did not continue to debate and discuss our relationship."
"The other vital pillar of the transatlantic relationship is of course the European Union's close and productive relationship with Canada."
"In fact when we talk about the transatlantic relationship we all too often forget that reality."
"From our shared history and from our shared values, from political pluralism and democracy and the rule of law, as well as on human rights, there was so much evidence of our firm attachment to the United Nations and to multilateralism."
"Europe and Canada have a great deal in common and the relationship between Europe and Canada is a close one."
"It is a productive relationship and it is one that requires recognition by both sides from time to time."
"It is in this context that the very successful EU-Canada summit in Ottawa on 18 March saw the launch of two major new initiatives – the EU-Canada Partnership Agenda and the framework of a new bilateral trade and investment enhancement agreement."
"The summit in Ottawa also gave a chance for the President of the Council and Prime Minister Martin to lead their EU and Canadian teams in wide-ranging discussions on major international issues, including looking at ways to promote effective global governance through revitalised international institutions."
"I should say – from personal experience of having worked for a very brief time with CEDA in Canada – that the Canadians bring a huge amount to the table in this particular regard, something which they do quietly and unobtrusively and which is all too frequently ignored."
"In closing I want to say that I am very conscious that our transatlantic dialogue is formed more than by just what happens at official and government levels."
"For this reason we were very happy two weeks ago to host in Ireland the 58th interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the US Congress under the joint chairmanship of Mr Nicholson and Henry Hyde."
"It was my very great pleasure to actually host one of those meetings and it was a quite remarkable exchange."
"I want to commend the Members of this House for this particular initiative."
"It is very important that this House continues to have a very lively dialogue with Congress, because my own personal experience is that all too often in Congress Europe is seen through a very hazy glass."
"The type of one-to-one relationship which this House has established with its counterparts in Congress is very welcome."
"As I said, I witnessed the exchanges at first hand."
"They are healthy, positive and productive."
"I had the opportunity to meet the MEPs involved."
"The debates were quite extraordinarily wide-ranging and, as the meeting was held in Ireland, much of it went on in my own constituency."
"A good time was had by all as well and there is no harm in that!"
"The presidency is fully aware of how closely Parliament is involved in taking the transatlantic relationship forward."
"We celebrate and commend that good work."
"I realise that some of the words I have said will not fall easily on some of the ears in this House, but they are made against the background that friends can sometimes disagree, even on important issues."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by supporting the presidency's commendation of Irish hospitality."
"Having spent the weekend at two conferences in Ireland myself, I can warmly endorse what the Minister said and I also warmly endorse his other remarks, not least what he said about our relations with Canada."
"When one has problem-free relationships, it very often means that one does not discuss them sufficiently or with sufficient enthusiasm."
"However we did set out last year, in a Commission document, some sensible proposals about beefing-up our trade and investment relationship with Canada."
"Those were sensible proposals that were well received by our Canadian friends."
"From the Middle East to the other trouble spots around the world we invariably see eye-to-eye with our Canadian friends who, I think, very much accept our notion of effective multilateralism."
"So I was pleased that the Minister referred to that important relationship."
"I am obviously grateful for the opportunity to commend once again the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for its commitment – demonstrated by this resolution – to the evolution and strengthening of transatlantic ties."
"It is a testament to this House's maturity and common sense that, amidst the emotions of a turbulent 18 months, it has maintained a positive and objective approach."
"That this relationship remains the keystone in the European Union's external relations is not to be doubted."
"We have often talked in this Chamber not only about the stakes involved – the enormous flow of goods, services and investment and the millions of jobs that depend on them – but also about how this partnership is indispensable for promoting democracy, overcoming regional instability and coping with global challenges."
"It is worth recalling some of the remarkable achievements there have been in the area of economic cooperation."
"Mutual recognition agreements have removed technical barriers in fields ranging from telecommunications to marine equipment."
"We have entered into bilateral agreements on customs procedures and veterinary equivalents."
"We are progressing in discussions on the regulatory dialogue in financial markets, removing obstacles for our operators in this ever more integrated industry."
"We are well advanced in negotiations on a cooperation agreement for Galileo and GPS and we are moving towards an open aviation area agreement."
"Despite all these successes much still remains to be done in pressing forward regulatory convergence."
"Neither the transatlantic economic partnership nor the positive economic agenda have developed as fully as we would have liked in removing barriers."
"We are therefore considering a joint EU-US review of the transatlantic economy, to report to the 2005 EU-US summit with a view to identifying impediments to further economic integration and to addressing the means for removing them."
"We have talked too about the importance of the relationship beyond the confines of the transatlantic community."
"After the strains in our relationship last year it has now become clear to all that we face common challenges which we will overcome far more effectively in combination than in competition."
"This of course implies that we have the political will in the European Union to unite our positions, and that we have in addition the capacity to act."
"The language of transatlantic cooperation can often seem tired and clichéd."
"That is no reason to allow these important truths to go unsaid or to be drowned out by the discordant notes of those whom, for whatever reason, look to divide Europe and the United States."
"In this spirit, I welcome the priorities set out in the resolution, many of which are familiar and match those on which we are working in the run-up to the EU-US Summit to which the Minister referred."
"I would like to single out very briefly three issues which are referred to in the resolution. First of all, HIV/AIDS."
"The European Union and the United States have both welcomed last years World Trade Organisation decision on the TRIPS agreement and public health."
"We must now implement this decision in legislative form without delay, with the active support of our business communities."
"We must ensure that the Global Health Fund can build on sustained and reliable sources of funding."
"In order to address the root causes of the pandemic in Africa, we are looking to European Union and US investors to establish a partnership to promote the improvement of health care where they operate in Africa, and we clearly need to do more together to tackle poverty there."
"Second, a brief word on China and Russia."
"Russia's proximity to Europe and the speed and scale of economic development in China suggests that we must continue to engage closely with both."
"Continuing political engagement and a range of financial instruments demonstrate our determination to encourage Russia's development as a stable, prosperous democracy."
"We will continue to encourage China to take a greater role in international affairs concomitant with its expanding economic capacity and interests."
"I hope we can encourage our US friends to regard China's stability and economic development as a good thing for all of us, rather than as a threat."
"We discussed the Middle East earlier, and I will not dwell on the arguments that we analysed an hour or so ago with some sadness."
"I will simply say that we have to encourage modernisation throughout the region along the sort of lines now suggested in two UNDP reports."
"We have to support Arab initiatives and Arab ownership of modernisation and democratisation, and must develop the plans that we already have in place – for example through the Euromed partnership – rather than believing it necessary to introduce new institutional arrangements."
"I would in particular like to underline the importance that Commissioner Lamy and I attach to the successful conclusion, as soon as possible, of a free trade agreement between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"I repeat that, by and large, we are more likely to achieve most of the things we want to achieve in the world if we can work with the United States."
"It is also true – though perhaps not as often conceded – that the United States is more likely to be able to achieve what it wants if it is able to work with us."
"We agree that there is much for the European Union and the US to do both in terms of our bilateral dealings and in cooperation in the wider world."
"The extent to which this requires the establishment of new structures or working methods is more difficult to judge."
"However, I note that since the launch of the New Transatlantic Agenda in 1995 the mechanisms of the relationship have served us well."
"The ups and downs we have experienced have been the result not of the institutions of the NTA but of genuine policy disagreements."
"They have not been the result of procedural failure or systemic failure."
"Where we have seen the need for changes we have been quite pragmatic."
"For example, we are about to launch an enhanced security dialogue with the United States, which should reduce the scope for confusion and confrontation on a range of transport and other protective security matters."
"Though I follow what the President-in-Office said in his extremely sensitive remarks about the issue of passenger name records, I am not quite sure what sort of dialogue the United States would expect us to carry forward if on this issue – which we have put a lot of effort into resolving – we were now to either scupper the prospects of an agreement or to put it on the backburner for the indefinite future."
"Do we wish to be taken seriously in this realm or not?"
"With elections looming here and in the United States, with a new Commission to be appointed in the autumn and with the Constitutional Treaty coming over the horizon, I would argue that this is not necessarily the right time for a really radical change."
"However, I totally accept that just as we need to look at the workings of the transatlantic economy, we should also review the workings of the New Transatlantic Agenda."
"To that effect, I am about to launch an independent study of the New Transatlantic Agenda which, in turn, should form the basis of an EU-US policy review in 2005."
"I believe that is the right timing."
"I respect those who take a different point of view, but hope we all recognise that we are working towards the same objectives."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thinks it essential to view the excellent and close relations that exist above all between the EU and the United States, though, in a broader context, between Europe and North America, as has been reiterated here, as a key factor in maintaining global peace and economic growth."
"If these, the two largest economic and military players in the world, were to come into permanent conflict, as unlikely as that may be, it would be a global disaster."
"That is why our group, in any political or economic disagreements that happen to arise, tries to look ahead and find solutions rather than point the finger."
"We are indeed concerned by many things."
"The unilateralism shown by the American leadership, one example of which is the Iraq war and its aftermath, and the policy President Bush’s administration has pursued which we think has recently only taken the interests of Israel into account, cannot have our approval."
"We cannot put this right, however, by terminating the framework agreement that exists between Israel and the EU or by just blaming the United States."
"We must try to find a way back to democracy, one in which global multilateralism and using the United Nations, and increasing its prestige, form a basis for solving crises."
"Good signs of this are already visible in America’s attitude to the forthcoming Iraqi administration under the supervision of the UN."
"Bad signs, on the other hand, are still almost exclusively visible in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and that is why the EU needs to be ever more active there."
"We also disagree about many trade policy and immaterial rights issues."
"For example, America’s unilateral approach to applying the concept of dumping is not in harmony with good trade practices, but protectionism."
"Under the expert leadership of Commissioner Pascal Lamy, the EU has endeavoured to remove barriers to speeding up the World Trade Organisation Doha round of trade talks."
"The United States on the one hand is a good partner in these negotiations, but on the other hand it also constitutes a certain barrier itself with its own system of rotational aid for agriculture and industry."
"By this I do not mean that the blame always lies elsewhere and not with us."
"We also have to open up our markets in this sense to a greater extent than previously."
"Once again, problems will be solved through dialogue, not through an escalating trade war."
"I wish furthermore to stress that the values we share, as has been often been said here, on which both continents – I am including Canada here – will build their future, democracy, freedoms and rights of the individual, human rights, a society based on statutory law, the market economy with its system of free enterprise, are such a wide basis for the development of natural, lasting and good relations between us, that conflicting interests can surely be settled."
"I am sure that speakers from our group will follow in my tracks and address many of the individual issues that make up transatlantic relations."
"Mr President, many fine words have been said once again about relations between Europe and the United States."
"I nevertheless remain somewhat sceptical when I look at the reality."
"Relations between Europe and the United States have been better."
"The US Government often takes little notice of its transatlantic partners."
"US policy is characterised by unilaterality and ever changing coalitions."
"Iraq has proved a divisive issue, and a major role for the UN in that country still seems a long way off."
"Earlier this morning, we discussed the Middle East."
"President Bush’s support for Prime Minister Sharon and the latter’s unilateral policy has – rightly – been poorly received here."
"The EU is clearly not a serious partner for the US on this issue."
"Nobody is intent on a genuine split between the United States and the European Union."
"We have a good deal in common, and together we could obtain more for each other in the world."
"Things would perhaps be better under a subsequent US Government, but in my opinion the trends run deeper."
"Today, we are discussing an agenda for transatlantic dialogue."
"This dialogue is necessary now more than ever, but it must be an open dialogue and not one in which one side only talks and rarely listens."
"Indeed, it is particularly important that we do not gloss over the differences between ourselves and the US."
"In the field of international security, a number of priorities can be seen, including Iraq and what we can learn from this."
"The first lesson, of course, is that something like this should never happen again, and another is that we must return to a full role for the United Nations, which must assume political leadership of the reconstruction of the country as soon as possible."
"Furthermore, we must cooperate on the resolution of the Middle-East conflict, keeping to the roadmap."
"Unless President Bush adopts a much more critical attitude towards the policy of Prime Minister Sharon – for example the security fence, the Gaza Strip and the assassination of Hamas leaders – it is unlikely that much will come of US cooperation with the EU."
"We also want an effective approach to international terrorism, but not just on US terms."
"What we want is that priority be given to a multilateral approach to international problems."
"We want pre-emptive engagement, as Javier Solana calls it, instead of pre-emptive wars."
"We want a strengthening of the United Nations and, in particular, a strengthening of the international legal order."
"We must therefore remain committed to the work of the International Criminal Court and the support that the European Union has given this all along."
"We also want a serious approach to disarmament initiatives."
"We must enter into dialogue with the US on all of these issues, but we must also remain committed to our own strength."
"We must be pragmatic, yet pursue our own aims."
"Where the US stresses military supremacy, we envisage a role for the European Union as, say, a civil superpower."
"– Mr President, I hope that I am not disturbing too many of the private conversations that are going on. I wish to state, however, that transatlantic cooperation must be strengthened and expanded for the benefit of the US, of the EU and of the whole world."
"Through cooperation, the greatest military and economic power in the world must show the whole world the way to security, peace, democracy, justice and prosperity."
"This cooperation is currently being put to the test in the fight against terrorism. It is here and now that confirmation must be provided that there is more that unites the US and the EU than separates them."
"Consequently, this topic must be high up on the agenda of the EU/US Summit, where a far-sighted common framework and action plan for the fight against terrorism should be established."
"The UN must have a prominent role in this struggle, and we must emphasise that the struggle is to be conducted with respect for human rights and international law. In this connection, I would once again draw attention to the prisoners being held at the Guantánamo Bay naval base, who have a right to a fair trial."
"We must strengthen and expand our cooperation but, as friends of the US, we must also be able to speak out when we disagree with the US Government."
"That is what we must do right now on the issue of passenger list information, which the Presidency has discussed and which is also part of the war on terror. We must also stand firm in our assertion that fundamental rights must be respected in this matter."
"The Commission is evidently in the process of transferring a piece of US legislation to the EU – bypassing the European Parliament, the national parliaments and presumably also the US Congress."
"As regards the attitude to the situation in the Middle East, we must also speak out against the latest pronouncements by President Bush."
"Any change to the boundaries dating back to before 1967 can only be recognised if it is the result of negotiation between the two parties."
"It is not something that Mr Sharon and President Bush can decide between them."
"Rather, we must call for the existing Road Map, to which the Quartet has given its support, to be abided by."
"Once again, yesterday, we heard in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy about the Geneva initiative for peace in the Middle East, a highly commendable initiative that should be brought into the discussion."
"The forthcoming summit between the EU and the US will be the first following EU enlargement."
"Europe will appear stronger and more united."
"The EU’s position on the international political stage has been strengthened, and we must exploit this situation in order to improve our necessary and desirable cooperation with the US."
"I hope I have not interrupted too many of your conversations."
"I apologise to our colleague for the level of noise before the vote."
"Mr President, I would ask you in future to intervene should such a situation arise as that which occurred while Mr Andreasen was speaking."
"This circus in which Members stand around holding private conversations, quite unconcerned, whilst someone is speaking is disgraceful."
"In my view, these Members are behaving outrageously and downright stupidly and unintelligently when they show no respect for others when they are speaking."
"Consequently,I would ask you to intervene in future and remove from the Chamber those Members who cannot work this out."
"Colleagues, on Wednesday 31 March I made a statement to the House about a number of newspaper articles and television reports concerning allegations made about Members of this House, purportedly on the basis of interviews and comments given by one of our Members, Mr Hans-Peter Martin."
"I informed the House at that time that when allegations are made, they are thoroughly and promptly investigated by the relevant services and appropriate action is taken."
"I went on to invite Mr Martin, if he had information concerning possible wrongdoing, misuse of funds or irregularities, to draw these to my attention so that they could be appropriately investigated."
"It was his duty as a Member of the House."
"Belatedly, late on Monday night, he sent me a letter that makes detailed criticisms of the allowance system that we have for Members."
"He further makes specific allegations – two concerning meetings of a political group outside the working places – and he also lists 7 000 cases where Members have claimed allowances in circumstances which he claims to be inappropriate, for example, when Members have signed the central attendance register and not attendance lists for parliamentary meetings."
"As regards the specific points, I have asked the political group concerned to give me further information about the two meetings indicated."
"On the more general point of the central attendance register, it is clear to me that Mr Martin is criticising the system and a specific Rule."
"However, there is no indication whatsoever that Members have broken the Rules of this House."
"On the wider point, he fails to acknowledge the important progress that has been made by Parliament in reforming our rules and regulations to ensure greater transparency and accountability and to respond promptly to any points that have been brought to our attention by the Court of Auditors in its annual or specific reports and which have highlighted possible shortcomings in our rules."
"Specific reforms on travel allowances, on the secretarial allowance and other allowances have been decided by the Bureau and by the Quaestors under the presidencies of Mr Hänsch, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, Mrs Fontaine and also during my mandate."
"At the outset of my mandate I sought a global reform based on two main elements: firstly, fair treatment of Members of this House on the basis of equality, and secondly, transparency on allowances to be based on costs incurred."
"Until the beginning of this year we, in Parliament, were hopeful because we had made the compromises necessary, that the Council could agree to this package."
"At the very last moment a minority of Member States blocked this reform."
"That has not prevented the Bureau and other bodies of this House from examining further reforms on an incremental basis."
"It would have been more helpful and, in my view, more fruitful had Mr Martin associated himself with this drive for reform in committee and in plenary ..."
"... rather than by conducting a campaign, the main purpose of which appears to have been to seek to discredit the institution, to call into question the honour of Members of this House and to wreak maximum damage – on zero evidence – to individuals, their careers and their families."
"In the times in which we live, it is very easy to blacken the reputation of public figures."
"It is extremely difficult to counteract slurs and partial information once these have been launched in certain sections of the media."
"The Rules of this House are a work in progress."
"Historically, we are still a relatively new Parliament and are constantly evolving."
"From May onwards, we have to find systems that are fair for elected representatives from 25 Member States."
"One area that has not been regulated concerns the behaviour of Members."
"It is my personal view, however, that the secret filming of Members and the secret recording of their conversations is unacceptable in every circumstance, most of all when it is done by a fellow Member."
"These are methods that are reminiscent of another time and another place."
"When we talk about standards of behaviour in this House, the way in which we behave towards each other is an important consideration in those standards."
"This House has always stood up for the rights of whistle-blowers, but we also expect whistle-blowers to exhaust the available and proper procedures."
"Here, it appears to me that no attempt has been made to use the normal procedures of this House, which have been bypassed in a grotesque attempt to maximise personal publicity."
"I shall reply to Mr Martin in detail."
"The specific cases that he raises will be looked into with the cooperation of the Members and the Groups concerned."
"But let me repeat that on the basis of what he has sent to me, there is zero evidence to support his claims of wrongdoing or breaches of the Rules."
"Let me place on the record my deep personal disapproval of the methods employed by our esteemed colleague."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today."
"I have been mentioned so often here in plenary in recent weeks, but this is the first time I have had the chance to speak to my fellow Members here in the House."
"You are correct, Mr President: at your written request, I submitted a dossier of information to you."
"You claim that there is no indication whatsoever that Members have broken the rules of this House."
"I have made it clear in all the statements I have made – and this is a very important point – that I have evidence of more than 7 200 cases where colleagues have falsely claimed a daily allowance."
"To what extent this is regarded as a violation of the rules is a matter for you and others to judge."
"Nonetheless, Mr President, in my letter to you, I presented a number of cases in great detail – one being the meeting of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in Berlin on 10 May 2001, which you have mentioned – and asked you to indicate or clarify which rule governs conduct of this nature."
"I remember you from our personal discussions before you took up your present office and at that time too, you had my support and vote as someone who was very reform-minded."
"You supported me on numerous issues – as we discussed at the time – and acknowledged that I was right in many instances, as with the campaign on parliamentary reform with which you were associated and which you often took up as an issue."
"I resolutely refute your statement that there is zero evidence for the allegations that I have made to you, and I also refute the suggestion that I am launching a campaign."
"I hope that the public will hear this reaction."
"I would ask you to take this reaction into consideration by granting me a few extra seconds in addition to the speaking time that I am allowed."
"I refute the suggestion that I am launching a campaign."
"This is a European initiative for transparency, and to claim that I have no proof while criticising my methods is a contradiction."
"Lawyers, colleagues, citizens and voters have said to me that I will have to provide detailed proof."
"That is why the footage was taken, and what I have done is no different from the actions of the President of the EU Summit in Denmark in 2002, who adopted the same approach in order to reveal the internal workings of the EU Summit."
"That was broadcast and discussed."
"I believe that reformers and critics should not be silenced. We will continue our work."
"I know that many colleagues would like to speak on this matter but we do not have time to have a debate."
"Mr Martin, you continue to allege the unscrupulous claiming of expenses."
"Your evidence of this unscrupulous behaviour named me. I reject the imputation and the slur on my personal character."
"Those who seek to promote transparency should cease to skulk in the corridors and secretly record and film their colleagues."
"Mr President, I would like to say firstly that you have the support and the thanks of the Socialist Group for the statement you have just made."
"Having said that, I would like to refer to the point of order I raised this morning at 9 a.m., at the beginning of the session, jointly with other group presidents, with regard to the re-inclusion of the Boogerd-Quaak report on freedom of expression and information in today's vote."
"I raised the issue this morning and I leave it to the Presidency to choose when it can be dealt with in depth."
"Mr Barón Crespo, we shall deal with that later."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I wish to protest again this year that the amendment tabled by my delegation on the 2005 calendar, which seeks to end this charade of coming to Strasbourg every month at gross expense to the European Union taxpayer, has been declared inadmissible."
"Mr President, I think you should refer the matter to the European Court of Justice."
"Mr President, Strasbourg is a beautiful and historic city but, for those of us living some distance away, it is extremely difficult to access."
"Colleagues should be aware that if they vote in favour of Amendment 2, they are voting in favour of adding Friday sittings to the Strasbourg calendar next year."
"I should like to remind colleagues that on Monday afternoon I informed the House of the contents of a letter sent to me by the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, in relation to the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the handling of personal data by air carriers."
"On Monday, Commissioner Bolkestein made some introductory remarks to the House on the matter."
"Yesterday, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report was discussed in plenary and Commissioner Patten spoke in that debate."
"We shall not vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report on air passenger data now; that vote will be taken as planned in the voting order."
"I am now asking for the advice of the House on the question of whether to make a referral to the Court of Justice."
"Many in the House will have heard Commissioner Bolkestein on Monday, but will not have heard a view from the Commission in the light of the full debate."
"I do not want to open a debate, but perhaps Commissioner Patten would like to say a few words on the specifics."
". Mr President, I have never knowingly turned down the opportunity of addressing this many people – a number slightly higher than the crowd I normally draw!"
"As you have said, Mr President, I spoke at what the leader of one Group regarded as inordinate length on this issue in the middle of the night, when the few of us here would have preferred to be where I am sure everybody else was: in their own bed."
"Perhaps I could have phrased that better."
"Perhaps very briefly I can make three points in response, bearing in mind that I was criticised the other day on the grounds that my virtue was that I said what I thought, but that my vice was what I thought."
"However, I will very briefly say what I think."
"First of all, as the Minister said earlier in the debate on the United States, if we had been through what New York went through in September 2001, we would have wanted our government to do everything possible to secure our freedom, to secure us against atrocity."
"Secondly, I do not pretend that the agreement we have negotiated in good faith is perfect – alas, we are not in the business of perfection – but I think it is an extremely sensible proposal and it has, I believe, resulted in a number of proposals being made which Parliament pressed for and we have been able to secure."
"I will not go through them all."
"Thirdly, let us be clear what will happen if we have to delay this for months or do not have it at all: complete disarray for the next few months, airlines facing financial chaos, people waiting in queues without any of the protection that we have managed to secure."
"I do not think that those people or those airlines will be singing Te Deums to thank the supporters of a motion to put off any decision for months."
"I had not meant to intervene, on this occasion, but I hope that people will think very seriously about the consequences of this and the consequences for our credibility when it comes to negotiating in the security area with the United States."
"Mr President, I enjoy listening to Commissioner Patten speak, but this particular speech was too much."
"Commissioner, the issue may be clear to you, but it is also clear to us."
"We want consultation of the Court of Justice because we are prepared to fight terrorism, but we are not prepared to fight against people's rights to confidentiality."
"This is part of our European identity."
"We will not cede our European identity to the American way."
"It is a vote for Europe, which approaches liberty and justice in a different way: the right way."
"Mr President, this House has discussed on a number of occasions the matter of the Commission's proposed agreements with the United States."
"The House has expressed its own willingness to reach agreement with the United States on exchange of data on air passengers in a proper international agreement, to be approved by Congress and by this House, to ensure that we get the right balance between data protection and an effective fight against terrorism."
"The Commission is deeply divided on this matter, and is unable even to claim adequacy because it does not know about the circumstances in which the Americans can refer data to third countries."
"We are seeking the advice of the Court of Justice on whether this is compatible with our own laws and our own Treaties."
"I advise this House to think very carefully and to refer it to the Court."
"Mr President, I do not believe what has just happened to be reasonable;"
"I do not believe it to be reasonable that speakers should have the opportunity to express, in front of all the Members of this House, an opinion contrary to that of Commissioner Patten on the referral to the Court of Justice, when we have spent months discussing it here."
"We did not have the opportunity that Commissioner Patten had yesterday, of speaking in front of a larger audience; we had our opportunity in the in-depth work carried out in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"There is a favourable opinion from the previous plenum about referral to the Court of Justice; there is a favourable opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs; we should have referred the matter to the Court by now."
"Let us stop this, please."
"It is not acceptable."
"And let us move on at last to the vote, because this will ensure that there is no further opportunity to change what until today has been the majority position in this House."
"We accept it, but do it now, please."
"Mr President, the agreement improves the legal position of European passengers, and I would like to make it quite clear – and Commissioner Patten has announced what will happen – that we will place the responsibility firmly on the shoulders of those responsible for this chaos."
"We will make it clear to Europe's citizens exactly who has curtailed their rights in this area."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, I should just like to say that the current situation is illegal and that a proposal for reform is not credible when it comes from those who have so far been unable to enforce the existing form."
"The United States has the right to ask for any data it likes before flights; this has to be done, however, through procedures that conform to our rules."
"The United States, if it wished, could even reintroduce compulsory visas: it can do that."
"What it cannot do is take data collected for commercial purposes and use them for security purposes."
"It is not a matter of the United States being bad."
"No Member State, no European government could do that."
"I do not think, therefore, that we can tolerate a situation where a state that is not a European Union member can do something that a Member State cannot."
". Mr President, it is not a question of whether or not an agreement should be concluded;"
"Parliament has said all along that an agreement should be concluded."
"Rather, what we want is an agreement to be concluded that has the approval of Parliament, as Mr Bolkestein promised us in September of last year."
"We are asking the Court of Justice to take care of this and to ensure that we are able to exercise our rights, so that we can block parts of the agreement – the transferring of data to third countries by the United States, to name but one – if we believe that they are not currently possible."
"I hope, therefore, that Parliament will continue to follow the course outlined."
"On this occasion I intend to exercise my own right to vote and will vote for the primacy of politics."
"I shall do my duty and refer the matter to the Court later today."
"Mr President, referral to the Court is not something that we would have chosen."
"The Commission promised to consult us under Article 300 with the power of assent."
"The Commission has not fulfilled that promise and, therefore, we have had to use a very blunt instrument to try to maintain democracy within this Union."
"On behalf of the House I should like to welcome to the official gallery a Rwandan delegation, led by the President of the Rwandan Parliament, who attended a ceremony here yesterday to mark the atrocities of one decade ago."
"You are very welcome here in the European Parliament."
"I now turn to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report on the freedom of expression, which I was invited to address earlier today."
"I shall point out a number of elements that have been drawn to my attention."
"We have 338 amendments."
"I referred a request to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to consider the amendments under Rule 130a."
"I have received a report back from the committee."
"All the amendments tabled have received favourable votes from at least one-tenth of the members of the committee and so, under the Rules of Procedure, the amendments are entitled to stand."
"I had received a letter from Mr Podestà requesting that the report be declared inadmissible."
"I replied to Mr Podestà and I sent a copy of our correspondence to the Civil Liberties Committee."
"I felt that, under the Rules, certain parts of the text could be reviewed, possibly involving the publication of a corrigendum; but that the report, as such, was admissible."
"Before the debate yesterday, I received a request from Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, to apply Rule 143 on the inadmissibility of the matter."
"The Vice-President in the Chair at the time ruled out this request because no notification had been given 24 hours in advance and because I, as President, had already decided that the report was admissible."
"I have since received a letter from Mr Poettering requesting a review of the decision not to refer the report back to committee."
"In his letter, Mr Poettering asks me once again to review the possibility of referral back, using the prerogatives and powers of the Presidency."
"In sticking to my decision, I am encouraged by the comments I have received from the chairman of the Civil Liberties Committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, who pointed out that the political groups shared my evaluation on the issue of admissibility in terms of the report overall."
"I thus intend to hold to the view that the report is indeed admissible in its totality, although some corrections may be required."
"I am prepared to take a vote on the referral back before the start of the vote on the report."
"This is in accordance with the Rules, it is not a question of personal preference."
"The House can do this at any time and we need to respect that fact."
"So, why are we not voting right now?"
"Here we begin a rather sorry story."
"Yesterday the services received 51 pages of requests for roll-call, split and separate votes for the Boogerd-Quaak report on the freedom of expression and information."
"This would amount to a total of 1 200 single votes, in addition to the 338 amendments, resulting in a vote that could last for four hours or more."
"Secondly, under these conditions, it was physically impossible for the services to prepare the vote overnight in time for voting today."
"At the end of the debate last night, the Vice-President in the Chair therefore announced that the report would be voted on Thursday."
"I have been looking into the matter – not just because it was raised today, but also because of its complexity – on the basis of the powers conferred on me, as President, by our Rules, especially the interpretation of Rule 19(1), which confers on the President 'the power to put texts to the vote in an order other than that set out in the document to be voted on', and also Rule 130 concerning the order of voting on amendments."
"I also fully recognise the rights of groups to table requests under our Rules."
"On this basis I wish to propose to you the following package. First, the vote would take place tomorrow at noon."
"Second, I shall allow a normal vote on all amendments, but no split votes and no roll-call votes on them."
"I shall also allow all requests for split votes concerning the original paragraphs of the motion for a resolution, but I shall allow only one roll-call vote per paragraph, according to indications supplied by Groups."
"This, I regret to inform you, would still give a total of 600 votes and a voting time that could last for two hours. It would, however, mean that this suggestion would rule out 1000 split votes on the amendments."
"In making this proposal to you I am trying to strike a balance between the rights of different Groups in the House and the preferences of one or another to try to conduct our business in a reasonably orderly fashion."
"I am prepared to put my proposal to you in accordance with Rule 19."
"If the House rejects the proposal I shall decide on the basis of Rule 130(3) to put to the vote first the original text of the report, paragraph by paragraph, and to vote on that alone."
"That is my proposal."
"I am prepared to hear one speaker from each Group, to vote and then make a ruling."
"Mr President, I must say firstly that it was I who proposed the content of that report, which was supported by a majority in the Conference of Presidents, and it deals with freedom of expression and information in the European Union – particularly in Italy, but in the European Union as a whole – and Mrs Boogerd-Quaak’s excellent report refers to the majority of countries in the European Union, including my own, and I therefore believe that it is a good piece of work which does credit to Parliament."
"Having said that, I would like firstly to make a political criticism, because I believe it is very positive that during this last plenary session of this legislature we should hold an in-depth political debate, and this relates to the case of filibustering which has arisen in relation to this report."
"You have mentioned a series of incidents which have taken place during the negotiation of the report."
"I can add some more information: for example, documents have disappeared in the committee, something which is entirely inexplicable."
"We are facing an obstacle course."
"And since you yourself have mentioned a letter which was written to you by Vice-President Podestà, I am aware of an article Mr Podestà has written today in the well-known Italian newspaper , in which he makes a series of serious accusations with regard to the European Parliament’s behaviour."
"He says – and I quote in Italian: , [the Rules of Procedure have been flouted, by allowing the debate in Parliament to run on indefinitely] and further on it says that [in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is dominated by the centre-left …] Well, I did not know that we were so dominant in Parliament and I do not know if Mr Poettering will agree with this."
"He then refers to the letter which he wrote to you and says that President Cox, in his reply, [had to admit that I was to a large extent right]."
"I would also like to make it clear that I believe that we in the so-called centre-left coalition have strictly observed the Rules of Procedure; we have had the patience of Job in the face of systematic manoeuvring involving blocking and filibustering."
"However, if we look at the issue in political terms, I accept that there are two groups in the House – and I am coming to an end, Mr President – who indulge in filibustering, because it is they who have tabled all the amendments but four, and I understand why they would defend Mr Berlusconi, who is currently the leader of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I accept that as well, but they should say so clearly, because ..."
"... because I would remind you of an old Roman Law principle which said – and this was what made Rome great – that one cannot legislate for the benefit of just one person."
"We must legislate for all the citizens, and that is what is at stake here."
"And I will therefore end, Mr President ..."
"... I will end with a proposal, Mr President: the so-called centre-left coalition has four amendments."
"You have 350."
"We accept that they be voted on en bloc and, if not, we accept that the President’s proposal should be voted on paragraph by paragraph."
"Mr President, I have every sympathy for Mr Barón Crespo, but I am not clear about his conclusion."
"You asked a question and Mr Barón Crespo provided an explanation, but he failed to arrive at any conclusion."
"That is why I have risen in order to say that I will gladly endorse your proposal to hold the vote tomorrow."
"We are in a difficult situation with 338 amendments which are multiplying as a result of procedural issues."
"I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, to underline this point, and I make it calmly and objectively."
"We have already discussed this issue this morning when the sitting opened at 9 a.m."
"The Chairman of one of the groups claimed that the amendments come from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I would like to point out that there are 338 amendments, and that not all of these amendments come from our group."
"We have tabled 157, which means that 181 amendments come from other people."
"I would ask for this fact to be noted."
"I shall refrain from commenting on the quality of the report at this point as I do not wish to exacerbate the situation, but I would ask everyone to work together to achieve some kind of resolution to this difficult issue."
"Mr President, we know you to be a fair and objective President of this House, and if you propose that we vote on the report tomorrow at 12 noon in accordance with the procedure that you suggest, you have our support."
"Mr President, I will not go into the substance of this matter since we all know what it is about."
"My Group has no objection to taking part in 600 votes tomorrow, but we have a clear preference for your suggestion that we simply vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph."
"A long voting session is already foreseen, colleagues on both sides have had their say, and, therefore, I propose to you that we follow your suggestion of voting on the original report paragraph by paragraph."
"– Mr Poettering, it is true that this will be a complicated vote, but I appeal to you as President of the largest group in this House and to the President of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, because, of course, groups of this size do not normally use obstructionist tactics and, besides, you have said that you do not want to."
"The first thing I want to do, then, is to appeal to these groups to glance through their amendments and see if any of them can be withdrawn."
"When more than a hundred amendments are tabled, I am sure that some of them will be more important and others less important."
"Please do that and make our job easier when we come to vote: we shall all be grateful."
"I think this would demonstrate the political sensitivity expected of groups of your standing."
"Mr President, we agree with your second proposal, to vote on the original text first."
"There is only one proposal, but depending on how the House votes it may manifest itself in one of two ways."
"– Mr President, I should just like to say that my group agrees to your proposal to vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph."
"The report is good enough, almost perfect to begin with; these amendments have been tabled for the plenary."
"I should just like to explain to the House, to anyone who may not have been paying attention, that it is true that 200 amendments come from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and another 200 from other groups, but altogether 350 amendments come from and ."
"It is obvious, therefore, that they all come from Mr Berlusconi’s friends."
"We therefore agree to your proposal, Mr President, and will vote accordingly."
"– Mr President, I believe your proposal can certainly be taken into consideration and, if you could grant a suspension of our work in order to assess it, we would be able to give you a more objective opinion."
"For instance, I feel we could accept Mrs Frassoni’s invitation to re-examine some amendments to see whether it is possible to group them together or cut any out."
"I am certainly in favour of having the vote tomorrow, if that is more convenient for everybody, but, Mr President, I am absolutely against any possibility of having all the amendments and all the calls for secret ballots rescinded, because it is unthinkable that all the secret ballots could simply be wiped out like that."
"I recall that many Members from other groups have tabled 30 or 40 proposals for secret ballots on documents that interest them without causing any outcry at all in Parliament."
"In connection with what certain Members have said, I remind Mr Barón Crespo – who criticised an article by Mr Podestà – that this mysterious, as he puts it, centre-left coalition has already published a pamphlet taking the approval of this report in this House as a certainty and making a whole series of remarks, even though the report has not yet even been put to the vote."
"Publishing wicked comments or lies is certainly not a mark of goodwill in a political group."
"As for the other Member who spoke of ‘Mr Berlusconi’s friends’, I can assure him on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that our amendments are on behalf of the whole group; the whole group is united; none of us has private friendships or enmities; but we claim the right as Members of this Parliament to carry out our mandate to the full, doing what the Rules of Procedure allow and not just standing by listening to the constant provocations made even in committee."
". Mr President, I should like to commend you on your wisdom."
"Having heard all the discussion, I agree that it is an excellent idea to vote on my original report."
"It contains sufficient substance for it to be steered through Parliament soundly, and this will perhaps take some of the pain away."
"Putting the original report to the vote sounds like an excellent idea to me, therefore."
". Mr President, I would like to speak on behalf of the committee I chair."
"Mr Barón has made a statement, an accusation which I believe to be particularly serious."
"He has said that documents have disappeared in my committee."
"I would like to say to the Presidency that, if that accusation is false, it is extremely serious since it would seriously harm the prestige and honour of the committee I chair."
"Secondly, Mr President, I would like an explanation of how Mr Barón has received that information, because I was not aware until today that this has happened, and that would also seriously harm the prestige of the services of my committee."
"I believe that this, Mr President, requires immediate clarification and, in any event, I would ask for the support of the Presidency."
"We have heard from the Groups' spokesmen."
"I would now like to take your advice."
"The package that was offered to you tries to respect the Rules and the different stresses and strains that have been brought to our attention."
"For the sake of clarity, I repeat that the vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"I shall allow a normal vote on all the amendments, but no split votes and no roll-call votes on them."
"I shall also allow all the requests for split votes concerning the original paragraphs of the motion for resolution, but I shall allow only one roll-call vote per paragraph according to indications supplied by the Groups."
"This would yield a total of 600 votes for the report, a long voting time, and would mean ruling out about 1000 split votes on the amendments."
"I feel that this tries to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of the Groups and the requirements of the House to conduct its business in an orderly way."
"I put this proposal to you in accordance with Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure."
"If the House rejects this proposal, I shall decide on the basis of Rule 130(3) to put to the vote first the original text of the report, paragraph by paragraph."
"The vote will therefore take place tomorrow, and, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 130(3), we shall vote on the original text, paragraph by paragraph, and on that alone."
"– Mr President, let me just ask you to examine the possibility of starting tomorrow’s votes earlier, as I believe it to be unfair that all the other votes cannot otherwise go ahead."
"Either we should make an earlier start on the sitting, and hence on the votes, or we should defer some of the morning’s agenda to the afternoon."
"Whatever happens, the votes should start earlier, by which I mean at 11 a.m."
"As a consequence of the decision you have taken, the vote should not take so long tomorrow."
". – I am surprised."
"I have asked for explanations of a series of accusations which have been made in this House and I have received no reply."
"I would ask that somebody answer my question."
"Bearing in mind that I am not the only person to have made accusations, but that Vice-President Podestà has made a series of written accusations in the Italian press ..."
"... I am happy to accept Mr Hernández Mollar’s challenge, but I would formally request that a package be produced containing what I have said and what Vice-President Podestà has said in writing ..."
"Mr President, I would ask the wild boar roaming wild out there to calm down."
"I am prepared to provide explanations to the Bureau of Parliament about all these issues, about Vice-President Podestà’s accusations and about mine."
"Would everyone please relax."
"I know that near election time we suffer from election fever and our temperatures go up. Please calm down."
"Mr Barón Crespo, you stated that there was some problem with the disappearance of documentation."
"I do not know the detail."
"The chairman of the relevant committee has pointed out that he regards this as offensive to the committee and its secretariat."
"I would invite you, Mr Barón Crespo, between now and the end of this part-session, to try to substantiate or, if not, to withdraw your remark."
"In the meantime, as I do not know what the evidence is, I cannot make any other comment."
". Mr President, I have said nothing about a challenge, and nor am I talking about packages, I am talking about a serious accusation by Mr Barón, which damages the prestige of this House."
"In any event, Mr President, if it is true – and I would now ask for an immediate investigation – the votes taken in committee are null and void and we cannot, therefore, vote on this report tomorrow."
"– Mr President, first of all I ask you whether it is right that staff should be sitting on the Council benches laughing and gesticulating."
"I ask everybody to maintain a respectful attitude towards this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I have always respected the positions of others: I therefore ask you to respect them in the same way."
"With regard to Mr Barón Crespo, first of all I had already asked to speak before now, my dear sir, but I was not given the floor."
"I have to say that I fully endorse what I wrote, because in effect, in fact, one only needs to take a precise look at the numbers to see what the situation is."
"Then, with regard to Mr Cox’s letter in reply, I have also had to write back to him indicating the points in his letter where he recognised that there were serious shortcomings and defects in the report itself."
"I therefore respect the President’s decision but, I beg you, do not hide behind a problem that does not exist and which, in any case, is not yours, just because you do not want to respond to a specific request by Mr Hernández Mollar."
"One final point, Mr President: once again I accept the vote of this House, the vote that you, Mr President, have had taken here today."
"If, however, we read the Rules of Procedure, it is not up to the House to decide when or how a particular vote should be taken: it is your direct responsibility."
"As far as I am concerned, then, you asked for advice and then decided independently."
"It is not the House that can decide on such matters."
"You should all, please, read the Rules of Procedure and study them."
"Mr Barón Crespo, the Rules of Procedure are not something from which you can pick and choose; therefore let the person who has the floor and is democratically elected and represents here the citizens of this …"
"Mr President, I think there is always someone amongst us who has discovered democracy too late and who perhaps, therefore, is not familiar either with its rules or with its deeper meaning."
"Mr President, with tomorrow’s voting procedure decided, it is unclear to me whether or not it will be possible to vote for referral back to committee, in accordance with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure."
"What is happening, what we are witnessing, is an inevitable, healthy reaction to the serious irregularities contained in the report, which, to my mind, removes competences from Member States’ constitutional institutions."
"That is what is giving rise to this fair, legitimate and inevitable reaction to the abuse on the part of the majority of this House, who invoke the Treaties in order to breach them and the Charter of Fundamental Rights similarly to contravene some of its rules."
"I therefore feel that this House must reassess this issue and must vote for referral back to committee, in order that the report can be cleansed of its irregularities."
"I should therefore like to request, Mr President, that tomorrow this motion be considered, discussed and put to the vote."
"Let me conclude by remarking, in response to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, that under the Rules of Procedure, you are entitled to move the referral back."
"The majority would decide that."
"Failing a referral back, we will vote in the manner indicated earlier."
"Mr Podestà was correct when he said that it is my choice, but that choice is now informed by your wisdom."
"I am sorry for the long delay."
"Now you have got to earn your lunch!"
"Mr Podestà will take the remaining votes."
"– Mr President, I just want to ask that, in the letter to the Council, you inform them that an error has crept in to the German version of the Common Position."
"In our negotiations with them, we succeeded in prevailing upon the Council to replace the term ‘high-speed sea routes’ by the term ‘motorways of the sea’, as we also want to promote slower ferries as well as high-speed ones."
"I therefore ask that the communication to the Council should make reference to the linguistic error that has found its way into the German version as regards the term ‘motorway of the sea’."
"I believe that view to be shared by the House as a whole."
"– I have taken note of that, Mr Jarzembowski; in any case, it has already been brought to the attention of the competent services."
". Mr President, since the agreement is being submitted to the Court of Justice, it seems to me a better idea to refrain from putting this report to the vote now, and first await the response of the Court."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council agree."
"I propose the following, therefore: rather than putting the report to the vote now, refer it back to committee in anticipation of the opinion of the Court of Justice."
"I would like to ask the chairman of the relevant committee to give his opinion."
". Mr President, I believe there is no reason or justification not to vote on the report and the motion for a resolution."
"What has been voted for this morning is perfectly compatible with the content of the resolution, which calls for the suspension of the agreement."
"We must, therefore, issue our opinion on this."
"I believe that both the proposal and the motion for a resolution should be voted on and I would ask that this be done."
"Mr President, surely if the rapporteur is requesting a referral back to committee of her own report, and there is a dispute, then the House should vote on this?"
"If that is an official request for referral, we will have one Member speak in favour and one against and then the House will decide."
"Mr President, we have decided to refer this matter to the Court of Justice."
"If we are now to take a vote on the report rejecting the agreement, then we are showing a discourtesy to the Court."
"If the House were to vote to accept the agreement, then we would be prejudging the Court's judgment."
"It seems to me quite natural that since we are awaiting the Court's ruling on the matter, we should wait in committee with this report before voting on it."
". Mr President, I would repeat what I said before: there is nothing incompatible about, on the one hand, our having voted as we did this morning in relation to the preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice and, on the other, having to give our opinion on the legislative proposal and the resolution."
"I will repeat: it is the resolution that calls for the agreement to be suspended."
"We therefore have this legitimate right in this House and the political groups would be deprived of it if we were prevented from voting on the proposal and the resolution."
"I would therefore insist once again, Mr President, that this report must not be referred back to committee, but that it should be voted on as planned, for the reasons I have just given, which I believe to be conclusive."
"Mr President, I am simply astonished that paragraph 24 of the van Hulten resolution is not considered inadmissible."
"I demand that it should be declared inadmissible."
"The text reads: ‘the rapporteur deems it necessary ...’."
"This Assembly is in no position to say what the rapporteur thinks or does not think."
"But this Assembly certainly is in a position to say whether it is in agreement with the rapporteur or otherwise."
"This is not the point."
"I request that paragraph 24 be declared inadmissible."
". Mr President, there is a misunderstanding here."
"Mr Bourlanges is referring to the explanatory statement – not to a paragraph in the resolution – and, as you know, the explanatory statement is not included in the final text adopted by plenary."
"It seems to me, Mr Bourlanges, that Mr van Hulten’s reply clarifies this point."
"Mr President, since Amendment No 44 was adopted, I should like, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to withdraw Amendments Nos 29 and 32."
"They are no longer relevant."
"– Mr President, that is correct, and I am grateful to him."
"From the interpretation I heard only ‘and’, ‘29 and 32’."
"As I understand it, 30 and 31 are redundant too, as they deal with exactly the same subject area."
"Perhaps that was an error in interpretation."
"I think that Mr Blak and I can agree that his group’s actions have now in fact lapsed."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if my eyes do not deceive me, Mr Hans-Peter Martin did not participate in this vote, something I would very much regret in view of the extensive reform we have just carried out, and I hope that he will duly give us his backing where these matters are concerned."
"After all, it is only right and proper that one should participate in votes of this kind, and I would also have been glad if he had tabled a few amendments in order to put his reforming agenda to the vote."
"– Mr President, I just want to respond to the remarks that have just been made."
"I am here; I just needed to go out briefly, as a statement was being published on behalf of the President in which allegations were being made about me that simply bore no relation to the facts."
"I have often seen Mr Ferber leave the Chamber under similar circumstances."
"I have always played my part in this reform process, and the present lamentable reaction shows how much you are isolating yourselves, and to what an extent criticisms made from within this House – including my amendments in the committees – are simply ignored."
"I feel sorry for Europe’s voters and taxpayers."
". Mr President, we did not win the vote against Strasbourg and I admit defeat on this issue for the time being."
"On the second issue, we voted by a very large majority to ask for the introduction as soon as possible of the reforms of the expenses system adopted by the Bureau last year."
"Would you ask the President to report back to the House as soon as possible as to when he intends to ask the Bureau to adopt those rules?"
"Mr President, could you give the House some indication as to whether you intend to break for lunch?"
"There are a lot of votes and there are a couple of official delegations, one from the Australian Parliament, waiting for our colleague Mr Sturdy to host lunch with them."
"It is also 2.10 p.m.!"
"I leave it to the House to decide"
"Mr President, whatever the vote on the adjournment of the subsequent items, I should like to ask you nevertheless to put the Cyprus resolution to the vote, because it is important that the European Parliament’s views should be made known in plenty of time for Saturday’s referendum."
". Mr President, I understand and sympathise with the idea behind the amendment tabled that incentives are needed in the marketplace so as to encourage the purchase of environmentally friendly products."
"However, the wording is too specific."
"I suggest an alternative that reads: 'Insists that, to promote the consumption of environmentally friendly products, the Commission encourage Member States to consider various incentives, such as reduced taxes, rebates, etc.'"
". Mr President, I support the first part of the amendment, but not the second part."
"However, I would suggest that if the House supports the first part then it should it be voted as an addition."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in my capacity as chairman of the temporary committee on the Sterckx report, on which we have been working for half a year, that I ask you to vote on it in order to obviate the risk of it lapsing."
"I ask you to have due regard for the work that Members have been doing for half a year and to put the Sterckx report to the vote."
"Mr President, we have asked the competent services to make a linguistic correction because Amendment No 2 has been tabled in English and there are other versions which contain the word ‘considerable’, which does not appear in the English version, which is the true one."
"I would ask that this correction be made."
"– We will check all the language versions, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna."
"Once again, the European Parliament has just voted for a working schedule for 2005 in which there are no Strasbourg sittings on Fridays."
"Of course, I voted against."
"What we are actually waiting for the French Government to do – and we have been waiting in vain for years – is to go to the Court of Justice to enforce the Treaty."
"I should like to remind you of what I have said a thousand times before in other explanations of vote: the arguments are good ones."
"First, the European Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and it must adhere to the Treaty, as the Court of Justice has acknowledged."
"Second, it has also acknowledged that, in the protocol establishing the seats of the institutions, which refers to ‘the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions’ of the European Parliament, the article ‘the’ means the sittings as they were held at the time the decision was taken."
"This included five days of monthly sittings, including Friday."
"Consequently, we must lodge an appeal on this matter, especially since the European Parliament is now so overloaded with work."
". It is absolutely essential that Community legislation be simplified and made clearer, in order to make it more accessible to the ordinary citizen and easier for everyone to read."
"Objectives such as these will be difficult to meet if we retain, on the same issue, a spread of provisions, many of which are substantially amended."
"The aim of the Commission proposal before us – one which I naturally endorse – is to codify the first Council directive of 23 July 1962, on establishing common rules for certain types of carriage of goods by road, and the other acts that have been modified, retaining the content in its entirety and confining itself to combining them with the formal amendments required by the codification process itself."
"This is in line with the Commission’s decision of 1 April 1987 to call on its services to set about codifying all legislative acts once they have undergone ten amendments, in order to ensure that Community decisions are clear and comprehensible."
"It also tallies with the Presidency conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council of December 1992, which reaffirmed the importance of codification."
"I voted in favour of this report, which recommends that this proposal be adopted."
". It is absolutely essential that Community legislation be simplified and made clearer in order to make it more accessible to the ordinary citizen and easier for everyone to understand."
"Objectives such as this will be difficult to achieve if we retain, on the same issue, a spread of provisions, many of which are often substantially amended."
"The aim of the Commission proposal before us – one which I naturally support – is to codify Council Directive 78/659/EEC of 18 July 1978, on the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement in order to support fish life."
"This is in line with the Commission’s decision of 1 April 1987 to call on its services to set about codifying all legislative acts after they have undergone ten amendments, in order to ensure that Community decisions are clear and comprehensible."
"It also tallies with the Presidency conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council of December 1992, which reaffirmed the importance of codification."
"I voted in favour of this report, which recommends that this proposal be adopted."
". Mr Berenguer Fuster’s report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe."
"The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties."
"In this particular case, it is hoped that a new regulation will be adopted on uniform technical requirements concerning the burning behaviour of materials used in the interior construction of certain categories of motor vehicles."
"The forthcoming meeting of the World Forum for Harmonisation of Regulations of the UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) will be an opportunity for the Commission’s representative to vote on this issue on the EC’s behalf."
"It should be remembered that the European Union acceded to the revised 1958 Agreement of the Economic Commission for a United Nations of Europe in 1997, on which the Council Decision entered into force on 24 March 1998."
"It should also be noted that this draft regulation will certainly ensure a higher level of environmental safety and protection."
"I voted in favour of the report, as I completely endorse its position."
". Mr Berenguer Fuster’s report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe."
"The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties."
"In this particular case, it is hoped that a new regulation will be adopted on uniform technical requirements relating to the protection of motor vehicles against unauthorised use."
"I voted in favour of the report, along with the other packages, as I fully endorse its position."
". Mr Berenguer Fuster’s report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe."
"The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties."
"In this particular case, it is hoped that a new regulation will be approved on uniform requirements concerning the type approval of tyres with respect to tyre rolling noise."
"I voted in favour of the report, along with the other packages, as I fully endorse its position."
". The proposal before us seeks to make amendments to the scope of three regulations that establish specific measures for the application of the common agricultural policy in the outermost regions."
"They are intended to improve conditions of production and marketing of the agricultural products in these regions and to offset the effects of their geographical situation and their particular characteristics."
"In order to prevent diversions of trade in the products concerned, these regulations prohibit, with a few exceptions, the re-dispatch and re-exportation of those products from the outermost regions."
"This prohibition and the strict nature of the exceptions have had an adverse effect on the development of the economic activities of certain operators."
"This proposal suggests that the dispatch or exportation of the products concerned should be authorised after the economic advantage has been reimbursed."
"A further measure concerns the Azores and Madeira."
"Currently, the prohibition on re-dispatching and re-exporting the products covered by the specific supply arrangements will not apply to trade flows between the Azores and Madeira, without any distinction being made between processed and unprocessed products."
"Sugar from Madeira covered by the specific supply arrangements has been the subject of speculative dealing in the Azores, where the market is facing difficulties."
"It is, therefore, proposed that trade between the Azores and Madeira of products covered by the specific supply arrangements should be restricted to processed products."
"I voted in favour."
". In view of the importance of the European Audiovisual Observatory and the laudable work it has been doing, I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal to accept the Commission’s proposal to extend the Community’s participation in the Observatory by two years, whilst retaining the current budget ceiling."
"Just two amendments have been tabled: firstly, where possible, to strengthen its capacities, and, secondly, to propose that the European Audiovisual Observatory collect and provide expertise and systematic information in the fields of tax and labour laws, copyright and consumer protection law."
". As is well known, the European Audiovisual Observatory is based on an Enlarged Partial Agreement of the Council of Europe."
"At present, 35 States, including all present and future EU Member States, participate in the Observatory."
"Its aim is to improve the transfer of information within the audiovisual industry, and to promote a clearer view of the market and greater transparency."
"The aims of the proposal before us are to extend the Community’s participation in the Observatory for a further two years, until December 2006, and to keep the annual budget at the 2004 budget level of EUR 235 000."
"This deserves my support."
"I also endorse the rapporteur’s proposals: firstly, that, where possible, the European Audiovisual Observatory’s capacities should be strengthened, and, secondly, that the European Audiovisual Observatory should collect and provide expertise and systematic information in the fields of tax and labour laws, copyright and consumer protection law."
"Lastly, I should like to highlight the importance of remedying the lack of statistical information and benchmarking as regards services to assist blind and partially-sighted people, and deaf and hard of hearing people in the EU."
"It is appropriate for the Observatory to take on the role of collecting and publishing this information."
"For all of these reasons I voted in favour."
". In recent years, significant progress has been made on combating tobacco consumption."
"Indeed, tobacco consumption represents significant public health risks. It is, therefore, vital that the European Union and the Member States should propose measures to safeguard public health."
"One recent, well-documented example is the requirement that every pack should bear warnings covering at least 30% of the main surfaces of the pack."
"Nevertheless, it is universally acknowledged that more needs to be done and it is in this regard that this Framework Convention has been drafted."
"Whilst I condemn over-zealousness and the instances of absurdly excessive behaviour that have come to light, I agree that people need to be protected from tobacco smoke in certain places."
"I therefore welcome measures aimed at banning the sale of tobacco to minors, the increased cooperation of the Member States and recommendations concerning advertising, particularly as these are not binding."
"Whilst the report received a favourable opinion from the committees involved and the adoption of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention would not have serious financial implications and would not affect existing legal acts, I continue to have the reservations expressed during the parliamentary process, particularly as regards ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle."
"Accordingly, I abstained."
". Directive 2001/113/EC harmonises the labelling of fruit jams, jellies, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée intended for human consumption."
"Each product is separately defined with separately specified contents."
"The aim of the proposal is to amend the German version of the Directive – given that, in certain parts of Austria, the term traditionally covers a wider meaning than that so far used in the Directive – to include both this correction and other potential semantic misunderstandings."
"I feel that, while this proposal redresses a highly specific anomaly, it also comprises two wider values that should be matters of priority for the European agenda, namely, respect for traditions and customs, and multilingualism."
"Without this objective, I feel that Europe would become ‘funnelled’, a victim of the gravitational movement towards a centre that is divorced from local realities."
"For the sake of clarity, I voted in favour."
". I wish to record my support for this report and in particular for the discharge to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2002 (C5-0631/2003 – 2003/2241(DEC))."
"The Foundation is a tripartite European Union body set up in 1975 to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions."
"It is located in Dublin and I am proud to applaud the excellent research and development projects it carries out to provide data and analysis for informing and supporting the formulation of EU policy on working and living conditions."
"The Foundation has contributed greatly to the work of those of us with a particular interest in achieving the Lisbon objectives of more and better employment."
"It has supported the constructive engagement of the social partners in developing fair working practices which recognise the true value of employees as key stakeholders."
". With this report, Parliament grants discharge to the Commission for the financial management of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) for the financial year ended 23 July 2002."
"We have no objections to this."
"Following the demise of the ECSC Treaty, the ECSC’s legal system and procedures disappeared straightaway and its Advisory Board was dissolved."
"In 2002, however, the ECSC continued to finance, from its operating budget, redeployment aid for workers, at a cost of EUR 35 million, research grants, EUR 72 million, and the RECHAR Programme of social measures, EUR 21 million."
"In light of the crisis in the coal and steel sector and the social and economic costs of the restructuring that has taken place over recent decades, the liquidation of the ECSC – irrespective of criticisms that one might level at it – has left a void that must be filled, also at Community level, which the new Research Fund for Coal and Steel does not fill."
"Bearing in mind the importance of investment in research in these sectors, it is essential that we consider the measures that might be taken at Community level to support these sectors, retaining some of the social measures of the old ECSC Treaty for a time period to be established."
". The salient point made in this report is that, in the past fifteen years, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) has paid out some EUR 800 million for applied research in the steel sector alone to companies and institutions, without, as a rule, receiving its contractual share of proceeds from the patents that this has made possible."
"The Commission must, therefore, enforce its legal claim to its share of the proceeds from research funding by means of a registration procedure for patents and other suitable measures."
"I also welcome the successful conclusion of negotiations with the accession countries concerning conditions for their participation in the new Research Fund for Coal and Steel, whereby the payment of their contributions, which will be determined in accordance with the size of their mineral resources, will be staggered to take account of their respective economic situations."
"We endorse the rapporteur’s position and, accordingly, voted in favour."
"We should also like to join the rapporteur in praising, once again, all those who set up and developed the European Coal and Steel Community, and who thus made a significant contribution towards the unification of Europe."
"Mr President, various amendments were worthy of consideration, but any amendment would have resulted in a conciliation procedure which would definitely have entailed the risk of a fundamental reassessment and would also have meant equally serious delays."
"This is why I could not support any amendment, but this is not the case with the proposed link between Italy and Sicily, which I supported."
"Mr President, as an MEP for Sicily, I would like to express my satisfaction and appreciation, and thank my fellow Members who, like me, voted for the amendment this morning, which has shown how, in the end, common sense prevailed when faced with the willingness shown by the European Council."
"There is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of Parliament has today concluded the procedure at second reading by accepting the common position."
"Of course, we were once again saddened at the attempt by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, accompanied in this action by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and by some Italian left-wing democrats – with an amendment which, fortunately, only received about 50 votes – to abort the continuation of the plan for the Messina bridge on the trans-European route from Berlin to Palermo."
"If the amendment had been passed, over and above the very serious detrimental effect, which was mentioned at the end of the procedure, the Italian Government – which has already launched the process to begin construction of the bridge – would not have received the 10% contribution from the Union’s funds, as provided for in the Treaty."
"Even more than the sum involved, there is obviously the political significance that such a vote would have had."
"The opposing view, taken by those against the bridge over the Straits, did however – if I may say so – seem to be misleading right from the start and counter, in particular, to the legitimate interests of Sicily and Southern Italy."
"We cannot hope for the development of these regions of Southern Europe and then deny them the right to have essential infrastructure."
"Building the bridge will of course not resolve all of the problems associated with the socio-economic deterioration of Sicily, but it will finally allow the trans-European road and rail networks to be completed and it will enable the island to play a more competitive role in the area of free trade planned for 2010."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Bradbourn on his excellent report on the amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network."
"I welcome the report, particularly as regards the strategy of reinvigorating the trans-European transport network, which is one of the main keys to the smooth running of the internal market."
"I strongly support Mr Bradbourn’s call for Parliament to be involved and to monitor the development of projects that form part of the development of the trans-European transport network."
"I also support the request that in Article 3(2) of the Commission’s revised proposal, special mention should be made of regional airports, as they also play a genuinely vital role in the development of the trans-European transport network."
". At first reading, in the debate on 10 March, I expressed my rejection of this plan."
"What is now happening at second reading is that, without a vote on the total, an excessively long list of motorways, airports, bridges and tunnels is being laid down as an investment obligation for the EU."
"This signifies a long-term call for cofinancing, and will probably also enable the circumvention of the obligation to prepare environmental impact assessments."
"This package also betrays the desire to further neglect the good rail network in eastern Europe by building a large number of motorways there."
"I dispute the idea, propagated by Italy’s Berlusconi Government, that tax revenues must chiefly be spent on infrastructure and other large public works instead of on public service, environmental protection and social security."
"A serious debate on this is no longer possible today owing to lack of time."
"My group is endeavouring to have plans for the bridge over the Strait of Messina scrapped, as it is unusable on account of earthquakes and gusts of wind and superfluous on account of shortcomings in the connecting rail network, and as its construction chiefly serves the interests of the Mafia."
"Furthermore, I support all the Green amendments."
"Rejection of all these amendments would burden Europe with a lead weight and an unnecessary assault on the environment for many years to come."
". During the last parliamentary part-session, representatives from the works council of the Group, a company that specialises in the manufacture of rolling stock for the railways sector, presented to Members of this House the details of their case and their concerns regarding the loss of acknowledged high levels of quality, experience and technological capacity in the construction of this kind of equipment that would result from the impending closure of six units in the EU."
"We hold the Commission and the Member States responsible for allowing this crucial sector to be dismantled and thousands of workers to be made redundant."
"In Portugal alone, this situation has led to 550 direct job losses and almost 1 000 further job losses in subcontracting firms."
"If the future, priority in developing the trans-European transport network is to shift road transport to rail transport in particular, we will need increasing amounts of new equipment and rolling stock; which is where ’s argument to justify the measures it announced – namely, a lack of orders – falls down."
"Whereas some aspects of the proposal under discussion are worthy of criticism, we must register our support for its commitment to alternative means of transport that are less harmful to the environment, such as rail transport."
"This is not an isolated case, and special measures must be put in place to protect this key sector of European industry."
". Unlike the Funds, which are, as a rule, large-scale and vitally important, LIFE constitutes a source of financing specifically geared towards actions to protect nature and the environment."
"Such actions are designed to promote the dissemination of practices, develop innovation and demonstrate how skills and experience can be used elsewhere; they also help to enforce Community policy and legislation in the area of the environment."
"This instrument contributes towards implementing the ‘Birds’ (79/409/EEC) and ‘Habitats’ (92/43/EEC) Community Directives, and, in particular, towards establishing the NATURA 2000 European network, aiming at the on-site management and conservation of the most important fauna and flora species and habitats in the EU, by creating, for example, special conservation ‘sites’."
"Life III expires on 31 December 2004."
"This proposal intends to extend the existing instrument in order to ensure continuity until a new approach is developed in view of the new post-2006 financial perspectives."
"Naturally, I voted in favour."
"I hope, however, that the conclusions of the ‘Article 8 Group’, (Habitats Directive) are taken on board, notably that the current funding of the NATURA 2000 network by means of the LIFE-Nature instrument (47% of the total funds of the LIFE programme) is clearly insufficient; that the application process is overly bureaucratic; and that the Life-Nature programme must be substantially strengthened, and in ..."
". This afternoon, this House agreed by a large majority on an extension, by two years, of the LIFE programme."
"This extension will ensure policy continuity until a new approach is developed in view of the new financial perspectives."
"When the extension of the LIFE programme was first discussed, the Court of Auditors told the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that an audit had been carried out in eight Member States."
"This had apparently revealed that, when private entities use European aid to purchase sites for nature reserves, there are insufficient guarantees that these sites continue to be well managed when the subsidy period expires."
"It was unable to give us any specific examples, however."
"The suggestion by the Court of Auditors that private entities be excluded henceforth from EU subsidies for purchasing nature reserves was unable to count on support from this House, therefore, which I think is a very good thing."
"The Court of Auditors is of course entitled to make suggestions to us."
"We can on no account tolerate misuse, but this does not mean that private entities that are functioning properly should be hit."
"We cannot and must not leave the thousands of volunteers in the European Union who devote themselves selflessly to the management of nature reserves out in the cold."
"On the contrary, we must encourage instead of discourage them."
"I am particularly pleased that I have been able to do my bit towards ensuring that properly functioning environmental organisations can continue to obtain European aid for purchasing nature-reserve sites in the future."
". I reluctantly voted for this report."
"It is not perfect and already there is evidence that such data has been inadvertently released to third parties."
"I totally acknowledge the right of any country to protect and maintain its security."
"We have a clash of cultures here and expediency has triumphed."
". I have voted, again, for the prevention of an unacceptable amount of personal passenger data being transmitted to the US authorities, without adequate protection being offered by the US authorities for the civil liberties of European passengers."
"While I fully respect the need for the highest possible level of vigilance against terrorism, the terrorists will have won if we sacrifice civil liberties and human rights under the pretext of ensuring security."
"I am very disappointed that Ireland voted for the draft agreement, thus giving the green light for unwarranted intrusions into the privacy of Irish passengers."
"The Commission simply must ensure its draft agreement text is modified so that European citizens' data protection rights are protected."
"Irish and European passengers deserve to know that their basic civil liberties will not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism."
". Following on from previous positions, Parliament has not agreed to conclude the Agreement with the USA on transferring air passenger data within the framework of the so-called ‘war on terror’."
"Thus far, the only thing that Parliament has approved has been to refer the process to the European Court of Justice for a ruling."
"The Commission’s proposal and the subsequent proposal for a Council decision enabled ‘access by US law-enforcement authorities to passenger name records (PNR) databases situated on Community territory’ which ‘amounts to exercise of US sovereign power’ in EU countries."
"This Agreement would declare ‘applicable in the European Union and for the European citizens the US legislation in this domain’ and would transfer ‘to European level the discretionary power of the Member States to authorise (...) the utilisation for security purposes of data originally collected for commercial use and to create (...) a legal obligation for European airlines to give access to these data’."
"As regards safeguarding the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees, ‘the draft agreement does not define the extent and the limits of these rights but it only refers to an unilateral Commission Decision which itself refers to some unilateral Undertakings of the US administration, which finally refers to the actual and future US regulations’."
". This question was in connection with the Boogerd-Quaak report on the Agreement between the EU and the USA on the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security (A5-0271/2004)."
"In view of the fact that this consultation was approved, this report has yet to be voted on."
"There is ample justification today for concluding agreements of this nature, due to the growing terrorist threat."
"This should be a basic measure of cooperation between countries, and blocking it only serves to prolong the absence of a firm EU response to the terrorist threat."
"Unlike the rapporteur, I feel that signing this Agreement is indeed compatible with the European Community Treaty and does not breach European legislation on data protection."
"I fully support the arguments put forward by Commissioner Patten."
"Rather than block the implementation of measures such as this, Parliament ought to be working towards requiring carriers that fly into EU territory to comply with obligations of this nature, thereby ensuring the security of each and every one of us."
"Because I disagree entirely, from both a political and a technical point of view, with any recommendation to the Council not to conclude this Agreement with the USA, I voted against consulting the Court of Justice, which I see as a disgraceful delaying tactic and a new hurdle in the way of an Agreement that is necessary to our security and freedom."
". It is essential that the European Union adopts coherent measures to increase effectiveness in the area of border security, without impinging on the competences of the Member States."
"I welcome this proposal for a regulation, ensuring uniform application in the Member States of the requirement systematically to stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross the EU’s external borders."
"This measure will respond to the need to be able to check the date on which a person from a third country crossed the external border, and will make it possible to verify how long a third-country citizen has been in EU territory and whether or not the person is there illegally."
"Recasting the Common Manual of External Borders will be an enormously complicated task and will thus take a considerable amount of time to adopt."
"The aim of this proposal is to iron out the disparities that currently exist between the various Member States and any ambiguities that may arise as regards the provisions of the Manual while it is being recast."
"This will be a step towards tightening control of the external borders and enhancing mutual trust between Member States in the area of border control."
"As these are common borders, lax security in one State will inevitably have a knock-on effect in all of the other Member States."
". The Schengen stipulates that, in the case of short-term stays, third country citizens who enter the territory of Member States legally and who meet the necessary conditions to this end have the right to remain within Schengen territory for a maximum period of three months, starting from the first date of entry."
"The need therefore arises to check the dates on which a third-country citizen crossed the external border, in order to calculate the total period of stay and to verify that the person is there legally."
"The Common Manual of External Borders provides for travel documents to be stamped and land border controls to be relaxed in exceptional circumstances, due mainly to the intensity of traffic implied by such circumstances."
"The ambiguity of this provision has led to the adoption of procedures that differ between Member States, and this is something that should be avoided."
"Consequently, and in view of enlargement, we accepted Mrs Angelilli’s position that this should be a first step towards ultimately harmonising procedures, such as stamping the travel documents of third-country citizens as they leave the ‘Schengen area’."
". The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has done an extremely good job of improving knowledge of drugs and drug addiction, by providing comparable data and information and primarily by monitoring and identifying dangerous substances that appear on the market and by proposing that these should be banned."
"It makes sense that, for reasons of clarity and openness, the Regulation establishing the EMCDDA should be recast, particularly in order to adapt it to the enlargement of the EU and to broaden its mandate to cover polydrug use, involving both legal and illegal substances."
"I cannot, however, accept the attempt to confer evaluation tasks on the EMCDDA."
"The intention is that the Monitoring Centre should not simply collect data but should also evaluate national policies and strategies and assess trends in drug consumption."
"This would confer on an agency powers that are currently held by the Member States."
"The Monitoring Centre should be entrusted with the task of furnishing overall information, in other words, of collecting, analysing and disseminating data on all aspects of the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction, which will help to provide the Community and its Member States with an overall view of the drug and drug addiction phenomenon."
"This task should not prejudice the allocation of powers between the Community and its Member States with regard to the legislative provisions concerning drug supply and demand."
"As usual, you were not listening and, as usual, we were right."
"At the time of the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 1995, National Front members declared right here, before this Assembly, that it was pointless, and they predicted that it would fail."
"Almost ten years on, the results are in fact pathetic: failures in the board of directors, in the information gathering and analysis network and in data dissemination, and lack of assessment of the various policies with regard to drugs."
"The annual reports and statistical data are piling up, but the problems have grown worse."
"France is now the country where 16-year-old adolescents smoke the most cannabis in Europe."
"A real epidemic, the use of drugs now affects all social classes and all ages."
"The rapporteur therefore proposes overhauling the observatory’s operations and missions."
"But the solution does not lie in a proliferation of Théodule committees, nor in the establishment of a community approach to anti-drug policies."
"It is time to realise that the use of drugs increases exponentially with tolerance and that only national policies based on zero tolerance with regard to drugs can give young people their future back."
". The fight against Drugs and Drug Addiction has always been a priority for the European Union and has been reflected in its other policies, particularly in the last decade."
"This is why, in its proposal for a regulation, the Council is seeking to take this fight to a new level."
"Nevertheless, it has become clear that the many amendments that have been tabled and which are scattered throughout this report, detract from this fundamental aim."
"Although, on the one hand, I agree that extending the powers of the Monitoring Centre is, on the face of it, a measure to be welcomed, on the other, I cannot accept the amendments seeking to ensure that the EP is represented by two Members on the Management Board and to increase the number of tools for evaluation purposes."
"I believe that the actions proposed in the report, in particular those originating in Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, do not represent the best approach to adopt."
"I could not vote in favour of the report."
"Instead, I would suggest that the European Union, the European Monitoring Centre and also the Member States, in cooperation or individually, combine their efforts, not in tasks that will result in wasted resources but in measures that will clearly lead to prevention."
"We need measures that effectively combat drug trafficking and drug addiction."
"I declined to vote in favour of granting discharge for the execution of the Commission’s budget for 2002 owing to the persistent lack of clarity on matters such as Eurostat."
"Back in January, the European Parliament regretted granting discharge for the 2001 financial year without having access to all the relevant information."
"I did not want to fall into the same trap for 2002."
"Furthermore, the resolution accompanying the decision to discharge includes many questionable points."
"For example, it states in paragraph 4 that Member States are in a subordinate position as regards the management of Community funds, which is inaccurate, in so far as they hold the purse-strings and it is the national taxpayers who indeed pay."
"I believe, on the contrary, that the Member States should insist on being able to exercise better control themselves."
"Another example: in paragraphs 115 and in subsequent paragraphs, the European Parliament wishes to establish a European tax, stating that the prime objective is to ‘guarantee the financial independence of the EU with regard to national contributions subject to the decisions of national parliaments’."
"It cannot be admitted any more clearly than this that a European tax would allow the Union to avoid national scrutiny and to finance its expenditure as it wishes."
". The discharge process for 2002 has been marked by the Eurostat case and by the ongoing Commission reform."
"We have substantial reservations about both of these matters."
"Despite the recent scandals and in light of the cases that led to the fall of the Commission in 1999, the administrative reforms that have been announced appear to be almost entirely cosmetic."
"The so-called ‘administrative culture’ still needs to be changed, as the Eurostat case shows."
"Measures are needed to safeguard against vital information being concealed."
"Progress must be made on keeping services in-house, and in particular on amending the Financial Regulation to the effect that the Commission is automatically required to request a full account of the ownership of a firm tendering for a Commission contract and in terms of financial management."
"The Eurostat case also highlights the need to review the accountability chain in the Commission and the relationships that exist between the various key players and the Commissioners."
"It also confirms that ‘it was a mistake to concentrate the competences for drawing up the budget and keeping accounts and for combating fraud in the hands of one Member of the Commission’."
"I should also like, at sectoral level, to express my disagreement with paragraph 115, which suggests a future European tax to replace national contributions from Member States to the Community budget and with paragraph 182, which supports the N+2 rule for the Structural Funds."
". The fine results achieved by the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds (EDF) should encourage us to pursue this crucially important aspect of the European Union’s action: providing real solidarity with the most disadvantaged parts of the world, by supporting macroeconomic or sectoral reforms."
"I welcome the suggestion that the ACP (African, Caribbean, Pacific) States in particular should agree to introduce a multi-annual programme for creating and/or strengthening a Supreme Audit Institution before budgetary support can be granted."
"The credibility and efficiency of the EDF depends largely on the transparency of these funds and on evidence, upstream and downstream, that they are being used appropriately."
"Furthermore, this will enable a more reliable comparison to be made with the EU’s own financial perspective."
"Lastly, I agree with the assessment of the Committee on Budgetary Control, highlighting the fact that, apart from the political significance of budgetisation, considerable advantages related to budgetary management can be achieved by integrating the EDF in the general budget of the European Union; for example, more efficient implementation due to the possibility of harmonising existing procedures, greater level of flexibility in implementation, a higher level of transparency concerning total Community aid and avoiding the current complications of transitional measures between EDFs."
"I voted in favour."
"Although elected by the inhabitants of the Belgian regions of Wallonia and Brussels, Mr President, I have as usual supported the continuation of European Parliament activities in Strasbourg."
"My support is based on my conviction that the presence of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, despite the passage of time and even present or future enlargements, is of considerable symbolic value."
"It is too easy to believe that old wounds have healed because they are no longer mentioned."
"On the contrary, history should make us wary of the ability of the past to resurface, sometimes suddenly, when it is least expected."
"This is why everyone in Europe, especially the young, needs the continuing presence of European democracy in the capital of Alsace."
"I voted in favour of the van Hulten report on granting discharge for the execution of the European Parliament’s budget for 2002, since it provides clear guidance concerning in particular the transparency of Members’ allowances of the type we have always defended."
"Incidentally, note should be taken of the rout of the European Parliament’s strategy, which has for years linked reform of the system of allowances to the adoption by the Council of an extremely federalist constitution for European Members."
"With the elections imminent, the Council has, however, blocked reform of the constitution, and the European Parliament has been obliged to accept that the reform of allowances could indeed be carried out separately."
"Furthermore, the initial report contained very regrettable sections casting doubt on the location of Strasbourg as the official home of the European Parliament."
"Fortunately, they were voted out."
"Strasbourg is in fact the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation and, tomorrow, it should become the symbol of reconciliation for the whole of Europe."
"Also, it would be unhealthy to concentrate all the institutions in Brussels, which would then be too inclined to put itself forward as a European federal district."
"The fact that our colleague, Mr van Hulten has taken the opportunity of discharge for the 2002 financial year to speak in favour of a single venue for the European Parliament, namely Brussels, is no surprise to me."
"That he makes use of hypocrisy and makes factually inaccurate statements in support of this is an insult to his intelligence."
"Paragraph 69 of his motion for a resolution includes an error."
"It gives the impression that the quoted sums of EUR 185 and 203 million are overspends arising from the retention of three venues, while these are in fact the total costs."
"Of course, even a single venue involves a cost."
"Paragraph 70 goes on from the confusion and includes falsehoods."
"I shall leave it for our French colleagues to respond to the attacks on Strasbourg."
"I protest vehemently at the insinuations to the effect that Luxembourg has access problems, health problems or security problems."
"This is in bad faith."
"Consequently, I have voted in favour of Amendments Nos 16 to 20, deleting paragraphs 69 to 73, tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Being in favour of discharge but still voting against the resolution presented by Mr van Hulten requires explanation."
"Even in amended form, the resolution is still unacceptable: instead of restricting himself to the execution of the 2002 budget, the rapporteur has made it into a mishmash of his personal ideas."
"Neither the rambling considerations on the status of Members nor the proposal concerning the seats of Parliament have any place in it."
"This last proposal not only constitutes an infringement of Article 284 of the Treaty, but expresses a narrow view of the financial cost of decentralisation."
"While it is true that decentralisation comes at a price, the concentration of all the European institutions in Brussels also has a financial, and especially political, cost."
"From a purely financial, or even Calvinist, perspective, the political aspects are insignificant."
"This is not the case, however, for the voters."
"I have not joined in the campaign for reform of the EP intending to make it more efficient, transparent and accountable."
"The purpose of the campaign, started by the socialist Member, Mr van Hulten, is to abolish Strasbourg as a seat and Luxembourg as a venue."
"Hypocritically, Members of the European Parliament and candidates in the European elections are being asked to ‘make a commitment to increasing efficiency by seeking to end the dispersal of European Parliament facilities (...) and establishing a single seat in Brussels’."
"I eventually voted in favour of the report, after my group’s amendments had been accepted."
"Otherwise, I should not have been able to do so, since Mr van Hulten misused his report in order to adopt a position with respect to the seat of the EP, which is not within our remit."
"A survey of civil servants in Strasbourg and Luxembourg has shown that 95% are against moving to Brussels."
"Mr van Hulten totally ignores the difficulties which this project would cause for the families affected, not to mention the cost of this , in terms of both money and productivity."
"I shall not be intimidated by this manoeuvring and this blackmail on the pretext of restoring the credibility of the European Parliament."
". Yesterday, I was one of the signatories of the appeal to EP candidates for the term 2004–2009 to put an end to excessive expenses and to wasting money as a result of meeting in two different cities."
"Today, it is possible to gauge the level of support for this within the 1999–2004-term Parliament that is soon to retire."
"On a proposal from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a majority of 31 voted against moving all sessions to Brussels."
"The costs of this refusal amount to EUR 185 million each year, rising to EUR 203 million after enlargement."
"The proposal to reimburse only the actual travel costs incurred was not included in the vote, as a much vaguer proposal was first adopted on a study into travel costs."
"My group presented two proposals to limit the period for which the attendance register can be signed."
"Limiting it to the fixed session times was rejected by 99 votes to 355, and abolishing the option of signing it on days on which there are no sessions was rejected by 151 votes to 320."
"Only the recently introduced option of additional taxi expenses has been abandoned, with 351 votes for and 146 against."
"That is an extremely poor yield for now in the fight to reduce this Parliament’s unnecessary costs."
"In these circumstances, in particular, it is a good thing that the Council did not allow the recent pay increase."
"Mr van Hulten’s report is an important one."
"We are nonetheless sorry that the call for parliamentary activities to cease in Strasbourg was not accepted."
"We believe that all of the European Parliament’s activities should be transferred to Brussels."
"For this reason, we abstained at the end of the voting."
". The reason I have voted against this report is mirrored in the roll-call votes that have been taken, on the Members’ Statute and on maintaining Strasbourg as Parliament's seat."
"As regards the first matter, although I agree with many of the amendments that were tabled, I believe they only make sense if incorporated into a future Members’ Statute, as the rapporteur to a certain extent acknowledges in his explanatory statement."
"There is no guarantee that this Statute will enter into force, as I would like to see – a desire that I have expressed clearly in previous votes."
"In fact, it was even rejected recently by the Council."
"Concerning keeping Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg, I fully realise that any change to the current situation will require a corresponding change to the Treaties."
"Nevertheless, there is no reason why I should not express my position on the matter, which has nothing to do with having less regard for France or the French."
"What it reveals is my opposition in principle to a regrettable duplication of costs, with no visible benefit, either for the quality of the workings of Parliament or for the working conditions of its Members and staff."
". On behalf of the Members belonging to the Austrian Freedom Party, I wish to explain our vote on the van Hulten report."
"The reason why we voted in favour of Amendment No 40 is that we advocate a new Bureau decision leaving no loopholes permitting additional mileage allowances and payments for extra time."
"We therefore advocate that the Bureau decision of 8 May 2003 should be revised to allow for the reimbursement of costs actually incurred."
"We voted against Amendment No 1, tabled by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, believing as we do that it could be interpreted in such a way as to facilitate the retention of the 28 May 2003 decision on costs, with its hidden lump-sum allowances."
"In the final vote, though, we nevertheless voted against the report, as it fails to deal with such issues as the demand for a single venue for the European Parliament or the abolition of allowances for Fridays in Strasbourg."
"Having considered all the arguments, I wish to emphasise that the decision to reimburse only those travel expenses that are actually incurred met with our wholehearted support, although, at the same time, I regret the failure to take on board many of the amendments."
"I support this report in order to state that, as one might expect, there is no consensus on the Members’ Statute, an issue that I have followed with particular interest, both as a Member of this Parliament and in my capacity as Quaestor between 1994 and 1999."
"I feel that this is a political issue and I would state unequivocally that Members’ allowances and expenses must be based on the economic and social situation of the Member State in which they are elected because, once elected, they are in this Parliament to represent their communities – in any event this is one reason for their presence here."
"I have voted in favour of the amendments to the following effect: 1) that the European Parliament itself be allowed to decide upon its seat (adopted by 275 votes to 223, with 16 abstentions), 2) that the European Parliament have a single place of working instead of, as today, three in the form of Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg (adopted by 271 votes to 223, with 21 abstentions), because this dividing up of its work leads to an additional cost of EUR 185 million per year (approximately SEK 1 750 million) and, after enlargement, EUR 203 million (approximately SEK 1 850 million), 3) that the reimbursement of expenses be reviewed (adopted by 380 votes to 119), 4) that the reimbursement of expenses be based on the principle of reimbursement of actual costs (partly taken into account in Amendment No 40 and adopted by 336 votes to 138, with 28 abstentions), and 5) that outlay on taxis not be refunded separately but be included in the general reimbursement of costs (adopted by 351 votes to 146, with 18 abstentions)."
". I voted against the van Hulten report because the rapporteur has taken the opportunity presented by the assessment of the implementation of Parliament’s accounts to proffer, out of context, his own political opinions on the system of payments to Members of Parliament and on the location of Parliament’s seats."
"These matters, which are causing a deep rift within Parliament, must not, therefore, be viewed in isolation (which is currently the case), much less at the end of a legislature and, apparently, as the result of particular personal interest and of inappropriate pressure from the media, whose sole intention is to damage the legitimacy of the forthcoming elections."
"The rapporteur has failed, this time, to serve the European cause well and should not, therefore, receive the European Parliament’s approval."
"We do not want the Commission to table a proposal aimed at changing the national share systems."
"We have chosen to vote against the wording that calls upon the Commission to implement the one share/one vote principle, because this is not in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Such a proposal would have far-reaching consequences for patterns of ownership in quite a few Member States."
"Different national company law systems must be respected."
"Nor can we support the wording designed to facilitate the movement of workers, because it takes no account of trade union aspects and is not accompanied by demands that companies accept social responsibility."
"Increased movement in the European labour market is good, but we cannot accept flexibility at workers’ expense."
"If the principle of ‘one share – one vote’ is introduced into all legislation there is a risk of legislation having retroactive effect, with the present ownership being changed and thus expropriation taking place."
"We think, instead, that the market itself must define the forms of ownership that it wishes to reward."
"For these reasons we have been unable to support the introduction through legislation of the principle of ‘one share – one vote’ as a general principle."
"We have today voted against the report, our justification being as follows."
"An agreement on takeover bids (relating to company purchases) has been made just recently."
"The EU institutions should keep to what has been agreed in these negotiations."
"This report proposes deviations from the agreement."
"Such behaviour may lead to its becoming more difficult in the future to conclude agreements, if the institutions do not keep to them."
"We therefore believe that the points relating to the weighting of voting rights and various forms of defensive measure should not have been included in the report."
"When those aspects of company law that benefit from harmonisation are changed through European legislation, the principle of subsidiarity must be respected, and central corporate governance must as far as possible be avoided."
"The freedom to enter into agreements must never be infringed in the manner proposed."
"We particularly welcome trade and industry’s initiatives in the interests of increased transparency and the scrutiny of administration and reporting, and we hope that these principles will influence future European development in this area."
". I have abstained from voting today on the Directive on unfair commercial practices."
"The reason is not that I oppose this kind of legislation in principle, but that this is the umpteenth compromise that has been presented with regard to the internal market."
"Four years on from the Lisbon Summit, I note that little progress has been made."
"Every day this Parliament advocates following the Lisbon Strategy, but when it actually has the opportunity to opt for the completion of the internal market by means of mutual recognition and possibly maximum harmonisation, it shrinks from it."
"Whenever we talk about the consumer, emotions flare up."
"Various amendments do afford the consumer protection, which is a good thing in itself, but on the other hand they do not take account of the costs this entails for traders."
"In my view, the present draft legislation does not yet strike the correct balance."
". I am pleased to support this report which significantly improves on the Commission's proposal to harmonise consumer protection against unfair commercial practices."
"While I am in favour of the Commission's proposals for corporate governance its key policy objectives should include reference to promoting sustainable development, environmental justice and fair trade."
"They should also place greater importance on the involvement of other stakeholders, such as workers, consumers and community representatives."
"European corporate governance and Company law must include decent structures and practices for informing and consulting workers, and all European company law directives should contain obligations to inform and consult employee representatives where major decisions are at stake as regards the continuity of firms and jobs."
"Therefore the European Corporate Governance Forum which the Commission proposes to convene ought to be representative of all interests and trade unions and civil society ought also to participate in it."
". Following the major financial scandals that have erupted across the world, such as the Enron and Parmalat cases – and their systemic nature, the Commission is seeking to show that it has been working on the matter, with a view to improving transparency in companies, in other words their ‘governance’, (which appears to be the way in which they are governed) and their sense of ‘social responsibility’."
"This could be said to be a case of shutting the stable door once the horse has bolted but, once you remove the declarations of intent and the appeals to the good nature of the business community, all that is left in the report is propaganda, because the aims are quite different."
"These are: to restore public confidence – particularly in the financial markets; to make regulations more flexible in order to facilitate the cross-border restructuring of companies in the European Union; to increase the competitiveness of companies and to improve protection for shareholders and creditors."
"We are consequently unhappy that, instead of focusing on the issue of relations between shareholders and managers – between ownership and control – the Commission has not attached greater importance to effective protection for workers, to their participation and that of the organisations that represent them in the process of taking decisions on the lives of their companies."
"The fact is that these employees have fewer rights than creditors and should have not only minimum rights to be informed and consulted, but also the right to active participation, with the right of veto, in decisions that are important for the continuity of the company and of jobs."
". I voted in favour for the same reasons that European regulations on company law and corporate governance need to be modernised."
"What is at stake are the main political objectives (increasing the rights of shareholders and protecting third parties, improving corporate efficiency and competitiveness, etc.) that must underpin all actions needed in this field at European level."
"These include an action plan that classifies in order of priority the various measures that are considered necessary in the short, medium and long term."
"In drawing up this action plan, particular attention must be paid, however, to the need to respect a set of guiding criteria, specifically the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and a degree of flexibility as regards the way the plan is used."
"Furthermore, the action plan is an important element in creating, in an enlarged Europe, a transparent and healthy capitals market, in particular given recent events in Japan, followed by those in the United States and in Europe – the Parmalat case, to be specific."
"Such a market will need further useful measures for sound financial management so as to prevent similar scandals and the economic and social consequences that they entail."
". I voted in favour of this report, in which the Commission advocates updating the European regulatory framework on company law and corporate governance, by proposing measures aimed at: increasing businesses' competitiveness as a crucial component of economic growth and job creation, improving protection for shareholders and creditors and enhancing the transparency of the way in which businesses operate."
"Nevertheless, although I endorse the report and although the rapporteur is a socialist, I voted against the amendments tabled at a later stage by the Socialist Group."
"Nor could I accept paragraph 21 of the original text which, using the fallacious argument that it would ensure equal treatment for all shareholders, calls on the Commission to accept the principle of ‘one share one vote’."
"Unlike what is put forward in that paragraph, the terms of equal treatment for shareholders have nothing to do with the principle of ‘one share one vote’."
"In addition to being a matter for social organisations, the rules linking the social participation of shareholders with the right to vote are rules of proportionality, in which equality is fully respected."
"Mr President, the draft plan for the reunification of Cyprus supported by the Commission, and just approved by the European Parliament, simply cannot be right for us."
"In order to make absolutely sure that agreement was reached, Turkey was granted concessions which are difficult to swallow."
"Although it is illegally occupying the north of the island and it has been criticised by everyone at the international level – this has to be stated before it becomes completely forgotten – it has been granted the right to sustain a regime controlled by the armed forces, with 100 000 settlers established in northern Cyprus and all kinds of restrictions on freedom of movement between the two parts, not to mention persisting obstacles to religious freedom."
"In these circumstances, the plan seems to have just a single objective: to sweep under the carpet, even at the cost of the very worst of concessions, even to the detriment of the Greek Cypriots, a problem which was threatening to be an obstacle to Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"Those who voted today for the resolution supporting this plan have therefore simply acted as supporters for Turkey’s entry."
".–At a time when the UN Security Council refuses to take a stand, the ΕU and the European Parliament are throwing all their weight behind the Annan plan, coercing the people and the political forces of Cyprus."
"The resolution adopted is an insult of the first magnitude to the Cypriot people, in that it calls on them 'to be fully responsible, consistent and committed to their status as EU citizens'."
"It extols the Annan plan as a shining example for the settlement of equally difficult international issues and maintains that it establishes a functioning federal system of intergovernmentalism."
"Of course, it does not contain a word about the Turkish invasion and occupation, the British bases and the guarantor powers."
"No embarrassment about the presence of Turkish troops on EU territory."
"Equally repulsive of the content of the resolution were the positions of numerous 'friends' of Cyprus, including President Pat Cox, Commissioners Verheugen and Patten and Greek MEPs."
"The President accused the Cypriot media of exclusion at a time when he himself, in an interview with a Cypriot newspaper, talked at leisure about the Cypriot leadership's lack of courage and imagination."
"The Commissioners spoke in unacceptable terms, extremely derogatory and insulting, as sovereigns to their subjects."
"The Communist Party of Greece supports the Cypriot people, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike, and roundly condemns any form of pressure, threat or coercion."
".– Surprise and anger were caused by the stand taken by Mr Verheugen, who set the tone for the unrestrained catalogue of dangers and pressures heard in plenary today."
"The Commissioner exceeded the remit granted to him by his institutional role and the need to respect the democratic rights of which the Commission is supposedly the guardian."
"Such stands should not be adopted when the common ground of all the Greek parties is that the Cypriot people should decide without pressure, assessing without haste the possibilities and the dangers which each possible outcome of the referendum implies."
"Apart from the viability and workability of the proposed solution, security guarantees and guarantees for the application of the arrangements are needed."
"This sort of stand by Parliament would operate beneficially in shaping the political preconditions, by which I mean support for the solution by the overwhelming majority of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, so that unification of the island can proceed and the two communities can be reconciled within the framework of a twin-community, twin-zone federation."
"The resolution, instead of adopting a pressure line, should have clearly emphasised respect for whatever choice the Cypriots make and accepted the constructive amendments proposed by the GUE/NGL and the Coalition MEP Μr Papayannakis on securing clear undertakings and guarantees."
"Following the rejection of the positive amendments, I could not adopt such a text and I abstained from the final vote."
". We reaffirm our ongoing solidarity with the Cypriot people in their fight against military occupation by Turkey and in their struggle for their country to be reunified."
"We believe it is a matter of principle and a fundamental requirement to ensure that the sovereign decision of the Cypriot people on its present and future – which falls to the Cypriot people alone – is respected, without any unacceptable interference, blackmail or pressure, in particular over the plan presented by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 31 March, and which will be the subject of a referendum on 24 April."
"For this reason, we firmly reject any intention or attempt to renegotiate the Republic of Cyprus’s Treaty of Accession to the European Union, to consider Turkey’s accession to the European Union, when what are termed the ‘Copenhagen criteria’ have not in any way been fulfilled, or to ‘legitimise’ Turkey’s occupation of part of Cyprus."
"Hence our vote against the resolution, which did not even consider the amendments tabled by our group."
".–The Annan plan is totally out of keeping with the UN resolutions."
"It cancels out the crime of invasion and occupation, it acquits, rewards and proclaims the conqueror guarantor."
"It establishes a state which is unique in the annals of international law and which is not viable."
"Basically there are two states, with separate economies, trade, industry, agricultural policy and employment policy."
"It leaves huge problems with regard to the return of refugees, compensation for property and the presence of colonists."
"It creates a situation of constant tension between the two communities, leaving the door open for new – including military – interventions."
"The Cypriot people are being put under intolerable pressure and are being subjected to all sorts of coercion."
"We consider the statements made today by Mr Verheugen and others and threats of the 'end of the world' if they do not accept the Annan plan to be unacceptable."
"We especially condemn the disgraceful, pitiful warning by Mr Verheugen to the Cypriots that, if they do not vote yes, the number of occupying troops and colonists will double."
"And he was applauded for that!"
"It is a disgrace!"
"This is the EU 'of peace', as Mr Verheugen maintained today."
"We consider it unacceptable for the USA and the EU to keep reminding the Cypriots that this is a unique opportunity (for whom exactly?)."
"The Communist Party of Greece again expresses its undivided support for the Cypriot people."
"The only acceptable solution is to apply existing UN resolutions and summit agreements on a united, independent Cyprus with no foreign bases and troops, a federal, twin-community, twin-zone, common homeland for Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, without foreign guarantors or protectors."
". For forty years, the Greek Cypriots have insisted on their island's reunification."
"To the Turkish Cypriot minority in the North, that was unacceptable, because they feared becoming a disadvantaged minority in their own country."
"Meanwhile, a majority of the Turkish-speaking Cypriots are probably in favour of reunification and reconciliation on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's plan."
"In it, a Belgian model of state is being proposed, a federation of two monolingual federal states."
"It now looks like a majority of the Greek-speaking population will be voting against on 24 April because it wants more rights for itself and fewer for the Turkish-speaking minority."
"It wants to enforce the unilateral pre-condition that Cyprus become a Greek-speaking unified state, in which individual Turks are allowed to live."
"At this rate, agreement will never be reached between the two nations and the barbed-wire border separation will remain in place for ever."
"Along with most of the groups, Commissioner Verheugen now feels cheated, and rightly so."
"I warned against this as long ago as 5 September 2001 when we discussed the Poos report on Cyprus' accession to the EU."
"By only admitting the Greek-speaking part to the EU initially, the Turks could be forced to choose between poverty outside the EU or submission within the EU Member State Cyprus."
"After the failed referendum, we will have to look for another way of admitting the Turkish-speaking part to the EU, if it so wishes."
".–Immediately after Helsinki, the Communist Party of Greece stated that the procedure for integrating Cyprus into the EU was being used as a lever to bring about a definitive partition of Cyprus."
"I mention this in order to emphasise that the course of events was prescribed from the moment resolving the Cyprus problem became expedient and in the interests of the ΕU rather than of the Cypriot people."
"Indeed, how could the results of the 1974 Turkish invasion and occupation be reversed when the EU never addressed the Cyprus problem as such, never made withdrawal from the occupation of Cyprus a precondition to the integration of Turkey?"
"How could a fair solution be obtained with the involvement of the EU and the USA when what happened in 1974 is daily practice nowadays on the part of the imperialist powers in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine?"
"How could the UN Secretary General express something different from the international coalition of forces, by which we mean the new imperialist order?"
"It is therefore no paradox that the Annan plan tramples over earlier UN resolutions and twin-community agreements, establishing a peculiar, so-called confederation of a state, unique in the annals of international law and partitioned under a foreign protectorate."
"The Communist Party of Greece expresses its undivided solidarity with the entire Cypriot nation."
"We call on you to do likewise and to stop this blatant coercion."
"I have voted against the resolution (adopted by 422 votes to 30, with 47 abstentions) prior to Cyprus’s referendums on 24 April, because the European Parliament would thus be contributing to the Turkish occupation of the northern part of the island."
"The resolution clearly supports the Annan plan."
"Previously, the European Parliament has consistently referred to the UN resolutions on Cyprus, demanding that the occupation cease and that there be an end to the division of the country."
"The occupation forces are being reduced in number, but are to remain in place for an unspecifiable period."
"Turkey continues to be given the right to intervene unilaterally, and its occupation continues, even though it is being reduced from 37% to 28.5% of the island."
"A number of the Greek Cypriot refugees are being allowed to return to their occupied homes."
"Others are being offered financial compensation in the form of bonds that can be redeemed, for an unknown value, in 20 to 25 years’ time."
"Cyprus is not being allowed to contribute to, and support, the EU’s security and defence policy in its territory without the approval of the Turkish Government."
"In practice, Cyprus will not be a fully-fledged EU Member State."
"Turkish citizens are being given the same rights to visit, and stay in, Cyprus as Greek citizens."
"Cyprus cannot enter into Schengen cooperation because the whole of the Turkish population would be given free entry to the Schengen area."
"Cyprus’s presidents are being urged to request that the European Court of Human Rights overturn all the judgments in which Greek Cypriot refugees have been given the right to recover their property in the northern part of the island."
"We voted against the resolution in support of the Annan plan, which is flagrantly biased and iniquitous and cannot form a firm and enduring basis for settlement of the Cyprus question."
"The resolution is right in line with the pressure and blackmail being exerted on the Greek Cypriots by the Commission, another example of which we heard today with the intervention of Commissioner Verheugen in plenary."
"This pressure takes the form of both unacceptable blame heaped on those who would dare to vote against the plan that others wish to impose upon them, and promises of fabulous financial aid if the vote goes the right way."
"In actual fact, the Commission has just one single objective: to exonerate Turkey, drawing a veil over the fact that it has invaded the northern part of Cyprus, where it is still in military occupation."
"Who cares if this means an agreement which tramples on the rights of the Greek Cypriots!"
"The main thing is for Turkey, whose Islamist government naturally supports the Annan plan, to appear to be a respectable candidate deserving to join the European Union."
"Those who supported the European Parliament’s resolution are therefore clearly in favour of the accession of Turkey to the European Union."
". This report aims to speed up the creation of a single euro payment area, before 2010, thus making a further contribution to completing the internal market."
"In the name of competition, priority is given to the interests of economic operators to the detriment of consumer protection."
"It is interesting to note that the rapporteur’s main concern is the efficiency of the payments sector, which is deemed to be ‘unsatisfactory’."
"Nothing, however, is said about the charges faced by consumers, about the increased rates and commissions for payment service operations, such as cash transfers, which have occurred particularly in the banking sector following the Euro’s entry into circulation, which have heavily penalised consumers, and on which no serious study has been conducted and no appropriate legislation exists."
"The rapporteur is extremely quick, however, to reject the idea that payment service providers should be held to account in the event of merchant-customer disputes, the idea of maximum charges for closing bank accounts and the idea of restricting the personal contribution by customers in the event of unauthorised transactions."
"He also considers the obligations on operators to provide their customers with information to be excessive."
"This is why we voted against the report."
"We also have reservations about the scope of the future legal framework for national payments, since consumers should clearly not have to put up with conditions that are less favourable than they are currently."
". The need to expand and complete the internal market requires payment services to be more efficient."
"The introduction, at the beginning of 2002, of Euro notes and coins has helped to make cash payments more efficient."
"The introduction of new systems – such as TARGET – for the banking sector has also streamlined cross-border transfers of large sums, with visible advantages for consumers, by adopting a coordinated approach to the security of transactions and to the efficiency and speed of the system."
"The shortcomings seen in the sector involving the cross-border transfers of small sums apparently reside in the inadequacy of the legal framework at European level that the Commission proposes to present, nevertheless, the structure of this framework – the form and number of legal instruments – is still not known."
"I welcome, in principle, the intention announced by the Commission, although I do agree with some of the rapporteur’s observations, in particular his warning that regulatory initiatives should be restricted to the ‘big picture’ and a number of selected areas, giving the economic operators themselves the necessary leeway for self-regulation."
". I am pleased to support this report and the IPP Communication, which seeks to support sustainable development by reducing resource use and the negative impact of waste disposal, and by reducing the environmental impact from products throughout their life-cycle."
"The Commission puts a lot of emphasis on 'working with the market'."
"Such an approach has clear merits, but will only be successful in an environment where 'green products' are priced favourably compared to other products."
"The application of the Polluter Pays Principle would be a key step in this direction."
"I hope that the Commission will respond to this report and take urgent steps to present a framework directive for IPP based on clearly defined principles and objectives and including the specific demands included in this report."
". This Commission communication, which follows on from consultation with the interested parties, which took place following the approval of the Green Paper on IPP (Integrated Product Policy), in February 2001, defines the measures the Communication will adopt, in order to push ahead with the IPP at European level, with the aim of limiting the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle."
"The Commission’s IPP approach consists of pushing ahead to achieve sustainable development: pragmatically including all the interested parties, such as those working on the projects, the various sectors of industry, retailers and consumers, creating an appropriate economic and legal framework (corporate acquisitions that are more ecologically sound, promoting ecological labelling) and promoting research (drawing up pilot-projects targeting specific products)."
"As I have stated many times before, European industry and producers must be made more aware of the importance of genuinely sustainable economic growth and of sustainable systems of production – which entails recycling, waste treatment, protection of the water, etc. – to match the growing awareness of the European public itself."
"This issue is becoming increasingly important in Union policy and this Communication is a step in this direction."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Mr President, as I stated during yesterday's debate, I have voted in favour of the Sterckx report because it is a sound one."
"It does, however, give the European people an unwarranted sense of security."
"Yesterday, I found out that the European Maritime Safety Agency’s plan of action cannot, for budgetary reasons, be implemented."
"This means that both in terms of quality and quantity, there is insufficient capacity to guarantee the safety of citizens along the European coasts."
"Which means that all the work we have done has reached a disappointing conclusion, particularly because we know that Member States refuse to take part in introducing criminal sanctions."
"Consequently, what we have proposed here is lacking in substance, which is very regrettable, but it has not prevented me from voting in favour of the report."
"I do take the view, though, that it is necessary to clearly define responsibilities, and so this must be recorded in the Minutes of this House."
"The June Movement has today decided to vote in favour of the report on improving safety at sea, since we naturally support all sensible comments on environmental considerations and the combating of oil pollution."
"It must be emphasised, however, that the June Movement cannot support the ideas concerning a European coastguard service."
"The Member States themselves should determine control of their own waters and coasts. There is no reason for the EU to be involved in this."
"Moreover, the June Movement decided to vote neither in favour of, nor against, Amendment No 5, since we are unable to support a desire for greater harmonisation. At the same time, however, we consider it necessary to put a stop to the ruthless exploitation suffered by crews on many vessels."
"We are giving this explanation of vote in connection with the following items."
"Item 13: We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguard services when it comes to joint operations, planning and the development of competence."
"We do not therefore believe that there is a need to develop a new, parallel organisation in the form of a European coastguard service."
"Item 17: We are doubtful about European funding of places of refuge."
"We believe that those countries that have accepted their responsibility and funded places of refuge along their coasts should not be forced by other states’ negligence to create places of refuge."
". – The report by the temporary committee is yet another attempt to conceal the anti-labour policy in shipping and defuse reactions by the grass-roots and labour movement to crimes at sea in which dozens of seafarers lose their lives every year and which have grievous consequences on the environment."
"The allegation in the report, that 80% of accidents are due to human error, is erroneous, unscientific and suspicious, in that it endeavours to cover up the responsibility of the shipping companies and government authorities by concealing the deterioration in naval training and glossing over the consequences of an obsolete fleet, defective surveys, inadequate crew compositions and intensification of the work of seafarers."
"The accidents are directly linked to the unaccountability which prevails, especially in the second registers of the Members States of the EU and on ships sailing under flags of convenience."
"It has been proven that the shipping registers operate as mechanisms to cover up infringements of legislation and perpetuate the unaccountability of shipowners, by issuing certificates which, on most occasions, do not reflect the actual state of the vessel."
"The proposals by the Commission and by Parliament conceal the responsibilities and promote the behaviour of the big shipping and shore monopolies and, on the pretext of combating terrorism, promote measures which strike at fundamental democratic rights of seafarers."
"We demand the immediate release of the master of the tanker and his return to Greece."
". – To widespread indifference, eighteen people died in January 2004 in the wreck of the freighter off the coast of Norway."
"Maritime transport is still subject to the laws of the ‘crooks of the seas’ and the European Union does nothing!"
"Three years since the adoption of the ‘Erika’ legislative packages, seven Member States (Italy, Greece, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and the Netherlands) have still not incorporated Community decisions into their national legislation."
"There is a pressing need to put an end to the system of convenience in maritime transport."
"We must do away with flags of convenience, starting with those in the EU. We must guarantee a high level of training and remuneration for seafarers."
"We must provide ourselves with the means of enforcing the legislation, strengthening the ranks of the inspectors or establishing a European coastguard force."
"Finally, we must turn the spotlight on the responsibilities involved in the sinking of the , especially those of the Aznar Government."
"With the accession of Cyprus and Malta, the EU will become the number one maritime power in the world."
"It will have the ability to change the IMO rules in a sector affected by capitalist globalisation."
"Without this commitment, we shall continue to be powerless to stop the human, social and environmental destruction."
"The Sterckx report is broadly inadequate in this respect."
". I congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report on maritime safety, which I fully support."
"I share the concerns about maritime safety expressed by the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea and by the rapporteur himself, reminding all parties involved that maritime safety is an issue that still requires substantial and lasting political attention."
"This will determine the quality and safety of vessels navigating European waters and European vessels throughout the world as well as protection of the coasts and of the European public."
"I firmly support the measures that have been adopted in this field, particularly those banning single-hulled tankers transporting heavy oils from European waters and those conferring further powers on the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"I shall conclude by reaffirming something to which I have referred on several occasions during my term of office: safety is everyone’s responsibility and requires everyone’s commitment!"
". The Spanish Government, which was responsible for the disaster involving the tanker and the fuel oil on the coasts of Spain, France and Portugal, has now been voted out by the electorate."
"In order to ward off possible oil pollution in one Spanish port, the captain of this ship was instructed to leave the coast and eventually to sink in open sea, as a result of which the disaster became much greater."
"Of the 77 000 tonnes of crude oil on board, 43 000 tonnes have been salvaged, and it is estimated that 14 000 tonnes are still on board."
"This means that 20 000 tonnes disappeared into the sea and that the coast of Galicia remains polluted long term."
"The report is right to criticise the Netherlands and Belgium for not, apparently, regarding the application of port state control and vessel inspection by classification bureaus as an urgent matter."
"Proposals have been made for the designation of ports of refuge, compulsory insurance cover to be able to recoup damage and costs from shipowners, the use of transmitters to trace lost containers and the stricter observation of existing environmental and safety rules; these receive my support."
"It is unfortunate that the European coastguard service, which it is apparently planned to set up, is not only intended for the joint protection of the environment, safety and compliance with fishery restrictions, but is also directly linked to the hunt for immigrants and possible terrorists and the further construction of a European superstate."
". Following on from an EP resolution of September 2003, inspired by the and petrol tanker disasters, a temporary committee was set up specifically to deal with issues relating to maritime safety."
"This committee has held various hearings with experts and leaders from Union countries, who helped it to gain a more thorough understanding of the issue."
"Its activity is coming to an end, with the adoption in plenary of a resolution aimed at summing up the approximately six months of its duration."
"Unfortunately, because some of the contributions have contradicted one another, this temporary committee has not been able fully to clarify the causes and the circumstances of the sinking of the , an aspect also referred to in the Sterckx report."
"I share the rapporteur’s concerns, specifically where he focuses on ways of improving maritime safety and insists on some points that I believe to be important, such as the need for the EU to work together with countries affected by maritime disasters; the publication of the black list of vessels that must be banned from entering EU ports and the development of a system for detecting vessels transporting hazardous goods at sea."
"Although the temporary committee has to date served to maintain the interest of the Institutions, Member States and other organisations involved in the field, it is now up to each of these to assimilate this concern and, above all, to bear in mind ..."
"It was out of the question for us to vote in favour of the Sterckx report, in view of its criticism of the Malaga measures jointly agreed by France and Spain to the great benefit of European maritime safety, but with the inherent defect, in the eyes of the majority in this Parliament, of being the product of cooperation between Member States and not of a supranational procedure."
"I am also astonished that French Members were able to go along with the categorical condemnation of an initiative taken by Messrs Chirac and Aznar, which considerably improves the safety of our coasts, our coastal populations and our fishermen."
"Although we eventually abstained on the Sterckx report, this was due to the adoption of a number of positive amendments improving the text, in particular with regard to the need to outlaw flags of convenience in European waters and provide for complete redress for damage caused by oil slicks to all of those involved, within the framework of a thoroughly restructured IMO."
"That concludes the vote."
"(1)"
"Colleagues, it is my pleasure to welcome this afternoon, on behalf of the European Parliament, two eminent representatives from the Geneva Initiative for Peace in the Middle East: the former speaker of the Knesset, Mr Avraham Burg and the former Minister of Information in the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser Abed Rabbo."
"I hope that the meetings they had yesterday and this morning with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the delegations for relations with Israel and the Palestinian Legislative Council, and representatives of the political groups will have been fruitful."
"The lively interest shown by Members in these meetings testifies to the enthusiastic support of the European Parliament for the Geneva Initiative."
"You are very welcome here."
"I hope that you appreciate that this afternoon we have a very light attendance in the House because we only finished our vote eight minutes ago."
"I think everybody is enjoying their lunch at the moment."
"Thank you for coming."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations."
"Mr President, thank you, although I regret that Mr Patten has perhaps not had time to come back to the sitting."
"On several occasions, I, like others, have been deeply concerned about the unilateralism of the United States."
"The list is a long one, covering collective security, human rights, development and environmental protection."
"What type of proposal should be made with regard to trans-Atlantic relations just a few weeks away from the Dublin Summit?"
"Would not the best ‘service’ the Union could do for this partnership be to display a critical attitude with respect to American views in several areas and, especially, to take the initiative in different directions?"
"I am thinking first of all of the distressing situation in the Middle East."
"Mr Prodi has described the assassination of the Hamas leader as an illegal and irresponsible act."
"I also heard, and duly noted, what the Council said at this morning’s debate."
"However, just a few days since the green light was given by President Bush to continue with the policy of occupation and division of Palestinian territory, when is Europe going to decide to take the courageous initiatives that are required and that it has the means to implement: suspend the EU-Israel agreement, insist that an international protection force be sent, and convene an international conference involving in particular the protagonists of the Geneva agreement?"
"In Iraq, the blinkered attitude of the Bush administration, producing daily human tragedies, should mean, in this area too, far greater involvement of the European Union so that a real transfer of sovereignty guaranteed by the UN can take place as soon as possible."
"This critical attitude is again of relevance with respect to the American plans for the Middle East as a whole, attempting to impose a ‘democracy kit’ from the outside, mainly to guarantee American economic and strategic interests as defined by President Bush."
"Finally, the needs of the war on terrorism cannot be used to justify a drift towards discriminatory security."
"Also, I am concerned about the statements made by the Council and the Commission today, going back over Parliament’s rejection of the transfer of air passengers’ personal data."
"Apart from clearly essential security measures, observing the rule of law, the response to terrorism must not ignore its causes."
"Taking the initiative within the IMF or the WTO with a view to alleviating inequalities throughout the world could, again, be a useful European contribution."
"Mr President, Europe and the United States do, of course, have a great deal in common, and the need for a dialogue between the two is self-evident, for neither can solve the global problems on their own."
"However, let there be no misunderstanding: this would be a dialogue between partners that hold fundamentally different views on a number of crucial issues, some of which I should like to mention."
"At the heart of Europe's safety strategy is conflict prevention and preventive involvement."
"Crucial to the Bush strategy is armed preventive attacks."
"The EU's objective is to reinforce the United Nations; that of the United States is multilateralism via the UN, if possible and if it suits Washington and not via the UN if it does not."
"The EU's ambition is to stop the distribution of weapons of mass destruction."
"Officially, that is also the line taken by the US, but at the same time, friendly regimes, including Israel in Palestine, are being protected, while the US itself continues developing what is called mini-nukes."
"The European Union is in favour of the International Criminal Court with a view to reinforcing international law."
"The United States is making every effort to make life for the Criminal Court as difficult as possible."
"The European Union is a civil superpower or, rather, it could be, if it were to concentrate more on improving the points it is good at, or could be good at."
"These points are conflict prevention, reinforcement of multilateral organisation, trade – fair trade if it were up to my group – and military action, under the UN flag, only if that proves to be unavoidable."
"In Iraq, the United States learnt the hard way that it cannot solve the problems of dictatorial regimes and terrorism without the help of the United Nations and Europe."
"However, let there be no mistake: that applies just as much to the European Union."
"That is why it is best for Europe to adopt the policy of joining forces with the United States where at all possible, but it should not shrink back from being uncooperative should this prove necessary."
"Not because idealistic politicians think so, but because our citizens expect Europe to speak with one voice and act assertively in order to restrain the United States if necessary."
"Mr President, the distress in Iraq is as acute as ever."
"That was again brought home to me in a telephone call I received from Baghdad on Monday evening."
"My Iraqi informer is directly involved – in the Ministry of Education, no less – in the reconstruction of his home country, multifariously ruined Mesopotamia that is Iraq."
"He was very harsh in his criticism of the United States and the European Union."
"If the transatlantic partners do not finally join forces emphatically in a military and economic sense for a better future for Iraq, this could well backfire at some point."
"What does this urgent appeal from Baghdad mean in practical terms?"
"It means that NATO must pacify Mesopotamia, preferably under a UN mandate, and that there must be a generous Marshall plan in order to neutralise the pull of radical groupings."
"Personally, I should like to warmly back this appeal within the Council and the Commission."
"That is the only way for the European Union to prove itself a solid partner to the United States."
"It is the only way for the European institutions to prove that they want to carry political responsibility for a world which appears to be ripe for the assault by the forces of the ultimate evil of terrorists for whom human life does not count, irrespective of whether this involves the life of Iraqi fellow-countrymen, fellow-believers or that of Spaniards."
"According to the Bible, a divided house will not stand."
"That applies to the European Union itself."
"Mr President, since the war in Iraq, transatlantic relations have gone sour."
"This has led to much tension within the present European Union."
"It looks as if this tension is set to stay, certainly initially, following enlargement."
"That is a very sad conclusion because I am convinced that Europe is mistaking its enemy."
"After all, the debate is not about how Europe can provide a counterweight for the power of the United States, but about the question of how we can best fight international terrorism."
"In my view, terrorism can only really be tackled by means of transatlantic solidarity and collective action."
"That is why the political leaders in Europe have an important role to play."
"More specifically, this Parliament should underline more emphatically how much Europe stands to lose in the event of continuing tension and how much it stands to gain from actual cooperation with the United States."
"With this message, I bid the European Parliament farewell."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the presidency for the hospitality shown in Ireland."
"It was indeed a memorable occasion, though I did not know that we were in Mr Roche's constituency."
"Of course, we were very well received and the hospitality was superb."
"Thank you very much indeed, Mr Roche."
"The spirit of your remarks and of Commissioner Patten's shows that, despite the enormous difficulties we have had in transatlantic relations in the past few months, a great deal could be achieved at this EU-US Summit if we have sufficient courage to do so."
"The remarks made give me some encouragement that we can make real progress."
"My first point concerns the question of the joint study – which you mentioned, Commissioner – looking at the economic aspects."
"I warmly welcome that because, if we can look at the remaining barriers to trade, we can aim for a barrier-free transatlantic market."
"Perhaps you might have the courage to say that this should be done within a ten-year period."
"That would genuinely galvanise communities on both sides to overcome the remaining obstacles."
"My second point, perhaps as important, is that we should look at the broader framework of transatlantic relations."
"As you have said, Commissioner, so many subjects form part of this agenda: the environment, foreign policy, industrial and social policy and, as we have seen, PNR data as well."
"It now needs a new framework to take these into account and, in particular, bring the parliamentary dialogue into the broader framework of the relationship."
"I therefore welcome the fact that you wish to carry out an independent review."
"I hope this wish will be shared by our American friends as well, so that at the EU-US summit next year, when we have the incoming administrations, we would be able to pave the way for a broader agreement, possibly a partnership agreement, to be struck between the EU and the US perhaps by 2007."
"Thank you very much for your comments."
"I wish you well, President-in-Office, and hope that, when you come to Dublin, we will have a statement to set out the future of the relationship which both Europeans and Americans can recognise."
"Mr President, Mr President-in Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, if we look back over the last debate and compare it with the situation we have today, we have, I regret, no option but to conclude that the gulf in relations between the United States and Europe has at least not diminished."
"We all had expectations and hopes that this would change for the better in the course of time."
"Looking at our report, our declaration, our motion for a resolution, I see three major political themes: the strengthening of the United Nations, the situation in the Middle East and the fight against terrorism."
"In all three of these – when considered realistically and not just optimistically – there are major differences."
"Where strengthening the United Nations is concerned, I do not see any change in emphasis in the USA’s policies."
"If we are now to really get the United Nations more involved in Iraq, then we have to be very careful about it, for it must be the United Nations in reality, rather than the United Nations acting as something like an extension of the occupying powers in that country."
"In that event, they will be sucked into the same maelstrom of violence and retaliation as the Americans have been."
"The fact is that there is, in the region itself, nothing left of the loudly-trumpeted initiative for a new Middle East."
"I wish we could join with the Americans in getting right down to the root causes and devising an overall strategy for the Middle East, which cannot, to be sure, focus on Israel and Palestine alone."
"I also think there are still serious differences where anti-terrorism is concerned."
"Today, I listened to Commissioner Patten – as always, it was a pleasure to do so – and I agree with many of his arguments. He is wrong about the way I voted, but he is right about much else."
"We have to be very careful about this, and it may be that we have to go to the outermost limit of what is legally feasible in order to have a real defence against terrorism, but what is essential is that we combat its causes, and there are, as before, great differences in the ways in which Europe and the United States of America go about doing that."
"Mr President, this morning, listening to Mr Patten, I was struck by the fact that he stated that, at the end of his five years in office as a Commissioner, he considered the international situation to be more dangerous than it was five years ago."
"I share this view."
"Perhaps more emphasis should be given than has been given in this resolution to the fact that one of the aspects of this dangerousness is the policy of unilateralism and, above all, the new American doctrine with regard to unilateralism."
"I believe that this aspect is largely lacking in the motion for a resolution."
"This is why we support most of the amendments submitted."
"I shall take three extremely relevant examples of expectations with respect to the EU."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, we actually heard Messrs Burg and Abed-Rabbo yesterday."
"There was a very explicit request that the European Union and the ministers of foreign affairs should give far more support than they have in the past to the Geneva initiative."
"There was also a request that the European Union should be proactive in the support of independent organisations, under international control, in Palestine."
"These points should be clearly stated in our draft resolution."
"Finally, I should also like the European Union to give more consideration to international studies."
"Some have been quoted."
"A report was published this summer under the aegis of the International Labour Organisation making practical proposals relating to good economic governance and the rules with respect to globalisation."
"If we do not understand that, as has often been said in this House and as Commissioner Patten has also often repeated, the struggle against poverty is one of the fundamental aspects of the war on terrorism and if we do not follow the recommendations of international reports to which we ourselves contribute, we shall lose all credibility."
"It is this type of message which the Bush administration must also be made to hear."
"Mr President, the United States, with just 3% of the world's population, is able to produce approximately 30% of the world’s goods and services."
"China, with six times the population and covering a much larger area, produces just 3%."
"Russia now ranks below Switzerland in terms of gross domestic product."
"What I mean to say by this is that the United States clearly enjoys a position of unprecedented political and military hegemony."
"It is also fair to say, however, that the US has achieved this on its own merits."
"I believe we must conclude that, if Europe wants to fulfil all its potential, we must do so in loyal cooperation with the United States."
"This loyal cooperation does not mean that Europe has to issue a blank cheque; Europe has its own positions in relation to the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, extra-territorial laws and trade policy."
"We must also bear in mind that relations between the European Union and the United States are based on common values, on a shared history, and I believe it is important that we do not forget that the trans-Atlantic link is in the European Union’s genetic code and in a shared passion for freedom."
"Furthermore, I believe it is important not to forget that there is an extraordinary degree of interdependence in the economic and commercial fields."
"Four-fifths of the new investments made in Europe today come from the United States and we must not forget that the 15 current Member States of the Union invest more in Texas, the home State of President Bush, than Japan invests in all 50 States of the Union."
"I would therefore like to express my agreement, Mr President, with a fortunate phrase by Commissioner Patten, which I often use in my speeches, which is that everything we want to achieve as Europeans we will be able to achieve much more easily if we cooperate with the United States and I am sure that the United States can achieve what they want if they cooperate with us."
"Mr President, I want to raise two issues in my one minute."
"Firstly, the proposal to launch a transatlantic marketplace is the brainchild of the Transatlantic Policy Network, consisting of multinational corporations, neo-liberal think tanks and politicians in this House."
"It has never been the subject of a proper public debate, even though it will be the biggest deregulation project ever undertaken."
"We do not believe it is in the interests of ordinary people."
"Secondly, I want to urge the Council to raise with US colleagues the issue of Iraq and in particular the recent massacre at Fallujah – and I do not use the word massacre lightly."
"Images of the US military's handling of the uprising in Fallujah have shocked the world."
"More than 600 Iraqis have been killed or injured in the last two weeks by US bombing and ground operations, and yet EU Member States have failed to condemn the US military actions."
"Maybe they accept the reassurance of the commander of US Marines that his men are 'trained to be precise in their firepower'."
"However, over 350 of the dead in Fallujah were women and children."
"In the light of US military use of unjustified and disproportionate force, and given the high death toll in this siege, I call on the Council to raise its human rights concerns in this transatlantic dialogue and to call for an independent commission of inquiry into the US military actions in the Fallujah region."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Minister Roche and Commissioner Patten for the very fine contributions they both made here today, contributions that should be carefully read by Members of this House who would benefit considerably from so doing."
"There must now be a dawning realisation on the American government that unilateralism is simply not the way forward if we are to address the serious problems which confront the international community."
"It is now clearer than ever that the American government did have a plan to rid Iraq of the evil dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, but that it did not have, and does not have, an exit strategy from Iraq."
"This is the root of the political problem which now faces us."
"Multilateral systems have a greater success and lay claim to greater legitimacy in upholding respect for the rule of law in relations between states."
"Effective multilateralism means a commitment to work with others to resolve the root causes of conflict, to promote respect for human rights and to create the machinery for resolving differences by peaceful means."
"A rule-based international order and strong international institutions, such as the United Nations, are of fundamental importance if international problems are to be tackled."
"Multilateral cooperation is in the interests of us all and most particularly serves the interests of smaller states which, lacking military power, must rely on building support for a strong rule-based system."
"We have placed our faith in the multilateral regime for disarmament and in non-proliferation treaties and agreements."
"The war in Iraq has certainly strained relations between many countries in the European Union and with the American government."
"The real question now is how best we can rebuild relations between the European Union and the United States of America."
"We should remember that when it comes to European-American relations there is much more that unites us than divides us although that does not mean that we do not have our differences."
"We have our differences over the Kyoto Protocol, we have our differences over a number of trading issues, but we are in a stronger position to promote the rule of law and to promote democracy when the European Union and the American government can work together as opposed to working in different directions."
"Mr President, the thought of the United States-European Union Summit planned for Dublin in two months’ time is sufficient justification for today’s debate, which, just for once, is being held far enough ahead of the event."
"This should be the norm as often as possible in this House."
"I am pleased that, on this occasion, the draft resolution produced by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, makes much of the matters of security and defence which would justify, if necessary, a reassertion of the transatlantic links, which became extremely stretched at the time of the Iraq crisis."
"On the eve of our next plenary session, which will witness the implementation of the enlargement approved today, it would be appropriate to repeat what we already stated in April in the context of the own-initiative report on European defence policy, the conclusions of which have been taken up by our treaty partners and will, I hope, result in positive decisions when the Intergovernmental Conference has completed its deliberations."
"What did we say then, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten?"
"We said it was a good idea quite simply to repeat that NATO is still today a fundamental guarantee of transatlantic stability and security and that this is why it makes sense to strengthen the capabilities of both NATO and the European Union."
"We must bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that we Europeans are partly responsible for the unilateralism of which we accuse the Americans so much, quite simply because we have been refusing for years to share with them the burden of defending our common values."
"This is why I am pleased about the commitment in this respect, recently reaffirmed by our Parliament and by the Convention."
"Mr President, many of us, particularly on this side of the House, wish to strengthen relations with the United States."
"In these dangerous times it is vitally important that democracies should come closer together and that any differences should be minimised."
"I am encouraged by much of the positive and constructive language in the resolution before us and I am particularly pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted my amendment calling for the establishment of a transatlantic single market by 2015."
"We must now work to turn that aspiration into a reality."
"It is a pity therefore that an otherwise good resolution is spoilt by some sniping against the United States or a subtext that has little to do with transatlantic relations and more to do with the obsessive movement towards some sort of European state."
"The integrationalists clearly visualise just two interlocutors in the transatlantic relationship, the US and the EU."
"The ambition is also for the EU to speak for the European countries in NATO and the UN."
"Indeed, in the objectionable draft European Constitution there is a requirement that the new EU Foreign Minister should present the EU case in the UN Security Council in certain circumstances."
"As a United Kingdom representative, I cannot accept that the European Union should represent us in our dealings with the United States on defence and security matters."
"For over fifty years NATO has provided the forum where the nations of Europe and of North America have discussed the great security issues of our time and agreed on necessary action."
"Difficulties arise when other institutions come into the frame."
"It is misleading our own citizens and our allies to suggest that the development of an autonomous EU military capability has anything to do with reinforcing NATO or is motivated by the desire to work in close partnership with the United States."
"I see no willingness among many EU Member States to contribute more military resources to the defence of the democracies and there is a lack of political will to deal robustly with the security threats that we face."
"We have no wish to see the EU as such involved in defence policy."
"We welcome rapid progress in the creation of a transatlantic single market."
". Mr President, again I wish to thank Members for their contributions, not all of which I will be able to cover."
"Parliament is well aware of how vital the transatlantic relationship is."
"Indeed, I almost signed up for Mr Van Orden's presentation when he said that all sniping should stop, but I unfortunately part company with him on his portrayal of the new Constitutional Treaty."
"That is a debate for another time."
"He is right that it is all too easy to fall into the trap of sniping at the transatlantic relationship, and at the Americans in particular."
"We know about the shared history of Europe and North America, how the history has been shaped and how it has shaped the values we both share – Mr Collins made that point."
"All too often, however, the between the United States and Europe make the headlines."
"It is time to promote the positive element of the relationship and to look at what we can achieve together, rather than continuously to focus on those issues on which we cannot agree."
"We should consider how we turn the ideas we share into a common reality."
"That is the challenge that faces political leadership in Europe and in the United States."
"Like all close partnerships, we do not agree on all issues at all times."
"Even the happiest marriages occasionally have points of disagreement."
"We must, however, work to maintain our dialogue and to cooperate in areas of shared interest."
"Mr Suominen was right to say that finger pointing is neither attractive nor productive."
"I would certainly agree with that view."
"When Mr Collins pointed out the benefits of an effective multilateralist approach, as seen from Europe's viewpoint, he did so without the necessity that some people feel to attack the American viewpoint."
"He simply put forward the fact that there are two different viewpoints and proposed that we should work to produce a synthesis rather than to generate disagreement."
"The fact is that we are working successfully with our United States partners across a full range of foreign policy issues, trade issues and economic issues in a sprit of partnership."
"There certainly are – and will continue to be – areas of disagreement."
"The reality that so much that we do in this relationship is positive should not be obscured by the disagreements of the moment."
"Mr Belder mentioned the Marshall Plan."
"It was very interesting and timely that he should do so, because we need to remind ourselves that if it were not for the extraordinary generosity of the United States and the Marshall Plan, where would Europe be and where would this Union have been?"
"The forthcoming EU-US Summit in June is vital."
"It is very important in terms of the relationship and it is important that we share views, discuss differences and identify more clearly the areas of cooperation."
"The Irish presidency is working hard to ensure a successful summit."
"That is not to suggest that we are supine or that we would not agree occasionally to disagree on issues – of course we will."
"However, we in the presidency will do all we can to steer the relationship back onto a positive and productive track."
"I would just like to mention, because a number of Members made this point, that what we say in Europe is amplified in the USA, and that what we say here is very frequently misportrayed over there."
"I am often shocked when I am in the United States at how often Europe is misunderstood and sometimes misrepresented."
"However, I have no doubt that visitors from the United States listening to our debates must sometimes be mystified as to how the United States is perceived, misunderstood and misrepresented here in Europe."
"As politicians, we have a responsibility to inform our citizens about the positive aspects of the relationship, notwithstanding the fact that there are occasional blips in it."
"In the past that relationship has been incredibly positive and I believe that will continue to be the case."
"One speaker made the point that this was a good debate to have and a good time to have it."
"I agree."
"I thank Members for their contributions, in all their diversity."
"While it will not be possible to follow all the advice that has been proffered simultaneously, I feel it important to say that the presidency has listened very carefully to what this House has had to say on this matter."
". – Mr President, I would be extremely grateful to you if you were to allow me to say one more thing about trans-Atlantic relations."
"I would like to urge the House to support this resolution, for, as the debate has shown, we have to strengthen transatlantic relations in such a way that they are no longer founded only upon NATO and security policy, but that we will be spreading them more widely and deepening them."
"The Council Presidency will support this, and so, I am sure will the Commission."
"The idea of the Transatlantic Marketplace is certainly a matter of very great importance, and so it would make sense if the EU/US Summit were to convene a group of experts to carry out, over the coming months, the studies that will be needed to enable us to get more involved in this project."
"Its significance is not merely economic; it will have a direct effect on the deepening of transatlantic relations."
"At the same time, though, it has to be said that my committee – unlike the lead Committee – actually takes the view that we should welcome the outcomes of the Commission’s negotiations on air transport, to prevent matters being made more difficult at this present time for people travelling back and forth, and that, here too, we should seek a practical approach in order thereby to strengthen relations even in the age of terrorism."
"I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan"
"and the"
"- Report (A5-0275/2004) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the signing of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
". Mr President, I am reminded of an occasion when a senior politician in Ireland was described in very uncomplimentary terms because he was up and down so frequently making contributions."
"I will not go any further into the quotation, but will be available for private consultation on it later on!"
"I would like to thank the House for this opportunity to address the situation in Pakistan."
"I know that this is an issue on which there are divided and diverse views."
"The Council considers it vitally important that the European Union should continue to strengthen its relationship with Pakistan."
"That view is shared by Pakistan itself."
"An enhanced relationship between the European Union and Pakistan is not just important on a bilateral basis."
"It is also important given the context of Pakistan's regional role in South Asia."
"I am therefore pleased to note that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs – and I see Mr Brok is here to present its views – last week approved the conclusion of the third generation agreement with Pakistan, and that in consequence a resolution to that effect is before Parliament and will be voted on later."
"Parliament is aware that the Council is of the view that the agreement is an important element in building an enhanced relationship with Pakistan."
"In such a relationship Pakistan can demonstrate its commitment to the respect, protection and promotion of human rights and to democratic principles, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contained in Article 1 of the agreement."
"We all know that serious concerns remain in relation to human rights and democratic principles in Pakistan."
"Indeed, these concerns have been outlined in the resolution and recognised in the work of the committee."
"I can well understand that the committee needed time to weigh up carefully the pros and cons of the issue and would like to extend my appreciation to the committee members and in particular to its chairman, Mr Brok, and to the rapporteur, Mr Cushnahan, for the work they have done in this area."
"I can assure Parliament that the Council is well aware of the concerns that have been aired in the committee and takes those concerns very seriously."
"At the end of February this year Ireland's Foreign Minister, Mr Brian Cowen, as President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, conveyed those concerns to President Musharraf and to the Pakistani Foreign Minister when the EU ministerial troika visited Islamabad."
"The well-documented revelations regarding Dr Khan and the proliferation of nuclear technology were also addressed."
"The EU ministerial troika expressed its grave concern at these revelations."
"For its part the Pakistani side assured the European Union that the revelations will continue to be fully investigated."
"The presidency hopes this investigation will be thorough and credible."
"The European Union will continue to monitor this issue."
"There are other political issues which give rise to serious concern."
"The situation within the parliament, where the committee system has yet to be fully established, is far from ideal."
"Furthermore, on 13 April Mr Hashmi, President of the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy, was sentenced to a total of 23 years imprisonment for what Pakistani authorities called 'inciting the army to mutiny'."
"The European Union has raised and will continue to raise with the Pakistani authorities its concern at these issues and the implications they could have for future EU-Pakistan relations."
"There is also the position of religious minorities and journalists, who have been subject to restrictions on freedom of expression, arbitrary arrest and worse."
"We are concerned at all these issues."
"Nevertheless, on the positive side of the balance sheet, the third generation agreement would strengthen the platform from which the European Union can convey to the Pakistani authorities at the highest level the importance it attaches to relations with Pakistan and, as part of those relations, our concerns on human rights, democratisation, non-proliferation and other vital issues."
"I would also mention that the conclusion of the third generation agreement clears the way for immediate conclusion of the technical negotiations already under way between the Commission and Pakistan on the readmission agreement."
"It is important to note that there have been a number of other positive developments."
"During the ministerial troika visit to Islamabad the EU welcomed the very important agreement that had just been reached by Pakistan and India on modalities for a composite dialogue between the two neighbours, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir."
"It is in the interests of the region, the European Union and the wider international community that such positive developments be supported and encouraged."
"President Musharraf's commitment to the fight against terrorism is also to be welcomed."
"It highlights Pakistan's crucial regional role, which has a bearing on the situation in Afghanistan and its nascent democratic process."
"I would also like to point out, again on a positive note, that significant progress has been made on the issue of the since our last meeting."
"Following the very positive moves by the Pakistani authorities in response to repeated European representations, all eight people have been released and have now returned to their homes."
"I am certain that honourable Members will welcome this development, as the presidency does."
"I am also certain that they will take some satisfaction in it because the vigilance and attention this Parliament has shown on this issue has been helpful."
"In summary, while there remain points of concern as regards Pakistan, the Council considers that the European Union must engage with Pakistan on those points rather than isolate it."
"The Council will continue to work towards a resolution of these remaining concerns – which are shared by Parliament – in the interests of Pakistan, the region and the Union and, most importantly of all, in the interests of peace in the international community."
". Mr President, I welcome the vote by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy at its meeting of 14 April, to recommend approval of the third-generation cooperation agreement with Pakistan."
"I am fully aware that this was passed by a pretty slim majority and that for many committee members this was not a decision that was taken lightly."
"I very much respect the principled stand taken by the rapporteur during the deliberations that have taken place in the European Parliament."
"I have come to value my honourable friend as a friend of democracy and a friend of human rights in Asia and he has done outstanding work as the European Union's Chief Election Observer in Pakistan and Sri Lanka."
"Although I sympathise with many of the rapporteur’s views, I was not able to support him in his recommendation to keep the agreement pending."
"This is because I feel we should regard this agreement as an opportunity to engage positively with Pakistan as an important partner in a sensitive region."
"I therefore hope that plenary, when it votes, will be able to endorse the Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendation that the agreement be concluded."
"Perhaps I could recapitulate why the European Commission continues to support the entry into force of this third-generation cooperation agreement."
"First and foremost, by means of Article 1, it offers an opportunity to engage more substantially with Pakistan on critical issues of human rights and democracy."
"Secondly, the agreement gives us a better basis for addressing challenges in several key areas, including basic education, trade and institutional links."
"Last but not least, the agreement opens up the possibility of engaging Pakistan in new areas not previously covered, such as regional cooperation, money laundering and energy."
"We regard recent developments as strengthening our position in favour of entering into this agreement, in particular the encouraging efforts for reconciliation with India, as well as domestic political developments in Pakistan."
"As a result of these initiatives there has been a noticeable thaw in Pakistan's international relations."
"For example, there are now indications that Pakistan may be readmitted as a full member of the Commonwealth in due course."
"I am also pleased to see that the seamen of the , including the master, have now been released and have returned to Greece and the Philippines."
"I know that many Members of the House have taken a strong personal interest in this matter."
"I myself raised it repeatedly with Minister Kasuri when last I met him in Berlin on 31 March; but I have raised the issue on a number of other occasions as well."
"The release of the men is indeed a very welcome development."
"We can finally draw a line under this most unfortunate incident and leave remaining issues to be sorted out by the claimants and insurers."
"However, I would be the last to say that democracy in Pakistan is in perfect condition."
"The discussions on this agreement have very usefully highlighted the many areas of concern in our relations – concerns that are well reflected in the motion for a resolution currently before Parliament on the situation concerning human rights and democracy in Pakistan."
"In this regard, the Commission would welcome any further guidance Parliament may want to offer, in particular in the crucial areas of democratisation and human rights."
"I am obviously aware of reports that General Musharraf may still be in two minds as to whether to shed his army uniform by the end of the year."
"In this connection, it is helpful that the Minister of Information has confirmed on the President's behalf that he would stand by his prior commitment."
"Any other outcome would hardly bolster confidence in the constitutional process in Pakistan."
"Pakistan needs to overcome the perception that real power lies with the President rather than the elected parliament and the civilian government."
"I have, however, during my personal visits to Pakistan, always been encouraged by the resilience of civil society in that country, and I remain convinced that this is a strength which the country will be able to build on in the future."
"I would like to associate myself with what the Minister Roche said about the recent conviction of Javed Hashmi, President of the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy."
"I can assure Parliament that we will continue to monitor his case very closely and pursue it strongly in our dialogue with the Pakistani Government."
"With regard to the overall human rights situation in Pakistan, there have been some positive developments, such as the adoption of a juvenile justice system order, but several serious concerns remain, including the blasphemy law, violence against women, the application of the death penalty and the incidence of child labour."
"Pakistan is a focus country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and the Commission is actively trying to address some of these issues."
"This summary shows that the problems and challenges in Pakistan are manifold, but there are also advances and positive developments."
"It is the assessment of this balance that allows me to continue to believe that closer dialogue and cooperation within the structured format offered by the third-generation agreement will best enhance the European Union's capacity to help Pakistan deal with sensitive issues, including human rights, non-proliferation and counter-terrorism."
"To sum up, then, I recognise the strength of views of some colleagues who would like to keep this agreement on ice."
"I think myself that, on balance, we should move ahead with the agreement, and I hope that in doing so we will be able to continue to take an active interest in the development of human rights and democracy in a country which is important to all of us."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I can endorse what has been said in the previous speeches, for this is one of those cases in which one has to find a balance, in which one can describe the glass as half full or half empty, and in which, therefore, one may justifiably come to different conclusions without there being any reason to reproach anyone."
"It is in fact my belief that what Mr Cushnahan has been telling the House for months, and what is expressed in his resolution, does amount to apposite points of criticism that must be addressed in dialogue with Pakistan."
"There is no doubt about the fact that it does not present evidence of fully-fledged democracy, the rule of law, observance of human rights or of the rights of women in the sense in which one would expect on the basis of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, which is, after all, universal."
"For this reason, it is certainly right and necessary that this third-generation cooperation agreement should also be used in such a way that the Council, the Commission and Parliament can work together in monitoring its further progress."
"Another possible model is that the Commission should regularly report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and to Parliament on progress in these fundamental issues of human coexistence, which is the proper way of moving the process along, a process also announced by the President of Pakistan."
"On the other hand, we have to concede that progress may have been unsatisfactory, but there has been some."
"In particular, though, it has to be clear to us that, in what is one of the greatest conflicts Western civilisation has seen, Pakistan is very definitely on the side of those who are fighting terrorism, and that, if there is to be cooperation rather than confrontation, Pakistan’s position in a conflict affecting Iraq and Afghanistan is of the utmost importance."
"We are well aware that, in this Union of ours, mistakes have often been made, and misguided positions have been taken up."
"We know that both the United States and Pakistan have taken up positions on the Taliban that we would today regard as ill-advised, but, even so, we have to realise that it would have been impossible to make progress, in the aftermath of 11 September, without the help of neighbours such as Afghanistan and other countries, of which Pakistan is one."
"That is why I see ratification as necessary; we have to open up the way for the Council to take a decision and for the Commission to make use of its instruments accordingly, always, though, taking the positions expressed in the Cushnahan resolution as our starting point, so that there may be real development and progress in this area."
"At the end of his speech, Commissioner Patten said that he was, on balance, in favour of recommending this agreement."
"I think this ‘on balance’ will have to be reconsidered, in the course of months and years, if the resolution that – I hope – we are about to adopt with a view to going forward, is to continue to be justified."
"Let me once again invite the Council and the Commission to cooperate with Parliament in this joint project, this model project aimed at improving relations while at the same time causing human rights to prevail."
". Mr President, my committee's opinion was that the cooperation agreement should be approved, subject to the enforcement of the human rights clause."
"This would mean that we really do monitor respect for rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, and intervene when breaches occur."
"The EU has not always exploited such possibilities to the full, and Parliament should push harder in future."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights is well aware of the imperfect state of democracy and human rights in Pakistan."
"We are outraged at the discrimination and violence against women, at the continuation of the death penalty and at the persecution of minorities, especially religious and national ones."
"The role of the army is unacceptable and the intelligence services are far too powerful."
"However, this situation is more likely to improve if we are engaged in the dialogue that the agreement will create, and which will enable us to encourage the forces of progress and modernisation."
"The Pakistani diaspora in Europe, which is especially numerous in the UK, can play a very important role in conveying the human rights message."
"My impression is that they want this agreement concluded."
"They are right."
". I wish I could share the optimism of the Council and the Commission that Pakistan is about to demonstrate its commitment to democracy and human rights."
"I find it more likely that Pakistan would quote Article 1 of the agreement, where it says that respect for human rights and democratic principles underpins Pakistan's domestic policies and constitutes an essential element of the agreement."
"In other words, we have now given legitimacy to the current behaviour of Pakistan."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation has therefore asked the Commission to make an evaluation of the human rights situation after one year."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Patten if the Commission is prepared to do that and also, if the situation is not better after one year, to bear the consequences."
"In their decision to abandon the human rights and democracy clause in the Third Generation Agreement with Pakistan, regrettably the Council and the Commission are betraying those in Pakistan – especially those within civil society – who risk their personal safety on a daily basis to defend these principles."
"This betrayal is taking place for a combination of unjustified geopolitical reasons and the 'thirty pieces of silver' in trading benefits that some Member States value so much."
"I listened today to Minister Roche, Commissioner Patten and Baroness Ludford, who argued that there will be an enhanced human rights dialogue."
"Ask those who are persecuted and incarcerated in China, North Korea and Uzbekistan, where there is already a supposedly enhanced human rights dialogue whether it has helped them."
"Let me remind you that, in the case of Uzbekistan, this Parliament was pressurised into ratifying a similar agreement in 1999 and, since then, the human rights situation has deteriorated further."
"The real reason why we are being asked to approve the accord is because of pressure from the US and the UK as a consequence of the current mess in Iraq resulting from a war that should never have been fought without UN approval."
"Does anyone think that it will help the situation in Iraq by abandoning the democratic and human rights of the people of Pakistan?"
"Instead we will be feeding the arrogance of the President of a unipolar power and a subservient UK prime minister and supporting their mistake, which is currently being repeated in the Middle East with likely disastrous consequences!"
"I must ask my colleagues in the European Parliament, are we to be the puppets of the Council and the Commission or will we be the democratic voice of the people of Europe, defending freedom and human rights and giving hope to the oppressed people of the world?"
"If we ratify this agreement we abandon this role in favour of conferring political legitimacy on a quasi-military regime which continues to abuse democracy and human rights and allows nuclear secrets to be sold to rogue states."
"I ask Members of this Parliament, where do you stand on this issue?"
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I have the highest possible regard for Mr Cushnahan’s dedication, and there are many in my own group who argue as he does."
"I, too, am very sympathetic towards them, but I do think that we, who perhaps represent another outlook, are not led or guided either by the Council or by the Commission, by the USA or the United Kingdom."
"Seldom indeed do we find them all taking the same line."
"This is indeed what the Commissioner and the President-in-Office have said it is; not a choice between black and white, but rather between differing shades of grey."
"The fact is that Pakistan is – as it ought to be – an important partner in the development of the region as a whole."
"As I see it, there has, over the past few months, been some progress in Pakistan’s attitude to Afghanistan and to the Taliban situation, as well as in relation to Kashmir, democracy and human rights."
"I am happy, though, to agree with Mr Cushnahan and all those who say that this is far from enough, and that much more has to be done to get Pakistan out of its isolation and moving towards more democracy and human rights."
"I also agree with all those who say that an agreement of this kind must serve as a basis for more intensive dialogue with Pakistan – and with countries like it – in order to spur them on to make further progress."
"I can tell Mr Cushnahan that I understand not in the least why it is that, having had most recently discussions even with Israel on this, we should not perhaps, here and there, insist on withdrawing from similar agreements if the undertakings given are not met."
"I am therefore entirely of the opinion that, having considered all the pros and cons – and I agree with you that there are a lot of the latter – there is, I think, an argument in favour of recommending this agreement by way of the resolution that Mr Brok has described so very well and that you too have signed."
"I would be the first to speak up on behalf of my group and demand our withdrawal from this agreement if the progress that has been begun were not to be continued and completed."
"This leads me to believe that the arguments put forward in this debate do indeed hold water, and my group will recommend acceptance of the agreement."
"I do, however, respect all those who take a different line and whose consciences lead them to vote another way, for the human rights situation is as unsatisfactory as ever and in need of radical improvement."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance agrees in the main with Mr Cushnahan."
"Naturally, a balance has been struck, as Mr Brok said."
"Positive things too are happening in Pakistan, especially the peace talks with India, which are incredibly important and which should have our total support."
"Is it not a little odd that, whenever we strike balances like this, the commercial, trade-policy aspects almost always end up counting for more than the very clear human rights principles we have written into our agreements?"
"What are we playing at, having human rights clauses in agreements with other countries if we always strike balances that end up with our not bothering about the human rights clauses but allowing other, mainly economic, interests to count for more?"
"This leads to our undermining respect for our own high principles."
"It is that balance that makes us in the Greens/ALE Group think it obvious that we must say no to this agreement now."
"We hope that Pakistan will understand this signal and take measures that mean we can quite soon say yes instead of no."
"I should like to have said yes, but that is unfortunately impossible if we are to hold to our human rights principles."
"Mr President, I had the honour to be a part of the delegation to Pakistan's visit to the Pakistani side of the line of control in Kashmir in December."
"We had the opportunity during that delegation meeting to meet with President Musharraf, and I was much impressed by his commitment to pursuing a programme of peace and reconciliation with India."
"It looks, for the first time, as though both sides are prepared to think the previously unthinkable and find a resolution, driven by the economic impact on their two economies of a continuing conflict; a conflict that has dogged the world for the last 50 years."
"Nevertheless, there are still enormous problems in Pakistan regarding human rights, democracy and nuclear proliferation."
"Colleagues have told us about the treatment of Christian and Ahmadi religious minorities, the situation of women, the deeply flawed election result that Mr Cushnahan oversaw, and the jailing of members of the opposition like Javed Hashmi."
"I would therefore concur with my colleagues on those concerns."
"Last year Mr Tannock and I added to our resolution on North Korea the fact that Pakistan had supplied blueprints for a highly enriched uranium technology programme to North Korea for the production of nuclear weapons."
"At the time, we were roundly attacked by the Pakistani Government and when I raised the issue with Foreign Minister Kasuri during the December meeting I was told that the North Koreans needed no help – they were well advanced with nuclear weapon technology, including miniaturisation."
"Whether or not they needed help, it is now clear that it was provided."
"Now new questions are arising about the nuclear test of 30 May 1998 in Baluchistan, which looks as if it could have been a joint test of a plutonium weapon between Pakistan and North Korea."
"When I raised the issue with the Pakistani Ambassador, who came to see me this week, he said that they were cooperating with the United States."
"That is not good enough: we in the European Union want cooperation and to be kept in the loop as well."
"However, despite that, I will support this third-generation cooperation agreement."
"We will be paying close attention to further progress on human rights in Pakistan."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, although I do think that what Mr Cushnahan said is of course highly credible, the point at issue is not whether we feel like puppets – which I do not believe that we are – and nor is it a case of us giving priority to commercial considerations, as Mr Gahrton said."
"Something quite different is at stake."
"It is what Commissioner Patten was talking about in relation to the Middle East this morning; it is about avoiding a clash of civilisations."
"It is about how, by working towards intercultural dialogue, we Europeans are performing what is a primary task for our own age and for our world."
"Whatever the reservations expressed in this debate, Pakistan very definitely has a positive role to play in this."
"The question at issue is: who is our partner?"
"North Korea is not one, but Pakistan is a partner in the fight against international terrorism, and the coalition ranged against that is of course much greater than the coalition of states at present in Iraq fighting terrorism there and fighting against the regime."
"The coalition combating international terrorism includes Germany, France, Russia and others."
"Pakistan is among them."
"It is for that reason that I believe that the conclusion of the Third Generation Agreement is a matter of the utmost urgency."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, democracies do have weapons, but when they give up using them, they lose their souls."
"The way they have dealt with the status of women in Afghanistan should serve as a lesson."
"Today, we are dealing with an agreement between the European Union and Pakistan which has no direct financial impact, since the European Community signed a technical cooperation agreement worth EUR 5 million with Pakistan in February."
"The main thrust of the agreement put to us is therefore political."
"We are all aware of Pakistan’s geostrategic role, bordering as it does on Afghanistan and India."
"We are all aware of the contribution it has made to the anti-terrorist coalition initiated by the Americans following the events of 11 September 2001."
"None of this, however, can justify our support for a country where the present authorities came to power by means of a military coup and where the most recent elections were held in circumstances condemned by our observers and resulted in the installation of a coalition of supporters of President Musharraf and Islamist fundamentalist religious parties not afraid to express their support for Bin Laden."
"President Musharraf has just adopted an amendment increasing the powers of the armed forces."
"The leader of the opposition, Benazir Bhutto, is still in exile and her husband has been in prison for five years."
"We do not underestimate the signs of produced under American pressure in relations with Kashmir, but we feel that nothing practical has yet been achieved."
"We, as European democrats, cannot continue to bemoan the fate of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma and go along with such an agreement without some soul-searching."
"For all these reasons, I beg you, on behalf of the French socialist delegation, to refer this agreement back to committee."
"Mr President, for three years the Parliament has blocked the association agreement with Pakistan to encourage that country's return to democracy and the observance of human rights."
"If we want to maintain that encouragement and not reject the genuine progress made, now is the time to give our support to ratification."
"I do not deny that profound concerns remain in relation to freedom of expression, religious discrimination, and the treatment of women."
"This Parliament cannot and will not justify any abuse of human rights in the name of the war against terror."
"I respect the sincerity of Mr Cushnahan in particular, although I regret that he has chosen to make a personal attack on the British Prime Minister this afternoon."
"However, I reach a different conclusion that does not deny that the 17th Constitutional Amendment represents a return to democracy; that President Musharraf is supporting the bill on the Hudood Ordinances and action against so-called honour killings; that Mr Hashmi was tried in an independent court, he will appeal and that the appeal to the higher court against exile by his own party leader was recently successful."
"We cannot deny that nuclear proliferation is being exposed and stopped, that the Greek seamen have been returned to their own country or that the President has once again confirmed that he will cease to be the chief of the army."
"I want the human rights clause to be a more effective part of our association agreements, but I also want that in relation to the agreements which exist today, with Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Israel."
"A 'no' vote against Pakistan would risk this Parliament being accused of double standards."
"When Pakistan, with India, has had the courage and vision to resume talks which lead the subcontinent from the brink of war, a signal of positive encouragement from Europe is the only just and fitting response."
"Mr President, in the past I have been a long-standing critic of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in terms of its human rights violations, in particular the ongoing persecution of Christian and Ahmadi Muslim minorities; its ambivalent and lukewarm cooperation in the fight against Islamist terrorism, which has led to the destabilisation of Afghanistan by aiding Taliban forces to regroup; ongoing Jihad infiltration across the line of control into Indian Kashmir; and – as Mr Ford said – most importantly of all, the Pakistani export of nuclear technology to rogue states such as North Korea and former terrorist-supporting Iran and Libya, which threaten global security."
"Nevertheless I support the trade agreement, as I have to recognise that Pakistan has recently made some encouraging moves in human rights, including women's rights, which deserve recognition and reward."
"Also, as a friend of India, historically Pakistan's giant neighbour and foe, I take great heart at the peaceful rapprochement as evidenced by several confidence-building measures, most visibly and recently the successful cricket tour."
"Only three years ago the two states teetered on the verge of nuclear war."
"India is today in the midst of general elections as a beacon for democracy and prosperity."
"Its growth rate is now higher than China's and it does not want to see Pakistan suffer economically."
"The recent campaign in Waziristan shows Islamabad's intent to prosecute a war against al-Qa'ida strongholds in tribal areas, historically no-go areas for the government of President Musharraf, who has now pressured tribal leaders to hunt down Islamist militants."
"Maybe human rights clauses should not be in trade agreements, as this muddies the waters, but should instead be conditional on aid received."
"Otherwise, does the EU stop trading with Russia, China, Uzbekistan or Iran, to name a few examples of countries with human rights problems?"
"Clearly that is a matter for another debate, but for the meantime we must support this accord."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for their comments."
"A stable and democratic Pakistan would be a benign influence in the region, especially in the context of neighbouring Afghanistan."
"There are benefits to what is proposed."
"I fully understand the passion that has been injected into this debate by Mr Cushnahan but I do not understand the choice of language."
"It is not a good strategy to portray those who disagree with you as selling out or as being puppets."
"Perhaps when he has the opportunity he might like to reconsider those words."
"You can have principled positions and you can also have pragmatism; they do not rule each other out."
"Nonetheless, I too compliment Mr Cushnahan on the work that he has done and I compliment also Mr Brok, as chairman, on his work and that of his committee."
"The conclusion of the agreement would help the European Union to better engage with Pakistan on the very issues that Mr Cushnahan touches upon, the issues on which we want to have changes."
"Perhaps the last speaker is right when he suggests that human rights issues and issues relating to democracy should be completely excluded from trade agreements, perhaps not."
"A number of other contributors made points with which I can certainly agree."
"Mr Ford indicated clearly that there are concerns, and that he fully appreciates the nature of the concerns, but then made the point that even he, as a Member who is close to the issue, can still support the position which has been taken by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the position which will be voted on here with regard to the third generation agreement."
"Mr Schröder demonstrated again the logic of support for the third generation agreement in his contribution, as indeed did Mr Howitt who reflected the same view and again illustrated the dangers of taking the view that every issue is only either black or white."
"I take very much to heart the comments of Chairman Brok;"
"I only hope that the Council and the Commission will maintain a sense of balance should the third generation agreement be ratified."
"I think Elmar Brok is correct in this particular viewpoint, which is the balanced one."
"It gives us a basis on which we can engage with the Pakistanis."
"The Presidency will not lose sight of the fact that there remain many serious negative issues in relation to Pakistan and we will certainly seek to ensure that the Union maintains pressure on the Pakistani authorities during the period of Ireland's presidency."
"Equally, I have no doubt whatsoever that this will also be the position taken by successive presidencies."
"Again I want to thank you, Mr President, and I want to thank the House."
". Mr President, there have been some extremely good and passionate speeches in this debate, which indicate the extent to which honourable Members have thought carefully about the issues and have weighed the sort of arguments which Mr Cushnahan, Mr Howitt and others have put."
"I would say to Mr Cushnahan, who made a storming speech which reflects his own passionate commitment to democracy, that it came as a modest surprise to me to be described as a 'puppet of Washington and London'."
"This will improve my street credibility in certain parts of the House, but anybody who was in the Chamber this morning may find that a slightly outlandish description of your humble servant."
"All is fair in love and war and I recognise that the honourable Member's speech was, as I said, a reflection of the passion that he feels about this subject."
"One direct question was asked of me and – admirably, because it is not always thus – the person who asked the question has stayed behind to hear the answer."
"I am not prepared – though I understand the importance of the issue – to agree to procedures for this agreement that we do not apply to any other, but I note that the agreement itself contains a suspension clause which both sides can invoke in the event of a breach of an essential element of the agreement."
"Article 1 of the agreement on human rights and democratic principles is such an essential element."
"The Commission is fully aware that this requires constant monitoring and this is, in fact, already being done."
"There is an EU working group on human rights in Islamabad which produces regular reports."
"It is perfectly possible for Parliament to debate those reports whenever it wishes."
"Regular dialogue on human rights will be strengthened once the agreement is in place."
"If the suspension clause is invoked by one of the parties, a consultation mechanism is provided for under the agreement itself, though I sincerely hope there will be no need for this."
"Again, I would like to thank Parliament for what has been an interesting and passionate debate."
"The issues raised are of great importance."
"However, as I have said repeatedly – not least in the committee presided over by the honourable Member – on balance, now is the time for Parliament to vote in favour of this third-generation agreement with a country of considerable importance, both within the region and globally, and of considerable importance not least to our own geostrategic interests."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0270/2004) by Mrs Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on human rights in the world in 2003 and the European Union's policy on the matter."
"Mr President, my report deals with four topics which I shall summarise briefly."
"First topic: the legislature’s record where human rights are concerned."
"This is a mixed picture."
"Of course, the report welcomes the cooperation established with the Council and emphasises the influence Parliament has been able to exert in the struggle against all forms of discrimination and against the death penalty and in favour of women’s rights and of freedom of religion and conscience."
"It regrets, however, that too many of these resolutions are yet to be followed up and that the dialogue on human rights is, in some countries, without substance and of no effect."
"Just one example: the tragic case of Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, whose conviction was confirmed today by the Turkish courts in an iniquitous ruling."
"It may perhaps in the future be necessary to build proper control over human rights in partnership with the country in question, a partnership which respects the country’s culture but which has specific objectives and timescales, as recently initiated in Bangladesh and as may be possible in the future in Morocco and Vietnam."
"Second topic: terrorism."
"The report unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism."
"It stresses the need to organise the fight against this curse. It also states, however, that this struggle must remain within the bounds of international and humanitarian law."
"The report refers to infringements of this law which could, owing to the feelings of injustice and despair they engender, produce an even more fertile breeding ground for terrorism."
"Third topic: reproductive health."
"This is a little known area of health."
"In the last century, of course, the talk was of shameful diseases and, in anatomy, the term shameful nerve was used to describe the nerve which passes through the genital areas."
"What is shameful today is not that nerve, but the fact that, in the twenty-first century, men and women throughout the world are still deprived of sex education, access to information and effective means of contraception enabling them to choose and schedule the number of children they have according to their own wishes and to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS."
"Looking at the terrifying spread of AIDS in Africa, in Asia, Eastern Europe and even, as you are aware, some of the candidate countries at the very gates of the Union, the urgent need for a response is clear."
"Anyone who sees up close, as I myself have done, the sexual devastation in the camps for refugees and displaced persons – remember that there are now 37 million displaced persons throughout the world, 65% of whom are women and young girls, that these women and girls are frequently raped, infected with AIDS and compelled to sell their bodies for food and that many of them lose their lives undergoing back-street abortions – will appreciate – and, in this regard, I appeal to Mr Gahler, representing the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that contraception is a vital instrument for survival."
"In fighting for reproductive health, I am not fighting against any spiritual leaders, whose right to lead their faithful I quite accept."
"I am fighting against certain blinkered policies, such as that of President Bush, which, by slashing funds for the reproductive health programme, including contraception by means of condoms, is going to kill thousands and thousands of people."
"I am in fact fighting for the right to life and human dignity."
"Fourth topic: the rights of disabled people."
"These people are trying to live full lives and their rights, as we know, are still being flouted in the countries of the Union."
"What, however, is to be said, then, about the exclusion of disabled people beyond the frontiers of the Union, their marginalisation and, sometimes, even their confinement in institutions under inhumane conditions?"
"The PPE-DE Group, represented by Mr Gahler, has accused me of doing too much on this subject and of going into too much detail."
"Is the fact that handicapped people represent 10% of the world’s population and that this proportion is increasing alarmingly in the developing countries under the cumulative effect of destitution and armed conflicts a detail, Mr Gahler?"
"A detail, when the PPE-DE Group wishes to delete paragraphs 71, 72, 73, 77, 78, 79 and 80?"
"Are the rights to education, mobility and accessibility and the right quite simply to establish a family mere details?"
"Is it a detail, supporting programmes for the care of children suffering from mental problems during conflicts? Is the fact that paragraph 78 is to be crossed out with a stroke of the pen a detail?"
"These are details which will doubtless be fully understood by disabled people and the people defending them."
"This report is characterised by conviction and is not designed to provoke. It presents a broad view, I accept, of human rights throughout the world."
"It is, however, a view bringing hope in a world torn apart. I should not like to finish without thanking all the groups which, apart from the PPE-DE Group, have supported me in putting forward this vision."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for allowing me to chip in before them and I would like to apologise to the honourable Member and to the House for the fact that I have to slip away leaving the Commission seat in the capable presence of my colleague, Commissioner Reding."
"I have to go to Moscow for meetings with President Putin and Mr Lavrov and others."
"I hope the House will excuse me of any discourtesy."
"I would like to start by thanking Mrs De Keyser for her report, which illustrates yet again how the engagement of the European Parliament on human rights issues serves in my judgement as a critical stimulus to EU policy."
"The Commission will, as usual, respond in writing to all the recommendations addressed to us in this report."
"I should like, for my part, to reflect on some of the important themes which have been revised."
"This subject of human rights and terrorism will unfortunately remain at the top of the international agenda for some time to come."
"My position on the fight against terrorism is clear."
"It has been set out several times."
"I referred to it again a couple of times last night and again this morning."
"I will reiterate it here."
"The fight against terrorism must be predicated on respect for human rights, and not the other way around."
"It is also my deep conviction that this alone is not enough."
"Fostering human rights should be an integral part of the fight against terrorism."
"The Commission will continue its efforts to promote and protect human rights in cooperation with our partners with all the means at our disposal: political dialogue, development cooperation and work with civil society in third countries."
"Two human rights issues which have received much less attention are covered in this admirable report: the right to health – in this case reproductive health – and the pervasive discrimination which, despite their efforts, people with disabilities still face all over the world, and which is compounded in situations of conflict or poverty."
"The ability of all people, especially women, to achieve reproductive health is an integral part of their reproductive rights."
"The rapporteur is quite right in her account of the dire consequences if the right to reproductive health is denied and also in stating that reproductive health is not a 'women's issue' alone."
"However, it is important to note that the social consequences of reproductive ill health can be most severely felt by girls."
"For example, in many parts of Africa, female adolescents are more likely than males to be stigmatised for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, and they are also more likely to suffer disproportionately from such problems as unsafe abortion and infertility."
"Since 1994, the Commission has become a major partner in addressing reproductive health needs in developing countries, in the framework of the goals agreed at the UN International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo ten years ago."
"Between then and 2001, we committed over EUR 655 million in external assistance that was explicitly targeted at family planning, reproductive health, safe motherhood, HIV/AIDS and population policy and management."
"Furthermore, in July last year, the Council adopted a regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries."
"Under this regulation, Community financial support is given to specific operations targeting the poorest and most vulnerable populations in both rural and urban areas, designed to combat practices harmful to the sexual and reproductive health of women, adolescents and children, such as female genital mutilation, sexual violence, child marriages and early marriages."
"The European Union has demonstrated its commitment to advancing respect for the human rights of people with disabilities through Community legislation which has been introduced on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty to combat discrimination in the field of employment, initiatives pursued as part of follow-up to last year's European Year of Disabled People and through its active engagement on a new UN Convention in this area."
"The Commission has further undertaken a number of initiatives as part of our wider efforts to mainstream human rights in all aspects of our development cooperation, including the distribution of specific policy guidance on development and disability for the use of our delegations."
"But there is still some way to go."
"We think the best way of addressing this is through the provision of training for our staff and facilitating exchanges between representatives of disabled people's organisations and policy-makers, by raising awareness of disability issues in our dialogue with developing countries, and by including organisations for people with disabilities in the dialogue at country level."
"Lastly, this excellent report highlights the anguish caused by one of the most pernicious causes of unnecessary disability in many countries, that is the use of anti-personnel landmines."
"Here the Commission is committed to pursuing a vigorous policy to eliminate the threat posed by anti-personnel landmines and increasing its efforts to reduce the humanitarian, social and economic costs to mine-affected countries."
"The strategy for mine action in the period 2002-2004 relates EU action to the goals set by the international community in the context of the Ottawa Convention."
"Assistance for mine clearance and capacity building under the EC budget has been channelled to 33 countries and regions and in 2002 European Union assistance as a whole reached EUR 145 million."
"I have been privileged to see the work we are doing in this sector from Sri Lanka to the Balkans."
"It is enormously important and it is valuable, as are the other points made in this report, that the honourable Member has drawn this matter to the attention of the Parliament and to European public opinion as a whole."
"We are extremely grateful for the report."
"I apologise for having to dash to Moscow more rapidly that Napoleon managed and I am grateful to the presidency for making my dash possible."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten; we wish you a good journey to Moscow."
". Mr President, I too welcome the opportunity to address the House in the context of this debate on human rights."
"It is an important debate."
"As I mentioned before, it is an issue of particular concern and interest to me."
"Enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and the Council on human rights issues is very important."
"It is an important focus of the Irish presidency."
"It is very important that we should be close on this issue."
"I want to thank Ms De Keyser for her very valuable report on human rights in the world in 2003 and the EU's policy on the matter."
"The report will be part of a very important discourse."
"We might disagree on some elements within it, but the reality is that this is a very good report."
"The protection and promotion of human rights should be a constant yardstick of our international actions."
"We adhere to the basic principle that human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and inter-related."
"As Commissioner Patten just said, they are so closely related to the troubles we have in a troubled world."
"I need not emphasise the close relationship between peace, security and stability on one hand and the respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy on the other."
"The present debate in Parliament is timely, including for the reason that it coincides with the current sixth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is ongoing in Geneva."
"I should like to say a few words about our relationship with the Commission."
"The annual report of Parliament rightly makes reference to the large degree of congruence between the European Parliament's priorities as expressed in its resolutions and the EU action taken at sessions in the Human Rights Commission."
"This is a concrete example of the implementation of the Council and the European Parliament working together more closely to achieve openness and transparency and the European Union's human rights policy."
"Indeed this is one of the recommendations of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in their conclusions on 10 December 2002, concerning human rights and the democratisation of third countries."
"The European Union has played a positive role at this year's commission in Geneva."
"To date, on individual country situations the Union has successfully tabled resolutions on human rights situations in Belarus, Turkmenistan and in North Korea."
"A resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories was also adopted by the Commission."
"The thematic resolutions tabled by the European Union have also been successfully steered to adoption."
"The Union's resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance, for example, has been adopted by consensus."
"The resolution on the rights of the child was adopted by mere unanimity following a call for a vote by the United States."
"I expect that the Commission will also adopt the European Union's resolution on the death penalty later this week."
"All of that is to be welcomed."
"However, a number of important United Nations-EU initiatives have fallen."
"This is due, in significant part, to the composition of the United Nations Human Rights Commission."
"It also reflects the unwillingness of some regional groups to accept any condemnation of their members."
"This has always struck me as one of the fatal flaws within the UN system."
"An initiative from the EU on Chechnya was defeated and our resolution on Zimbabwe fell to a 'No Action' motion."
"It is noteworthy that the number of votes that were cast against the draft resolution on Chechnya was, this year, significantly higher than those recorded on the same issue last year."
"We will have to analyse this outcome and learn why this has happened."
"We will also need to address the number of critical, country-specific resolutions that we table at the Commission."
"Not least, we need to decide on whether our priority is to make Union declarations so that the world knows where we stand, or to see our texts in fact adopted by a majority of members of the Commission."
"If I could lapse into less diplomatic language, it may be time that the European Union learned to 'box a little more cleverly' in its dealings on the Human Rights Commission."
"If we want to be effective, as opposed to simply making declarations, we have to be strategic in our approach."
"I want to deal with three priority areas that are mentioned in the report."
"In her report, Ms De Keyser focuses on three main themes: first, trends in the international war on terrorism; second, the impact of the international situation on reproductive health; and third, the rights of disabled people, particularly in conflict situations or in extremely poor or developing countries."
"In regard to disability, I was struck when reading the report by the reference to the fact that three-quarters of disabled people live in developing countries."
"The incidence and intensity of disability in the developing world is aggravated by poverty and, as Commissioner Patten has said, by conflict."
"It is a horrific fact that a huge amount of mutilation and disability flows from the use of landmines produced in so-called developed, civilised nations and then exported to the third world."
"In recognition of the rights of persons with a disability, during the Irish presidency we will further progress work within the Union and at the UN-level to lead to an elaboration of a UN convention on the human rights of persons with disabilities."
"In the context of reproductive health, the annual report highlights the worrying increase in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in eastern Europe and in central Asia, and the relationship between poverty and reproductive health issues."
"The Irish presidency has recognised the importance of addressing the AIDS issue and it is way beyond the capacity of any one government to solve."
"In February the presidency hosted a major conference in Dublin on the problem of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region under the title 'Breaking the barriers: the fight against HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia'."
"On reproductive health in general, I want to state that the European Union will unstintingly work to ensure that the rights to reproductive health care and services accepted in all basic documents of the major UN conferences would be implemented."
"The European Union and its Member States are committed to the specific reproductive health goal that was agreed at the Cairo International Conference. That is to make primary health care – reproductive health care – accessible to all individuals of appropriate age as soon as possible and no later than 2015."
"This commitment is demonstrated by the regulation, adopted by the European Council in July 2003, on aid for policies and actions on reproductive health."
"As for terrorism, Mrs De Keyser is quite right to emphasise that the danger of emotional reactions, such as fear, anger and a desire for vengeance, can lead to calls for repressive measures in the fight against this phenomenon."
"This is a common theme that has run through so many of the debates in this House: we all are interested in a common fight against terrorism but we must also make sure that the fight is balanced with respect for human rights for democratic principles and for the rule of law."
"In the period since September 2001, the fight against terrorism has become a global priority."
"At the same time, that fight has posed new challenges for the promotion and protection of human rights."
"Acts of terrorism can never be justified by any cause or ideology, and must unreservedly be condemned."
"The indiscriminate slaughter of unsuspecting human beings, which is the hallmark of terrorism, constitutes first and foremost a flagrant denial of the most fundamental right of all: the right to life."
"All states have a duty to protect their citizens from terrorist attack and to combat terrorism in all its forms."
"Yet, in order to receive the widest possible support and to be successful in the long term, the fight against terrorism must be conducted in full respect of human rights and in full respect of fundamental freedoms."
"Fostering human rights should indeed become an integral part of any fight against terrorism."
"We must also address the causes of terrorism."
"To seek to understand the causes of terrorism should not be understood as being in any way soft on terrorism or on the terrorists."
"On the contrary, it is an essential step in the elimination of terrorism."
"As the President of the European Council, Mr Ahern stated here in Parliament last month that any good physician will tell us that in treating a disease it is first necessary to tackle its causes as well as its symptoms."
"All too often the simplistic response to terrorism is equivalent to addressing only the symptoms, not the disease."
"In the context of combating terrorism, Mrs De Keyser also rightly notes the need not to use this objective as an excuse to suppress the freedom of the press and specifically not as a justification for attacks on individuals or individual journalists."
"The European Union has traditionally attached great importance to the work performed by all human rights defenders, including those in the media."
"Human rights defenders have become increasingly effective in ensuring greater protection to victims of human rights violations."
"However, this progress has frequently been achieved at a high price and at high individual cost."
"The defenders themselves have increasingly become the targets of attacks and their rights have been violated in too many countries."
"While the European Union has attached importance to the protection of human rights defenders this has been largely done on an ad hoc basis to date."
"The Irish presidency is working to produce specific policy guidelines in order to strengthen the European Union’s support for human rights defenders."
"These guidelines will shortly be brought before the Council of Ministers."
"Let me again congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"On behalf of the Council, the presidency welcomes this collaboration with Parliament in further advancing our common cause of democracy and human rights."
"The European Union is founded on respect for human rights, and this is true both of the internal affairs policy within the Union and it is equally true of our policy in foreign affairs."
"– Mr President, protection of human rights is, traditionally, one of the core issues for the European Parliament, and there is in fact political consensus on how to handle it."
"The standards to be applied are to be found in the international agreements protecting human rights."
"Those breaching these standards or negligently allowing them to be breached must come in for criticism from this House."
"This year’s report, however – in contrast to all its predecessors during this legislative period – has not been born under an auspicious star."
"Our main point of criticism is that the rapporteur has laden down what is meant to be an annual report on human rights with an unacceptable amount of ideological ballast, and made her own hobbyhorses, not to say obsessions, its central point."
"That, for a start, is why it lacks a general and uncontentious component, which has been introduced into the text only by dint of 70 amendments."
"Let me reiterate, for the sake of absolute clarity, that such a report has to be about the big issues, that is to say, about questions like: where do we demand democracy, free elections, freedom of opinion, freedom of the press, freedom of faith and conscience, the removal of legal and practical discrimination against women, the protection of physical integrity and so on?"
"For what do we criticise the Council, particularly when, in its dealings with large countries, it pays only lip service to human rights?"
"It goes without saying that reference in such a report to the rights of – for example – the disabled is only right and proper."
"Of course, their rights as citizens of the State with equal status must be enforced, and demeaning treatment in public facilities must be denounced."
"Within the limits of what individual States can do, the human right to life also includes the right of access to health facilities, but you must stop dressing up detailed demands in health and social policy – desirable though they may be – as a catalogue of human rights and immortalise them in this report."
"The fact is that those things that are guaranteed as human rights can be claimed as legal entitlements, and those who fail to provide them are violating human rights, but no single constitution, not one international convention – European or otherwise – declares the detailed demands you make here to be actionable human rights."
"If they were to do so, the Mayor of Rabat or his counterpart in Lagos would be violating human rights by failing to comply with your demand that the city’s buses should be equipped with doors that disabled people can use."
"Failure to do so may well make him a bad mayor, but he is not violating human rights."
"This shows just how false your approach is."
"There is no human right to the distribution of free condoms either, but, in this case, it is a goal to be achieved."
"The President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, may well have the wrong idea about how to combat Aids, but that does not make him a violator of human rights."
"This House has before it Mr Mantovani’s outstanding report on the situation of disabled people, and it is the proper place for all the things you enumerate, but then you would be able only to table amendments and the report would not carry your name."
"Let me tell you, Mr Mantovani’s report puts it all so much better; that is why we will be voting for his report and not for yours."
"As for your other hobbyhorse, reproductive health, that belongs in the Committee on Development and Cooperation or in the Junker report on 10 years after Cairo – in fact, it is already in there – but not, in this form, in the category of guaranteed and actionable human rights."
"From whom, then, do you intend demanding it?"
"This is where you and I are often not that far removed from each other;"
"I too am against this Mexico City policy."
"I am also the first to want Catholic mission stations to hand out condoms rather than anathematise them, but when you demand that we in the EU make up for the loss of funds from the USA, that, I think, is when others will get the idea of saving their money; after all, the EU will take over, will it not?"
"The consensus on human rights in this House has lasted for many years, but, as I see it, your report does nothing to help maintain it."
"Mr President, in Britain a man suffocated to death his 40-year-old brother who had Huntington's Disease."
"He pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and the judge set him free."
"In a residential institution in Belgium, disabled people have been abused by carers and health workers, physically beaten and their money taken and used by staff."
"In a residential home in the Netherlands, five elderly people with dementia were hit, spat at, kicked and called names by three nurses."
"In Spain, a 44-year-old disabled woman was confined by her parents to a cellar six feet deep from the age of four."
"Social workers knew about this for 25 years."
"In Bulgaria, children in a home for intellectually disabled people were tethered to their beds in winter and left to freeze at night when the heating was turned off to save money."
"Fifteen children - a quarter of the residents - died."
"A man from Venice in Italy with mental health problems was habitually locked in his home when his mother went out, leaving him alone."
"When fire broke out he found the front door locked and died of suffocation from smoke inhalation."
"In Germany a 55-year-old man with learning difficulties and impaired sight was attacked on his way to work by two skinheads and beaten and trampled to death."
"The youths told the police that 'he was unworthy of life'."
"As Mr Gahler has just stated, the members of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament voted against Mrs De Keyser's admirable report in committee and some threatened to oppose it in plenary, because they say that these examples of abuse against disabled people do not constitute a breach of human rights."
"Shame on them!"
"Mr President, will we ever achieve the level of civilisation at which large-scale human rights violations will be a thing of the past?"
"The most important reason for such violations is often the retention or indeed, conquest, of power at all costs."
"Similarly, barbaric practices of sowing hatred for purely religious or ethnic reasons have by no means been stamped out; on the contrary, ever more innocent people are being killed on a random basis."
"This week, we are commemorating the massacre in Rwanda."
"The world community is collectively hanging its head in shame for its own passiveness."
"Is this genuine?"
"Have we really drawn the correct conclusions?"
"For Europe, do human rights really weigh as heavily in practice as the solemn declarations would suggest?"
"Are we really prepared to give precedence to human rights over economic and strategic interests?"
"Unfortunately, this is still not the case."
"Extensive violence, torture, structural violations, such as abuse of women, the caste system, are still a daily occurrence."
"Luckily, Mrs De Keyser supports the appeals I made in my report last year to make the human rights dialogue with partner countries less non-committal and structure it more effectively."
"The question is to what extent this has had an effect in practice."
"Since my report, cooperation with the Council has considerably improved on a number of levels."
"I expect that the Dutch Presidency will further improve relations with this House where these matters are concerned."
"We on our part would do well to ensure that the human rights report is published on a set date every year, so that it is possible to include a verdict about the Council report and also about the solutions brought by the UN human rights committee."
"In addition, our Parliament should follow up human rights violations where we have identified them more systematically."
"It is unfortunate how the De Keyser report came about."
"Despite this, my group supports the content, even where the rights of the disabled and reproductive health are concerned."
"After all, it goes against any fundamental sense of justice that someone should die due to a lack of medical care."
"Our Christian Democrat friends should agree on this, even if it involves non-enforceable rights."
"Finally, I should once again like to highlight the increasing abuse of religions for political ends and radicalism."
"Given the seriousness of the threat and the reality of Madrid, I would repeat last year's appeal that the European Union will need to map out the problem in all its dimensions and should draft a strategy to prevent this religious extremism."
"It is also high time, in my view, that the EuroMed Foundation, which was decided on in Valencia in 2002, finally got off the ground."
"The European Union prides itself on being a community of values."
"That means that our human rights policy should become less non-committal; it also entails an obligation to work to propagate a level of civilisation at which large-scale human rights violations are a thing of the past."
"Mr President, the annual report on human rights is once again, unfortunately, the occasion on which we acknowledge that the world situation is becoming worse."
"The law of the jungle and the option of repression and military intervention are supplanting the principles and values of international law."
"The war on terrorism is seen as justifying all-out aggression, in many regions of the world, against individual and collective freedoms."
"The list is a long one, and includes Turkey, where Leyla Zana and her companions have just been unjustly condemned, once again, for speaking out on behalf of the Kurdish people;"
"Tunisia, where harassment and repression of any democrat are increasing, a phenomenon to which the European Union is indifferent;"
"Morocco, where violations of the rights of the Sahrawi people are increasing in occupied Western Sahara;"
"Iraq, where US occupying forces are causing real human tragedies, buying up the country’s natural resources at low prices and taking upon themselves the right to behave like masters, and Palestine where, in the words of Avraham Burg, the former Speaker of the Knesset, the situation is so explosive that, ‘crying out is a moral imperative’."
"One could also mention the intolerable harassment of those who defend human rights all over the world."
"According to the 2003 Annual Report of the International Federation for Human Rights Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, ‘The present climate that focuses on security first and the implementation of arbitrary measures restricting individual freedoms undermines the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"In this context, it has become more and more difficult to denounce the adoption of restrictive laws, to defend the right to a fair trial, to fight against the death penalty and to condemn torture.’"
"In some countries, journalists, lawyers, political opponents and trade unionists have become real targets to be shot down."
"However, now more than ever, support and encouragement for these men and women in their struggle for democracy, justice and peace are proving to be vital to our common future."
"Finally, respect and guarantees for fundamental rights such as the right to sovereignty, the right to food self-sufficiency, the right to health, and the right to live in dignity and not in misery, are also playing their part in the building of a better world."
"In that sense I support the rapporteur’s action, particularly as regards reproductive health."
"– Mr President, we can accept the changes in substance, despite the restricted emphasis on some details."
"At the same time, however, I want more generally to draw attention to the methods that have been used, which this time have been scandalous."
"Human rights must not be allowed to become hostage to short-sighted and often media-led day-to-day politics."
"Thus, their implementation requires political choices to be made and it will also have a political impact."
"They have intrinsic value."
"Human rights work calls for an overall view of the situation and the systematic, sustained and consistent prioritisation of problems, both in thematic and geographical terms, that is based on its own system of logistics."
"We welcome this report’s overview of human rights work at the present time."
"At the same time, however, we need to look to the future."
"Unless we can improve the way we coordinate the EU’s internal and external human rights monitoring processes and put them on a par with one another, unless we are able to engage in more vigorous post-monitoring activity and disregard irrelevant political motives and hidden agendas, we will be leaving a sad legacy to the next Parliament."
"Only if we can put our own house in order can we in any credible way demand that Member States and the Council give up their attitude to trade policy and other narrow views on what they might gain from a situation, and create a consistent and lasting policy."
"In this sense human rights begins at home and that is mainly what the issue is now."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the speech we have just heard."
"We too would have preferred a report that addressed the common core of the human rights culture stemming from the United Nations Universal declaration of Human Rights."
"This is the direction we should be taking rather than using these reports for any other purpose."
"I acknowledge that the report is better than the original version that was rejected in the parliamentary committee, but nevertheless, I wish to make some observations on my own behalf and on behalf of my group."
"First of all, a few words on the Sakharov Prize and the three winners of this prize, who continue to be persecuted."
"The resolution lacks balance, with the explanatory statement citing three cases in Turkey, Burma and Cuba whereas paragraph 23 of the final resolution ignores the situation of Osvaldo Payá in Cuba."
"This must be corrected, otherwise we could be accused of memory loss and of bias."
"Secondly, where terrorism is concerned, we have still not achieved a properly balanced approach."
"Above all, however, I wish to express my reservations as to the way in which the issue of reproductive health has been brought into this matter and especially as regards the link that is made between abortion and reproductive health – something with which I wholeheartedly disagree."
"To quote only a few figures from the report, its explanatory statement claims that 100 abortions take place every minute and that 70 000 women die each year from unsafe abortions."
"I have done some calculations and this means that 52 560 children die in non-leap years and 52 700 in leap years, in addition to these 70 000 women."
"These are certainly worrying figures, but our slant on them is entirely different: we see them as confirming the right to life."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Veronique De Keyser for having for the first time in the history of this Parliament included women's reproductive rights in her report."
"At the ICPD the international community placed reproductive health firmly in the context of human rights, and for a very good reason."
"When human rights treaties are interpreted, the biological differences between men and women are not taken into account and this has drastic consequences, especially with regard to the AIDS pandemic, 60% of those affected being women."
"Only 11% of women in a country like Zambia think that they have the right to ask their husbands to use a condom."
"Up to half the young women and girls in developing countries say that they were forced into their first sexual experience."
"They do not have abstinence as a choice."
"They may be faithful but their husbands are not, and they do not use a condom either."
"If fact married women have a higher frequency of HIV than unmarried women."
"These women desperately need to know that sexual and reproductive health is a right."
"I am appalled that some colleagues in this House want to deprive women of these rights in trying to suppress a chapter making them explicit in the human rights report."
"This House should be very clear in its support to these women; we can do that by voting in favour of Mrs De Keyser's amendments and her report."
"Mr President, I get the disagreeable feeling that the rapporteur sees the fight against terrorism as just as big a problem as terrorism itself."
"This remark was made repeatedly during the discussion of the report in committee."
"It was emphatically denied, but the final version of the report has in any event not been able to take away this feeling."
"Formally, terrorism is condemned – just as well – whereupon the report spends many paragraphs on the human rights of terrorists or those accused of terrorist acts."
"Similarly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lacks any sense of nuance: Palestinian terror attacks and the construction of the security wall, for example, are bracketed together."
"We in this European Parliament should seriously consider whether reports such as this one are useful."
"Moreover, this is a report on human rights in the world, which means the world outside of the European Union, while we would perhaps do well to look closer to home."
"Today of all days, the court in Belgium is passing judgment in a court case against the most important Flemish opposition party, the , a case instituted by a government body in which all the traditional parties have a seat, including that to which the rapporteur belongs."
"What we are now witnessing in Belgium is the instrumentalisation of the fight against racism, or what should pass as such, in order to curb the right to the free expression of opinion."
"With the elections only a few weeks away, attempts are being made to rob a democratic opposition party of its funding and even to have a court impose a ban on it."
"You will appreciate that I have my reservations when someone who condones practices such as these is rapporteur today of a report on human rights in the world."
"Mr President, I am a great supporter of genuine human rights, but there is a danger that we are moving to an increasingly rights-based culture and that just about every human desire and social and health need is defined as a fundamental human right."
"This approach is unhelpful from many standpoints, not least from the point of view of those who suffer genuine human rights abuse and whose cry is muffled by all the other competing demands."
"I have another concern: at a time when international terrorism ranks among our greatest anxieties, we all too often see terrorists and their front organisations and political apologists abuse the human rights label for their own purposes as a political weapon and as a means of reducing the effectiveness of the security forces operating against them."
"The report before us contains all of these faults."
"It is a great improvement on the first draft, but still lacks sufficient focus on the real human rights concerns around the world."
"Whilst swiping at the current targets of the left - the United States and Israel - it misses the opportunity to expose those corrupt regimes on many continents that keep their people in misery, and offers very little support to the victims of terrorism or those engaged in fighting terrorism."
"In regard to the Israel-Palestine question, paragraph 46 of the report infers that settlement activity outside Israel's borders is somehow comparable to indiscriminate terrorist attacks on innocent civilians inside Israel."
"Such comparisons are nothing short of abhorrent and it is most irresponsible for politicians to make such suggestions, particularly when all our peoples are faced with the threat of terrorism."
"In regard to the issue of Guantanamo Bay, the report offers excessive comfort to those detained in Camp Delta, while ignoring the difficulties faced by our democracies in dealing with fanatics who are intent on menacing and murdering innocent civilians."
"I would like to see a call for tough action by the EU and the rest of the international community to bring about real change in the countries that are the real human rights abusers, like Zimbabwe."
"Let us focus on real human rights problems, not political whim."
"Mr President, this is a very important report, which very nearly foundered on account of underhand political games on the part of the Right."
"I shall concentrate upon two parts of the report: those relating to Israel/Palestine and to women’s right to determine their own lives."
"Let me first say, regarding the Pakistan debate, that, on this issue too, human rights, and not the economic aspects, must be central."
"Legitimising a regime that, through a military coup, has seized power and does not respect human rights should be quite alien to the EU."
"Yesterday, those of us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy were able to listen to the Geneva Initiative and representatives from both Israel and Palestine, confirming what is described in, for example, items 46 and 47 of this report but which the group on the Right now wishes to vote away."
"Closing one’s eyes to reality has never led to genuine solutions to problems."
"Secondly, a word about reproductive health."
"Women’s rights are human rights."
"Women must, of course, have the right to make decisions concerning their own bodies and so have the right to reproductive health."
"Proposals 28–40 are important additions to support."
"Every minute, a woman dies for reasons connected with childbirth."
"Every minute, 100 abortions are carried out, half of them by people with no medical training."
"Every year, 70 000 women die following unsafe abortions."
"In the developing countries, reproductive problems are the most important cause of death and disablement."
"In this situation, refusing to support organisations that provide advice on contraception and consciously helping bring about a situation in which hundreds of thousands of women undergo unsafe abortions and die prematurely and in which hundreds of thousands of women are infected with HIV each year constitute a profound violation of human rights and a serious risk to women’s reproductive health."
"Mr President, in the eyes of the surrounding world, the EU’s work on human rights is of very great significance."
"Rogue states, which we condemn in our reports, despatch their ambassadors with a view to having references to their countries removed at any price."
"Conversely, a resolution by Parliament sometimes gives hope and renewed courage to those throughout the world who are imprisoned, tortured and oppressed or who are engaged in struggle."
"Committed people look to the EU to play an active role in working for a better world."
"They are sometimes disappointed when we choose to close our eyes to serious crimes because trade policy or strategic interests come before such gross violations."
"We must therefore never flinch from emphasising human rights in contacts with countries such as China, Iran, Cuba, Syria, Zimbabwe, etc."
"Almost five years ago, I myself wrote a report on the annual report on human rights in which I drew attention to the subject of violence against women."
"I think it logical that we continue down this road in the last report of this term of office."
"The fact that, in 2004, we are having a debate about sexual violence, genital mutilation, the sex trade, the rape of young girls and the lack of AIDS medication not belonging in a report on human rights shows that we have quite a long way to go in this House too."
"I do not agree with Mrs De Keyser regarding all the details of her report, but it is important and only right to highlight these issues."
"It is very odd that there should be protests from the right wing about these issues not belonging in a report on human rights."
"Mr President, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, many people thought that the end of the cold war meant that we would finally have a world at peace. Yet exactly the opposite has happened."
"There has never been so much violence in the world."
"It was in this climate of fear and interrogation that the Bush administration launched its anti-terrorist crusade, the sole aim of which was actually to ensure the economic, and therefore military, supremacy of his empire in a globalised liberal economy."
"A new concept has been born, a concept full of tragic consequences, the concept of preventive war."
"It is in the name of the fight against the private terrorism of his former agent Bin Laden that Bush is now legalising state terrorism, the first victims of which are the Palestinian or Iraqi people and the first accomplices of which are Sharon, Blair or Aznar."
"It is always in the name of the fight against terrorism that a new arsenal of repression is being stockpiled throughout the world, which calls into question fundamental liberties."
"What values could we possibly have in common with a government which has organised that camp of the living dead in Guantanamo Bay?"
"Far from weakening private terrorism, this arsenal actually tends to criminalise any opposition to the establishment of this new order, such as trade-union, associative or anti-globalisation movements."
"Unfortunately, the European Union has participated in this undertaking, with a definition of terrorism which is fatal to liberty, by adopting the European arrest warrant or the many laws against immigrants, not to mention those governments which still, in Europe, dare to prohibit abortion."
"The campaign to eradicate war and violence cannot be confined to pious hopes, which is something which Parliament has a habit of doing."
"We must attack the root of the evil, a social system dominated solely by profit, which transforms people into commodities, a regime which destroys the environment and excludes billions of human beings from employment, from health or education systems, from housing, or even from the basic ability to feed themselves."
"Capitalist globalisation generates the globalisation of violence."
"Even now, however, we can take practical steps, for example by regularising the situation of illegal immigrants, prohibiting collective deportations on charter flights, insisting that the Council freezes the association agreements with Israel, reorganising the distribution of wealth, in particular by imposing a Tobin tax on movements of capital, or, finally, cancelling third world debt."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, today this House is examining the human rights situation and European policy in relation to third countries."
"I have decided to devote my speech to Syria."
"I am sure you will be aware of the fact that, in that country, the defenders of human rights and democratic freedoms are suffering constant pressure and harassment."
"Several reports by NGOs condemn flagrant violations: people in prison because of their opinions, political exiles, repeated interrogations, interruption of speakers, arrests, torture, and sometimes disappearances."
"Aktham Naissé, Chairman of the Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, was arrested on 13 April by the military security forces."
"He is being held in detention at a secret location."
"He is not allowed to have his medical treatment, despite the fact that his state of health is giving grave cause for concern."
"It even seems that he will shortly have to appear before the State Security Court."
"Is there any threat to public order or act of terrorism in defending human rights?"
"Ahmad Khazen and Hassan Watfa were arrested on 15 and 16 March 2004 by the military security forces and sentenced to prison for having taken part in a deputation to the parliament, calling for democratic reforms and the lifting of the state of emergency."
"To date, Syrian civil society has still not heard or seen any reaction from the European Commission. Yet the Commission’s delegation to Damascus has already witnessed several of these violations."
"It is not a matter of interference, but rather of defending universal values for which we have a responsibility."
"Allow me to remind you that we are currently in the process of negotiating an association agreement with Syria."
"Agreements of this type are based on the rule of law, and Article 2 of such agreements clearly stipulates an undertaking, on the part of both parties, to respect human rights."
"In Syria, a state of emergency has been in existence for 41 years, thus enabling martial law to be applied by means of military courts."
"This is contrary to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms as guaranteed by international law and the Barcelona Declaration."
"Exactly one month ago, on 22 March in Athens, we created the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, of which Syria is a member."
"Such a partnership can only be constructed on the basis of certain requirements such as respect for human rights and democratic freedoms."
"I should therefore like to ask you to intervene as a matter of urgency with the Syrian authorities, and ask them to guarantee the integrity of the people I have just referred to, to order their immediate and unconditional release, to put an end to the constant pressure and harassment, to respect international law and to comply with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the international instruments which have been ratified by Syria."
"Our democracies have ways of exerting pressure."
"If we do not use them to ensure that our universal values are respected we shall lose our souls."
"There are many of us, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, who are waiting for a response from you, because no indulgence can be allowed when human rights are being violated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur most warmly for what the report she has presented to us contains, and also for what it does not contain but what will, I hope, be the subject of a positive vote tomorrow, so as to re-establish what makes the vision which Mrs De Keyser has tried to bring to the dimension of human rights in the world such an original and specific one."
"Like other Members, we Italian radicals actually pay a lot of attention to anything to do with reproductive health, to the whole dimension, this new dimension which our society increasingly has to take into account in the way in which it perceives the issue of human rights, including, for example, the right to health, which now means the new technologies, genetic research, and all kinds of possibilities which are now available to mankind but which are still a problem, a stumbling block, in many of our societies."
"We shall therefore be voting in favour of all amendments along these lines tomorrow, in the hope of enhancing Mrs De Keyser’s report."
"Having said that, I should like, in the context of this debate, to launch an appeal to Members, to our rapporteur, and to the coordinators of the various groups, in the hope that my message will be heard."
"After the vote in committee had taken place, a dreadful massacre took place, and appalling violence was used against the indigenous mountain people of Vietnam."
"These people form an aboriginal population, the oldest in Vietnam, which is suffering oppression at the hands of the regime in Hanoi."
"That oppression became manifest, a few days ago, in the brutal police action taken in order to disperse demonstrators, as also happened in another country, as we have just heard."
"Dozens of people were no doubt killed, and many others arrested and imprisoned."
"We have no news of them."
"I know that time has run out, but since we talk about indigenous peoples in this report, I should like, tomorrow, with the agreement of my fellow Members, to table an oral amendment with a view to inserting the briefest reference to the mountain people of Vietnam, so as to remind the authorities in Hanoi that the European Parliament has taken their situation to heart."
"Mr Patten has often taken action on this matter, and some European countries have intervened too."
"I believe that it would be to our credit to mention, when we vote tomorrow, the oppression being suffered by the mountain people of Vietnam."
"Mr President, However, there is a worrying undercurrent in the way human rights and terrorism have been addressed."
"While I share some of the sentiments that have been expressed by my colleague Mr Van Orden, I am also worried from another point of view."
"Centralised government, whether national or international, is very quick to take powers and set up mechanisms that help them in the fight against terror but which certainly erode the established rights and liberties of the citizen."
"There is therefore a supreme irony that the counter-terrorism policies, which we all support, may do as much to restrict our freedoms as the terrorists do themselves."
"Mr President, unless there is an electoral miracle in June, or a mass self-sacrificing resignation among my colleagues, this is the last occasion on which I shall have the pleasure to address this distinguished and honourable House."
"May I, with your indulgence President, take this opportunity to put on record my sincerest thanks to the Members of this House, the staff here and in Brussels, and above all my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation for the generosity, kindness, help, sympathy and often-needed support that all have given me over the past five years."
"It would be a lie if I said I was happy with my lowly position on my party's list in the South West region of Great Britain, but it would not be a lie to say that I have enjoyed these five years, perhaps more than I can say."
"So Mr President, thank you and farewell."
"My Lord, I came close to joining in the applause, which I am not permitted to do."
"Many thanks for this very personal farewell to this House; perhaps you will come back after all."
"Mr President, I had prepared a speech, which I decided to put aside after listening to the comments made by some Members from the Right. I believe that as long as criticism is bandied around in this House – as if we were putting Galileo on trial – every time that we deal with the issue of women’s rights, and as long as we use the word ‘obsession’ when talking about rights, our debates will do no more than give work to the stenographers."
"We would have expected greater severity and more passion from some right-wing Members when, for example, denouncing the legal gap that exists – which runs counter to all the rules of international law – on the status of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners."
"We would have expected passion and severity in denouncing the arbitrary use that is, unfortunately, often made of the fight against terrorism to repress dissidents."
"Mr President, we believe that the defence of rights should be sought and guaranteed, above all, in everyday life in order to stop the rights of the just becoming the rights of the few, and we really feel that such silence on this issue is obsessive."
"Mr President, I think that Mrs De Keyser’s report is very uneven."
"There are some chapters which are interesting and which open up new prospects, in particular regarding reproductive health and the rights of disabled persons."
"However, with regard to the central issue, to which Mrs De Keyser had wanted, in a way, to give preference, I think that she has dealt with it rather poorly."
"I am talking about the issue of the relationship between human rights and the war on terrorism and, to be more specific, the challenge which the war on terrorism poses to democracy."
"In the twentieth century, democracies were faced with the challenge of war."
"Could we go to war and still remain democracies?"
"It was necessary to find solutions that struck a balance between the ideal and the constraints of reality."
"Now we have to demonstrate our creative abilities again in trying to strike a balance on current issues."
"We cannot place the rights of terrorists and the rights of the victims of terrorism on an equal footing."
"We cannot allow the war on terrorism to take second place to the war on those who are combating terrorism."
"Yet this, particularly with regard to the Middle East, is the unpleasant feeling produced by Mrs De Keyser, in seeking to put everything on an equal footing, whereas what we have to do is to invent a right of legitimate democratic defence against terrorism."
"This is the central issue, and unfortunately she has failed to address it, a fact which I find regrettable."
"Mr President, I would like to follow up on the excellent speech by Mr Van Orden and the very interesting point made by the Earl of Stockton in his valedictory speech just now."
"At its meeting last week, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights failed to publicly criticise Russia and China for their human rights abuses."
"It rejected resolutions on Chechnya, China and Zimbabwe, but adopted measures on North Korea, Cuba, Belarus and Turkmenistan."
"This showed that powerful countries can still get away with murder, torture and the silencing of critics just days before news emerged about the discovery in Chechnya of the bodies of nine men who had been extra-judicially executed."
"Torture and arbitrary detention remain rampant in Chechnya despite Russian Government claims that the situation is normalising."
"The United States has sponsored a mildly-worded resolution on China that encourages the Chinese Government to make substantive progress in systematic reforms to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"However, China was victorious in a procedural initiative at the UN with a no-action motion to prevent the resolution from coming to a vote."
"Over the last ten years, about 8 900 Chinese Christians have been arrested and detained, and religious activity that is not state-controlled is illegal."
"China is increasingly branding harmless religious groups as dangerous cults."
"In Zimbabwe, there is a chronic situation of human rights abuses, yet the United Nations is not taking any action."
"It simply cannot be that countries with poor human rights records use a no-action motion to block discussion of their own human rights practices."
"The UN Commission's purpose is to publicly air the human rights situation in any country, especially in the case of egregious violators."
"It is time to put an end to the misuse of procedural mechanisms to keep violations off the table."
"If the UN continues to be a puppet, we should cease funding its human rights activities."
"Mr President, I welcome this report, which is wonderfully comprehensive."
"The sad thing is that we have to have it at all."
"If only we lived in a world where we did not perpetually have to stand up and condemn the human rights abuses that occur throughout the world."
"Let me mention what is happening in Zanzibar, with its criminalisation and arrests of homosexuals, and where the EU has a mechanism through which it can act - the Cotonou Agreement - but does not seem to have the political will to do so."
"Similarly, when there have been breakdowns of the human rights clauses in our EU Association agreements and we have called for action, those calls have been ignored."
"Let me also mention Egypt, where there is continuing arrest, entrapment and imprisonment of homosexuals."
"I praise the Irish Presidency for its work at the UN in supporting the Brazilian motion on human rights and sexual orientation."
"Sadly, this motion has once again been suspended, due primarily to lobbying by Egypt and Pakistan, the Vatican and the Conference of Islamic States."
"We are talking here about human beings, about the destruction of individual freedom, individual hope and individual lives."
"The dignity of any society is based on respect for the dignity of those individuals."
"Finally, this report sends out a powerful message that what happens in another part of the world is as important to this House and the Member States as if it were happening in Europe."
"Human rights abuses against another individual are human rights abuses against us all."
"– Mr President, I would like to say thank you for an excellent report."
"A free, independent and diverse mass media is a fundamental right."
"That is even more important in the information society, in which information is the major factor in production."
"It is good to remind ourselves of the situation in China, but we have problems right here amongst ourselves."
"Information is a major industry that guides governments and nations."
"It helps to fill the human consciousness, which could not contain anything more important."
"The uncontrolled political influence that the big proprietors of the media have is something that is familiar to us all."
"Italy now has nothing less than a system of perpetual motion: a huge economic power has bought the power of the media, which in turn legitimises political power."
"There is also a new danger here."
"Big companies in France are buying up the media to protect themselves, with the result that they are outside the scope of criticism."
"Why do we not intervene in this, the way we do with regard to human rights violations?"
"This after all is a violation of the right to access to information, which is a fundamental right in the human information society."
". Mr President, once again I thank the Members for their contributions."
"To sum up, this debate underlines the value of our focus on enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and Council in the area of human rights."
"It also illustrates once again just how broad this canvas is, and just how extraordinarily diverse the focal points have to be in terms of human rights and human rights defenders."
"The contributions covered a remarkably wide range of topics and this is obviously an area where Members have not only a particular interest, but also very considerable expertise."
"I hope that those people who criticise this Parliament will read today's proceedings and just for once come to the conclusion that this is a House worthy of their support."
"I know the presidency and the Council will benefit greatly from exchanges that we have had here."
"The work of the Commission on Human Rights is continuing in Geneva as we speak."
"I mentioned earlier some of the resolutions that we have adopted in relation to the human rights situations in Belarus, Turkmenistan, North Korea and the Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Arab Territories."
"Work on other resolutions goes on but we can be proud of the role the European Union is playing via the Commission and of the work of the Commission to date."
"I have some good news for the House, which I will keep for the end."
"Members are obviously very concerned at the human rights aspects of the progress of the war on terror."
"Ms De Keyser’s report reflects these concerns and I want to assure the House that they have been noted by the Council."
"I also want to thank Mr Crowley, who recently said at an interparliamentary meeting with US Congress that, in our actions against terrorists, we must be bound by the rules that terrorists flout."
"That was a very valuable point made by a Member of this House and is a view shared by the Council – i.e. that respect for human rights must underpin our whole approach in the war on terror and it must underpin the whole approach of our allies in the war on terror."
"Human rights are not divisible."
"Human rights cannot be set aside for the convenience of the moment."
"I believe it was President Chirac who said that it is in this way we uncover and analyse the roots of terror in order to sever them."
"We must be conscious of all the issues touched on in this report."
"I was very touched by Lord Stockton's farewell speech."
"I wish him well."
"Indeed, yesterday and today a number of speakers touched on the point that this was their valedictory part-session."
"I wish them all well."
"It is always a sad moment in the life of a politician when you see a parliamentarian moving on."
"Mr Deva made a very interesting observation highlighting the serious problems that exist in the intergovernmental nature of the UN Human Rights Commission."
"Those of us who are UN defenders - which means most Members of this House and certainly myself - may rightly praise the UN for the role it plays, but should also ponder the point that he made."
"Mr Dell'Alba raised the issue of the Montagnards, the mountain people of Vietnam."
"I want to assure him and the House that the situation of these people is an active concern of the Council and will remain part of the Union's dialogue with the government of Vietnam."
"The representatives of the Union in Hanoi have received guidance in this connection."
"I want to finish on a positive note."
"I received some good news as I was making my contribution earlier, and am very pleased to be able to share this good news with the House."
"Earlier today, the Commission on Human Rights adopted the European Union's resolution on the death penalty by 28 votes to 20, with 5 abstentions."
"I would point out to the House that this is the best ever margin of victory in the history of this EU initiative."
"That margin of victory is an indication of the effectiveness of the Union's policy of opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances."
"It is also a sign of the growing trend towards the international abolition of the death penalty."
"It also underlines the point I made earlier that if the Union sometimes has to come from the back of the field on issues of concern to it, then we should perhaps learn to box a little more clever and to be a little more strategic."
"However, this is good news and I am pleased to share it with the House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0279/2004) by Mr Fernández Martín, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 975/1999 laying down the requirements for the implementation of development cooperation operations which contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms (COM(2003) 639 – C5-0507/2003 – 2003/0250(COD))."
". Mr President, I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity to tell Parliament why the rather technical Commission proposal to which you will be giving a first reading today is so important."
"The regulation which you are being asked to extend by two years, until the end of the present financial perspective in 2006, is one of the two legal bases for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"As you are well aware, the initiative is an extremely important element of the European Union’s overall policy on promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries."
"In 1999, the European Parliament itself was fully involved in drawing up the regulations underlying the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, moulding the objectives of the initiative and setting its priorities, as well as shaping the administrative procedures for its implementation."
"I am very pleased to see now that the honourable Member's report fully supports the Commission in securing an extension of the initiative beyond the end of this year, subject to some amendments."
"In the run-up to today’s plenary and decision-making, the Commission proposal has triggered fruitful exchanges between a number of Members of this House and Commissioner Patten and/or Commission services."
"These exchanges have focused essentially on two important issues: firstly, how to more effectively involve the European Parliament in political priority setting for implementation of the initiative and, secondly, how to further improve the performance and practical relevance of the initiative with a view to democracy building and strengthening human rights in the world."
"We have welcomed these exchanges, as we welcome today’s debate."
"The Commission, like Parliament, has every interest in supporting proposals designed to make the initiative ever more effective and relevant."
"As was stated at the February part-session, we have an open mind on the ideas that Members of Parliament put forward."
"However, this does not allow us to disregard certain constraints imposed by respective institutional prerogatives, nor must we lose sight of the key objective of the Commission proposal before you today, which is to secure the continued operational availability of the initiative for the next two years."
"The Commission has listened carefully to the views expressed by honourable Members and is ready to examine in a constructive spirit all ideas that have been put to it in order to ensure that what we do, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, is better focused and more effective."
"More specifically, I would like to state that the Commission is committed to setting up a structured and regular dialogue on the initiative with the competent committees of the European Parliament, led by the responsible Commissioner and supported by his or her own services."
"This will enable us to exchange views in good time on planned multiannual programming documents, annual programming updates and work programmes, or amendments to them."
"It would, I hope, give Parliament ample opportunity to provide comments and input into the Commission’s thinking."
"It would also, crucially, be compatible with comitology rules and institutional prerogatives."
"Moreover, the Commission will examine with an open mind the suggestion, contained in the report's explanatory statement, to create specific mechanisms to allow greater involvement of civil society and NGOs with a view to the promotion of democracy and human rights."
"In this respect, I would simply remind you, however, that this suggestion has to be seen in the context of the Commission’s recent proposal on the future financial perspective, which envisages a simplified architecture for the Community’s external assistance and which therefore will also have significant implications for the future operation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"In conclusion, let me reiterate the Commission’s appreciation of the constructive spirit shown by this House and its support for continued effective operation of the initiative beyond the end of this year."
"Your positive vote on Mr Fernandez Martin’s report at first reading today should pave the way for an agreement with the Council, thus dispensing with a second reading and allowing the timely extension of the initiative’s legal basis."
"Given the political importance we all attach to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, this is a welcome outcome in everyone’s interest."
". Mr President, this debate on the regulation amending certain aspects for the implementation of Community development cooperation operations which contribute to consolidating democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights has served to test, over recent months, the extent of our capacities and also to demonstrate certain defects in our procedures."
"This is certainly a modest instrument in financial terms, but one which is very important in terms of its content and objectives, and highly valued by everybody, and particularly by the European Parliament."
"I would point out that one of the budgetary lines funding these programmes was created on our initiative in 1994."
"As Commissioner Nielson has just told us, we are talking about a proposed regulatory modification which, in the Commission's opinion, according to what the Commission services have told us, affects purely technical aspects - he did not mention this specifically – and comes closer to what Parliament believes has always had an unquestionably political content, if only because the intention is to extend by two years the duration and the operational capacity of an instrument which according to all the reports and opinions received, and which are mentioned by the Council's communication, is of very great interest."
"Nevertheless, Parliament considers that, as proposed in the Council's draft, the participation of our institution in the different stages of the procedure does not meet our aspirations, particularly in an area which is subject to co-decision."
"From the beginning, more than six months ago now, we have spent a great deal of time debating formal and procedural issues but, fortunately, as Commissioner Nielson has said, today I believe I can perhaps confirm that we will make it at the last minute, but on time, so that this Community initiative will not be interrupted or paralysed for some time as a result of the changes that will take place in Parliament and the Commission over the coming months."
"Before dealing with certain technical comments on our proposal, I must point out, Mr President, that there is a technical corrigendum which the services of Parliament must be aware of at this point, which changes the order of the amendments we are proposing and which we will vote on tomorrow."
"In the report I have proposed and which is supported by the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in agreement with the Council, we propose an amendment to Article 4(1) by means of which we introduce into the legislative text that ‘in cases of EU electoral observation missions and procedures, natural persons can receive financial support within the meaning of the present Regulation’."
"The experience of all of us who have participated in missions of electoral observers tells us that, despite all the restrictions we might wish to mention, the presence of international observers in elections increases trust in transparency and strict compliance with democratic principles in developing countries."
"Parliament does not wish to give up its participation in the programming phase, in establishing priorities and in implementing initiatives."
"In the explanatory statement we have included this desire on the part of Parliament in case, as a result of the current legislative framework, as Commissioner Nielson has mentioned, this is not possible at the moment."
"We hope that the commitment adopted by Mr Nielson on behalf of the Commission can be confirmed in the future."
"In my view, Amendment No 3, which appears in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, should be withdrawn by its rapporteur."
"Otherwise, I recommend voting against that amendment."
"This is the best agreement possible if our intention is to approve this report at first reading, as the Council, the Commission and Parliament wish, in order to respond to a widely shared demand."
"Furthermore, it is particularly necessary for the strengthening of civil society in developing countries."
"However, this does not mean, and should not be understood to mean, that Parliament is satisfied."
"It is a co-decision procedure, an issue that affects human rights and fundamental freedoms, which this House has been very sensitive to for many years."
"Parliament believes that when it is a question of establishing a new programme and not just an extension for the next two years, as in the case we are debating today, we will demand a greater presence and more active participation within the framework of the rules regulating the Union’s institutional dialogue, on which those who succeed us here in the next legislature will have to establish a new framework which provides an equal basis so that this desire on the part of Parliament is fulfilled."
"Mr President, the bad news for the Commission and Council is that I expect to be back in the next Parliament and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the regulation covering third countries."
"It is quite clear that the Committee on Development and Cooperation is content with the operations under the European initiative for democracy and human rights and it is understandable that two-thirds of the money should now be released for next year."
"I am sure Mr Nielson is pleased about that."
"On the other hand, the Foreign Affairs Committee, which actually began this programme some twelve years ago - it was 1992 not 1994 and I was the original rapporteur - is not content."
"Its members have agreed that we should withdraw my report, which should have been debated today, to allow us time to put more pressure on the Commission and Council over the coming weeks to agree to two very simple requests."
"The first request is that an advisory committee should be set up – outside comitology, composed of representatives of Parliament and the Commission and probably chaired by the High Representative – to deal with this fundamentally sensitive programme, which should not necessarily involve the developing countries but rather the countries nearer to us - the 'new neighbourhood' as it is now described."
"The second request is that an independent study be conducted, and I await a serious offer from the Commission on this, not just 'we have an open mind'."
"The Commission does not have an open mind."
"It wants to keep the entire programme to itself."
"However, there is a better way of delivery, as is shown by the Americans, the Danes, the Germans, the Dutch, the Swedish and the British, and that is to have a separate foundation that is reliable, flexible and expert to assist the Commission in the delivery of the programme."
"That is our position and we look forward to some proper reaction from the Commission and Council to these suggestions in due course."
"The Commissioner said that this result was welcome and in everybody's interest."
"Is he talking about the hundreds of millions of people who live in the new neighbourhood, from Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, through the Caucuses and down through the arc of instability across North Africa to Morocco, into the Arab world? Two hundred and eighty million Arabs live without democracy."
"Is he proud of that?"
"I now have to address my remarks to the Press because we have an election coming up and in today's I write that 'Europe's power risks being so soft that it can hardly be felt by the people to whom it is addressed'."
"Unfortunately, this welcome programme, brilliantly implemented in the former-Soviet bloc, is totally ineffective in today's world."
"It is the Commission's responsibility to make it effective and I intend to press very hard to ensure that it does."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we must welcome Mr Fernández Martín’s report and be glad that responsibility for the report was finally given to the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"The majority of the countries to which the regulation applies are in reality developing countries."
"We have worked hard to achieve a compromise in the committee that could be accepted by the Council and the Commission, as well as by Parliament."
"We understand the importance of getting this report through at first reading."
"We therefore support the rapporteur’s request to vote against the third amendment by the Committee on Budgets, which is unacceptable to the Council."
"Nonetheless, we have made some demands of the Commission to ensure that Parliament is able to follow the work on the regulation more effectively."
"By asking the Commission to produce an annual report setting out programming for the coming year by region and by sector, we wish considerably to increase the transparency of the work on the regulation."
"Moreover, reporting back to Parliament will mean our better understanding where implementation is most effective."
"We are pleased that the Commission has accepted some of our most important changes."
"It is important that the decisions taken on a human rights basis reflect the EU’s commitments to support democracy, international law and, naturally, respect for human rights."
"The additional proposals initially tabled were aimed at ensuring that our decisions on human rights were based upon our own anxiety concerning the security of the European Union."
"That would have been a tragic mistake."
"We do need to protect ourselves, especially against terrorist threats, but the present trend espoused even by a number of senior figures in the EU, whereby aid should be tailored in such a way as to meet our security needs, is a very dangerous road to go down and a principle that should not be established."
"We must protect human dignity when it comes to our measures concerning human rights, cooperation and the development of aid and ensure that the primary focus of these measures is always the consolidation of democracy, international law and human rights and the eradication of poverty."
"Finally, this is the last time that I too am speaking in this House."
"I shall be leaving it after ten years, and I wish to thank you for your very constructive cooperation."
"We are very grateful to Mrs Theorin for the extraordinary work she has done over these years."
"Mr President, the programme on democracy and the development of democracy in third countries is a programme of few resources – we are not talking about large investments in terms of the Community budget – but one that is very important in terms of content, because it is the only instrument that we have to implement a policy to develop human rights, to help women, to support democracy and to monitor elections, without necessarily going viabilateral relations with governments."
"Since it is, therefore, the only instrument of this type that we have, we must ensure that it is efficient and we cannot always check the efficiency of our measures."
"This is why I think that it is right that, whilst respecting the various prerogatives of the Commission and Parliament itself – because we are not the ones in charge – Parliament should have greater involvement, both in the planning phase for measures, and in the phase where the results are assessed."
"Above all, the question is whether the instruments to implement this programme are as flexible as the situation requires because, clearly, the situation is not rigid and bureaucratic as our rules are at times."
"This is why the amendments that we have tabled to this regulation are important and, above all, the discussion that we will be able to develop with the Commission will be important."
"Commissioner Patten has written a letter to us about the other regulation, for which no codecision procedure is planned, in which he proposes involving Parliament much more in the new approach to revising these regulations from 2006 onwards."
"I therefore believe that our amendments are just the beginning of a deeper involvement, which will reach its optimum level in 2006 or, at least, will result in more precise and effective measures than those we manage to implement today using this instrument."
"."
"Mr President, Mr McMillan-Scott put a very clear and direct - but strange - question to me."
"He asked whether I am happy that millions of people are living in countries without democracy or adequate human rights."
"Such a clear question deserves a clear answer."
"I hope the honourable Member will not be shocked by its bluntness, but the answer is 'No, I am not happy with that'."
"The Commission supports the rapporteur's proposal to withdraw Amendment 3 from the Committee on Budgetary Control on the applicable comitology procedure."
"The intention contained in this amendment, to provide for an advisory committee instead of today's regulatory committee, is unacceptable to the Council."
"This is well-known."
"Thus, maintaining the amendment would scupper our joint efforts and the objective of facilitating a first reading agreement under the codecision procedure."
"The Commission proposed that a management committee is the appropriate form of committee and constitutes a fair compromise."
"It is extremely important that we are now able to secure a continuation of this work."
"I agree with Mrs Napoletano that our actions are not always effective."
"One reason is that we are not effective ourselves."
"Another is that in an area such as this it is very difficult to produce effective so-called solutions."
"However, we have to try."
"We do not do this because we know it works but because it is necessary."
"That is the nature of this kind of activity."
"This initiative has been important in practice and for sending a signal showing how we think in Europe about what we want to do in the world."
"I thank Parliament for the constructive spirit in which it has been handled."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0148/2004) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the ‘European Capital of Culture’ event for the years 2005 to 2019 (COM(2003) 700 – C5-0548/2003 – 2003/0274(COD))."
". Mr President, we are going to begin with what I consider to be the soul of Europe, the most positive thing in Europe, which shows our citizens that they do exist, and which gives them a forum where they can express themselves in all their diversity."
"I believe that the European Cities of Culture, now to be called European Capitals of Culture, have in that sense, over the years, assumed great importance in the European cultural landscape."
"They are a shared cultural space."
"They show our diversities at their best."
"Of course, the formula has developed over time: the scheme was launched in 1985 on the initiative of Melina Mercouri, and cities were originally designated by means of an inter-governmental process."
"We have come a long way since then, and the event has become a Community action following the 1999 decision."
"The process is still developing, and it will go on developing."
"What we shall be looking at and deciding on today will be one stage in that development."
"Why will it be only one stage?"
"It will be one stage because we are on the eve of a historic event which will change the destiny of the European Union."
"I am talking, of course, about enlargement, which ought to be taken into account when we are considering European Capitals of Culture, hence the Commission proposal which we are debating today."
"The purpose of this proposal is to allow the rapid integration of the new Member States into the ‘European Capital of Culture’ initiative."
"That does not mean that we do not have to think quickly about other changes which might prove necessary."
"Moreover, we are all in agreement on the fact that radical changes will have to be made to the current decision, and in any case we are already working on that."
"A study is in progress involving the European Capitals of Culture for the years 1995 to 2004."
"The results of that study, which will become known in the second half of 2004, will form the basis of our reflections and later, I presume, of the action we take to develop new rules."
"However, today we cannot make the new Member States wait any longer."
"They must be able to participate, like the others, in this action, which is so much appreciated."
"We must therefore give them the welcome that is their due."
"They have already made great efforts in order to obtain entry into the present Union."
"They cannot be kept out of the ‘European Capital of Culture’ event."
"The integration of the new Member States is already a priority, and it needs to be done very quickly."
"That is why the Commission wishes to separate the stage involving the integration of the new Member States from the debate on the need to remodel the whole procedure."
"The Commission therefore proposes, at this stage, simply to add the new Member States, by 2009, to the list drawn up by the decision, alongside the current Member States already designated, in alphabetical order."
"That order had already been decided, moreover, by a joint agreement between the Council and Parliament in 1999, and it is on that basis that the cities in question are currently preparing for the years to come."
"Thus from 2009 onwards, two capitals will be designated each year, one for the current Member States and a second one for the new Member States."
"I can well understand Parliament’s desire to see the procedure improved."
"However, the way we are proceeding now is the only one which enables us to put the new Member States on an equal footing with the current Member States as far as the ‘European Capital of Culture’ scheme is concerned."
"We need to be aware that, if we omit this stage, and start straight away on a remodelling of the procedure, the new Member States will not be able to participate in the scheme until, at best, 2010 or 2011, or perhaps 2012, because it takes four years to prepare for the event, and the designations for 2008 will be made this year."
"Moreover, it will be for the new Parliament to decide on how to reform the procedure, because that procedure will in future involve twenty-five Member States."
"What is our position on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament?"
"The European Parliament’s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has preserved the purpose of the Commission’s proposal."
"However, it has expressed a wish to see, with effect from 2009, each Member State concerned, i.e. two per year, putting forward at least two cities as candidates for the title."
"This is equivalent to a substantial amendment to the designation procedure and is therefore a change to the Commission’s proposal."
"That is why I cannot accept such a change from the point of view of the two-stage revision."
"Such an amendment actually belongs in the second phase, at which point we shall have the specific data necessary to complete the remodelling of that decision, in other words it will come later."
"In addition, the Commission feels obliged to reject Amendment No 2 by Parliament’s committee and, as a result, Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 as well, since they are the result of Amendment No 2."
"On the other hand, Amendment No 1, which is concerned with adjusting the budget in the light of the fact that there will be at least two ‘Capitals’ per year, is acceptable."
"In fact we shall have to take into account this doubling of the number of cities involved when we come to evaluate any proposal for a programme to carry on from Culture 2000 with effect from 2007 onwards."
"Provision has, in fact, been made for funding in the context of that programme and not by virtue of the 1999 decision."
"Nor is the Commission able to accept Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 tabled on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group."
"These amendments would also make very radical changes to the designation procedure, a debate which will have to take place later."
"There, ladies and gentlemen, you have what seems to me today to be a position that makes sense."
"I know that it was not easy to reach, because we would all like something better, including your Commissioner."
"In politics, however, one must be realistic, and if we want to make progress sometimes we have to move forward in small steps in order, finally, to achieve our objective."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has the honour to submit for debate, and then to a vote here in this House, a report about which there has been much discussion."
"It brings to a temporary conclusion an adventure which has been somewhat unhappy."
"It is a report on which your rapporteur is in the minority, so all I can do is to tell you its history."
"This is the first time, in the two and a half years during which I have been fortunate enough to work with Mrs Reding, that I find myself in disagreement with her – friendly disagreement, but very clear disagreement nevertheless."
"She is well aware of this."
"She has even alluded to it briefly."
"The idea that every year one city in Europe should be the European Capital of Culture is an idea that originated with Melina Mercouri in 1985."
"At first, Mr President, that idea had a brilliant future, at a time when fierce competition brought together a number of candidate cities in a contest to win a single designation, and when a jury of experts gave its verdict on the real European interests of each of the plans of the candidate cities."
"In 1999, the unfortunate Decision 1419 was proposed by the Council, supported by the Commission and approved by Parliament, and it governs, until 2019, as Mrs Reding has just reminded us, the list of Member States which, at the rate of just one per year, are responsible for proposing the European Capital of Culture."
"First of all, that decision takes no account of the fact that, even at the time, there was a prospect of the possible accession of at least ten new Member States, and the fact that it did not do so is unacceptable."
"Secondly, it left itself open to criticism, if not scandal, in both legal and political terms, since it practically prohibits the European Parliament in the next two legislative periods, i.e. those beginning in 1999 and 2004, from exercising, for five years, its powers to contribute towards the annual choice of the European Capital of Culture."
"Finally – and this is at least as serious – although some Member States have submitted to the European institutions and the jury a list of two or three cities, thereby enabling a real choice to be made between them on the basis of the dynamism, innovation and European dimension of the projects, not all have done so."
"Member States’ recent choices have often related to a single city, chosen for reasons concerned with the local-election policies of the government currently in power, and without the city in question having shown any real interest in assuming this role."
"This amounts to forced labour, all the more so since assistance from the European budget for these activities represents less than 5% of the expenditure that they involve."
"What we need to do, Mr President, is to start again from scratch."
"At the beginning of this debate, several months ago, my committee agreed unanimously with that."
"Mrs Reding was aware of it too, and she knows it is true as well as I do, even though she has just told us again that this will be something for a second stage, in the autumn."
"The evidence shows that we need to revise the list and change the order after 2008, because it possible, Commissioner, contrary to what you have just said, to integrate new Member States, provided that those Member States already designated for the years after 2009 would agree to a little delay."
"It was perfectly possible and it was very simple because, Mr President, it is essential to realise that a city needs five years in order to prepare itself."
"Obviously, therefore, it would be necessary to revise the list, change the order after 2008, reintroduce competition between cities and reinstate the importance of the role of the jury which, when there is only one ‘Capital’, obviously has no role at all and is no use for anything any more."
"It has, moreover, said as much, in writing, with delightful diplomatic acidity."
"However, the Council was watching and the Commission did not dare to confront it."
"Therefore you now have a proposal for a decision which I would describe as astounding and which consists of deciding that, with effect from 2009 and up to 2019, there will be two European Capitals of Culture per year – one in a current Member State and one in a new Member State – and it will still be the Member States who will designate the candidate cities, without their being under any obligation to submit alternative choices to the European institutions."
"Mrs Reding will even refuse an amendment by the PPE-DE Group, despite the fact that it was pushing in that direction."
"To choose two European Capitals of Culture a year at a time when the procedure is almost stifled is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing."
"We shall simply make the dilution and obsolescence even worse."
"The jury still has no significance and the next two Parliaments are not allowed to participate in the selection process."
"The Commission’s promise to submit to us, in autumn, a new draft decision amending this system, is merely a decoy."
"If we adopt this draft now, Commissioner, I do not see how, in autumn, we can go back on the date of 2019, the order in which Member States are listed and, above all, the fact that two capitals a year will be designated, leaving that task to the two Member States in question."
"I believe, moreover, that you will not be able to get the directive you have announced adopted, because you have become tangled up in the main substance of the problem."
"That is my prediction."
"However, the Council is watching and it has been using intimidation."
"The three Member States involved in the crucial period of 2009 to 2011, which are Austria, Germany and Finland, have been afraid that their designation will be called into question, though no one was actually thinking of this."
"The PPE Group has been taken in hand."
"We are faced with a decision which serves the prestige interests of our Member States, but surely not those of Europe, which would have been to revitalise and give back the sparkle to what was an excellent procedure."
"Anxious to keep the peace amongst us, and my personal friendship with Mrs Reding, I had proposed, and the Socialist Group had agreed with me, to accept our defeat at the committee stage and to decide not to put forward our amendments at the plenary session."
"After all, my mother brought me up properly and I am still a polite boy."
"However, our Green friends took up these amendments again, as is their right."
"You are therefore faced with two sets of amendments which are entirely incompatible."
"First of all there are the amendments of Socialist origin, though now supported by the Greens."
"These amendments are aimed at going back to the old system and to committing ourselves for the future only as far as 2010, reserving the right of the next Parliament to ask the Commission to propose, in autumn, a new list of Member States including the new ones, and to order those who can to organise a broad competition between cities, so that after some candidates have been eliminated the final decision is left to the jury of experts, which needs to be given that role if it is to be of any use, and to the European institutions."
"The other set of amendments, which comes mainly from the PPE Group, validates and sets out in detail the Commission’s proposal which, in my opinion, makes any decision this coming autumn completely pointless."
"This set of amendments, however, requires that those Member States which are able to should propose several cities – and, Mrs Pack, you have just heard that there will be no question of this, because Mrs Reding will be obliged, by the constraints under which she is suffering, to deny you this."
"This set of amendments claims to encourage competition between cities but it does not explain how, because it does not deal with the problem of the numerous smaller Member States which have only one important city, which would call for a revision of the list of Member States, which is something which will have to be done in the autumn."
"This opening up of the competition, however, has now been refused."
"There you have it, Mr President: Members will vote according to their conscience."
"Once again, I would like to say that the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, is not as much to blame as the Council of Ministers, which is stifling the emergence of any truly European spirit and imposing a system whereby Member States set out their stalls displaying their national heritage and talents, while at the same time resolutely denying the authority of this Parliament."
"Faced with this situation, I have a feeling of relative sadness, but of course I am speaking as the defeated party."
"– Mr President, I would have been quite happy to applaud Mr Rocard had it not been for the unfortunate fact that not everything he said was in line with what I am going to say."
"That is why I could not give him the applause I would have liked to give."
"The fact is that I cannot act without thinking; I have to be guided by the facts."
"The Capital of Culture that we are discussing today is something like a beacon of light in the small amount of cultural policy that we are allowed to deal with, so I am happy that we are carrying the torch onwards."
"The idea has been around for a long time now; it originated with a Greek lady Member of this House, and I think we can take pride in it."
"I also agree with Mr Rocard’s demand that the choice should be of at least two cities."
"It was after all we who introduced this idea, and I think, Commissioner, that it can be put into practice right now."
"In this Capital of Culture, European diversity ought to be much more visible than it has been up to now, and so I do not think that these amendments run counter to what the Commissioner wants to do."
"I therefore ask her to consider whether she cannot perhaps incorporate this."
"Secondly, I have to reiterate how much we all regret the Council of Ministers’ decision, none more than I, as I, back in 1999, was furiously angry about the Council of Ministers’ decision, seeing it as short-sighted and guided by national considerations."
"At the time, the Council of Ministers knew as well as we did that the European Union was going to be enlarged, and it showed that it did not give a damn about it, by naming only Western European cities right up to 2019."
"That is to the Council’s shame and not to our own, for we were bound by their decision."
"The decision has been made, though, and, as they say where I come from, ! That is why we cannot change the fact that, up to 2019, the countries in question will also be entitled to propose cities."
"That is why, for the benefit of my German audience, I would like to say that Germany will be able to propose a city for 2010."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, though, endorse the Commissioner’s proposal for two Capitals of Culture, simply because the 10 new Member States cannot do anything about the shameless conduct of the old 15."
"It is now for the Commissioner to remedy that; she can do so by giving two cities the opportunity to present themselves to the world, and I do not believe it is so terrible that we should be doing this, if, for example, in 2010, we have one city from Germany and another from Hungary."
"I do not see that as such a bad idea. The two countries have marvellous things in common and the rivalries between them have been productive."
"Let me say one thing more: we may be 25 countries strong today, but there will be even more by 2019 – Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, not to mention the others."
"If we are allowed to name only one Capital of Culture, that means that each country would have a turn only once in a generation, and we cannot expect the public to put up with that. It is for that reason that I, like my group, support the Commissioner’s proposal."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, thanks are due to Melina Mercouri for coming up with the idea of a European Capital of Culture, since being the European Capital of Culture is a challenge to reflect contemporary artistic creativity; it promotes discussion and enables people to make their minds up; it promotes awareness of the values of our cultural heritage and leaves behind visible signs, such as, for example, the in Graz, which was last year’s Capital of Culture, a building which, even though it is also very important that such signs should also reflect modern architecture, has been the subject of much debate."
"I agree with my fellow-Members and with those who have spoken before me that the decision taken in 1999 was quite simply wrong."
"However much it took lead times, procedures for withdrawal, and so on, into consideration, this decision went too far."
"What was mistaken about it was not only its failure to take the future new Member States into account, but also the fact that it completely bypasses future Parliaments."
"Competition is necessary and rules are required if the expert jury is to be given an area of activity and a definite mandate, neither of which it has, unfortunately, had to date."
"If that is not done, the European Capital of Culture – at present a hallmark for cultural diversity and quality – will depreciate in value."
"If we are in future to have two Capitals of Culture, that surely must not mean that, when giving them a financial basis, we split the existing grants in two, but rather that we double them."
"Anything else would make no sense at all."
"So I would urge that we do something about the financial basis, for two Capitals of Culture – if they are to put on a good programme – will need a great deal of support, quite apart from the enormous effort required of them and the amounts of money they themselves have to find."
"Mr President, I really want to support the proposals of the rapporteur and Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard."
"There is no need to go into the appalling nature of the decision in 1999, which established selection entirely leaving out the ten countries that are joining us in less than a month."
"The solution proposed by the Commission, which aimed to split the procedure in two, would mean that for much too long a period – until 2019 – there would be two colleges, which is quite the opposite to integration."
"Integration does not mean continuing with two colleges within the Union and its selection and decision-making processes made up of old and new Member States."
"I think that this goes entirely against the desired objective, which we say is for them to become members."
"Therefore, and also for other reasons, I think it is wise to stop this in 2010."
"The other reasons are linked to the evaluation that is taking place, which you mentioned, Commissioner."
"I think that the deviations that have been highlighted by Mr Rocard, which are linked to decisions that are far too motivated by self-interest, exploitative and for reasons of prestige or even less attractive reasons, even political reasons, have reduced the European quality of these events and that is what we need to discuss."
"This is the quality that the new selection process, which we say we want, needs to reaffirm, definitely through competition, also taking into account the events that are taking place at the moment, such as Lille 2004."
"The event is on the one hand very attractive and factual, with very interesting things to see, but at the same time there is a great frustration among those involved."
"Artists and those involved in culture are quick to point out that this event, which is mainly focused around factual matters, could devalue their work as artists, break down the relationship that there normally is with the public and result in fierce competition between cultural structures."
"These collective comments from a network of cultural players and artists in a city or region where the ‘European Capital of Culture’ project is taking place, in Lille, should attract the attention and interest of the evaluation that is underway and encourage care."
"We should await the evaluation and try to find a selection and competition method that will promote adding value to Europe, as this is the challenge, to ensure that culture is valued across Europe."
"Mr President, the European Capital of Culture programme is one of the European Union's success stories. It gets Europe out of Brussels and Strasbourg and into the hearts and minds of people right across Europe."
"Cities compete to become the Capital of Culture - which is regarded as an accolade - and indeed they should."
"In Britain, Glasgow's time as the European Capital of Culture in 1990 was a real success story."
"Today it is the third most visited city in Britain."
"Glasgow's urban renaissance provided a blueprint for others and I am sure that Liverpool - the home of the Beatles as nobody needs reminding - will have great success during its year in 2008."
"As an MEP from the south-east of England, I am only sorry that our candidates of Canterbury, Brighton and Oxford were not chosen."
"Any one of them would have been a great Capital of Culture."
"As an English Conservative I have great respect for our French Socialist President of the Committee on Culture;"
"I admire the first quality, I will excuse the second!"
"In this instance I believe the majority in the committee was correct."
"It was too long to wait until 2019 for any of the accession states to have the opportunity to become a Capital of Culture."
"By sharing the list from 2009, when Lithuania will be the first of the accession states to get the opportunity, we will not detract from the principle: we will introduce the opportunity of cooperation across Europe, putting Europe back into the concept."
"That is something we can look forward to: cooperation is, after all, what Europe is all about."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I actually wish we had been able to have an open debate in this House on optimising the way in which Europe’s Capital of Culture is chosen."
"Instead, we have to deal with what has to be called some kind of emergency solution or repair job."
"It has been said, and quite rightly, that it was utterly egoistic of the Council to come to a snap decision to make use of all the present Member States by 2019, in the full knowledge that we would have unification to deal with, in the shape of enlargement."
"Now that enlargement is imminent and it has dawned on some people that it cannot be right and proper to put these countries off until 2020 or even later, the Commission has now come up with this tandem solution– and a solution it is, although I have to tell you, Commissioner, that it does of course leave a disagreeable aftertaste."
"I think you are aware of that too."
"I will readily concede, though, that you have tried to make the best of it, and it really is a great shame that we in this House are in two minds about it and that opinions differ on it, with the result that the proposals Mr Rocard has made in his report on the qualitative improvement of the selection procedure cannot be discussed in isolation from the question of what actually happens if fundamental changes are made."
"I am a German MEP. In Germany, 17 cities are seeking to be the Capital of Culture for 2010."
"We are told that nobody wants to interfere with this."
"What legal certainty, though, is there for these cities if the procedure cannot be completed?"
"They have applied and are engaged in a contest that I believe can point the way ahead. The only real recommendation I can make for the future is that a competition be held within the Member States, with the Member State making a qualitative decision, which would then be taken up to European level, where I would like to see a competitive selection procedure."
"I hope that the new Parliament can do some fundamental new thinking about this."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, we are in full agreement with what we have now heard, namely that the decision taken by the Council was premature and false."
"Now, though, I think we should do everything possible to make the best of it, in the interests of the countries concerned and, above all, of European culture."
"Much as I would, theoretically speaking, have preferred our Chairman’s clear and purist solution, I nevertheless think it is now time to turn the tables."
"We should now see this necessary solution not as an emergency measure but as a positive opportunity to set forth Europe’s cultural diversity by having not just one Capital of Culture, but – and why ever not? – two capitals for this great Europe of ours, embracing for the first time East and West and symbolising our cultural diversity."
"There must then be no distinction between old and new Member States; there must be two equal cities, symbolising the cultural diversity of Europe."
"What will then be important is that the concept, the vision, that underlies the concept of a European Capital of Culture should play more of a role."
"This should not just be about cities depicting themselves and their splendid history, their past and their present, but about them putting on show the way in which European history has been made and today’s Europe shaped by them."
"From this point of view, I do see the resolution we are now adopting as being – if you go back to its origins – a great opportunity for Europe’s cultural diversity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I start I would like to say that I have been a Member of the European Parliament for just 19 days and this is my first speech to this illustrious House, and perhaps the last, but I do not think it is audacious of me to talk about culture today, because for the last eight years I have been Managing Director of , a European channel which has observed and broadcast the activities of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, but which has also put an enormous amount of effort into observing and broadcasting European cultural activities, whether official or not."
"And as a person from outside who can perhaps comment with fewer political implications, I would like to say that culture is very broad, it has many facets and that two European capitals is not excessive."
"In sport we have two Olympic games, in winter and in summer, within the same year, and no harm is done."
"Culture is perhaps even broader and we cannot deny the new countries which are going to join us the opportunity to organise and hold a European capital of culture in one of its cities."
"I personally and my group therefore support the Commission’s position of naming two cities as European capitals of culture."
"On the issue of how to select them, we believe that competition should prevail."
"This is provided for, to a degree, by having two cities from two different countries within the same year."
"But we should also try to ensure that there is a degree of competition amongst candidatures from the same country."
"We hope that the Commission can resolve this issue."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vila."
"I would like to say that you give the impression of having been an MEP for many years given your mastery of the situation."
"We congratulate you on this maiden speech and we hope it is not your last."
"Mr President, first of all, as I will not have another opportunity in this House, allow me to congratulate the Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, my colleague and friend Mr Rocard."
"We have done some good work over the last few years."
"I regret that it has to end on a disagreement."
"We do not, however, disagree on the fundamental issue, because we have the same fundamental idea: to ensure that European capitals of culture continue to be real springboards for European cultures and diversity."
"Unfortunately, the fact that the Treaties require unanimity in cultural matters does not allow us to go any further, which is what we really need to do."
"This is why, while we hope to soon have a new treaty establishing majority decisions on cultural matters, which would help us enormously to make progress in many areas, we should propose a radical review as soon as possible of the way in which European capitals of culture are chosen."
"There are two things that I would like to say."
"The first is that I agree with those of you who have said that a repair solution may be an opportunity for the future."
"Often, in the past, European capitals of culture have not been European enough."
"If we have two capitals between which bridges are built, there could be a very significant strengthening of that European dimension."
"I must also assure you that this Commissioner has his pilgrim’s stick ready to go to the cities when they are being prepared, to argue the cause of a more European programme."
"I think that the last three examples, Graz, Genoa and Lille, to name but a few, show a remarkable effort to place the European aspect of culture on the agenda, transcending regional and national dimensions."
"I am therefore optimistic, because I am speaking on the basis of what is being done."
"There are even some Member States already doing what we want for the future: healthy competition in order to choose the best city."
"What is happening is England, Germany and elsewhere is marvellous."
"We are also aware, of course, that there are negative examples, but today I prefer to look mainly at the positive examples, because they are marvellous and they show us that the capitals of Europe are a good idea with a great future ahead of it."
"I attach huge importance to the bridges to be built between the cities."
"For example, look at the Luxembourg proposal, which raised a few problems, because it was not sufficiently developed."
"The jury protested."
"Luxembourg submitted a new plan which creates synergies within the big region of Europe, i.e. Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and France, and also creates synergies with a Romanian city which, historically, has a specific relationship with Luxembourg."
"They even still speak Luxembourgian there."
"This is to show you that if we are really doing our job and pushing the cities to be better, to be really European in their cultural choices, the result can be very positive."
"I agree with those Members who have cited some cities to show how becoming European capitals of culture opened up new perspectives to them by directing them towards cultural industries, cultural tourism and cultural excellence."
"This is the case of a city such as Glasgow, for example, which was not really oriented towards culture at the start."
"The same applies to Liverpool."
"These cities are experiencing a development that is not only industrial and social, but also involves citizens and culture."
"If we work hard in the future, like the current Parliament, for whom this is the last debate on culture, has done over the last five years, I do not doubt for a moment, Chairman Rocard, that what your Committee wanted and what your Commissioner has always advocated will be put into practice in the cities of culture of the future."
"I hope that the good examples of the past will be followed in the future, and I wish all citizens and all those involved in culture courage and pleasure as they meet in the future in the cultural cities of Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.(1)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0247/2004) by Mrs Zissener, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a single framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences (Europass) (COM(2003) 796 – C5-0648/2003 – 2003/0307(COD))."
"Mr President, we are moving on from culture to education, professional training, competences and qualifications, and in my mind the two are linked."
"On 17 December 2003, the Commission adopted a proposal aimed at rationalising the European situation in terms of transparency of qualifications and competences."
"I am sure you are aware that this was a step forwards in the construction of the Europe of education and training."
"It is also a major tool to benefit citizens and enable free movement."
"Through this initiative we wished to provide real assistance to all those who want to have their qualifications recognised in another Member State, to give them more opportunities to find a job."
"This initiative was explicitly requested by the Council in its resolution of 19 December 2002, and was well received by the Council and Parliament."
"Several improvements have been made to the Commission proposal without any substantial objections, and I welcome this consensus on both the objective and the content of our proposal."
"What is the proposal?"
"It incorporates five existing documents into a coordinated portfolio called Europass, covering qualifications and competences from a perspective of lifelong learning: the European CV, which concerns personal competences; the language portfolio, multilingualism, which we had advocated so strongly over the last five years, the MobiliPass, which replaces and extends the current Europass-Training; the Diploma Supplement, which concerns higher education qualifications, and its equivalent for professional training, the Certificate Supplement."
"By mentioning these various documents, I do not want you to think that is the end."
"Europass is supposed to be an open framework, and other documents may be added in the future."
"I am thinking, for example, going back to our youth policy, of voluntary activities that citizens do during their youth or adult lives, and social and civic action, which should be taken into consideration, because they are part of the personality of a human being"
"Although we agree on our approach to this matter, a number of amendments have been adopted."
"The Commission accepts them, with some exceptions."
"Amendment No 7 is not acceptable in its current format."
"It gives the national Europass agencies the additional task of making a guide to mobility available to every citizen."
"This task is not part of their primary responsibilities."
"Following the modifications proposed by the Council, a modification to this amendment was suggested, stating that Europass national agencies fulfil this task 'where necessary'."
"With this addition, the Amendment would be acceptable."
"Amendment No 12 is also not acceptable in its current form."
"Firstly, the MobiliPass must be completed by the sending and host organisation and not by one or the other."
"Secondly, the third language into which the MobiliPass can be translated must be a widely spoken language."
"If it established joint responsibility between the sending and host organisations and did not confine itself to a third language or only widely spoken languages, the amendment would be acceptable."
"Amendment No 5, which highlights the role of social partners in the development of future sectoral initiatives, is in principle acceptable to the Commission."
"Following the changes proposed by the Council, a modification was proposed, removing the specification 'sectoral'."
"This modification is also acceptable."
"The same applies to Amendment No 8, which can be modified in the same way."
"As you can see, Mr President, there is nothing insurmountable."
"The important thing is that this proposal aims to implement a service for citizens to help them to have their competences better valued, and we agree on this point."
"I therefore welcome the efforts made by Parliament and the Council to ensure that it is swiftly adopted so that citizens can use the tool from the beginning of 2005."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europass is the realisation of the type of policy that citizens expect from us."
"I think that it is a good project and I thank you for your support."
". – Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is a key concept in European policy, and globalisation is making it more and more important."
"The unfortunate reality is, however, that we have found, and are still finding, that Europe’s citizens are not yet as mobile as we would like them to be."
"One of the main reasons for the fact that mobility has not yet been completely achieved is a lack of transparency of qualifications and competences."
"The lack of transparency, as we all know, is the most important obstacle to mobility in terms of training and professional activity and a significant block to making the labour market in Europe more flexible."
"The Commission has now submitted the proposal for a uniform framework concept for the promotion of transparency of qualifications and competences – in brief, the Europass – which has been long awaited and ardently desired."
"This Commission proposal is an exceptionally good one, in that it makes it easier for citizens to gain access to opportunities for mobility."
"The Commission has already said that in the new Europass portfolio five existing opportunities for mobility will be combined, namely the European career structure, the addition to the diploma, the existing Europass for professional training and references and, also extremely important, the European language portfolio."
"As already mentioned, these instruments already exist. However, they were not yet appropriately visible to the public."
"That makes it extremely important that not only the existing instruments, but also the networks, be coordinated and rationalised."
"An agreed portfolio of documents has a greater communication impact than a loose collection of separate documents."
"The important thing, however, is that it is an open portfolio, and I believe there are two reasons for this."
"In the first place, citizens can search for documents that are relevant to them."
"Nobody has to wade through all five documents."
"Secondly, this open system enables further documents to be included in the portfolio."
"I have proposed here in my report that the next document to be included in this portfolio should be a certificate of computer competence."
"At this stage, I would like to thank everyone, the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation, which has indeed ensured that this proposal can rapidly proceed through all the bureaucratic hurdles."
"I believe that we all have an interest in ensuring that this proposal is implemented as rapidly as possible and that the Europass is made available to the public as early as possible."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely pleasing that in the penultimate week of the session of this parliamentary term we will be adopting such a fine, interesting and new European project, a project that I thought could be passed without either conflicts or objections on the part of the Council."
"This confidence must now be moderated somewhat, since I have heard, Madam Commissioner, that you do not agree with several of the amendments, including those proposed by me."
"Perhaps the administration could once again go through various points with me this evening, so that tomorrow we will in fact be able to adopt something going further than what we had initially had submitted to us."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whom I have produced this opinion, has not only taken the project seriously and welcomed it, but we have also integrated it in our work."
"We know that mobility and lifelong learning are today important components for professional success and that often up to now neither the economy nor policies have put in place the conditions for it."
"This is now going to change."
"For these reasons, we have made various proposals and additions, which we regard as important, for example the inclusion of third-state nationals – we regard this as a symbol of fairness – the inclusion of the social partners in order to make use of their know-how, the consideration to be given to social integration and, last but not least, more and better information for the public, providers of education and training and social partners, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is because the entire project will only be any use, will only be successful, if it is known about, if it is accepted by young people, by workers and also by industry and society."
"So it will be necessary also to conduct a campaign of explanation and information."
"Then, I think, we will be able to get this child onto the right track."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the run-up to an election and I, just like Mrs Weiler, am grateful that right at the end of this parliamentary term we have managed to create something for many young people, indeed for all young people."
"This is because the Europass is something that really affects young people, even those who are entering their studies."
"I think we have spent a long time looking for this, and I am glad that the Commissioner can get it moving at the end of her current period in office."
"It would, of course, have been nice to pass this in the present legislative period, but we have to accept what cannot be done, and, if we manage to do this in September or October, that will not be too bad."
"Although we should not overload the Europass with expectations of absolutely everything, we should at least expect it to make realities of those constant pious truisms, transparency and mobility opportunities."
"These are the stuff of daily life for young people and workers; they are often affected by European laws and still cannot evolve as we would wish."
"This means that there is a need for clear decisions on the European career structure."
"We must say very clearly what is meant by the specialist competences of the individual."
"It must be possible to include the language competence of individuals in a tested form."
"We should also, as you have suggested, take into account young people’s voluntary service, for that is a competence acquired by a young person in the course of his or her life, and it should be more recognised than it has been so far, including by employers."
"I also believe that there are very many opportunities to help young people to find their way in this huge labour market and in turn to be found on the basis of their qualifications."
"It is often, today, impossible to assess exactly what a person can do, simply because what his references say is not translated and basically cannot be compared."
"So I believe that in this Europass we have achieved clarity about training periods, the content of training and professional competence, and I believe that that is what we need, what young people need, in order to really experience Europe for themselves."
"So let me say once again that my group is grateful that Mrs Zissener has taken on this report and we are delighted that in the autumn we will be able to get this matter going together – unfortunately with a new Presidency of the Council – in the interests of our young people and therefore in the interests of our children and grandchildren."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, with the start of the new generation of programmes in the area of general professional training from 2007 and the intensive involvement of the new Member States in them, it is becoming all the more important to attest, in a uniform passport, experience acquired abroad, and the capacities, competence and qualifications acquired there."
"I believe that it will be extremely important that what we will be adopting tomorrow we should also be able to actually provide, and it is absolutely essential that this should go hand in hand with an advertising campaign."
"Its use, significance and added value must be made clearly intelligible to every user and person filling in the forms."
"As it is the purpose of the new generation of programmes, including the Leonardo programme, to achieve 150 000 trainees a year, it is absolutely vital that training providers should know about the Europass."
"Since this document is a formal recognition of professional qualifications, I ask right now for the administrative costs to be kept as low as possible, as these are among the major obstacles for all young people."
"I see the Europass as vital, provided that it is not only an opportunity for formal qualification but also for informal competence."
"The really crucial factor – and let me stress this – is intercultural competence, because in future, with increasing globalisation, integration and interaction between different civilisations and cultures it will be necessary to have intercultural capacities and build on them."
"The mobility pass, which comprises all learning-related and transnational knowledge from abroad, should also certify this experience."
"Both in the learning process and in professional life, mobility is required."
"For young people to be able to achieve an overview of this jungle of support and exchange programmes, the competent agencies, working with the Commission, should produce guidelines for mobility, making available exchange and support programmes, the names and addresses of people to contact, as well as links, so that the added value of Europe is evident to everyone."
"Mr President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur for her work and also the Commissioner for the tremendous effort which has been put into this."
"One slight note of caution: I was hoping that everything could be sorted out in the first reading on this report."
"I am not certain whether that has finally been agreed."
"I know that the Council presidency has been in contact with the rapporteur and others to try and achieve this result."
"As the Commissioner, the rapporteur, the draftsperson and other speakers rightly said, this is one of the key elements with regard to which we in the European Union institutions can point to how we improve people's lives on the ground; how we make their lives easier, both at work and in education."
"By putting together a single portfolio of all the qualifications and experience that citizens have, and allowing them to transfer that across different countries and different working sectors has to be an improvement compared with today's situation."
"Since the late 1980s we have had this idea of a single market with free movement of people, goods and services, but the bureaucracy and the lack of recognition of qualifications and services was so great that there was no true free movement of people."
"This single framework aspect as proposed by the rapporteur is a positive move towards that."
"The issue of lifelong learning is one that continues to be of the utmost importance, not just because of people returning to education or to the workforce, but simply because of the technological changes which are taking place in the workplace and now in our everyday lives: whether it is about online banking, email or being involved in a technical process in the area in which you are working."
"The one aspect of this proposal that will be of the greatest benefit of all is that employers, educational institutions and others will have a single document to look at, and this document will finally provide some idea of the equivalence of qualifications and experience across Member States."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her speeches and her work this evening and during the legislature."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the motion of censure on the European Commission (B5-0189/2004)."
"I should like to inform the House that Mr Borghezio, Mr Gobbo and Mr Turchi have added their signatures to the motion."
"Mrs Muscardini has withdrawn her signature."
"That brings the number of signatures to 67."
"– Mr President, it is usually the author of the motion for a resolution who starts the discussion off, so I suggest that we allow Mr Heaton-Harris to start the debate."
"Mr President, this motion is to censure the whole Commission."
"Alas, we do not currently have the power in this House to censure individuals - we have only this nuclear option."
"Perhaps in Eurostat's case this is the best thing."
"The problem here is that the Commissioners are happy to make great political statements on policy but absolutely refuse to take political responsibility for problems that occur in their DGs."
"Effective political control, proper communication, procedures and financial checks and balances were either not in place in Eurostat, failed to work, or were simply ignored."
"In fact all the warning signs were completely ignored."
"In this case, EUR 5 million went missing because of fraud and bad management controls."
"Yet the only person to be arrested was a journalist - Hans-Martin Tillack - who chose to report this in and whose office was raided again today."
"It is not amazing that OLAF can act with such speed involving police in trying to get the name of a journalist and checking his bank accounts in days."
"However, if you compare this to the Eurostat case, where after more than a year of investigations we have basically nothing, it begs the question of the priorities of various individuals within the DG responsible."
"During the discharge process for 2001, Eurostat was one of our rapporteur's key themes."
"We now know that not all the information we needed at the time was made available to this House."
"Many MEPs are now on record as saying that if they had been given all the facts at the time, they would have voted against discharge for those accounts last year."
"If the Commission and the leaders of all the political groups in this Parliament had put half as much energy into solving the systemic problems shown up by the Eurostat case as they have in trying to block this motion from having an airing on the floor of the House, then all these problems could have been solved years ago."
"This Commission deserves to be censured, and future Commissioners need to know that they will take political responsibility for the actions of their DGs."
"."
"Mr President, as my colleague Mr Fischler stated yesterday, the Commission took immediate action when it had evidence of the problems in Eurostat."
"This has resulted in a thorough restructuring of the Eurostat Directorate-General and its operations."
"In addition to the statement made by my colleague on behalf of the Commission, I would like to emphasise the measures regarding in particular the revision of the code of conduct, the improvement of the flow of information related to fraud allegations, as well as a revision of the legal framework of OLAF."
"I would particularly like to point out the following measures."
"Firstly, revising the code of conduct that governs relations between the Commissioners and their services and which emphasises the political responsibility of the Commissioner, as well as that of the Director-General or the head of service."
"The new code includes specific procedures requiring the Commissioner to be informed about any fact, situation or question concerning management – especially financial management – the gravity of which could invoke the responsibility of the Commissioner or the college."
"Secondly, putting in place measures aimed at facilitating the cross-referencing of any information related to fraud allegations, helping to ensure that the political level is kept informed and that any cases detected are properly followed up."
"Thirdly, strengthening information circuits between the central services and operational services, especially in the areas of control and internal audit."
"This involves a series of important measures that aim at fine-tuning financial management reforms that had already been introduced by the Prodi Commission."
"These measures derive essentially from the recommendations which the internal auditor made in his report on DG Eurostat's contracts - informing and training staff about the different mechanisms in place for whistleblowing and revising OLAF's legal framework with the adoption of two new legislative proposals to be examined by the new Parliament."
"These proposals aim to improve the information flows within the institutions of the Union and to reinforce the procedural guarantees."
"Despite the crisis, Eurostat's functions in performing the essential statistical work of the Commission have not been interrupted."
"A major reorganisation of Eurostat was approved by the Commission on 29 September 2003 and the new establishment plan has been in operation since 1 November."
"The system of approval for commitments and payments was reorganised."
"The financial circuits were more explicitly defined so as to bring into play the responsibilities of the delegated authorising officers at head of unit and directorate level."
"The Commission's decision to end the contractual links with four companies required a significant amount of work in ending the contracts themselves and in ensuring that the potential for litigation was minimised."
"Following on from the special audit undertaken by the internal audit service in September 2003, as well from the in-depth audit that had recently been concluded, a series of initiatives generated by the annual activity report were also undertaken."
"There will be a radical new departure in the field of providing statistical information."
"Based on the principle that European statistical information is a public service, all statistical data drawn up and collected by Eurostat should be available free of charge to users and should be available on the Internet."
"Finally, the work programme for 2004 is strictly prioritised and intentionally realistic."
"The emphasis is on the essential missions of Eurostat, namely the production of figures and independent statistics."
"The Commission is keen to reduce its dependence on external companies and organisations and to ensure that the European statistical service remains a public service which is open and available to users and acts in the public interest."
"The Commission has thus taken very concrete and swift measures to respond to the criticism made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 17 December 2003 on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2004."
"This is also confirmed in the Commission's progress report of 9 February 2004 on completing the reform mandate."
"The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, for having voted today by a large majority to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the execution of the general budget of the European Communities for 2002."
"This vote confirms that the Eurostat affair is a very regrettable exception to the generally sound financial management of the budget of the European Communities."
"However, the Eurostat affair also shows the necessity and the importance of the reform progress engaged by the Commission."
"With regard to the political responsibility mentioned in the motion of censure that is going to be debated here tonight, I would like to confirm the position of the Commission as very clearly stated by President Prodi in his speech of 25 September 2003 at the conference of presidents of the political groups."
"I also want to underline, as my colleague Mrs Schreyer did yesterday when answering a question from Mrs Avilés Perea, that the reform measures will prevent problems like those which occurred in Eurostat before 1999 from recurring, and that the Commission has learned its lesson with regard to the problem of inadequate information flows revealed by the Eurostat case and has taken appropriate action."
"President Prodi and his whole Commission are committed to zero tolerance against fraud."
"You know very well that this is not a guarantee that no fraud will ever occur but it is a guarantee that nothing will be hushed up."
"Potential problems will be brought out into the open and appropriate measures will be taken."
"As also stated by my colleague Mr Fischler today, the Commission remains committed to following up on actions taken to maximise the safeguards against fraud and it is grateful to the European Parliament for its substantial contribution and its continued support in this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate this evening is both regrettable and, in my view, dangerous."
"It is regrettable because the signatories to this motion actually have no other objective than to sully the reputation of the Commission, which, although it can be criticised for its management of the Eurostat matter, certainly does not deserve a vote of no confidence from Parliament."
"It is also dangerous, because this is an important time in the history of European integration with the unification of the continent on 1 May, the European elections, hopefully the adoption of the Constitution and the fight against terrorism."
"The process can only be weakened by mediocre political manoeuvres that do not fool anyone."
"I do not in any way wish to minimise the importance of the questions surrounding the Eurostat affair, but above all, I wish to understand the real reasons that led those who signed this motion of censure to do so."
"Was it really their concern for transparency?"
"I do not think so."
"Was it really their desire to shed light on the Eurostat affair?"
"I am sure it was not. There are two reasons why I think not."
"The first reason is the time that was chosen for this initiative, Parliament’s last legislative sitting."
"Some will naively argue that this is a coincidence, but I would like to point out that more objective observers will note the proximity of the European elections."
"I would draw attention to the fact that the questions surrounding Eurostat were raised as long as two years ago."
"If a desire for transparency was behind this step, the motion of censure would have come much sooner."
"The second reason to back up my arguments is the list of signatories to this motion of censure."
"Everyone is free to defend their convictions and undoubtedly the Members who support the motion of censure are doing so from their soul and their conscience."
"The majority of them, however, have an anti-European soul and a merely national conscience."
"Despite appearances, it is not the Commission that is being targeted, but European integration."
"It is not a defence of the interests of European taxpayers, but a desire to destroy the reputation of a Europe, which, although it is not perfect, is an effective way for our people to live in peace and relative prosperity."
"This motion of censure is the work of the ‘inward-looking’ club of people who reject common policies, fight against European progress waving flags of fear, and reject the contract of trust that is the European Constitution proposed by the Convention."
"I am not trying to offend anyone by saying this, because this is what they are doing by making people believe that Europe is a machine, a monster that regulates everything, decides everything, cheats and I do not know what else."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has chosen a different path to the signatories, because we talk about the future while others stay stuck in the past, because Europe is not built on fear, but on ambition and will."
"It is true that everything is not perfect."
"There is still a great deal to do, particularly giving real political meaning to what is a human step, because it is a human venture to welcome the ten new countries, which are a symbolic example."
"With regard to the Eurostat affair, the PPE-DE Group as a whole has always publicly expressed a desire for light to be shed on the affair."
"We have noted the measures taken by the Commission."
"We want those responsible to explain themselves because we strongly suspect that major mistakes have been made."
"Those responsible must, however, be punished in proportion to any mistakes that become apparent."
"We owe the European people a sense of responsibility, respect for democratic procedures and a guarantee of the rule of law."
"Inquiries need to be conducted, there needs to be punishment for the mistake, the punishment needs to be fair and there must be transparency."
"This is what we have always said, this is what we are fighting for."
"To claim, however, as the signatories to this motion of censure are doing, that the Commission has not fulfilled its obligations, to seek to blemish a Commission at the end of its mandate which has of course made mistakes but which has a commendable record, is not acceptable to us."
"This is why the PPE Group will vote against this motion with determination and conviction."
"Mr President, when you announced yesterday that it is a coalition of British Tories and Greek Communists who have tabled a no-confidence motion against the Commission, I was reminded of the remark of Karl Marx that when history repeats itself it does so first as tragedy and secondly as farce."
"When the Santer Commission fell 5 years ago, most of us Socialists allowed ourselves to be pushed up against a wall by, to some extent, defending the indefensible."
"We have learnt from this."
"Having, at the time, been one of the minority who voted in favour of the vote of no-confidence, I am now all the more convinced in speaking on behalf of my own group against the farce of a no-confidence vote, the only purpose of which would be to serve those newspapers of which it can be said that we do not know whether they are written for illiterates or by them."
"To make one thing clear, that assessment is transnational, it applies to several countries and not just to one."
"It is legitimate, even in this Parliament, to be against European integration and therefore against the Community institutions."
"The question, however, is whether the systematic discrediting of the EU institutions should be allowed to become a means whereby political debate is carried out."
"This question is not to be put to the Tories or to the European United Left, because they have a record of doing this, and will carry on doing so."
"The question, rather, is whether those who are in favour of political integration in this House are going to leave these people without resistance."
"I am in favour of resisting."
"We are also defending ourselves against the abuse of Budget control for clearly political purposes."
"Even you, Mr Heaton-Harris, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, have frequently made it clear that the reasons that led to the collapse of the Santer Commission do not apply in this case, whatever criticism may be levelled at the present Commission."
"In contrast to the Santer Commission, the current Commission, despite all the mistakes, has not attempted to conceal information systematically from Parliament."
"That is the decisive point."
"Mr Bösch and Mr Casaca were two Socialists involved in a leading role in the preparation of the events surrounding Eurostat."
"Using the Eurostat case as an electoral instrument is the best way to distract the incipient reform process and we do not wish to do this."
"The bizarre nature of this circus act is now making two things clear, and they should be made public in this session."
"The signatories of the motion for a vote of no confidence include a Member of this House who personally urged me several months ago to ensure that the Eurostat story was buried."
"In his own words, his reasons were that the closer the elections come, the madder MEPs get."
"He has now signed the motion."
"When this morning – and here I am addressing Mr Bonde – we sat down in a circle in order to discuss the overall approach to the subject of Eurostat, you kindly asked whether it would not be possible to make it superfluous by including in the resolution on Eurostat a couple of sharp paragraphs on the subject of political responsibility, because you did not know whether the no-confidence motion would work out all right."
"Mr Bonde, we are not proposing to get you out of the mess in which you have buried yourself."
"The majority of this Parliament will not give you a helping hand; you must manage it yourself."
"In May, when the new Commissioners arrive, you are welcome to propose that all ten be promptly sent back home, and then you will be exposed as fools before the European public for having abused this instrument of the no-confidence motion for purely party political purposes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the vast majority of my group does not support this initiative of a motion of censure on the Commission."
"We think it is inappropriate, because voting for the resignation of the Commission every time that bad management problems are discovered and recognised is quite excessive."
"As well as individual disciplinary measures, what we need to do is to increase the independence, powers and resources of OLAF and give the Commission as a whole the human and financial resources to fulfil its tasks."
"The reforms undertaken by the Commission aim to do this, as the Commissioner has just said, and the European Parliament has made specific recommendations in several resolutions, which we are waiting to see implemented."
"In the historic period that is beginning of a Union of twenty-five, in which we need to succeed with enlargement, our group thinks that we need a competent European executive and civil service which is subject to permanent democratic monitoring by Parliament."
"– Mr President, we have attempted to apportion the blame for what happened, but it has not been possible."
"In our opinion, no one believes they are to blame for anything at all."
"This was the conclusion of the report, submitted by the so-called Committee of Wise Men in March 1999, into the problems of the earlier Santer Commission."
"The same can be said of the Eurostat scandal."
"All the defence mechanisms have been set in motion."
"Commissioner Solbes is not to blame because he does not read newspapers."
"Commissioner Kinnock is not to blame because he was not listening when Mr Blak told him what Mrs Schmidt Brown had said."
"Commissioner Schreyer was not to blame because she does not read audit reports, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, is not at all to blame because he obviously ensured that no information got through to him either from the European Parliament or the press, and if you do not know about something you cannot be to blame for it, as Mr Prodi says."
"The only thing one might wonder is how people with so little ability to perceive what is going on around them have come to be so high up."
"The truth is, of course, that they had known what was going on at Eurostat for at least a year, but they kept under wraps something that should not have been kept under wraps. You could call it misplaced loyalty to a corrupt system."
"You could call it nepotism. Whatever you call it, it is not worthy of an inter-European institution."
"That is why we want to establish who is to blame, but the system is designed to prevent us from doing so."
"In a normal democracy, critics within a parliament can move a vote of censure."
"This occasionally happens in our Member States."
"If a government has a solid majority, it will be fairly indifferent."
"A government that wins a vote of censure generally comes out of the vote stronger."
"In this case, the Commission is certain to win, because the majority here in Parliament do not wish blame to be apportioned, and those of us tabling this motion of censure know that we will lose."
"Nonetheless, those loyal to the Commission have been busy preventing us from holding this debate and the subsequent vote at all."
"Signatures have been placed under suspicion and removed for no objective reason, and Members have been pressurised into withdrawing their signatures."
"That is not true parliamentarianism."
"There is something rotten permeating the entire issue of Eurostat, and a majority in Parliament do not want to contribute to apportioning the blame."
"I recommend that Members vote in favour of our motion of censure."
"– Mr President, I should like to start with a question for Mrs Grossetête, Mr Kuhne and Mrs Reding: who is politically responsible for the Eurostat scandal?"
"Over 100 Members of the European Parliament signed a motion of censure against the Commission, but one in three was pressurised into withdrawing his or her signature."
"The die-hards now include some Members who may lose their places on important committees or in delegations."
"Members of this Parliament will be punished by their groups for supporting the simple principle of the responsibility of ministers and Commissioners for their conduct in office."
"Parliament’s highly politicised administration is no longer there solely to serve its Members."
"Not content with checking the authenticity of the signatures and counting them, it has cooperated with the groups in getting Members to withdraw their signatures."
"It has even refused to accept confirmation sent by fax and quite obviously genuine signatures in order to stifle or stave off the debate on censure."
"Do we also have to verify the signatures on the attendance lists by means of handwritten original letters?"
"Imagine if all the group chairmen were as keen to penalise the people in the Commission who have had their hands in the till, or those covering up for the thieves."
"Nothing is, however, so bad that there is not some good in it somewhere."
"The compromise text on Eurostat contains the fiercest criticism to date of the Commission’s financial management."
"It still does not apportion direct responsibility, however, and we are thus weakening those in the Commission who are working to bring about honest accounting and transparency."
"We are backing up those who say that approving the accounts is just parliamentary chit-chat, that it does not mean anything and that we can carry on swindling people."
"EUR 8 billion disappears from our budget every year."
"It is taxpayers’ money, and we have been elected to this Parliament in order to represent taxpayers."
"Consequently, we must call upon the Commission to apportion the blame itself by 12 noon on Tuesday 4 May. Otherwise, we shall vote on the motion of censure."
"I should like to thank the more than 100 members who are signatories."
"There may be more of us watchdogs after the elections."
"I should like to thank you, Mr President, and to the person who said that this was electioneering I would point out that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have attempted to apportion political responsibility for this from the very first day the scandal came to light."
"Mr President, in order to fully justify the proposal for a motion of censure on the European Commission that I co-signed, all I need to do is to refer to the report that the European Parliament itself adopted by a very large majority on 29 January, on the measures taken by the Commission to follow up our observations on the discharge of the 2001 budget, particularly regarding the Eurostat affair."
"The assessment made by that resolution is damning."
"What is more serious is not so much the Eurostat affair itself because, after all, misappropriation can affect any body, but rather the monitoring failures that it revealed, and, above all, the inability of the Commission to convincingly put things right."
"Our resolution of 29 January, which I remind you again was adopted by the European Parliament, criticised the culture of secrecy and lack of transparency in the Commission, the poor internal communication of information, the fact that it was extremely slow and reticent in submitting audit reports to the European Parliament, and the fact that the Commissioners were shirking their political responsibilities."
"The last of these characteristics seems to be even more true now, as the Commission no longer accepts any responsibility for this affair and Mr Prodi, who did not even come to our debate this evening, seems to be more interested in the electoral campaign in Italy."
"This is why Members must take on their own responsibility today as elected representatives of the people of Europe, the taxpayers of Europe."
"I congratulate the sixty-six other co-signatories to this motion, led by Mr Bonde and Mr Heaton-Harris, who had the courage and clarity to resist all the pressure."
"I would like to say this to Members who are hesitating to vote in favour of the motion of censure: by defending the Commission, as Mrs Grossetête just did, whether you like it or not, you will be covering up unacceptable behaviour and providing a very poor service to the European institutions."
"The way to provide a good service to the European institutions is to make the Commission understand that it is not superior, that it is a body like all the other bodies, which has to give in to the higher control of the European Parliament and the Member States."
"Two colleagues have made reference to the question of signatures and implicitly suggest some kind of foul deeds behind the scenes."
"As far as I know, the motion of censure is on the European Commission and not on the services of the European Parliament."
"Let me make it clear that while it is argued by some that there are 100 signatories, I have a duty of care as President, under the Rules of Procedure, to establish and verify who has signed and who stands over the signature."
"In the fulfilment of that duty of care and in instructing the staff to follow that duty of care on our behalf, I take the responsibility."
"So if you have a problem about what is going on behind the scenes, talk to me."
"On my watch we will do it the right way or we will not do it all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the reason for the motion of censure, its signatories argue, is the scandal and the irregularities which have taken place in Eurostat."
"Everybody is aware that for some time we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have been working very hard to try to clarify this issue and resolve the problems stemming from it."
"It is true that the Commission took a long time to react, but it finally did so and implemented an in-depth reform and, so far, we believe that the results are satisfactory."
"It is true that the case is not closed, since a judicial procedure is underway."
"The majority of the political groups have therefore prepared a resolution which will be voted on during tomorrow’s sitting, precisely because we are still concerned about such an enormously important issue as fraud in Eurostat."
"We do not believe this issue to be closed, and we believe we must monitor events very closely in order to prevent any repeat of it in the future, either in Eurostat or in any other Commission body."
"The resolution various groups will table tomorrow makes it very clear that Parliament is vigilant, is carrying out its duty and is exercising the control conferred on it by the Treaty as a fundamental Community institution throughout the procedure."
"There is no justification for this motion; it is a purely electoral issue for the signatories, who have in common, amongst many other things, their anti-European sentiment and militancy, their Euroscepticism and their constant campaign against the European institutions."
"We therefore believe that this motion is inappropriate."
"We in the European Parliament do our work, we have done so seriously and rigorously, and we are going to continue to do so, and we do not believe that a group of Members who call themselves anti-European and Eurosceptic are the right people to defend the transparency and smooth functioning of the European institutions."
"In our work, we have often insisted that it is necessary to trust in the control of the Commission’s management, as we have done this morning, while making it clear that we are still concerned about the problem of Eurostat, and we therefore believe it is entirely inappropriate for small groups in this House - whose record and approach in relation to this issue have been very well-known from the outset and have never changed - to try to use this issue for electoral party political ends."
"They have taken no notice of explanations or solutions, nor any type of suggestion."
"The position of the People's Group is very clear and we will continue to work to ensure the openness and transparency of the European institutions and also to strengthen them."
"Mr President, the document that we are discussing appears to be more like an election manifesto than a parliamentary mechanism."
"Furthermore, the fact that this was drawn up and signed by minorities known for being anti-Europeanist quite clearly exposes this intention."
"This is confirmation that, in making Parliament’s work more frenzied, the run-up to the elections is inspiring initiatives such as the one that we are dealing with this evening."
"The Eurostat affair is once again being discussed by some of our fellow Members to bring general discredit to the European institutions and, in particular, to the Commission and its President."
"My fellow Members who signed this document know that the Eurostat affair has been – and still is being – continuously and thoroughly tracked by this Parliament and will be the subject of an umpteenth resolution in this sitting too."
"The bad faith concerning this affair is clear to see when nothing is said about the specific measures adopted by the Commission and, more generally, about the reforms implemented in order to achieve the good governance that we want to inspire all the European Union’s institutions, a process followedstep by step by this Parliament and by its Committee on Budgetary Control too, and mentioned here by Commissioner Reding."
"Of course, it is easy to stir up scandal about particular issues in order to try to grab the attention of the public, which is often ill informed about politics and the European institutions."
"It is more difficult to give Europe a political dimension, starting with adopting a real constitution."
"Having said that, as a representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, it is a matter of pride to me that no one in my group signed this motion."
"The support of the British Conservatives once again clearly shows the untenable association of this group with the European People’s Party tradition, so well represented by Mrs Grossetête and also by Mrs Avilés Perea."
"Among the signatories, I then notice many Members from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, in which the representatives of the Italian stand out in particular."
"It seems to me that this position contrasts somewhat with the role that the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Fini, played in the work of the Convention."
"This is perhaps why Mrs Muscardini wisely withdrew her signature."
"If the Members of her delegation were to follow her example, moreover, that would even cast doubt on the safety of the 66 signatures announced by the President this evening, without even mentioning the so-called ‘technical signatures’, which should not turn into votes in favour either."
"There is, however, another key to interpreting the true intentions lurking behind those who tabled this motion, and it is the one given by the Vice-President of Italy’s Senate, Mr Calderoli, chief representative of the He claimed that, in actual fact, the signatories are secret supporters of Mr Prodi."
"Indeed, this Parliament’s trust in the President of the Commission would be strengthened and his prestige increased as a result of this motion, which will certainly be rejected."
"If this is true, though, what is to be said then about Mr Speroni, a member of the same party as Mr Calderoli?"
"Is he aware of being converted into one of the most fervent supporters of the European Commission?"
"If things are really like this and we look at the motion of censure in this light, then I believe that all of the group of signatories have something to think about."
"Mr President, different assessments can, of course, be made as to whether the Commission’s action is so serious as to require a motion of censure, and I can therefore respect a contribution as objective as that of Mr Jonckheer."
"When, however, I listened to Mrs Grossetête, Mr Kuhne etc., I was reminded of when, in the Eighties, I visited the Supreme Soviet in Moscow where all critics were held up to ridicule, condemned and accused of being anti-Soviet and traitors."
"Is that the way in which you are to defend your EU project?"
"Is it to be done by means of accusations and ridicule, through the harassment of whistleblowers and by setting the police on investigative journalists?"
"Have you not noticed that the project is suffering from a crisis of confidence due to the lack of transparency and democratic legitimacy?"
"We are attempting to use a classic parliamentary tool to monitor the executive."
"You may have a different view but, when you ridicule us, run us down and call us anti-Europeans, you undermine the democratic legitimacy of your own project."
"Mr President, in the end, and almost too late, I agreed to add my name to this motion of censure on the Commission regarding the Eurostataffair."
"Quite frankly, I do not feel that I am either illiterate or, even less so, an anti-Europeanist, nor do I believe that I can be blamed for bringing the Commission into disrepute; if anything it did that on its own."
"At the end of the day, we were practically forced into this extreme measure by the Commission’s indifference and perfunctory attitude towards Parliament, because – and I want to mention this – this is not an impromptu move. For more than a year, there have been hundreds of questions and a large body of parliamentary work behind this extreme move."
"In any case, we expected the Commission to act less like Pontius Pilate; this is what we expected and, I believe, what we deserved since, after all, we are the only institution that has genuine popular legitimacy."
"I do not want to go back over the many questions to which adequate responses were not given, or the good proposals stated by the Commission for the future."
"Once again, however, I would like to comment on the organisation involved, that is to say Eurostat It is worth remembering that Eurostatdoes not deal with generating interesting and harmless statistics."
"Eurostatis an institution which, through its surveying and statistical work, is in fact the guarantor of the Stability and Growth Pact: it monitors the application of the Maastricht criteria."
"It is, therefore, involved in setting out the economic and financial policies of the Member States and, indeed, in making Member States adopt strict policies that often entail budget and welfare cutbacks."
"It is, therefore, an institution that has a monitoring role, and its impartiality and authoritativeness must not be even slightly scarred by the doubts and suspicions that hang over Eurostat today."
"I am, therefore, sorry, Commissioner Reding, but the Eurostat affair cannot be crossed off as a deplorable exception."
"We realise that the affair is embarrassing, it is for me too, but I believe it is the citizens that are calling for this not to be tolerated, the same people whom we are asking to make sacrifices in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I do not want to give lessons in democracy to anyone – God forbid – but I would like to quietly mention that democracy is based on the rights of minorities to express their opinion."
"Mr President, I think that this evening we are experiencing a real parody, a mockery of democracy."
"Every week we issue resolution after resolution, giving lectures in democracy, transparency, human rights and whatever else, to the whole world, and we are not capable of organising a debate, worthy of a Parliament deserving of that name, on censure, which in all of our democracies, is an important moment in political, democratic and parliamentary life."
"It is said that we can only make our mark by opposing."
"This is how the national parliaments have been created throughout history, generally against the arbitrary nature of executive powers."
"That is not the case here."
"Think about it, if you will, Mrs Grossetête, that is not the case here."
"The executive and legislative powers are thick as thieves, dodging the truth, like in the famous Vermeer painting, in view of the onlookers, European citizens."
"I admit that you have impressed me in this exercise, Mrs Grossetête."
"I am talking about dodging the truth, about dishonesty, and I would even say that you reminded me somewhat of Vichinsky pleading before the Soviet Parliament."
"The proximity of the elections may exacerbate people’s attitudes, that is quite natural for a democrat: the elections are not a difficult time to get through, as you seem to think."
"We spent an hour this morning, Mr President, an hour, and we also did so in the last sitting, pushing and shoving each other out of the way for reasons which, personally, entirely escape me."
"Is that the type of democracy that you want to set an example for?"
"We spent an hour this morning and we will definitely spend two or three hours tomorrow morning debating an obscure manoeuvre of Italian internal policy."
"Is that the democracy that you are talking about?"
"You should recognise, Mrs Grossetête, that it would be at least paradoxical for this Parliament which, I repeat, gives lectures to the whole world, to act like a frightened virgin when it comes to exercising the only power that it has: monitoring and censuring the European Commission when it has made a mistake."
"Mr President, senator Calderoli is right in saying that our real intention was to help President Prodi."
"We wanted to prevent him from ending this European affair in the shameful role of someone who is as slippery as an eel when faced with questions and demands posed by different newspapers – and we would have thought that he would have had the decency to be present in this House to discuss this issue – whilst one of the people who exposed the information is being investigated, as in the good old days of the communist police, and his files are confiscated because he dares to investigate European fraud and Eurostat."
"The scandal concerns a body of the European institutions that deals with funds and sensitive data, and this makes it a serious fact."
"The Eurostat dossier has compromised the image of the European Commission and its President, who – in our opinion – would do well to draw from it the necessary consequences."
"What we really must ask ourselves in this situation is what type of hidden connections of solidarity – in Italy we would say somewhat mafia-like – prevented the Commission from lancing the pustulent boil that is EurostatI would welcome an answer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the May part-session."
"The next item is the joint debate on four reports produced on behalf of the European Parliament’s Delegation to the Conciliation Committee:"
"– A5-0242/2004 by Mr Jarzembowski, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways (PE-CONS 3641/2004 - C5-0156/2004 - 2002/0025(COD));"
"– A5-0245/2004 by Mr Sterckx, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (Railway Safety Directive) (PE-CONS 3638/2004 – C5-0153/2004 - 2002/0022(COD));"
"– A5-0243/2004 by Mrs Ainardi, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and Directive 2001/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system (PE-CONS 3639/2004 – C5-0154/2004 – 2002/0023(COD)); and"
"– A5-0244/2004 by Mr Savary, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Railway Agency (‘Agency Regulation’) (PE-CONS 3640/2004 – C5-0155/2004 – 2002/0024(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the second railways package we wanted to provide a strong impetus for the construction of an integrated, competitive and safe European rail network."
"Now we are at the end of more than two years of intensive work, and I think that the result is very good."
"I would like to highlight the essential contribution that the European Parliament has made to the four texts that make up this second rail package."
"I would particularly like to thank the four rapporteurs, Mrs Ainardi, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary, for the considerable work that they have done and I would also like to thank their colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have closely monitored this matter."
"My thanks also go to Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee and, in particular, its Chair, Mrs Cederschiöld, who reached an agreement with the Council at the final conciliation meeting on 16 March, a compromise which we consider to be very balanced."
"This second package of measures opens up new possibilities for development for rail transport in the enlarged European Union, and I therefore hope that Parliament will adopt the results of the conciliation and therefore give the definitive green light for implementing these texts."
"From that point onwards, I can assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to establish the European Railway Agency as quickly as possible."
"Allow me to give you a few thoughts on future work in the railway sector."
"When examining these texts in the second railway package, Parliament wished to highlight the importance that it attaches to opening up the passenger transport market."
"The Commission itself indicated in the White Paper in September 2001 that proposals would be made."
"This is why it adopted a series of proposals on 7 March regarding opening up the market for international passenger rail transport services from 2010, and also regarding passenger rights."
"These texts are accompanied by a significant proposal for a directive on certifying locomotive drivers and crew and a proposal for a regulation on contractual quality clauses for rail freight."
"It will of course be up to the new Parliament elected in June to examine these new proposals."
". – Mr President, Commissioner – Viviane – ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that it is now a little late and there are hardly any spectators present – apart from a well-known representative of a railway company – I will be brief."
"I think that Parliament can be proud that we have overcome the hesitant position of the Council with the results of the conciliation procedure on the second railway package and have created a new, practical European dimension for the development of railway companies in the Union."
"With the amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC, all railway companies will now be given non-discriminatory access to the rail networks of all the Member States for cross-border freight traffic as of 1 January 2006 and – this is Parliament’s achievement – for freight traffic within them as early as 1 January 2007."
"At the same time, the Commission, Parliament and the Council recommend an opening up of the network also for cross-border passenger traffic for the year 2010."
"Commissioner, we are grateful to you for the third railway package, as put before us by the Commission."
"I personally am not sure whether it is necessary to regulate quality control for freight services – which I believe should be left to the market – and compensation for delays and so on in railway transport – aviation is rather different from railways."
"However, we will do this in the next round."
"In any event, we are in favour of the opening up of passenger traffic, on which we agree, Commissioner, and also on the fact that we need a European driving licence, so that we can have a European labour market for railway employees too."
"I would like to go on to say, however, that, with the new Directive on railway safety in the Community, we will for the first time be developing a European safety standard for railways, that we will be overcoming the small-state approach to questions of safety and will in fact be introducing rules across the Union for a uniformly high level of safety for private and public railway companies."
"I believe that this will be a major step towards a European internal market."
"I regard Mrs Ainardi’s amendment on interoperability as important precisely because we will be able more rapidly and better to coordinate and accelerate technical specification work for rolling stock in other parts of the railway system."
"Finally, I also believe that with the regulation establishing the European Railway Agency we will have created an important institution which will be committed in practice both to European safety standards and also to the rapid processing of the technical specifications for interoperability."
"Let me conclude with that. I believe that, by means of the conciliation procedure, we have created the right – that is to say, favourable – parameters for ensuring that in the railway sector too there is a European internal market and, now that we have created the parameters, it is now up to the railway companies – whether public or private, on that we are neutral – to exploit, at a high level of safety, the opportunities in the market and at the end of the day to achieve our common objective of reviving rail transport in the European Union and shifting as much freight as possible from road to rail, so that our policy can make sense both environmentally and commercially."
"We have thus taken a major step towards a reasonable modal split between future transport providers and a good new opportunity for railway companies in the Union."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sterckx was unable to remain in Strasbourg this evening, and I am speaking for him."
"The objective of the new directive on railway safety is to harmonise the regulatory structure in Member States and to develop common safety targets and methods in Europe."
"Harmonisation aims to reduce the number of barriers to an EU-wide railway network."
"The proposal defines the main elements of common safety systems, puts in place a common system for the issue of safety certificates, as well as introducing the principle of independent technical investigations in the event of accidents."
"In conciliation an agreement was reached on 10 March which was confirmed by the Parliament delegation and the Conciliation Committee on 16 March."
"Under the agreement Member States agree to keep the introduction of national safety rules to a minimum."
"This way the objective concerning the application of just European rules gains depth."
"The Commission’s powers to scrutinise new national rules were strengthened."
"It was given the power to suspend the application of a national rule if there is a serious doubt about the compatibility of the draft safety rules with the European rules."
"The Commission can also act if it considers that a rule constitutes arbitrary discrimination or disguised restriction in respect of rail transport operation between Member States."
"The Member States will be obliged to ensure access to training facilities for train drivers and on-board safety personnel."
"To allow mobility of these members of staff between railway companies, it has been agreed that train drivers, on-board safety personnel as well as ground-based infrastructure managers will have the right to have access to and obtain copies of all documents attesting to their qualifications."
"This new directive is an important step towards the creation of a safe European railway system and sets out a clear regulatory structure for its gradual establishment."
"The European Railway Agency, another essential part of this railway package, will play a key role in the implementation, monitoring, development and harmonisation of the system."
"The agreement reached within the Conciliation Committee fully reflects Parliament’s position at second reading."
"All in all this railway package is a major step towards freeing up traffic by means of the railways."
"We need our railways to be efficient and safe and to provide a high quality service."
"Otherwise they will be unable to compete equally with other forms of transport."
"A functional railway system will mean greater and greater benefits to the consumer and also allow us to achieve sustainable development in transport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate this evening brings us to the end of numerous discussions and meetings regarding the future of the railways in Europe."
"A package has been completed, but it is also true that we have not yet completed the necessary revitalisation of the railways."
"At the end of this long and educational road, I would like to thank all my fellow rapporteurs who, despite differences of opinion, even seeing things in an entirely different way, have allowed us to work in a way that respected everyone’s points of view."
"As this discussion follows many others and closes the package, I would like to give an overall view of the proposals."
"In my opinion, this package is in line with the twofold reality of European integration today."
"It is also proof of the positive contribution that Europe can make to its people in order to tighten links and develop solidarity."
"The same applies to the reports on interoperability and the creation of the Rail Safety Agency."
"The aim of the ‘interoperability’ directive, for which I am rapporteur, was to bring the national networks forged by history into harmony with each other in order to achieve faster, more efficient and more harmonious transport."
"This is essential in order to revitalise rail transport and help international trade to flow more easily."
"It means that techniques need to be made coherent and that we need to ensure that the diversity of networks does not hinder traffic or cause delays."
"Considerable progress has been made in this respect and also on how we can achieve it."
"To give just one example, the black box proposal, which everyone welcomes today, was suggested to me right at the start of the debates by actual railwaymen, which shows that we have everything to gain from the participation of the main people involved."
"This is why, as rapporteur, I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for helping me to complete this task, and also everyone within Parliament and outside, professionals and associations, who have helped me to look in detail into these questions and gain a better grasp of the issues at stake."
"This is also one of the main reasons why I welcome the report on the creation of the Rail Agency."
"Representatives of the profession, and in particular of employee organisations, will be on the board of directors of the agency."
"They will also have the opportunity to take part in working groups on the TSIs that affect them."
"Even though I wanted other improvements, in my view these two points demonstrate what Europe can gain by trusting and giving a voice to those who keep it going day by day."
"They deserve strong support from Parliament at the vote tomorrow."
"I now come to the other aspect of the twofold reality that I mentioned earlier."
"In my opinion, this package also reveals an ideological bias towards opening up markets and liberalisation."
"The unbridled race towards ever more liberalisation is one of the sources of discontent with Europe."
"The directive on opening up the networks proposes total liberalisation of freight, even though the first package has just been transposed and no serious, transparent and balanced evaluation has been conducted on its effects."
"Moreover, a date for the total liberalisation of passenger rail transport has been announced, prejudging the debate, which has not yet started, on the third package."
"I think we need to stop being deaf to the opposition expressed by all the rail workers’ unions in Europe."
"Even on a subject as important and decisive as safety, it is being proposed to us that the first Article be amended to place opening up to competition on the same level as safety."
"In my view, this is sending a bad signal."
"I do not wish to repeat what, as my colleagues know, I have already said several times on this matter."
"I will simply say that, on issues of such importance, with the experiences that we have had in Europe, it is worth adhering to the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank all of my colleagues, firstly the rapporteurs of these four important reports, but also all my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for the very significant work which has been done on these four texts."
"I think that this is a very good example of Parliament adding value to the initial Commission proposals."
"We have added a considerable amount to them, which I think is positive, and in response we have had great understanding from the Commission and the Council, which means that the texts are ultimately very gratifying to us as MEPS."
"I would like to go back to this package to say that, as a whole, we are very pleased with it, particularly thanks to the work of Mrs Cederschiöld in the Conciliation Committee, in particular the safety package, which was absolutely necessary as a strong political signal prior to enlargement."
"I think that the date that we are reaching is not insignificant."
"At a time when we want to welcome ten new countries, we have to renew a very strong safety requirement in an area, railways, in which ultimately the job is about safety."
"With regard to interoperability, we know that it is one of the essential conditions for opening up the networks."
"Opening up to competition would not overcome the technical barriers that still exist and which mean that, for example, the Thalys locomotive has to take on board computer equipment capable of reading the different control and operation systems on the small Thalys network."
"Therefore, bringing all of this up to standard and starting on this vast project is essential for the future of the railways."
"With regard to the Agency, I think that it is very important to establish a tool to enable the Commission to work on a more daily basis on implementing this major policy and major ambition for the railways."
"I am personally very honoured to have been able to bring this matter to a close having made significant changes."
"These include, for the first time, involvement of all the social partners – in particular, but not exclusively, the unions – in working groups and management board."
"We would have liked to set an example in another area, as we think that for the Agency, the Council should stop requiring one representative per country, which now means that we have a representation of the Council of 25 members, two of which do not have rail networks."
"This shows the absurdity of the system, which creates mechanisms that will very soon be unworkable, in particular when we want to push enlargement further, towards the Balkans and perhaps beyond."
"I therefore hope that the commitment made by the Council and the Commission to adopt a directive in the coming years to create order within the agencies and establishing a standard model for all of them, in order to put an end to the disparities, will be respected for the purpose of better governance."
"Finally, regarding access to the network, my fellow MEP Mr Jarzembowski is aware of my reluctance, not regarding opening up to competition, but the fact that it brings with it a number of requirements."
"I consider that in this text, which is acceptable regarding freight, we are going to have to be careful about opening up to international passenger traffic."
"In particular, what bothers me in this text is that it states that there will be an evaluation on 1 January 2006, when 1 January 2006 is the opening date."
"I do not see how we can evaluate a text which will be implemented at the same time as the evaluation report."
"On a more general note and to conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give you a few comments on our major objective, which is sustainable mobility, and therefore developing railways and waterways, rather than giving in to the rise in road traffic that will one day pose severe political problems."
"I think that opening up, in the sense in which we see it, in other words as purely liberal, creating competition on the networks, is not the panacea."
"We are currently blindly working towards that goal."
"In reality, we are well aware that there is no funding for interoperability."
"We are well aware that there are colossal investments to make and the financial perspectives do not respond to the request for financial resources made by Commissioner de Palacio herself in order to fund trans-European transport networks and, in particular, rail networks."
"In short, I do not think that anything will be done."
"Today is a step forward without the railwaymen, because there are extremely strong national cultures in these companies, that is how it is, because they are labour companies."
"I think that we need to promote sectoral dialogue before issuing directives, which is what we did this time."
"We need to continue in this way, but I also hope that one day we will move towards a collective railwaymen’s agreement, whether they are employed by private or public companies, so that they can own this tremendous rebirth of the railways which is of benefit to everyone who wants us to have a less polluting method of transport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the last conciliation of this term of office was aimed at establishing a common market for railway transport, and it has been a great success, especially for Parliament."
"It is, however, annoying that the Council refused to reduce the number of members of the board of the new European Railway Agency, as Parliament wanted it to."
"This will indubitably lead to unnecessary bureaucracy, as explained so eloquently by Mr Savary here in the House and, best of all, during the negotiations."
"On the European Parliament’s side, we succeeded, however, in introducing a legally binding document whereby the Commission is to carry out a thorough review of the structure and composition of all the authorities."
"Efficient management must be based upon the general European interest."
"It would be a retrograde step if the view were to be taken that the greatest merit of the decision-making bodies were that they were constituted on a national basis, because that would reduce the chances of bringing about the greater efficiency that is needed."
"National interests may certainly have their place, but they must definitely not reign supreme."
"Parliament succeeded in bringing the liberalisation of freight services forward to 2007, thanks to Mr Jarzembowski."
"His wording means that the Commission must seek also to liberalise passenger services in a similar way after 2010."
"To ensure rail safety, all railway workers, such as train drivers, who affect rail safety must, from now on, use a generally known vocabulary and system of orders to eliminate any risk of misunderstanding."
"All trains must, furthermore, be provided with black boxes similar to those on aircraft."
"Mr Savary, who was rapporteur for the report on a European Railway Agency; Mr Dirk Sterckx, who was responsible for the report on safety on the Community’s railways; and Mrs Ainardi, who was responsible for the report on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system – have all helped inject life into the European railway sector."
"It is necessary to develop the railway infrastructure in order to reduce the congestion on our motorways and enable us to fulfil the environmental requirements."
"I wish to thank the European Parliament, together with the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary, Mr Sterckx and Mrs Ainardi for this important step."
"A particularly worthwhile instance of progress was the fact that we succeeded in uniting all the different parties."
"There was only a minor split between the parties."
"We were able to maintain a more or less common front against the Council, a fact that is, of course, in large part the reason for the outcome."
"The conciliation was held in a constructive spirit, and the entirely new mood we can now sense exists between Parliament and the Council found its optimum expression."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her work."
"In many ways, it was easy from the start because the policy ideas were similar and ran in parallel, whereas in other aspects it was slightly more difficult, but if one is used to debating from different standpoints and if one is prepared for a compromise, then one will indeed find a good compromise."
"Why do I think, as a Social Democrat, that this is a good compromise?"
"It is because I am constantly telling my friends that in the last few years and decades, since there was no liberalisation or opening up of the market, the railways have lost market share."
"What happened was not liberalisation but scrapping."
"The fact is that, on the one hand, there are heavy goods vehicles, driven more or less the length and breadth of Europe without borders."
"Drivers do not have to change at the border, and the driving cabin is not changed at the border; there are, no doubt, various detailed provisions about traffic signs but they are relatively easily intelligible."
"On the other hand, unfortunately, there are still national railway systems, which are separate from each other, which involve obstacles and which of course also make the railway inflexible."
"For that reason, many companies which, whether we like it or not, have relied more and more on just-in-time production, have frequently found themselves forced to prefer the lorry over the railway."
"Coming as I do from a country which is burdened by a massive amount of lorry transit traffic, I can only hope that there are efficient, market-oriented but still, of course, environment-oriented means of transport and for me that certainly means the railway."
"Mr Jarzembowski was right to say that railways must now do something about this."
"I have constantly criticised the fact that railways have taken a long time to start thinking in international and European terms."
"However, I believe that today – not least because of the work of this House – the railways, and even the representatives of the employees, the trade unions, have a European orientation."
"There are probably not many trade unions that are now as European-oriented as the railway unions, because they know that the future depends upon their being involved at European level."
"I believe that they are also to a large extent responsible for this evolution."
"The times when there were still firemen on English trains even though there were no fires left to stoke are, thank God, over and it is employee representatives who are now working, as we also see with the train drivers, very constructively on deliberately giving the railways a renaissance at European level and also enabling them to compete with the roads."
"Of course, there is still much to be done."
"This very week, we voted on the Cocilovo report."
"It is not yet the optimum solution, but there has been some progress."
"Mr Jarzembowski does not regard it as progress, but the good thing is that he must also sometimes make compromises, even in Hamburg in Northern Germany he must be able to make compromises."
"So with any luck we will be able to find a good solution for the question of the offsetting of external costs."
"For I believe that any reasonable person, any reasonable traffic expert, would say that we need both rail and road."
"What is at issue is the appropriate balance."
"In this period, I believe that a good compromise has emerged."
"We will see what to do about passenger traffic."
"I agree with Mrs Ainardi that we need to review the steps that have been taken."
"Only so far, there has in fact not been much market opening, not much readiness on the part of the railway companies to accept the market."
"I hope that this will now be the case to a larger extent."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur warmly for her work once again."
"I would also like to thank you, Mrs Cederschiöld, very much for the way in which you have chaired the conciliation committee in a purposeful and cautious manner."
"This made it possible to be on a level with the Council and the Commission. That itself, I think, is an important milestone in the development of the European railway system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first speech to this House fifteen years ago, which I remember, took place during an evening sitting at around 11.45 p.m."
"My last speech, fifteen years later, is also in the evening, before an almost equally reduced audience."
"I am nevertheless pleased to be able to make this speech on this important matter of the rail package and everything that it implies."
"I would like once again to say on behalf of my group and also personally that we think it is very important to maintain and particularly to develop a quality, tight, diverse, secure European rail network, providing a public service to all the citizens of Europe and contributing to a balanced use of land in Europe."
"In our view, the rail package and what underlies it are an example of a Europe that we no longer want, a Europe which has given priority to free competition, very often over any other consideration."
"It is true that thanks to the fight by the unions in the sector and by a party in Parliament, not forgetting the real pressure of public opinion that is increasingly sensitive to our arguments, the points that were most dangerous for the future of rail have been removed or deferred."
"But in our view, and in my view, the result is still not acceptable, in particular with the Jarzembowski and Sterckx reports, despite the Savary and Ainardi reports which we consider to be positive."
"Ultimately, the overall result is still too negative in our view."
"To conclude, I would like to express my hope that in future there will be more forces that wish to construct the other Europe that we want, a social and citizen’s Europe which we think is much closer to the dream of the founding fathers of Europe than this Europe of a big liberal market that years of liberalisation decisions have finally led us to."
"Mr President, unlike the situation affecting other modes of transport, the liberalisation of the markets has only touched the surface of the rail transport sector."
"As a consequence, this mode of transport has lost a great deal of influence to competing sectors, to road transport in particular."
"We therefore welcome the presentation of this second rail package in which the Commission proposes new measures that will enable us to move towards liberalisation, whilst at the same time maintaining the safety standards required for the sector."
"I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the excellent work of the rapporteurs."
"From our point of view, the compromise that could be reached with the Council is acceptable as regards the points under dispute."
"The most complex issue was, of course, the process of liberalisation, because this clashes with interests that are deeply entrenched in the various Member States given the special role that the rail sector plays in each country’s economy."
"From this point of view, the conciliation that has been achieved moderates the more radical proposals without, however, discounting a future opening-up of the market to passenger rail transport."
"Another point that must be highlighted concerns the agreement reached on the composition of the administrative board of the future European Railway Agency."
"The principle of including on the board one representative from each Member State, which has already been applied to the other agencies, was fortunately accepted."
"I wish to say a final word about the need to include a common rail safety strategy, which is ultimately one of the most important aspects for users of this transport sector."
"We fully agree with the need to harmonise minimum safety standards in this field and the provisions in force in the various Member States."
"We should also emphasise the set of proposals put forward by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on introducing a safety certificate, on training and certifying rail staff and on introducing a common working language for international transport, similar to the situation in the air transport sector."
"In short, the compromise that has been reached demonstrates the bold and forward-looking vision that we should all adopt towards the crucial transport sector."
"Mr President, we can look forward to the revival of the railways as a wonderful prospect."
"Unfortunately, reality is still far removed from that."
"In order to bring the high hopes within reach, a powerful European incentive is crucial."
"We are therefore pleased with the progress that has been made under the supervision of Mrs Ainardi, Mr Savary, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Sterckx."
"These Members of our House have each contributed to the setting up and further elaboration of a sound legal framework within which European railways can develop as competitive carriers over the coming years."
"An important area of concern was passenger transport."
"I endorse the current insight that passenger transport is, as a market, entirely different from goods transport and the concept of one type cannot be applied seamlessly to the other."
"Development of this market therefore calls for a cautious approach."
"The Council has spoken;"
"Parliament has spoken, and so have I. It is now up to the industry to take up the challenge."
"Mr President, I believe that we would do well to be satisfied – I would say very satisfied – with the result that we are achieving."
"The Members who have followed this railway package will remember that there have been moments when we doubted that we would succeed in the endeavour to close such a complex chapter."
"The first result that we must be proud of is, therefore, that of having reached the destination and of having achieved the result."
"The second is that, objectively, apart from some things that may not convince all the respective political leanings – as we have also heard this evening – we must recognise that we have achieved a balanced result."
"In these four proposals – for which the rapporteurs must, of course, be thanked for the great work that they carried out – we have a balanced mixture of, on the one hand, the urgent need to open up this market and modernise it and, on the other hand, the need to give us guarantees, both in terms of security and in terms of the ability and experience that the workers in this sector bring, which we want to safeguard."
"More than anything, what I want to do is say thank you."
"I would just like to make one observation, because I have heard comments that I am struggling to understand."
"When talking about this liberalisation, which some are demonising, I would like to call for us not ever to forget that our focus and our objective are the users of this service."
"No one has the key to liberalisation as such."
"We must ensure that, by using competition opportunities, we, on the one hand, effectively improve the service for many users who are, primarily, workers – the commuters on this service – and, on the other hand, ensure that this takes place safely and also makes good use of workers’ professional skills."
"I believe that we have achieved this objective."
"Since this is my last speech of this parliamentary term, I will take this opportunity to thank my fellow Members."
"For me, this has been my first parliamentary experience and to have had it in this committee has helped me to understand on many occasions that more is done to build Europe in this difficult, regulatory work that has a direct effect on people’s lives rather than in the many, often pointless, debates on the future and meaning of Europe."
"Mr President, the Trans-European Networks have set back rail transport, a symbol of public investment and service that have been the norm for decades and which have featured in epic poems telling of conquests that have enabled access to hitherto uncharted areas."
"The wholesale shift towards liberalisation, like other parallel factors, was bound to reach the railways, in the same way that it has reached education, health and water, establishing the market economy as a single and fundamentalist ideology."
"We do not, out of a sense of nostalgia, want to turn the clock back."
"We do, however, want to help to ensure that the railways and with them public services move into the future in a way that will benefit the community and that they are not motivated solely by financial interests, serving few areas and passing through at high speed."
"Interoperable networks, multimodal links, proper safety, environmental safeguards, real participation and liability of Member States as a crucial part of a rail structure are prerequisites for ensuring that this happens."
"I therefore thank the rapporteurs for their work."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237/2004) by Mr Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision 2000/819/EC on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2001-2005) (COM(2003) 758 – C5-0628/2003 – 2003/0292(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, for his excellent work, which will enable us to adopt this proposal at first reading."
"It is a good example of efficient and constructive cooperation between the institutions."
"The Commission proposal has two main parts."
"On the one hand, it envisages the closure of the Joint European Venture programme and, on the other hand, makes a few changes to the European support mechanism for start-up capital for technology companies, called ETF Start Up."
"This mechanism provides risk capital for launching technology companies."
"The proposed closure of the JEV programme is the result of an evaluation of the programme which concluded that it has not achieved its objectives."
"Demand has decreased and the impact in terms of job creation is limited."
"I think that this proposal sends a clear message that both Parliament and the Commission are prepared to close ineffective programmes that do not achieve their objectives."
"It is better for the Commission to devote its financial and human resources to financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises which have a greater impact, for example the SME guarantee facility and the ETF Start Up mechanism."
"The changes proposed for this support mechanism will make it flexible."
"The changes will improve the availability of funding and start-up capital for companies that are up to ten years old, compared to five years old currently, if they are working in particular sectors such as life sciences."
"This reflects the fact that product development and the experimental phase can be particularly long for those companies and that, during that time, they need access to risk capital in order to continue their business."
"The Commission’s proposal also refers more explicitly to the eligibility of funds invested in companies carrying out research and development activities."
"This highlights the fact that the European support mechanism for start-up capital is open to funds used for small and medium-sized enterprises that are particularly active in research and development."
"I will conclude by saying that these changes to the support mechanism for start-up capital should help in achieving both the Lisbon objectives and the objective of 3% GDP for spending on research and development."
"I am therefore pleased to see that Parliament supports the Commission’s proposal."
"It therefore goes without saying, Mr Rübig, that the Commission accepts all the amendments from the European Parliament, i.e. Amendments Nos 1 to 5."
". Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, working hard and hitting precise targets is what I learnt as a smith, and I am glad that the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and also the Commission – have shown how rapidly and efficiently European legislation can work when there are important matters at stake, and when there is agreement on them."
"The proposal was submitted in December 2003."
"In January, three committees and a rapporteur were instructed by Parliament."
"On April 21 – today – we have found in the trialogue that we agree on this draft legislation, so that, from the first proposal to the entry into force of this important decision for small and medium-size firms, only four months have elapsed."
"We quite simply want this programme to facilitate investments in new technologies and above all in training – and so I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Reding is here, because we think that training, education and further training is an absolutely crucial basis for the success of a company and therefore at the end of the day the creditworthiness of a company and the securities required for receiving credits are also decisively improved by it."
"Our objective is quite simply to secure existing jobs and companies and to create new ones."
"I believe that this programme will enable us to achieve this objective quite efficiently."
"We also acknowledge that we want to promote collaboration, especially between companies – especially the smallest – and at the end of the day also the collaboration between businesses, but also with the organisations that promote them."
"We also believe that the Commission should report to us about the progress, obviously in the first place on the financial effect, but we are also interested in the benchmarks, which are imposed, and the best practice, as to how these programmes will in fact be put into practice, how they will be implemented, how we can learn from various country applications in order to exploit these programmes as optimally and 100% as possible, so that here in this area there is no administrative expenditure included, but that all the money provided – 100% – is passed on directly to the companies through the European Investment Bank ."
"We know that in one of the three programmes, namely JEV, we have not achieved these objectives."
"I would like explicitly to thank the Commission for having had the courage officially to concede this and to say that this is a programme which is not being used to the full."
"However, we would like to use the funds which have become free here appropriately and we know that the subjects of Basel II – guarantees, equity loans and risk capital – will in future be even more the focus of attention."
"So even today I would like to demand from this body - and we will indeed provisionally resolve all this tomorrow in the plenary session - that the subject of Basel II is also taken seriously."
"Here we find that although a study has now been produced which is already recorded by the competent experts internally, with the results of which, however, we are apparently not satisfied, we would also like an impact study, which quite simply shows what problems we are expecting to get through the Basel II legislation, and we would like today to have an impact study by the Commission, and the Council has also insisted that we should get one."
"We would like to know what our finance ministers, what our national states, in the run-up to the introduction of Basel II, would like to do or will have to do, what proposals the various States are developing here, and above all there must be a programme of business re-engineering."
"However, it cannot be the case that we introduce Basel II with billions of euros in costs."
"We would like the opposite."
"We would like a rationalisation project."
"The costs for companies, for banks, must be reduced dramatically, and here everyone is looking to the financial markets supervisors, the finance ministries and the Commission."
"Parliament, too, will also do everything it can to make Basel II a success."
"We would like the Stability Pact, which we have accepted for our Europe, also to be shaped to fit our small businesses, and then they too would be looking at a secure future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Rübig report does not pose any problems."
"It proposes adjusting the financial measures for companies and modifying the multi-annual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for which I was rapporteur."
"I hope that this report finally marks the will of the Commission to take into account the needs of SMEs for risk capital, start-up aid and transfer of business, as you said, Commissioner."
"All of these programmes are still insufficient to achieve the Lisbon objectives, which are nevertheless reaffirmed each year at the Spring Summit."
"I will not elaborate further."
"As this is, however, our last sitting and I will undoubtedly not be in the next Parliament, unfortunately, I would like to emphatically state again what my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and I have always advocated."
"First of all, I hope that the European Charter for small enterprises will finally have legal status."
"Our companies need it to be implemented, as was stated at the Barcelona Summit."
"What is the Commission’s opinion, Commissioner?"
"Secondly, our companies, both small and medium-sized, and whatever their sector, innovative, traditional or small-scale, need access to the research and development programmes."
"This is not an option, but an obligation in order for them to remain competitive, dynamic and effective, as you just said, Commissioner."
"Finally, these companies need advice, cooperation and dialogue."
"There are professional organisations that support these small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Does the Commission intend to consider them as genuine partners when drawing up new programmes?"
"This is how our companies will be able to respond to the challenge of growth and employment, our young people will be able to take on the culture and spirit of enterprise and Europe, finally reunified, will be the most dynamic area in the world so that every citizen can find their place in it."
"Mr President, I would like to say just for the record that Mr Hans-Peter Martin, who is always excited about people signing in without being present, is himself conspicuous by his absence from this night-time session."
"Since those who were due to speak are not present, the debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0235/2004) by Mr van Velzen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable (COM(2004) 96 - C5-0082/2004 - 2004/0025(COD))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, this is a fairly historic moment, because it is now Wednesday evening, and this is the last report on this evening's agenda."
"It is also my last report in this House, because after ten years, I am retiring."
"Not so long ago, the importance of the Lisbon process was discussed once again during the Summit in Brussels."
"If we want to turn Europe into the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society by 2010, there is of course a great deal left to be done."
"As we have already witnessed in the case of Europe 2005, a successful implementation of access to broadband largely relies on the availability of Content."
"Indeed, it is possible to have broadband, but if there is nothing on it, then the public will not exactly be enthusiastic."
"The same applies to advanced services for users of mobile telephony, and I would, for example, refer to the third generation."
"I spent a few weeks in China recently, and it struck me that the Chinese, together with the Japanese and the South Koreans, are already getting excited about fourth-generation mobile telephony."
"What this means, then, is that, in terms of third-generation mobile telephony too, Europe will be lagging ever further behind, as the figures at Nokia testify."
"In this light, the report on Content is extremely important, because it promotes an increase in productivity and innovation, better information products and services; it has a positive impact on Government, another area in which we are trailing behind badly, and it leads to more projects in the areas of Health, Business and Learning."
"I am therefore pleased that the Commissioner is here this evening."
"The Commission's present Content -proposal identifies the obstacles, particularly in the areas of public interest in Europe,and also the areas in which the market is overlooking adequate investments."
"The market cannot do everything and the governments have a just role."
"In the current proposal, conditions are being created for better access to, and better use of, digital content and, where necessary, for greater economic return for services based on access to, and re-use of, digital content."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has tabled 16 amendments to the Commission's proposal."
"By means of these, we want to ensure that the report targets the public sector, that consideration is given to the financial perspectives after 2007, that a budget to the tune of EUR 55 million will be set aside for the years 2005 and 2006, and that the total budget will amount to EUR 163 million."
"In this connection, I should like to take the opportunity of thanking my shadow-rapporteurs, Mrs Gil and Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, for the excellent working relationship we have had."
"It promised to be a good celebration, because the Council, with whom we negotiated, also benefited from completing in one reading, so that we would not face any delays."
"Our basic budget was EUR 163 million."
"The Council, and the Irish Presidency in particular, led us to believe that a deal was within reach if we were to reduce the amount to EUR 145 million."
"As befits good parliamentarians, we ultimately hoped for an amount in the region of 150 million, but, during the informal trialogue, the Irish Presidency responded that the budget should not exceed 120 million and added that, if we were to push a little, we could probably end up with 138 million."
"We indicated that this was insufficient for us and that 140 million was the absolute minimum."
"We subsequently asked the Council Presidency to declare in writing that an agreement was reached on 140 million."
"The deal expired at 1.30 p.m. this afternoon."
"It is characteristic of the Council that I received the following message at 5.11 p.m. I will quote it verbatim, as this will look good in the historical records."
"This is now the third time that we have received the same message from the Council, and each time we ask them to deliver, they respond that they are unable to do so."
"With this amount of, what I would call, uncertainty in the Council, we cannot but conclude that we are about to launch an election campaign."
"That we will be telling the citizens that the Council makes fine promises in Brussels where the Lisbon process in concerned, but as soon as it has to deliver, also in terms of financial means in order to achieve the Lisbon process, the Council fails to come up with the goods and leaves us empty-handed."
"It is extremely regrettable that we, who want to have the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010, and we in this House, are being treated by the Council in this manner."
"I am glad that election campaigns are on the way."
"They will in any event spur me on to take part and to denounce the Council's ambivalence."
"The future is bright."
"Mr President, allow me, before I go into the heart of the matter, to say a personal word to thank the honourable rapporteur, my friend Mr van Velzen, for the work that he has done over the past ten years for the common good and to improve the lives of all Europeans, whatever their background or field, and not only Europeans: I am also thinking of his international and even global work."
"I think that Mr van Velzen has shown what it is to be a good parliamentarian."
"I turn now to the e-content+ programme."
"The Commission aims to launch this programme, as the rapporteur explained, at the beginning of 2005, nearly halfway to the target year for the Lisbon Agenda: 2010."
"We need to improve conditions for innovation by business - notably in certain sectors of the digital content market - and that is why this programme is very relevant to the Lisbon strategy."
"The online digital content market offers significant potential for growth, but it also provides an ideal platform for innovative digital content products and services that transcend national boundaries."
"Imagine, for example, if our public administrations in Europe all collected and stored data and information in the same way and if, on top of that, our citizens were proficient in all the languages of the Union."
"I tried to raise awareness of that with the European Year of Languages, and the process is ongoing: people are learning more and more languages, but we still have a long way to go to reach our goal."
"However, on the Internet we are likely to see many more maps of trans-European highways, waterways and other natural and man-made features, and then we will see large European digital libraries of cultural and scholarly repute."
"We will see much more European digital learning material."
"The reality is that in May 2004 the European Union will encompass 25 Member States, 20 languages, even more cultures, a great many regions and a truly fragmented market for any business intending to develop innovative cross-border digital content products and services."
"This is a situation that should be taken into account when the e-content programme starts in January 2005."
"The outlook might not be as bleak as it appears."
"The recently adopted directive on public sector information aligns legal frameworks in Member States with respect to the re-use of information held by the public sector."
"The difficulties in combining formats and languages can be addressed using today's information technologies, subject to the eContent+ proposal."
"That is why – and I agree completely with the rapporteur – it is so important that this e-content programme should be seen in conjunction with the e-learning programme, since people first have to be taught to utilise the content before it can be of real benefit."
"The proposed programme recommends focusing on clearly fragmented parts of the digital content market in Europe where market forces alone have been insufficient to drive growth, as rightly stated by the rapporteur."
"It targets three domains: spatial or geographical data, educational material, and cultural content."
"The Commission is therefore pleased to note that the amendments to its proposal tabled by the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, improve the proposal."
"We would like to thank him and the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, for their efforts to find a compromise with the Council in an attempt to conclude proceedings at first reading."
"Even if the rapporteur has problems with the Council, he should have none with the Commission because it can accept all the amendments tabled by Parliament."
"Mr President, congratulations are due to Mr van Velzen because he has done excellent work and produced a really good report."
"I was rapporteur for the first e-content report and I can see that Mr van Velzen has worked very hard to try to ensure we give Europe an advantage in e-content."
"As he stated earlier, the US has the world's most advanced digital economy and Europe, with its fragmented markets and smaller media and telecommunication companies, is trying to catch up in terms of quality of content and products."
"Rather than talk about what is in his report, which has been eloquently summarised both by the rapporteur and the Commission, I want to talk about the Council."
"I am extremely concerned about the sort of attitude and approach that the Council has adopted."
"It has stated time and again that it wants to achieve the Lisbon objectives, key among which is the opening-up of opportunities for Europe in the electronic age."
"However, when it comes to the Council putting its money where its mouth is, nothing at all happens."
"As the reporter said, the Council has treated Parliament with complete contempt."
"We have been haggling over figures – 20 million, 30 million, 50 million – because it is unwilling to provide sufficient resources to make this programme happen."
"In a Europe of 25 Member States, adequate resources will be needed if we are to gain a competitive edge over our major competitor, the US, in this area."
"Many high-skill jobs rely on us being able to get our content right and on having this programme and reaching SMEs and other providers."
"It is a great pity that owing to the Council's attitude we have been unable to finalise this initiative."
"It was key for this legislature to do that and have this programme up and running for 2005, and there was real will on Parliament's part to make this happen."
"It is to the detriment of the EU that it has not, and this has been because the Council has been unwilling to pay for it."
"What it is offering at the moment is peanuts in terms of a Union of 25."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who did his utmost to achieve closure, because some of us in other Groups wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal, which was for EUR 165 million."
"That is the amount needed if we are genuinely to deliver on this eContent proposal."
"This failure is not due to a lack of effort on the rapporteur's part."
"I hope that at second reading the Council will get the message that Parliament is not willing to support programmes that are simply piecemeal efforts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.(1)."
"(1)"
"Mr President, as other colleagues have done this week, I too would like to draw the attention of the House to the unusual fact that we were not allowed to make one-minute speeches on Monday."
"I submitted a statement in writing at that time on the issue of Mordechai Vanunu, who was released from jail in Israel yesterday after 18 years' imprisonment."
"He is subject to very severe, cruel and unusual restrictions on his liberty."
"This is not acceptable in a democracy."
"He is not allowed to leave the country, people watch him wherever he goes, he is not allowed to make contact with foreigners and he is not allowed to contact journalists."
"I ask the President to make representations to the Israeli Parliament and Government in support of this person, who served a prison sentence for showing that weapons of mass destruction were being prepared in Israel."
"These are precisely what the forces in Iraq have been seeking; the discrepancy between the way the two countries are treated is simply amazing."
"I ask you, Mr President, to bring this matter to the attention of the President of Parliament, and to ask him to contact the Israeli authorities with a view to allowing this man his liberty."
"He has served his sentence."
"We shall bear this in mind."
"I shall pass this request on to the President."
"Without doubt this is an issue which arouses strong emotions amongst many European citizens of all political persuasions, and I have no doubt that in the future it will be dealt with in Parliament through the appropriate channels."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the outcome of the trial against Leyla Zanay and others in Ankara."
". Mr President, the case of Leyla Zana casts a negative shadow over the implementation of political reforms."
"In a statement made yesterday, the Commission strongly deplored yesterday’s verdict by the Ankara State Security Court confirming the sentencing of Mrs Zana to serve her full prison term until June 2005."
"Let me briefly remind you of the background to this case."
"As part of the political reforms adopted in Turkey in the period 2002/2003, new provisions were introduced in the Turkish legal system allowing for the retrial of persons whose convictions the European Court of Human Rights has found to violate the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"This was a specific priority under the Accession Partnership with Turkey."
"Another priority concerns the need to remedy the situation of those persons prosecuted or sentenced for non-violent expression of opinion."
"Following the introduction of these new provisions, a decision was taken in February 2003, under which Mrs Zana and her three co-defendants were to be retried by the Ankara State Security Court."
"However, in spite of the several sessions held by the Ankara State Security Court, retrial largely resulted in a repetition of the previous trial, leading to persistent concerns about the respect for the rights of the defence and the principle of presumption of innocence, as acknowledged by independent international experts."
"The Commission has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the Turkish authorities in the framework of the political dialogue."
"In our view, while fully respecting the principle of independence of the judiciary, the way this case has been handled shows the gap that exists between the spirit of the reforms and their actual implementation."
"As I mentioned, the trial against Mrs Zana was held at a State Security Court."
"It is worth recalling that, according to the relevant priority under the Accession Partnership, the European Union has repeatedly asked Turkey to align the functioning of the State Security Courts with European standards."
"We note that the abolition of these courts is among the measures envisaged in the next package of legislative reforms announced in Turkey."
"I should also like to point out that in his speech before the Turkish Parliament in January 2004, President Prodi called for the immediate release of Mrs Zana."
"Moreover, the Commission has raised this issue several times in its regular report and within the framework of the political dialogue with the Turkish authorities."
"We understand that the lawyers representing the defendants have announced their intention to refer the case to the Court of Cassation and hope that it will be dealt with in accordance with all the relevant principles of equal justice."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its statement."
"Probably uniquely in this House, I actually knew Leyla Zana before she was tried and convicted."
"I first met her in the late 1980s."
"She is, to put it mildly, a controversial figure."
"Nonetheless the action that she took is perfectly within the realms of democratic expression."
"After all, all she did was to say something in the Kurdish language within her Parliament."
"Mrs Ahern and others sometimes choose to use the Irish language within this Parliament."
"Indeed my Quaestor colleague, Mrs Banotti, did so in her opening speech."
"However, I do not think even the worst enemies of Fine Gael would wish Mrs Banotti to be locked up for 15 years for that."
"There has been complete over-reaction from the very beginning."
"The way in which the trial was conducted was unacceptable and it was thanks to the intervention of the Council of Europe that a retrial was held."
"It is a great disappointment to me and my group that the Turkish judicial authorities did not show themselves to have sufficient flexibility to use this opportunity of having a retrial that would effectively have exonerated Mrs Zana."
"She has been the victim of what is in effect a struggle between a reactionary judiciary and a state that is trying to reform."
"I welcome the packages of reforms that have been adopted and I also welcome the fact that the state security courts are to be abolished."
"This is not before time."
"Some people are indeed working hard for democracy in Turkey, and the AKP deputy Faruk Ünsal spoke out against this particular verdict."
"I hope that in passing in what I think will be a unanimous resolution, supported right across the House, that we can send a message, not to the Turkish Government but to the Turkish judiciary, to be realistic, to get up to date and, for a change, to support their government in trying to restore respect for the Turkish judiciary within Turkey."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply disappointed by the decision in the case of Leyla Zana."
"I, too, am far from agreeing with all her views; to judge by her latest letter – which I have here – to, among others, Javier Solana and President Prodi, her assessment of Öçalan and of the PKK’s successor organisations is perhaps somewhat naive, rather exaggerated or understated, depending on your chosen way of putting it, but – as has already been said – none of these things are reasons for someone to be locked up for many years and their sentence confirmed in the teeth of rulings by European courts."
"I entirely agree with the Commissioner that this shows that there is still a great discrepancy between a parliamentary decision in favour of reforms, and those reforms being implemented."
"That is not to be taken as criticism of the government, which, as I see it, has, in so far as it has been able to do so, made quite plain its interest in a different decision on Leyla Zana being reached."
"We really do, though, have to urge, beg, or urgently petition the government to really put its whole weight behind the reforms in order to push them through, especially in the justice system, for I do think we will have major problems if the government proposes the right things, if the parliament backs them up, but the necessary democratic practices are not in place in the administration or in the law courts to make them happen."
"This government, too, when decisions are taken in December, is sure to have the charge laid at its door that too little has been done by way of implementation and that too little effort is being made to bring Turkey’s administration and its justice system up to modern European standards."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its extremely strong and clear statement on the unfortunate Zana case."
"During the recent Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting in Turkey, we brought up the issue of the Leyla Zana trial, as we always do."
"Justice Minister Cicek promised us that in the next package of constitutional reforms, which I think is to be published this week, the State Security Courts would be scrapped."
"This is, of course, first-class news because these courts do not contribute to justice; they do not contribute to security."
"The Turkish Government fully appreciates the political importance of the Zana case for the European Parliament."
"As a strong Turkophile, let me be quite clear that, if Leyla Zana and her colleagues are not released soon, it will be impossible for Turkey's closest friends to argue that accession negotiations should be opened from December."
"No country can seriously contemplate European membership with nearly six thousand prisoners of conscience, no matter how controversial those people prove to be."
"Mr President, yesterday morning I was in Ankara at the hearing during which the 15-year sentence of Leyla Zana and three other ex-DEP MPs was confirmed."
"Among the many serious aspects of this trial that have already been mentioned by fellow Members and the Commission representative, whom I thank, what matters is the very fact that the 1994 sentence has been confirmed."
"The Strasbourg Court condemned the 1994 trial because it was illegal in many respects and called for a new trial to take place."
"The sentence is not based on the proceedings of this trial, but explicit reference is made to the 1994 sentence."
"The behaviour of the State Security Court in Ankara not only affronted the European Union but also the Strasbourg Court."
"I attended all of the trial hearings: the right to defence was breached in a most blatant manner; more specifically – and to keep it short – the defence was denied any possibility of objectively replying to claims made by the prosecution witnesses."
"By the way it acted throughout the 14 hearings, the Court was only concerned with protecting the 1994 sentence."
"I will not add any more general comments since I agree with what has been said by those Members who spoke before me."
"In October, the European Commission will put forward its proposal on whether or not to open, and if so when, the negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"Having also listened to the Commissioner, I believe that the European Commission’s assessment will be a conscientious one. Having heard my fellow Members, I also believe that the future Parliament will conscientiously assess the advisability or otherwise of opening negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union or whether to open them immediately."
"At the moment, frankly, the conditions for opening negotiations do not exist."
"Mr President, sadly the outcome of yesterday's verdict came as no surprise."
"Those who have been involved in this matter over the past months and years have been able to see with their own eyes that this trial was a farce."
"The judges and especially the public prosecutor had absolutely no interest in properly reinvestigating the old evidence from 1994."
"And in this trial the defence once again had no opportunity to call new witnesses who wanted to put forward contrary evidence."
"This was a copy of a bad trial, and the result of a bad trial is a bad verdict."
"But one thing should be quite clear: this says less about the government's attitude to reform than about the stubborn resistance of conservatives."
"These judges, yesterday's judges, wanted to show who is boss."
"Their answer is clear: we are the bosses, not the European Parliament or the European Commission in Brussels, and not the Government in Ankara either: we are the ones who decide what will happen in this case."
"I think that the only way the Government can limit the damage it has undoubtedly suffered in connection with its request to start negotiations in December is to show that this is an exception to the rule."
"That rule must remain the same: reforms on paper must be put into practice."
"Two examples."
"There has already been mention of the plans – and I emphasise the word 'plans' – to abolish State Security Courts."
"I should like to call on the Government to make haste in this matter, not to drag things out, and to ensure that these courts are actually abolished by December."
"The second example, highly symbolic of course in this context, is the use of the Kurdish language, which we should remember was where this whole issue started."
"On paper, once again on paper, the use of this language is permitted, but in practice there are still numerous administrative hurdles."
"So it is very important that by the end of the year the Kurdish language can actually be used in the education system and in the media."
"Finally, for those who have concluded solely on the basis of this matter that negotiations should not start, I would like to remind you of what Ms Zana herself said."
"In a letter to the European Parliament she said: I would rather be in prison in a country that is negotiating with the European Union than free in a country on which Europe has turned its back."
"Mr President, I would like to support the fine rhetoric of my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk."
"I would prefer Ms Leyla Zana to be at liberty in a country that is negotiating with the European Union."
"That is actually the only option which I find acceptable."
"It is in fact very rare for someone to have spent so long in prison and to have held the Sakharov prize for almost as long."
"The situation is quite extraordinary."
"It is also very unusual for the European Union to have continued proceeding on a 'business as usual' basis for so long."
"This cannot continue."
"We must make more of a nuisance of ourselves, exert more pressure so that this pressure can in turn be exerted on the opposing forces in Turkey."
"The old state philosophy, the old type of Kemalism, still holds considerable sway as can be seen in this trial."
"Those in charge are themselves supporters of this old philosophy and of course time and again come to the same conclusion."
"I agree with other Members who have already taken the floor and made the point that the unusual feature here is that the Government, as we must recognise, is doing its best and has adopted some dramatic legal reforms."
"The Government was behind the change allowing trials to be reopened, in particular."
"It also introduced the option to free someone from prison, but this is not used: the legislation is either not used at all or not used properly."
"I believe that we must persuade our own governments of this."
"It is not just a question of isolated symptoms, like the serious case of Leyla Zana and her associates."
"It is a consequence of a more profound question which we must discuss with Turkey."
"I would also add that in my opinion it is essential to build up contacts between European judges and public prosecutors and their Turkish counterparts in order to change attitudes, as the wrong attitude can take us down the wrong track time after time, falling into the trap of nationalistic hatred against minorities caused by the fear that they could undermine the integrity of the State."
"For these reasons I think that we must press for the existing opportunities to be used to free Ms Leyla Zana and others imprisoned for similar so-called offences in anticipation of reform of the entire legal process."
"Mr President, I wished to speak because I naturally find the result of this trial unacceptable."
"It has been restarted twice."
"The Supreme Court, at the request of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, has restarted the trial."
"The verdict is identical."
"We could not be more disappointed and, faced with such confusion, there is nothing more to say."
"I went to see Leyla Zana in 1995 at her prison in Ankara, with the other Kurdish prisoners, prisoners of conscience, we must remember."
"It was the year when the Customs Union was to be voted on."
"I was very confused and said to myself that maybe I should give Turkey a chance, since I was in favour of its accession in the future."
"I therefore went to the country to learn about its evolution, which I wanted to give a chance by voting for the Customs Union."
"I thought that maybe this would have an effect on respect for human rights, respect for minorities and freedom of expression."
"Of course, I must recognise today that, unfortunately, things have hardly developed in a positive way."
"I am, nevertheless, Mr President, in favour of Turkey entering the European Union."
"I am, however, sorry that Turkey continues to violate human rights and I insist that a considerable effort be made. Otherwise I fear that accession is in a bad way."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision in the court case against Leyla Zana shows beyond doubt that Turkey is not yet ready negotiate its accession to the EU."
"Unaffected by the official reforms in Turkey, the court is doing things the way they were done in the old days, so anyone who had attended the hearings – as I did – could conclude that the initial judgment, founded upon one sentence spoken in Kurdish and harshly criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, would be upheld."
"Turkey could have used the trial as a means of demonstrating that its reforms of the justice system exist not only on paper."
"This was not, in the final analysis, about the minutiae of the law, but about a woman whose fate had become a symbol of the failure of Turkish politics and Turkish justice, a woman whose trial was a test of how seriously reforms were being taken."
"Neither that, nor the fact that the eyes of the world were upon them, could induce the court to conduct a trial in accordance with the rule of law."
"Let me ask you this, then: if even the case of Leyla Zana cannot bring about change in the Turkish legal system, how are reforms to be implemented at all?"
"In principle – and let me make this clear – I am in favour of Turkey joining the EU, provided that it meets the relevant conditions."
"Turkey has known for years that there must be drastic change in it if it is to have a prospect of acceding, but yesterday’s judgment shows that the willingness to do so is still not yet present, and so the EU must now, at last, cut short all this talk about the commencement of accession negotiations being imminent."
"Those who, in the aftermath of this ruling, continue to insist that accession negotiations will be possible in six months’ time, show only their indifference to the Copenhagen criteria and their interest in the implementation of strategic objectives to the exclusion of all else."
"Far from it; the fact remains that the criteria for accession to the EU have been laid down and must still be met."
"For as long as Turkey ignores that fact, there can be no accession negotiations."
". Mr President, I do not have many comments to make about the various contributions."
"I just wish to say that the independence of the judiciary is perverted when the very structure, performance and culture of part of the judiciary itself negate basic democratic principles."
"This is comparable to the situation in Guantanamo."
"It is not good enough."
"We therefore welcome the proposed abolition of the state security courts, and the Commission will attach due importance to this issue in our report on Turkey in October."
"To end this debate, I have received 5 motions for resolutions, in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:"
"– A5-0280/2004 by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Recommendation of the Commission relating to the 2004 updating of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States and the Community (period 2003-2005) (COM(2004) 238 – C5-0183/2004 – 2004/2020(INI)), and"
"– A5-0277/2004 by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposed Decision of the Council relating to the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (COM(2004) 239 – C5-0188/2004 – 2004/0082(CNS))."
"Employment results today constitute a key element of the principal objective of Lisbon, set in 2000."
"As you surely know, this objective is the following. I quote: ‘making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’."
"We must not forget that Europe has already made considerable progress as we have created six million jobs on the European continent since 1999."
"That being the case, it is clear that, despite this progress, Europe will not reach the intermediary quantitative objective: to reach an employment rate of 67% by 2005."
"Today, a major French newspaper used the headline ‘Europe’s growth at a standstill’, growth that will only reach 1.7%."
"This is the reason why, faced with the observation that the economy is slowing down, we must bring everything into play, and it is the duty of the European Union to react."
"It is in this context that Mr Wim Kok’s report was produced."
"This report stressed that there was an urgent need for practical action, by putting in place some decisive measures on a fiscal, social, environmental, research and innovation level in order particularly, in all areas, to create jobs, taking into account, of course, globalisation and the problems linked to the ageing of the population."
"This requires to a great extent a rapid reaction and good management of the change."
"This is why we have a duty to choose this change in order not to be subjected to it."
"This is why, in my report, I wished to insist on the practical implementation of the employment guidelines."
"Firstly, it is advisable to improve the reaction capacity of businesses and their employees."
"This requires an adaptation through an increase in levels of human capital and a policy of life-long training, which should be encouraged."
"This also requires active encouragement of the creation of businesses, particularly small businesses."
"It is in this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 7 of the report) that Europe must support networks and partnerships, for example platforms of excellence that link small businesses, research centres, universities and private businesses."
"Secondly, there is cause to mobilise the working population, indeed the entire population."
"In this spirit, I recommend (this is the subject of Amendment 5) making the employment of young people a great European cause."
"Thirdly, it is advisable to launch a huge European plan against de-industrialisation."
"In this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 6), it is certainly important that the European Union support the most disadvantaged regions without neglecting the development of the most dynamic areas."
"This is the subject of Amendment 5."
"Fourthly, very specific guidance, intended to improve governance."
"This is, in fact, the conclusion of the Wim Kok report."
"Improved governance, meaning the need to mobilise all of the players – national parliaments, regional and local players, social partners, trade unions and associations, but also businesses – and also to facilitate, in this spirit, improved access to the structural funds."
"Until now, Europe has supported the policies of the Member States, but in a spirit of assistance, by adopting a policy of what I would like to call assistance in the form of a crutch, but not in a spirit of economic dynamism."
"I think that if it is advisable to keep in mind the need to support the most disadvantaged regions, Europe must both show overtly, and demonstrate, to the outside world its ability to be dynamic."
"Community financing policy must be established in this spirit of economic dynamism."
"This is very specifically what I would like to say."
"Furthermore, Mr President, I am sorry that, following the votes that took place yesterday, which were on such important issues as the environmental life cycle, tyres, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée – all votes of great consequence – we are obliged to discuss employment policy now, and, moreover, without the Council."
"I am sorry about the conditions under which we have had to produce this report, given the ambiguity that surrounds it."
"Indeed, you are producing a report on the guidelines, a legislative report, but you cannot amend it because the guidelines have been fixed for the past three years, as if the environmental context, the international, sociological, financial and fiscal context of this matter, were not changing."
". – Mr President, this House has always demanded that economic, employment, social and finance policies should be coordinated and considered as a whole, in order to provide the European Union with a coherent strategy for growth, employment and society."
"We think it right that we should be doing as we now are and considering these broad economic policy guidelines not merely over a year, but over a longer period."
"That does not, however, mean that we do not have to take a very practical and critical look at these guidelines and at the need to adapt to changes in growth and employment."
"We can see very clearly that the European economy is continuing to lose its strength, and that, within the eurozone, recovery, where it has occurred or has had a beneficial influence on growth, is primarily attributable to a steep rise in exports, while domestic demand has sunk as a result of low levels of private consumption over several quarters."
"That must surely give us cause for concern, and so we want to consider and reformulate these broad economic policy guidelines in such a way as to stimulate economic growth and enable it to become more sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms."
"Only if all the Member States keep to what has been agreed will this be possible."
"I will now reiterate Parliament’s criticism to the effect that many Member States are not keeping to their commitment on the Lisbon strategy of combining and bundling all measures aimed at creating truly sustainable growth and also enhancing competitiveness."
"This is why I believe that the policy guidelines must be targeted even more than before at stimulating economic growth by way of investment and job creation, thus bringing about a rise in productivity."
"While the Growth Initiative, with this as its end, is surely to be welcomed, the guidelines should also express in clear and definite terms a concentration on human resources, research and development, and innovation, as well as on an industry policy that particularly prioritises small and medium-sized enterprises, renewable energies and environmentally-friendly technologies."
"Although the environmental technologies action plan must be implemented, we must not forget the need to invest in social infrastructure, for there will be no increase in productivity if we do not make work and family more compatible and thereby increase the number of women in work."
"This I do regard as a very important measure; it cannot be too much stressed that this is an area in which many Member States must make much more of an effort."
"Nor is the funding of growth-promoting investments any more adequate, and we should also be including in the broad economic policy guidelines coordinating measures to combat unfair tax competition and tax evasion."
"Indeed, the spending envisaged in the present Quick Start programme and in the Growth Initiative will take us no further than that, as all the economic research institutions are of course right to state that no investment under 1% of gross domestic product will have the desired effect, in particular, the positive effect hoped for on the vast mass of people in the European Union – over 14 million of them – who are unemployed."
"The broad economic policy guidelines must continue to focus on social and regional cohesion and on convergence in real terms, but there must be greater clarity as to which policy mix will actually prove successful, as we need strong synergy effects between, on the one hand, the necessary structural reforms and, on the other, investment and macro-economic policies aimed at stability and growth."
"This, of course, is where intelligent use of a more flexible Stability and Growth Pact is called for."
"Transparency and participative implementation of the Lisbon strategy are not just lofty ideals; these approaches really do promise a great deal in terms of using reform partnerships as a means of implementing the Lisbon strategy."
"It is my belief that such partnerships for change must concern themselves with economic, social and environmental issues across the board if the Lisbon strategy is to be improved and moulded into a more political form."
"Affirming, as I do, the spirit of Lisbon, I believe that this is the most comprehensive strategy for the purpose of mastering the problems of the European Union, but we must, of course, respond to economic change by updating these guidelines every year, which, as we can see, is becoming more and more necessary."
"Any reform of the structural funds must also take into account the importance of forging a link between the economic policy guidelines and the structural funds and the use made of them."
"Moreover, the whole must be formulated in such a way that all the partners really are compelled to make the connection in the interests of sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be taking part in your debate today on economic policy and employment policy."
"This debate is being held in response to the update of the broad economic policy guidelines and the Commission's 2004 report on the employment strategy."
"I should like to congratulate in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mrs Hermange on their reports."
"The adoption by the Commission of the so-called package of guidelines, a package which jointly covers the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies, is proof yet again that streamlining bears fruit."
"Streamlining has resulted not only in the update of the economic policy and employment policy coordination circuits of the European Union, but also in stronger complementarity and cohesion between these two basic procedures."
"The core objective of streamlining, of coordination of the policies, was to increase their efficiency, by placing more emphasis on application than on the annual drafting of guidelines."
"Both the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies were adopted with a three-year perspective."
"It was clear right from the outset that the guidelines must be amended only in order to take account of important developments."
"Within this framework, as there are no important developments, the three-year guidelines must remain stable this year."
"By maintaining a stable strategy, we shall be able to improve how we project and forecast the impact of European Union policies and ensure that they continue and are efficient."
"I should like first to comment on the broad economic policy guidelines."
"The Commission considers that the overall political strategy laid down in these guidelines continues to apply."
"Emphasis was placed in the 2004 update on incorporating the 10 new countries within the framework of the coordination of our policies."
"I should like to comment in greater detail on these two aspects, taking account also of certain comments made in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The European Commission has confirmed the Community's medium-term strategic economic policy laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003-2005."
"This strategy has three main axes: macro-economic policies predicated on development and stability, economic reforms to increase development potential and policies to reinforce sustainability."
"This package of policies focuses on the contribution which economic policies can make towards achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"The reasons for continuing the existing strategy and for achieving progress are obvious."
"First, economic developments are in keeping with the expectations which applied when the Council issued the present broad economic policy guidelines last year."
"As stated in our new economic forecasts, the economies of the European Union are in the process of recovery, which is expected to consolidate."
"Of course, I have taken note of what Mrs Randzio-Plath said earlier about concerns about recovery and growth and Mrs Hermange's comments in today's publication about the stagnation in the economy and growth."
"In all events, the general framework of macro-economic policy is not negative."
"I should like – and I think that we must – emphasise that we need to take pains to give new impetus to financial restructuring once the recovery has progressed and we must not make mistakes, as has happened on previous occasions when the short-term economy has been sound."
"Secondly, in order to strengthen both potential growth and the endurance of the economy, decisive application of the objectives we have set for structural reforms is required."
"In the first evaluation of the application of the present broad guidelines in January, the Commission recognised that some progress had been made."
"It did, however, also become clear that more progress with the reforms is needed in order not to jeopardise the achievement of the Lisbon objectives."
"The 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines focuses on integrating the new Member States within the framework of the coordination of our economic policies."
"It is positive that in Mrs Randzio-Plath's report and in the motion for a resolution you express your support for this objective."
"The economic challenges which the new Member States face do not differ materially from those which the current Member States face, they are just bigger."
"Our medium-term economic strategy is in a position to address the challenges of the acceding countries."
"The synergy created from the interaction of macro-economic policies and the necessary structural reforms will result in gradual convergence between these countries."
"This – gradual convergence – is the most important challenge which the acceding countries face."
"As far as the 2004 guidelines for employment policies are concerned, I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, for the dynamic way in which they prepared the European Parliament's opinion on the guidelines."
"It is very positive that the issues addressed in the report all relate to the four basic policy sectors, as set out by the European Employment Task Force and in the 2004 joint report on employment, which were confirmed by the spring European Council, namely: improving the adaptability of workers and businesses, attracting more people to the work place, improving the quality of employment and investing in human resources."
"I consequently consider that, materially, we are on the same wavelength, we have the same concerns and the same priorities for action in coming years."
"It is also important that you emphasised the need for stricter assessment of the performance of the Member States, in order to give impetus to the application of the strategy on employment."
"I shall refer very briefly to the Commission proposal for the 2004 guidelines for employment."
"The Commission proposes maintaining the guidelines as adopted by decision of the Council last July."
"As part of our joint efforts to streamline the economic policy and employment policy circuits of the European Union, the guidelines for employment policies, like the broad economic policy guidelines, follow a three-year cycle."
"The reform of the policy on employment carried out last year aimed to address better the basic challenges of the job market in the European Union, in order to respond to the Lisbon objectives for 2010."
"This reform emphasised the medium-term approach and the definition of a framework policy which would take account of the diversity which prevails in the enlarged European Union."
"The joint report on employment on which the European Employment Task Force under the chairmanship of Mr Kok agreed, highlighted the need to emphasise the monitoring of the reforms which the Member States undertook to implement, rather than becoming involved in a procedure of further amendments to the guidelines."
"Similarly, the spring European Council confirmed the need identified in the joint report on employment for the procedure on employment to focus the following year on evaluating progress."
"The main issue in the next joint report on employment must therefore be the Member States' response to the special recommendations for each country."
"This means that these recommendations must be at the epicentre of the national action plans submitted by the Member States, both the current fifteen and the new Member States, in the autumn of 2004."
"Finally, may I assure you that the European Commission expresses its satisfaction with the constructive approach by the European Parliament, which has focused its amendments on the recitals."
"The European Commission, during further negotiations with the Council, will also take account of and will support those amendments which improve certain recitals."
"I am absolutely convinced that the immense challenge which we face in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives by 2010 makes it necessary for us to focus 100% on application, by translating the challenges into political action."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Hermange for her report – I shall focus on employment – and also the Commissioner for his statement this morning."
"Mrs Hermange has the correct approach: we are not seeking to amend the detail of the structure of the guidelines."
"When we agreed to the streamlining of the economic and employment guidelines last year, we implicitly agreed not to unpack the guidelines themselves until 2006 – the mid-point."
"That is the right approach: we need that stability in the guideline structure."
"However, we must acknowledge that we need to focus ever more upon the implementation of both the economic guidelines and in particular, perhaps, the employment guidelines."
"The problem lies there: Member States are not implementing the guidelines properly."
"Therefore, we have introduced a number of recitals that seek to focus upon key areas of implementation."
"For example, Amendment 1 concentrates on research and development."
"With the streamlining of the broad economic and employment guidelines we have every right to expect a comprehensive European framework for investment in lifelong learning, research and development and infrastructure to create a European Union engine for growth and to transform that growth into full and better employment and more social cohesion."
"That is what the Lisbon process is about and we are falling far short of that at the moment."
"In our Amendment 2 we focus on a couple of issues highlighted by the Employment Task Force – the Kok report – namely adaptability and lifelong learning."
"They are there in the employment guidelines."
"However, we must acknowledge that in all the national plans, to a greater or lesser extent, there are failures in achieving the targets laid down in those respects."
"Amendment 3 concerns taking possession of the delivery of guidelines by national parliaments, social partners, NGOs, and local and regional authorities."
"We need to encourage those tiers of government to take possession of the guidelines and ensure their proper implementation."
"I particularly welcome Mrs Hermange's Amendment 6 on better harnessing of the structural funds for delivery of the guidelines."
"I also welcome Amendment 7 to encourage companies to better anticipate economic, technical and industrial change."
"Throughout this mandate, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has insisted on a proactive approach to the management of industrial change."
"She is right to make that call."
"Finally, I know that Mr Bushill-Matthews intends to table an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce."
"We would be happy to accept such an amendment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for a sterling piece of work."
"I wish in particular to recognise Mrs Randzio-Plath’s solid work on this report."
"She has also done some sterling work for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Your chairmanship, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has been characterised by impartiality, knowledge and professionalism."
"I am quite sure that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will miss you."
"Thank you."
"The EU economy still suffers major problems."
"Overall growth has not achieved the rate we had desired and expected."
"Even if the American economy is improving all the time, many problems remain."
"The double deficit and the political uncertainty are undermining economic strength."
"Nor is growth in the eurozone impressive."
"We are well aware of the current figures."
"When it comes to the EU of the Fifteen, it emerges that the countries concerned have greater economic strength, with growth of 2% this year and 2.4% next year."
"Things are significantly better in the new Member States, with growth of 3.5% this year and, on average, 4% next year."
"Those are figures we can virtually only dream about in the EU of the Fifteen."
"We know that the changes in the new Member States have been very far-reaching and often painful."
"The trend is manifestly in the right direction, even if a number of objections may be raised and caution recommended in the manner, for example, of today’s statement by the International Monetary Fund."
"The EU of the Fifteen should be able to learn more from the new Member States with a view to giving impetus to the economy."
"The competition and the increasing market that is now opening up are to everyone’s advantage."
"Instead of criticising countries like Slovakia and Estonia which have reduced their taxes and in that way created room for growth, we should see what we can learn from their having done this."
"Above all, it would be devastating if, in an attempt to standardise and direct the national economies, the EU were to force the new countries to introduce tax increases and extensive welfare reforms at a rate that they themselves are not in favour of."
"Certainly, competition will become tougher."
"It has done so already."
"Corporation tax in the new Member States is lower than in our own countries, but healthy competition is to be welcomed."
"There is still a need for structural reforms in quite a few of the Member States."
"We know who the sinners are, and the list of these will unfortunately become longer."
"The Netherlands and Great Britain are next to be added."
"Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, we think that this has operated well."
"It is already flexible."
"Certainly, the rules can be reviewed, but"
"We Liberals believe that Europe can extricate itself from these economic problems but, if it is to do so, more must be done."
"The Lisbon process must be implemented in full."
"The Liberal recipe for enabling the EU Member States to obtain growth and more jobs involves sound public finances, increased competition, completion of the internal market in all its aspects and structural reforms for the future."
"We shall not support the extra amendments in Mrs Randzio-Plath’s report, but we are prepared to support the rapporteur’s balanced assessment."
"Mr President, we face huge challenges in Europe, but the opportunities in the new Europe are so much greater."
"Peace, freedom, democracy and social and economic stability now dominate Europe."
"Mr President, we agree that things are going very badly for Europe."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath’s excellent report documents how dreadfully bad matters look."
"That applies particularly to Europe and not to the whole world."
"It must therefore have something to do with specifically European conditions."
"I am among those who believe that it has to do with the Stability and Growth Pact and with the policy linked to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"As long as the pact prevails, there is little help to be found."
"We have a low level of investment and a lack of growth and dynamism, meaning in actual fact that we have a surplus of capital."
"This capital then has to leave Europe in order to find more profitable investment opportunities."
"We also have a tragic surplus of labour in the form of people who are unemployed."
"I do not believe we can break this pattern unless we also abandon the Stability and Growth Pact and, instead, begin to think in terms of public investment as practised in the Keynesian tradition."
"It is nowadays forbidden to talk about Keynes, but I think it incredibly important to begin to debate Keynes and post-Keynesianism."
"The fact that this is not being done must be due to a kind of ideological block."
"I cannot see how it could be otherwise."
"Our having a sound employment policy does not help much as long as those with education and qualifications are not given jobs."
"Companies do not want them."
"We need to pin our hopes on public investment."
"I believe, above all, that we are concerned here not only with infrastructure but also, to a large extent, with the consumption of public services."
"This needs to be increased."
"I also believe – and this is another matter that is not allowed to be discussed – that there is a place for reducing working hours in order to get more people into work."
"We should then obtain a better balance and be able to increase work productivity."
"Such measures are needed if we are to get anywhere, but as long as neo-liberal politics dominates, matters will, unfortunately, continue to go badly for Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, my fellow Members will not be surprised if I tell you straightaway that I am in almost complete disagreement with my esteemed Liberal fellow Member’s intervention."
"I think that, at the end of this legislature, it is time to briefly take stock of economic policy in the European Union."
"Economic policy includes a Lisbon agenda whose philosophy we could certainly share, but whose implementation is, in fact, deeply unbalanced, since it concentrates on the liberalisation of the sectors and neglects the social and environmental objectives included in the agenda."
"There is, however, another part that is definitely lacking, and this is macroeconomic policy at European Union level, which, if it exists at all, does so only through a Stability and Growth pact."
"The policy that has been followed in recent years, particularly by France and Germany, has consisted of making an effort in relation to budgetary policy, in an attempt to reduce deficits and debt at the same time as decreasing public revenue, in the hope that this can all be resolved by an increase in growth."
"This scenario did not work."
"We have very weak growth, increasing unemployment and an increase in disparity in income between different social groups, with no reduction in exclusion and poverty, in one of the richest regions of the world."
"I think that there are alternatives."
"These have been discussed within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but without success, or at least without achieving a majority."
"There are alternatives that consist, in particular, of making efforts in relation to supply, certainly, but also substantial efforts in relation to spending."
"Is it normal that European savings should be financing an increase in military spending in the United States?"
"I formulate the problem in these terms, which is how it must be formulated."
"There is, therefore, room for a relaunched neo-Keynesian policy, which relies fully on the size of the internal market within the context of a Union of twenty-five and on the need to increase public and private investments."
"Maybe the growth initiative is moving in the right direction, but it is inadequate in terms of both quantity and quality."
"We need to coordinate the budgetary policies of the Member States and the social and environmental convergence rules, particularly concerning working conditions, salary progression – yes, salary progression – and the environment."
"Finally, I would like to end on the fiscal issue."
"It is a point we have discussed at great length."
"I would simply like to tell Mr Schmidt that I was struck by a French Press Agency dispatch, a statement by the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, which said that if the candidate countries continued to decrease corporate tax as they were doing, it would no longer be possible to agree to finance these candidate countries through the structural funds."
"We would do well to think about this kind of observation, and I maintain – and I am weighing my words carefully here – that those who do not want to subject corporate tax to the system of qualified majority voting laid down in the European Constitution are irresponsible and will have to face ever harsher scenarios of fiscal competition, which will unravel our systems of social protection."
"Madam President, last Tuesday Mr Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, gave a speech about the European economy."
"He appeared to be very concerned at the slow recovery of economic growth."
"I share that concern, as growth is taking too long to appear."
"A passive attitude will do nothing to encourage growth."
"We need action, and that is just what we do not see."
"According to Mr Trichet – and I agree with him – we agree in Europe as to our diagnosis, but – and here I go further than Mr Trichet – our political input is not producing solutions."
"I want to urge the Member States to overlook their differences once and for all and take action."
"Countries like China and India will miss no opportunity to forge ahead of us."
"Action will be hard and demand political sacrifices, but waiting longer would be irresponsible."
"Madam President, I would like to confine my remarks to the Hermange report, and start by saying this is not the speech that I had intended to make."
"I had hoped to be in a position to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report."
"It was an excellent report but by the time it came out of our committee earlier this week a lot of the more excellent parts of it were unfortunately removed."
"What is left is still very useful, very positive, but it is a pale shadow of the excellent and very thorough work that she had put in."
"Unfortunately her amendments were voted out by the PSE Group who were there in strength on Monday."
"Unfortunately, apart from herself and one other Group Vice President from the PPE-DE Group, I was the only representative of our Group there."
"I have no quibble with the Socialists for what they did in pursuing their agenda."
"They happen to believe they are right in saying there should be no legislative changes and I am not going to debate that particular point now."
"I congratulate them for their single-mindedness and the efficiency with which they pursued it."
"However, I do say to our colleagues, particularly our absent colleagues from this side of the House, that if we care about employment, as we do; if we care about unemployment, as we do; if we care about the social injustice that flows from unemployment, as we do; then we must be prepared to make this area a priority."
"Although there is work simultaneously in other Committees, we have to make certain that we can stand up to be counted, so that our view may prevail in these meetings and so that we can drive change."
"Change is important on the issues of employment guidelines;"
"I was delighted that the Commissioner again reinforced the importance of the Lisbon Agenda, to which all sides of the House have agreed."
"However, if we are to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, it is not good enough simply to say that the guidelines will not change before 2006."
"Similarly, it is not good enough to say it is entirely up to Member States to make changes and implement the guidelines."
"The guidelines need to be strengthened and refocused and there is a lot of work both to do and to undo in this House in order to give more impetus to the Lisbon process."
"Finally, I would like to thank Stephen Hughes for saying that he is in full agreement of an oral amendment, which I believe the rapporteur will also support, concerning the importance of elderly people, which I will be proposing later this morning."
"I am delighted to have that agreement; I hope that augurs well for our relationship in the coming mandate."
"I know that Stephen Hughes hopes to be back;"
"I also hope to be back, but next time with more support."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many months the Group of the Party of European Socialists has been calling for an adaptation of the Stability and Growth Pact to the economic cycles."
"On different occasions, I have been able to develop, on behalf of my group, specific proposals to reform the Pact in order to turn it into the instrument of a European policy of growth and stability."
"Thus, we recommend greater stringency when the economic climate is good."
"It would be a case of, for example, requiring the Member States to have a balanced budget when growth exceeds, let us say, 3%, even if it allows them greater infrastructural spending flexibility at the time of an economic turnaround."
"Our objective is the transposition of the British golden rule to European level."
"The Christian Social Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has just taken up the Socialist proposals again."
"In an interview for the newspaper , he recommends that the Pact should be more flexible when the economic climate is poor and stricter when the economic climate is good."
"At the recent Ecofin Council, the theory that it would be necessary to reform the Pact in 2005 gained ground."
"The Socialists will bring their constructive participation to this necessary reform, but Mr Juncker will have difficulty persuading his colleagues in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who demonstrate almost religious dogmatism in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In fact, stability without growth will only increase the economic and social problems of the European Union."
"In this respect, I recommend that you read the paper of Professor Jean-Paul Fitoussi for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"This paper broadly demonstrates that the Stability and Growth Pact has slowed, and continues to slow, growth in Europe."
"The Pact is particularly harmful to the large European economies, whose economic activity depends more on internal stimulation than that of the small countries, who depend more on external demand."
"This certainly explains the fact that the small countries seem more virtuous in relation to stability than the large countries, whether the large countries are governed by the left or the right."
"Stability and Growth Pact reform is, therefore, not a question of politicking, but rather a vital necessity for a Europe that is losing the fight for growth and employment."
"Madam President, allow me to address a final word of thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath will no longer be part of the next Parliament, which saddens me greatly."
"With her, we will lose a woman who was committed to the euro, to a social Europe and to a Europe of growth and employment."
"I think that I speak on behalf of all our fellow Members in thanking her publicly for her work at the head of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Thank you, Mr Goebbels, for the words that you have just addressed to our fellow Member, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who has worked so hard within this Parliament and in the service of Europe."
"Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"I too, Madam President, would like to take the opportunity during these last sittings to congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath on her work and to offer her my friendship again, as well as Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels and the others."
"We have not only deplored the European Union’s situation of profound underemployment and weak growth, but we have sought to build an economic policy at European Union level."
"In order to overcome the various obstacles, I too would like, moreover, now to put forward some political objectives."
"The first is that we must first of all seize the opportunity that enlargement offers."
"The new Member States want growth and they need solidarity."
"Just like us, and even more so, it is in their interest that the enlarged Europe be a much more dynamic region of the world."
"The fears of the West must, therefore, be dispelled and common interest built, which means that positive mobility, restructuring and specialisation strategies that enable human and productive capacities in the East and the West to be increased are essential."
"How, though, are these to be brought about?"
"The second objective is to create new options in the debate on structural reforms."
"How can investment be encouraged?"
"Two ways are possible."
"Only the first of these is being used at the moment: the drawing power of capital for high profitability, with fiscal and statutory competition."
"Failure is inevitable."
"Another way is to be opened up."
"Indeed, we must issue the challenge of a new mixed economy, a mixed economy of multinational cooperation, founded on policies of partnership and networks."
"This is the structural reform that Europe needs and that we will have to devise."
"The third objective is the renewal of the macroeconomic framework."
"The Lisbon strategy chose good objectives and a good driving force, but its guidelines are still very ambiguous and it has not found the tools to work with."
"The greatest ambiguity reigns as regards its interpretation."
"National policies differ."
"The redefinition of this policy must be at the heart of the agenda of the next few years, particularly in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I think that with a good European budget and fiscal harmonisation, we would indeed be in a better position to resolve the problems relating to the reduction of national public deficits."
"Finally, my last point is a question of method."
"The Member States have got an absolute nerve: they do not respect the Lisbon strategy; they do not take it on board."
"We must build up the responsibility of the national parliaments and envisage reinforced cooperation in the field of economics, but it is particularly amongst the players of civil society, amongst businesses and territorial communities, that we suffer most from a loss of profit."
"There is a mass of activities to start, but a great backlog of projects and of players."
"European policy is only possible on the basis of decentralised participation."
"Madam President, I should like to make a few comments regarding the procedure we have followed so far, because that is where the necessary difficulties have arisen."
"I should also like to say something about Lisbon, about Mr Kok's report on the quality of work, about China and India, and finally about the amendments."
"As regards procedure, I think that this is the second or third time that we have realised how little time we have when it comes to determining employment guidelines."
"This causes conflicts among us, beyond the normal political differences, as to how the guidelines should be interpreted, how they should be amended, what needs to be changed and so on."
"I would suggest a different approach next year; that is a piece of advice to the future presidencies of the Council and to the Commission."
"It is vital to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to play its role under the Treaty, namely commenting in an appropriate manner, so that we need not vote down a series of votes on a pile of amendments, which, let me put it this way, are not in the correct procedural order."
"I also wonder whether the triennial procedure we have adopted is the most sensible approach."
"Given the fast pace of change in the economy, and in view of the fact that the Commission soon had to adjust its optimistic outlook and accept that things were not going as smoothly as expected, I think that we need to have the opportunity to alter some important aspects of these economic and employment guidelines."
"I would also like to point out a major shortcoming in the Treaty."
"It needs to be said."
"According to the definition, employment guidelines are, in fact, subordinate to economic guidelines."
"We do not want that."
"It causes all kinds of problems, for example when liberalisation is on the agenda, but it also means that all kinds of other measures are put forward that have their impact in this way."
"I agree with what a number of other speakers who have already taken the floor, including Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels, have said on this point."
"Little progress has been made since Lisbon."
"This has been commented on in our committee as well."
"We have achieved little on poverty and on the participation of older people and women in the workforce."
"There has been some progress, but far too little and we must really revise the guidelines."
"We should revise the Lisbon agreements in the light of various factors, including the evolution of the economy."
"Against that background the position adopted in the Kok report, namely that we must achieve better implementation of the agreements in their entirety, is welcome."
"That is what the Council was supposed to be doing."
"I wonder whether it is enough though."
"Mr Kok proposes discussing and encouraging flexibility and security."
"He certainly addresses the issue of flexibility, but I see nothing about security."
"Both Germany and the UK are still blocking the Temporary Agency Workers Directive."
"That is not in keeping with the principle of promoting the quality of work, also one of Mr Kok's ideas."
"In other words, I think we must look carefully at this and that we should get back to, for instance, the proposals of the Belgian Presidency on the quality of work."
"That was a useful report, not only with regard to a simple category like job satisfaction."
"I also think that we should look not only to the United States but also to developments in China and India."
"We are currently facing massive off-shore outsourcing with all its consequences."
"Finally I should like to thank all those who have cooperated during this last term in office."
"I can also tell you that the Group of the Greens will support the amendments submitted by Ms Hermange and probably also the oral amendment tabled by Mr Bushill-Matthews."
"Madam President, I would like to join in the words that have been spoken on the subject of Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"I was her first vice-chairman for two and a half years."
"I was able to appreciate both her rigour and her courtesy, even if, as you know, our ideas scarcely brought us together."
"I was also pleased to hear Mr Goebbels speaking of the harmful aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"When I spoke in similar terms within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs three or four years ago, I think my fellow Members were shocked."
"It is now clear that, in fact, I was right and that the Stability and Growth Pact is a corset that is far too tight for growth, investment and employment to be able to develop in Europe."
"There is, however, in my opinion, another subject that weighs down European growth, and I think that this is the euro."
"In order to be convinced, we need only see that the three countries of the Union that have not adopted the euro and have preserved their monetary sovereignty are doing much better than the twelve that have chosen, within the framework of the European currency, to link their destinies and to entrust them to a veritable State Bank, a supreme bank that does not care two hoots about growth in Europe."
"I hope the subject of the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign."
"I do not know if, like Mrs Randzio-Plath, I will not return."
"Personally, I hope to return, but it is far from certain."
"That said, I very much hope that the consequences of choosing the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign since, in my view, this is the main problem between Europe and its citizens today."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, despite all its successes, lives with the worry of creating new jobs, because this is one of the fundamental rights of European citizens and is also the best precondition for growth and social cohesion between us."
"The employment guidelines and the Luxembourg procedure in general are very important in achieving this objective, which is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs always examines them with close interest."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, has taken the right approach, for which we thank and congratulate her."
"I could reiterate many of the positions formulated by my fellow Members; however, I shall comment for my part on certain points which I consider should be highlighted."
"First, increasing employment is a highly complex procedure and policy."
"It affects all sectors of economic policy, of social policy, of education policy, of vocational training, of transparency, of the fight against tax evasion and of undeclared work."
"Research and innovation have been particularly highlighted recently."
"This was, in fact, a decision by the recent spring Council and I thank the rapporteur for accepting my amendment on the subject, which calls for proper coordination of all these policies when designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the application of the guidelines."
"This coordination policy is very important to the new Member States, which are being called on to adopt European results in their internal policies."
"We also note that the countries in which there is no proper coordination have the worst performance records in the field of increasing employment."
"Coordination and complementarity are needed both between European policies and national policies at all levels – central, regional, local – and between all the agencies involved."
"I agree with the rapporteur's proposals about transparency and simpler procedures and about information on making the best possible use of the structural funds."
"Another issue on which I want to comment is the issue of structural reform, mainly in the fiscal sector and in the social security sector."
"It would appear that this issue, however necessary everyone considers it to be, is not easy."
"It demands a political price, it needs to be distilled by society and matured and this is not happening to the required extent."
"The assent which we set forth as policy, in order to have meaning and be successful, needs properly informed and prepared citizens, responsible social partners and serious effort if the results of our policies are to become visible and if we are to create trust in our chosen objectives and procedures."
"Madam President, Mrs Hermange has produced a valuable report and notwithstanding the comments by Mr Bushill-Matthews the emphasis remains on implementation."
"Implementation is key to the employment guidelines and to the Lisbon process."
"Why is it so important for us?"
"We understand that not only have the Lisbon guidelines not been pursued and that progress is slow but also, as Mr Dimas commented, the new Member States have to do what we have to do and they have the same problems."
"Unfortunately size does matter in a situation where we must keep to the employment guidelines and yet overall unemployment and the budget deficit in the new Member States are roughly double that of the EU 15."
"Size definitely matters."
"That is why implementation is key, rather than new guidelines."
"Implementation is important, as some people have touched on – in Amendment 5 for example, concerning youth unemployment and as regards women in the workplace – but we also have to look at the issue of older workers, the rapidly ageing population of working age."
"Also, as was briefly mentioned by the chair of our committee, the job shocks that our regions are now facing, such as the outsourcing and offshoring of work – issues that this House is at last taking seriously – will have to be incorporated into the Lisbon goals."
"I am sure Mr Dimas will take account of that in his work in the coming months."
"The big issue here is to ensure not only that implementation is key, but also that there is better understanding among the main players – the trade unions and business organisations – of what the strategy is."
"This clearly does not yet exist in Member States."
"It is vital with regard to this issue, which is one of the last the Committee on Employment will address before the end of the mandate, that we register that the players concerned by this Lisbon goal are insufficiently aware of the strategy being pursued."
"Also important are the quality of lifelong learning and the regional impact of issues like equal funding and market discrimination."
"All of these issues are vital and must remain within the Lisbon goal and the employment guidelines."
"We must strengthen implementation."
"That is the key to today's debate and I welcome Mrs Hermange's report for that reason."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mrs Hermange and Mrs Randzio-Plath, but shall confine myself to commenting on Mrs Hermange’s report."
"Although the recent reforms of the employment guidelines were a positive step, it now seems clear that the European Union will not achieve the Lisbon goals set for 2010."
"The employment rate at the moment is 64%; achieving 70% by 2010 would entail creating 22 million jobs in the new 25-Member European Union."
"Only through the development of competitiveness and growth potential will Europe achieve this rise in employment and productivity."
"The 2004 Spring Summit therefore drew up employment recommendations with the aim of highlighting priority areas for action by each Member State and underlining the need to strengthen the exchange of good practice and experience, which have a fundamental role in European employment strategy."
"I support Marie-Thérèse Hermange’s excellent report, which highlights the need to make more effective use of all available instruments, the effort to implement what has already been agreed and the mobilisation of all the players involved."
"My country, for instance, Portugal, is well on the way to meeting the Lisbon employment objectives, even though it has recently seen its unemployment rate go up, mainly because certain multinationals have pulled out."
"Even so, the unemployment rate is below the Community average."
"As for the objectives of promoting the employment of women and older workers, Portugal has exceeded them."
"Let us not evade the issues, however: the economic environment we have in Europe today is very different from the one that formed the backdrop to the Lisbon Summit in 2000."
"The economic and financial situation in certain Member States demands tough policies to curb public spending and, most of all, structural reforms as a precondition for economic growth and job creation."
"Those Member States that remain courageous enough during this economic slowdown not to give in to easy solutions and undertake the necessary reforms of employment legislation, social security schemes, and so on, deserve not reprimands but encouragement and incentives for their ability to reform."
"I am certain that without structural reforms Europe will not achieve the levels of growth needed to implement the Lisbon objectives."
"– Madam President, Romano Prodi recently stated that recovery in Germany and Italy is non-existent, which means that this year will see a continuation of all the same old uncertainties, doubts and risks as to economic recovery in the euro zone."
"All this statement does is carry over the pessimistic forecasts made by the Commission for 2004 into the political field."
"This then is the background against which we must analyse how Europe’s economic situation develops in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines."
"We cannot continue to dodge the issue."
"We do in fact have at our disposal powerful theoretical instruments, such as those resulting from the Lisbon Strategy or arising from the good practice associated with economic policy coordination."
"We also have powerful limitations, however, such as those resulting from too strict an interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which demolish all the efforts we make."
"The issue is becoming more and more political, or, put another way, a matter of choices, and while it is true that there can only be long-term, sustainable economic development with financial consolidation, it is also true that there will be no financial consolidation, even in the short term, without economic growth."
"Europe needs a new agenda, focusing on the problems of the economy and employment, in place of the current agenda, focusing on the budget deficit and public spending, which have become a veritable obsession."
"What Europe really needs is structural reforms, but it also needs the financial means to carry them through."
"In the early stages there will always be an increase in public spending or a reduction in revenue, and that can only be possible with a profound change in the budgetary rules in force."
"It is at this point that delays begin to occur to the proposals for a review of the Stability and Growth Pact announced by the Commission, especially if these proposals focus on the essence and are not confined to sweetening the regulatory aspects of control."
"Reform of the SGP is inevitable, partly because this instrument has, strictly speaking, been suspended since 25 November."
"The new rules can no longer ignore the changes in the economic cycle, or fail to take account of each Member State’s individual situation without prejudice to the efforts to achieve budget conciliation for the whole euro zone."
"They certainly can no longer ignore the role of public investment and quality spending in the framework of development."
"Aiming at a zero budget deficit in the euro zone over the long term is complete folly, is not supported by any economic theory and would result in the absurdity of a public debt that would, after all, be no better than zero."
"I believe these concerns are to be found in the excellent report tabled by Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath, to whom I offer my warmest wishes, because the dealings I have had with her over the last three years have shown her to be a woman who is capable, competent, determined and profoundly pro-European."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, may I begin by congratulating Mrs. Hermange on her good work and on the quality of the report, which by now has become customary."
"Much has been done in Europe in recent years concerning employment."
"Specifically, in my country, the People’s Party Government, during its two terms of office, has created more than 4 300 000 jobs."
"Clearly we all agree on the need to reform our employment strategy, with a considerable degree of stability, and we all also agree on the importance of the three objectives – full employment, improved labour quality and productivity and strengthening of social cohesion – and we will agree on both the common recommendations and the specific recommendations."
"I should like to stress the importance of certain principles which must underpin the application of employment strategies, in addition, of course, to a principle already often repeated here – the need to coordinate economic policies and social policy – and I should like to emphasise the need to horizontalise policies such as equality, health and safety in the workplace and integration, which seem to me to be essential objectives in the construction of Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I should also like to emphasise, Madam President, the need for improved productivity in the face of relocation – which has already been highlighted by Mrs Bastos – which has disastrous effects on territorial cohesion and the necessary polycentrism of the European Union."
"I believe that increased productivity and labour quality are the best remedies for slowing down relocation. Nowadays this makes many European citizens sceptical about the European Union."
"It also seems to me that the link between the structural funds, territorial restructuring impact policies and employment policy is vital for the achievement of territorial cohesion, a tool for genuine polycentrism in the European Union."
"The need for concerted action on the part of the European Union, the Member States, the regions and local authorities and, of course, social dialogue, are other important tools in the application of these directives."
"– Madam President, as this is the final debate on the broad economic policy guidelines of this Parliament, perhaps we could carry out a more general survey."
"Of course, the term 'European economic policy' which we use is somewhat misleading."
"The Union does not have primary responsibility on this matter nor, unfortunately, does it acquire it under the new draft Constitution."
"Primary responsibility lies with the Member States."
"The Union simply intervenes in a coordinating capacity."
"Where the Union has responsibility, in monetary policy, we have indisputably seen immense success with the introduction and stabilisation of the single currency."
"Unfortunately, we cannot also say the same of the management of the real economy."
"Growth rates have remained low and unemployment has remained at correspondingly high levels."
"The recession in the real economy has led to a crisis in public finances, with huge deficits appearing in major economies, resulting in collapse due to failure to apply the Stability Pact."
"25 November 2003 should have released us from the Stability Pact."
"Instead, however, we returned to the same tired debates about how to revive it, instead of finding ways to get out of the stagnation of the European economy."
"There are, of course, two ways."
"One is a common, truly European policy, within the framework of a mixed economy."
"We must stop worshiping the market, which has failed miserably because, if you take the 30 years after the Second World War, the mixed economy achieved full employment and high rates of growth."
"If you take the next 30 years, during which the doctrine of the free economy has triumphed, full employment has collapsed and the European economy has stagnated and weakened."
"It is time we returned to more logical principles, to a mixed economy like that which served us so well in the post-war years."
"They tell us that unemployment is structural and that, in order to cure it, we need to take structural measures."
"This simply means measures against the workers."
"I would reply to this that the lack of investment is structural and that we should act against speculation on the money markets, which has paralysed the investment mechanism."
"If we could find a new alliance of social forces, then we could really bring the European economy back to its old levels."
"If we cannot find this alliance, then the European economy is condemned to stagnation and, ultimately, to becoming a satellite of the US economy."
"It is time we realised this."
"Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we need a public debate on our economic and employment policy objectives and the reform measures they call for, and one that is much more in-depth than that currently going on in the Member States and at European level."
"For an example of how to debate economic and employment policies, we should take the debate about the Stability and Growth Pact, a subject about which there was far more public debate than there has been about the economic and employment guidelines."
"I also want to put the case for a greater role for the Commission in economic and employment policy, and I urge it to make more use of its right of initiative, rather than hiding behind the unanimity required of votes in the Council."
"Thirdly, I would like to see an end to unanimity in all economic and employment matters affecting the internal market, which would make it possible for Parliament to exercise its power of codecision and unleash new dynamism."
"Let me also draw your attention – and particularly that of the left wing in this House – to the whole catalogue of economic and employment policy principles in the new Constitution."
"In it, rather than setting social policy at odds with the market, we affirm our belief in the social market economy, in sustainability and in full employment; we do not play the various areas off against each other, for they are all mutually dependent and mutually complementary."
"The competitiveness of enterprises is dependent on the skills of employer and employee, as well as on the stability of the currency and on the low level of inflation associated with it."
"It is on competitive businesses that growth depends, and without growth there are no jobs, and employment is the precondition for social cohesion."
"If we communicate this, in these terms, to the public and know ourselves bound by these basic principles and by this interaction, this reciprocity, then we will be able to implement the guidelines all the more efficiently."
"The fact is that we have to get stuck in to the job with greater earnest and greater determination."
"We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which internal market directives are not transposed."
"We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which the Commission has over a thousand infringement proceedings pending against Member States."
"We cannot, we must not, allow Member States to justify breaching the Stability and Growth Pact by saying that, by so doing, they wanted to do something for growth and employment."
"If that were the case, then Germany would have the highest proportion of people in work; instead, it has the highest proportion of people out of it."
"In bringing this speech to a close, let me ask what our weaknesses are."
"They lie in our structure, in our lack of dynamism, in rigidity and over-regulation, and in population change."
"Where do our opportunities lie?"
"We have them in enlargement, in the concept of the internal market, in small and medium-sized businesses, in the skills of our workers, in the Lisbon strategy, in the euro and in the social dialogue."
"Let us take these objectives and make them into action plans and timetables!"
"Let us apply more seriousness and determination to the task of doing away with our weaknesses and seizing our many chances, which are still, like treasure, buried and waiting to be brought to the surface."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have truly followed the debate with great interest and, of course, I cannot but agree absolutely with what Mr Karas said earlier about employment being necessary for social cohesion."
"I do not think that anyone will disagree with this conclusion."
"I should like to formulate a few more conclusions."
"Within the framework of the gradual strengthening of economic activity and the increase in employment in the European Union, we need to make decisive progress, as Mr Hughes and other speakers emphasised earlier, in applying our medium-term strategy for economic policy and employment policy, as laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines and the strategy on employment."
"This strategy continues to apply, both to the old and to the new Member States, as Mrs Kratsa said and, of course, it must be understood in the best possible way, as Mr Moraes pointed out."
"We therefore need to safeguard the continuation of both packages of guidelines in accordance with the principle of streamlining."
"Instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus, even though Mr Bouwman said earlier that conditions are changing."
"Of course, but there must be important changes, as I said in my first speech."
"Therefore, instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus on closing the gap between expectations and results."
"Careful monitoring of these procedures on your part, in close contact with your counterparts in the national parliaments, is the to success, especially within the framework of the interim review of the Lisbon strategy."
"This review will be carried out next year and will naturally focus on ways in which we can achieve in practice the main objectives of our economic policy and our employment policy, including productivity, as Mr Pérez Álvarez emphasised."
"The report by Mrs Randzio-Plath presents a series of amendments to the European Commission's recommendations relating to the 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines."
"The report by Mrs Hermange and her relevant amendments are designed to change the recitals of the guidelines for employment policies for 2004."
"I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs and the Members of the European Parliament for the constructive way in which they expressed their concerns."
"I am delighted that the amendments are in line with the strategy which we have agreed on in order to strengthen the economy and employment in the European Union."
"As regards the amendments to the recitals of the employment guidelines, I should like to assure you that the European Commission will support in spirit those aspects designed to improve the recitals during further negotiations with the Council."
"Finally, I think that the reference to older workers introduced by Mr Bushill-Matthews complements the reference by Mrs Hermange to the young unemployed and our position is therefore positive."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the French Members of this House most warmly and congratulate them on the French Government's action in deporting from France the Imam of Venissieux on the grounds of his misogynistic utterances."
"For a woman in politics, such as I am, having spent decades contending for women's rights, it is immensely reassuring to know that it will no longer be possible, in this European Union of ours, to call for human rights – for that is what women's rights are – to be disregarded."
"Right now, I would rather like to sing the 'Marseillaise', but perhaps it will be sufficient for me to say, ''"
"The next item is the vote."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two things I want to say."
"We spent a great deal of time yesterday considering the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, which has been a matter of some controversy."
"I would like to say that we regard the refusal by the President of Parliament to permit the amendments as lacking any legal justification and we are therefore contesting his decision."
"We will also be considering legal action to test whether the rights of Members of this House can be set aside by sweeping aside all the amendments, as was done in this instance."
"It is because we regard this as a very serious course of action that our group will not be taking part in today’s vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, thereby recording our protest and our inability to accept this decision."
"There is a second matter that I would like to address, and it has to do with what Mr Barón Crespo said in the plenary yesterday."
"The first question that has to be dealt with has to do with the background to Mr Barón Crespo’s assertion that documents had disappeared from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for, if that is indeed the case, then it follows that it could affect all the procedural issues connected with the Boogerd-Quaak report."
"I would, however, ask Mr Barón Crespo to withdraw the allegations he made in the plenary yesterday, which are, unfortunately, not recorded in the Minutes."
"Yesterday, I heard the remarks that Mr Barón Crespo addressed to Mr Tajani, and they are recorded on the House’s official tapes, but not in the Minutes."
"Yesterday, Mr Barón Crespo said to Mr Tajani, for whom we all have high regard: ‘, which, when translated, means ‘shut up, you wretch!’"
"I think it unworthy for one Member of this House to describe another in these terms, and I ask Mr Barón Crespo to withdraw this remark."
"Something else was said, and I regret that."
"I had never thought I would have to say something like this in this House."
"There is, though, something that binds us together no matter what disputes we may have with each other, and that is our mutual respect."
"That is something that our group, at any rate, stands for, and such language should not be used to anyone."
"I will add that Mr Barón Crespo also said something that I will read out, which was taken down for me from the tape."
"I am reading it in Spanish, a language that I, unfortunately, do not speak, and so I apologise if I am not getting it quite right: ‘’ Translated, that means: ‘I would ask the wild boar running loose in this Chamber to calm themselves!’"
"Such, ladies and gentlemen, is not the language that should be used here in the European Parliament, and I ask Mr Barón Crespo to put right the remarks he made yesterday."
"Mr Poettering, we had a full debate on this issue yesterday."
"I do not intend to allow another wide-ranging discussion."
"In terms of the substance of your remark, I would remind you that the President put an alternative proposal to the House that would have allowed amendments to be voted on, and that was defeated by the House."
"Consequently I am in a position today where we have a ruling from the President and a vote by this House on how we are going to conduct the voting on the Boogerd-Quaak report."
"I do not intend to vary from that, so no matter how many points of order are made, we will stick to that position."
"Mr President, I shall be pleased to answer the request put to me."
"Firstly, in relation to the issue raised concerning the disappearance of documents, I have written to President Cox, as he requested yesterday, and I have sent a copy to all my colleagues, the Group Presidents, explaining that certain documents did indeed disappear, but thanks to the efforts of the assistants and the officials of the Groups and the committee, they were replaced before the start of the meeting."
"On this point, moreover, I hope that Vice-President Podestà will give explanations to the House concerning the serious accusations he has made in writing in the ,which he has not mentioned at all until now, and this is a grave insult to Parliament."
"As regards my statements, I see that Mr Poettering has noted what I said, but not what was said to me."
"That is, I would ask that everything be recorded."
"I shall give explanations about what I have said."
"I told Mr Tajani that he was like a basilisk – this is not an insult, it is a word whose meaning can be looked up in the dictionary – ' [be quiet, wretch]'. '' – I refer you to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy of Language – describes someone who has no grace, and as far as I am concerned, he clearly is such a person."
"As regards 'wild boar', there is a problem, which I accept is to do with Spanish parliamentary culture."
"‘’ has been a traditional expression in Spanish parliamentary affairs since the Second Spanish Republic."
"Pérez Madrigal was well known for acting as Mr Pannella is acting now – shouting to right and left."
"In Spanish, ‘acting the wild boar’ means doing what many of his colleagues were doing."
"I am sure, Mr Poettering, that since yesterday you have received no complaints from the European Association of Wild Boars concerning such a comparison."
"Thank you for your clarification, Mr Barón Crespo, but I am not sure that it was as useful as I would have liked it to have been!"
"We have over 600 votes to get through this morning."
"We could have a lot of fun; we could spend the next 30 or 40 minutes playing games on this, or we can get on with the vote."
"I will give the floor to Mr Podestà because he was named and therefore has the right to make a personal statement, but I will not take a series of points of order."
"Mr President, I believe that I can say to you and to my fellow Members that the explanations that Mr Barón Crespo has just given are the most pathetic that I have heard in ten years of parliamentary life here."
"I would also like to take the liberty of noting that, in his letter to Mr Cox, Mr Barón Crespo, when quoting what was published yesterday in the in my name, completely misinterpreted it and changed the wording."
"This is serious, Mr Barón Crespo, because I wrote that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has breached some of the Rules of Procedure, which is why I sent Mr Cox a letter, to which he sent a reply, which I answered."
"The difference between saying ‘breached some of the Rules’ and saying ‘systematic breaches’ is merely one of intellectual integrity, or otherwise."
"It means saying ‘black’ or ‘white’: it is one thing to raise some points; it is another thing to say that our Rules of Procedure have systematically not been respected."
"I will take the liberty – in conclusion, Mr President – of making one remark."
"You said that yesterday the House voted on something that is, in any case, the sole responsibility of the President, but since we chose – or rather, since he chose – Rule 130(3) without considering that paragraph 1, which is binding, says that first of all amendments are put to the vote and then the text, we – or perhaps not we, but someone here whose responsibility it was – betrayed this Parliament’s sense of democracy."
". Mr President, I am indeed aware of the letter which Mr Barón Crespo sent to the President's office concerning his unfortunate and malicious statements of yesterday, and confirming them in exactly the same terms as in his speech."
"On the other hand, Mr President, and according to the explanations given by the secretariat of my committee, and of which the Presidency is directly aware from the note which was sent to it, it is absolutely clear that all, absolutely all, the documents were available in the Committee on Freedoms at the start of the day on the 20th."
"Documents which, moreover, are public and which, besides being available in the documentation department, are also available on the Internet."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would emphasise that no political group – including the Group of the Party of European Socialists – nor any member of the Committee on Freedoms made any comment or statement on the matter, neither during the course of voting on the amendments nor at the start of the same."
"Furthermore, Mr President, at the end of the sitting I was congratulated by all the political groups for the way in which the work had been carried out."
"In conclusion, Mr President, and in Spanish, Mr Barón Crespo has lied, manipulated the truth and insulted us, in addition to casting doubt on the good name of the Members of this House, of the officials and also the assistants of the political groups."
"The President has not responded to the request of the chairman of my group to have the verbatim Minutes of yesterday's sitting revised."
"As he himself has just admitted, Mr Barón Crespo spoke to a fellow Member yesterday, saying, ' [be quiet, wretch]'."
"Mr President, this is not only an arrogant expression, it also shows contempt for an opponent which is incompatible with the democratic spirit."
"Mr Galeote Quecedo, you were as helpful as a wet Friday in November."
"Because of your contribution, which was not on the subject you said it would be on, I now have no choice but to give the floor to everyone else who asked to speak on this subject!"
"Mr President, I take the floor to state that, after the blow that has been dealt, yesterday in this House, and today in the Bureau, to the freedom of MEPs and their right to carry out their mandate, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will not take part in the vote on the report in question."
"We also challenge the fact that this Chamber is used for strictly exploitative ends, choosing who can and who cannot speak."
"This system has been going on for a long time."
"Democracy must be respected, above all else, in this Chamber, and not by making statements in newspapers and by giving out insults."
"Here is a very pragmatic suggestion, Mr President."
"Since the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are relinquishing their participation in the vote on the great report, I would suggest that you have a block vote, which will save time."
"We shall look at that when we come to the vote on the report."
"– Mr President, this is just a reminder that yesterday, as announced, I submitted a motion to refer the report back to committee."
"I hope to be able to table it before the vote on the report and I also hope that the House can vote on it."
"This is the last opportunity for this House to bring itself into line with the proper rules."
"If you wish, you may request a referral back to committee, but please wait until we vote on the item in question."
"This would be an appropriate time – since they are used to robust exchanges of views – to welcome the Australian delegation to this House."
"They are here for the 27th EP-Australia Interparliamentary meeting in Strasbourg in June."
"The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament have had direct political contact since 1981 and we look forward to continuing our interesting and successful dialogue."
"Mr President, quite simply, extremely objectively and in order to get out of this row between old accomplices – which is more like a mafia row than a parliamentary one – I would, with respect, like to hope that, faced with this situation and this debate, the President of Parliament might wish to honour us with his Presidency in this House."
"I believe that this does not in any way detract from your well-known, excellent ability to preside, Mr Martin, but I think that President Cox could come himself, with his authority – and I would also say with his clarity – and preside over this sitting."
"Mr President, I would like to intervene briefly in accordance with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Indeed, a motion requesting referral back to committee has been proposed and as you know, in this case, there can be one speaker in favour and one against."
"Mr Gollnisch, the request has not yet been formally made."
"I will take that formal request when we get to the vote on the report."
"To respond to Mr Pannella's point, I should like to point out that the President is present."
"I am happy to resume my own responsibilities, but if the President wishes to speak, he is welcome."
". I should just like to respond very briefly to Mr Pannella."
"The Vice-President, Mr Martin, enjoys the full confidence of the House and of the President to conduct our affairs this morning."
"In all calmness I can say that I have had a week where I have received an enormous amount of advice – mostly unsolicited – from many friends in this House."
"I have understood, more fully than most in this House, the passions that have fed into our debate."
"Yesterday I sought advice from the House after a lengthy exchange of views and then, not following a vote but under the prerogatives of the Presidency, I made a ruling."
"I accept that there are many colleagues in this House who are not satisfied with that."
"Solomon does not chair the European Parliament – lucky for Solomon."
"So there it is."
"The House was divided from the very first day as to whether there should be a debate on this question."
"That division has manifested itself at every stage of this report from its inception until now with the final vote."
"In my view the essential elements under discussion have always had a considerable underlying and latent political dynamic."
"That being so, the divisions have been inevitable."
"But now the report is before the House and the House must now exercise its mandate however it sees fit."
"I would commend to you, Mr President, that you should – as you remarked – stand by the ruling."
"Mr Ribeiro e Castro will propose – as is his right – referral back."
"The House, in its wisdom, can then decide."
"Finally, can I say that over the past 24 hours I have asked the services of the House to conduct, on my behalf, their own investigation into this question of documentation at a committee meeting earlier this week."
"I am entirely satisfied that everything was done as it should have been."
"If there was a temporary problem with some documents, that fell more into the category of 'cock-up' than 'conspiracy'."
"I would commend to the House that we put an end to this matter and recognise and salute the integrity of Mr Hernández Mollar, his committee and his services."
"The only piece of advice I would have welcomed this week would have been not to be in the Chair on Thursday morning!"
". Mr President, I am glad that we can now get on with what we are meant to be doing rather than continuing to waste valuable time."
"For ten years now, I have been the rapporteur on the problems of beekeeping in the European Union, and today sees me presenting my seventh report to you."
"As before, it improves another half-hearted Commission proposal for a regulation on actions in the field of beekeeping."
"Neither the Commission nor the Council have made much of a response to the many good proposals we have made since 1984 on saving beekeeping in Europe."
"Since 1997, admittedly, there has been a regulation on the 50% cofinancing of national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey, for which different amounts are made available to the 15 Member States every year; in one year EUR 10 million, in another EUR 15 million, in yet another EUR 16 million."
"That is next to nothing in terms of the overall budget of the European Union; it is peanuts."
"As, yet again, the new regulation proposed by the Commission is far too half-hearted, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted my suggested improvements by an overwhelming majority, with the particular intention of securing additional co-finance for measures under national programmes to support the restoration and development of the Community's bee population, in support of honey analysis laboratories, and for the analysis of honey."
"My hope and expectation is that you will give this report your unanimous support, not as a farewell present to mark the end of a legislative period, but, as before, out of conviction."
"Mr President, I wanted to thank the Commission and the Council for making it possible for this document to be adopted today, within four months of its submission, and at first reading. I would also like to extend warm greetings to the delegations from the Austrian National Council and Federal Council, who are in the visitors' gallery."
"Thank you, Mr Rübig, it was indeed a remarkable achievement to get this through in four months."
"Mr President, as I stated earlier, I have a very short oral amendment to Amendment 5 that is acceptable not only to the rapporteur but also certainly to the PSE, ELDR and Green Groups."
"After the phrase 'facilitating the access of unemployed young people to their first job', we would like to add 'and also the employment/continuance in employment of older people'."
"Mr President, I just wish out point out, so that Members are not in any way confused, that it is Amendment 1 – the first vote on this report – which ascertains whether or not Parliament is in favour of the theory of setting up a health scheme for former Members."
"Those who are in favour will vote 'yes'; those who wish to abandon their former colleagues will vote 'no'."
"That was very neutrally put!"
"(1)"
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 130(3), I would like to point out that, every time we vote, we are prepared to systematically breach the Rules of Procedure of this House."
"Indeed, paragraph 3 states that ‘the President may put the original text to the vote first, or put to the vote before the amendment that departs furthest from the original text an amendment that is closer to the original text’."
"On the basis of the decision taken yesterday by this Parliament, which annulled a good 350 amendments with an arbitrary act, I would like to ask you what we will vote on if a paragraph in the text had to be deleted, since there is no amendment left."
"We will have a text that is like a lump of Gruyere, that is full of holes, which can only be closer to the truth given the content of this report. This is, however, an extremely serious further breach of the EP Rules of Procedure that we are being forced to commit – or rather those who will vote will be forced to commit – on the basis of the bad decision, taken yesterday by President Cox, not to give a ruling and to make this Parliament decide to put to the vote the original text, understood as the consolidated text that was put forward by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"That means to say a single voice, that of the left, incorporated its amendments into the original text."
"This itself is a distortion, to which is added a further one, which I pointed out pursuant to the Rules of Procedure."
"I would say to my fellow Members – who do not know the ins and outs of this case – that they have one last chance to prevent a serious injustice, a precedent that could become dangerous for the future, by voting to refer this report back to committee or by rejecting it."
"We will not reopen the debate."
"I will give the floor to Mr Ribeiro e Castro who will formally move the request to refer the matter back to committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is an extremely serious precedent for the future, full of substantive, procedural and formal irregularities."
"Democracy cannot be invoked, only then to be violated."
"Neither can the rule of law be invoked, only then to be violated."
"This is the case with the motion for a resolution that has been tabled."
"It violates the provisions and the guarantees of the Treaties and, even if the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Constitution were already in force in the terms spoken of by some people, it would make a complete nonsense of these two texts too."
"As a European institution, we have only the powers that are accorded us."
"Now, can we judge the decisions of the constitutional courts of the Member States, particularly of Germany and Italy?"
"No."
"Can we judge the legality of this or that fact within the framework of the national laws of the Member States, particularly Italy?"
"No."
"Can we declare, like a people’s court, that certain facts have been established – particularly for Italy or Poland – for which no evidence has been produced or presented?"
"No."
"Can we determine the national legislative process of the German Bundesrat?"
"No."
"Some say that the subject of the report is covered by Article 7 of the Treaty."
"In that case, however, we should have acted accordingly, which we have not done."
"Others say that the report has its basis in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Even if, however, this were already in force and being applied, note should be taken of Article 51 – retained, moreover, in the draft Constitution – according to which the Charter is applicable to the European institutions and the Member States alone."
"I would ask Mr Barón Crespo to restore order among his little wild boars so I can finish."
"This is a very sensitive issue."
"I was trying to be generous, but the Rules of Procedure are clear."
"You have one minute to speak in favour and one minute to speak against."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that the President was practically forced to issue this ruling – for that is what it is – because an element of this Parliament sought to prevent the majority from giving its opinion."
"This is a situation forced on us by the stonewalling that they imposed, in the sense that this is an exceptional measure, in line with the powers given to the President of Parliament."
"This is the situation that we have today, a situation without precedent and one which I hope the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – which is a large group in this Parliament – will want to give due consideration to, so that we are not forced into such a situation again."
"Mr President, the Rules of Procedure allow for the interventions of the person tabling the motion, of one speaker in favour and of one against."
"I informed you at the start of the meeting that I wished to register in favour, as well as passing you a written document."
"I thank you, therefore, for giving me the floor."
"I will be brief."
"I am in full agreement with this motion for referral back to committee, but I would like to add an essential reason, which is that the text of the proposed report particularly targets Italy, as is shown in the heading."
"There are, however, countries in our European Union where freedom of expression is much more seriously threatened."
"I am thinking of Belgium and France in particular: Belgium where, yesterday, a decision of the Ghent Court of Appeal, pronounced in accordance with some truly Stalinist legislation, condemned a perfectly legal and peaceable party, the Vlaams Blok."
"Before telling Italy what to do, the parties involved in this villainy should set their own house in order."
"Mr Gollnisch, in my view, Mr Santini moved the request and Mr Ribeiro e Castro spoke on it."
"We will now move on to the vote."
"Mr President, I suggested just now that we have a block vote, since the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group had decided not to participate in this vote."
"In the meantime, however, several fellow Members of other groups have informed me that they wished to be able to vote on certain paragraphs."
"Not wanting us, therefore, to be in disagreement on this point, I suggest that we vote normally."
"Mr President, as Chairman-in-Office of the College of Quaestors, I wish to point out for the purposes of the Rules that my Group is present but not taking part in the vote."
"I have noted your very important point, Mr Balfe."
"You are always looking after Members' interests!"
"Mr President, I feared that, after having denied us the right to table amendments, you were also denying us the right to speak."
"Fortunately that is not the case."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, to point out what is written in the voting list concerning paragraph 44."
"Here there are two words that have been deemed inadmissible: the words ‘serious’ and ‘persistent’."
"I ask you to highlight this since you have put this paragraph to the vote without this being stressed."
"You are absolutely right, we did indeed vote on the paragraph without those two words."
"The two words have been removed."
"You should have been informed of that."
"Mr President, I am against voting on blocks of amendments together when part of this House is against it."
"I would, however, inform my fellow Members that, in adopting paragraph 62 they have condemned the Italian governments of the last few decades, including the D’Alema Government."
"I hope that they inform their voters, both on the centre-left and all the others."
"We will continue to vote on the paragraphs individually."
"I could hear my good friend Mr Pannella shouting, but I did not know what he was trying to tell me."
"As you have now clearly asked for the amendments to be voted individually, we will do that."
"Mr President, you said we were to vote collectively, not on the amendments but on the paragraphs."
"We are, therefore, not respecting the Rules of Procedure, which provide for amendments, and not sections of the text, to be put to the vote collectively."
"I am sorry, you are wrong."
"I could have taken everything in one single vote if I so wished."
"I apologise, Mr President, to you and my fellow Members, but as shadow rapporteur it is my duty to keep an eye on the little standard procedure that remains in this vote."
"If I am not mistaken, you made us vote on paragraphs 1 to 14, but paragraph 12 has been declared inadmissible, in so far as it contains the two petitions that no Committee on Petitions has ever presented to our committee."
"Paragraph 12, therefore, must absolutely not be included in the text."
"I would also like to wish the services of the sitting the best of luck in the task they will have in putting right some paragraphs: paragraphs 59 and 69, for example."
"If you remove Mr Berlusconi’s name then they will be without a subject, sentences which do not make sense: there is a verb, a few adjectives but there is no subject."
"It would have been more responsible to delete the entire paragraph."
"I do not want to be cruel to you, Mr President, by asking you to read to me, out of curiosity, how paragraph 59 could end up if amended."
"It is not possible because there is a subject missing: who does what is written here?"
"Who feels the consequences of what is indicated here?"
"This is a difficult situation, Mr President; it really is a real mess."
"Again, Mr Santini, in relation to citation 12, you are correct."
"The modification you mention has already been taken care of by the services."
"You should have been informed of this before the vote."
"Mr President, as the House knows, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy was deeply divided over whether or not to ratify the third generation agreement with Pakistan."
"However we are not divided on our concern for human rights and democracy, and the resolution before the House was supported unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"It is vitally important that there be a strong vote for this particular resolution."
"The reason I recommend this is that when this House agreed to ratify the third generation agreement, it gave a commitment to review progress on human rights and democracy after one year."
"The position the Committee on Foreign Affairs puts forward in this resolution under my name is the appropriate benchmark for judging how much progress has been made."
"I welcome the amendments tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Swoboda, which strengthen the resolution."
"I respect the fact that there were sincerely-held views on both sides in the debate over Pakistan."
"I would therefore like to thank Members for all their individual contributions during the time I had the honour to be rapporteur."
"This is my last speech in the House, so I wish to thank all my colleagues for their friendship – and indeed the battles over the years, even if I lost one today – and also to thank the staff for the courtesy they have extended to me."
"I wish my colleagues who are standing again well – I hope they are successful."
"To those, like me, who are retiring, I wish fulfilment."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that President Cox paid you such an outstanding tribute today when your authority in the Chair was challenged, since you have been an outstanding chairman of these proceedings."
"You have always chaired with efficiency, courtesy and, most important of all, humour."
"I wish you well."
"You are an asset to this House and I hope you return."
"I have had the privilege of being a Vice-President of this House for 15 years and a Member of the House for 20 years."
"I will not be a Vice-President in the next Parliament."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank colleagues for their support and for giving me the privilege of chairing this House."
"More importantly, in some ways, I should like to thank the services, who do an incredible amount of work behind the scenes and do not get the credit that they deserve."
"Mr President, even though Mr Cushnahan and I did not always agree, I would like, first of all, to thank him for his dedication."
"He really did do a fine job, and achieved a great deal."
"I would like to add an oral amendment to Amendment No 6, to which many of us would be able to agree if something were to be added to it, that being the words, ‘provided that the United Nations shall not have assumed political responsibility’."
"The fact is that unilateral withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the present time, without the assumption of responsibilities by the United Nations, would certainly be highly problematic and could well plunge the country into chaos."
"If that were agreed to, we could support the amendment as a whole."
"That is my question to the proposer of the motion."
"Mr President, here too we find a similar lack of logic, and so I ask that, by analogy with paragraph 13, the following words, which I shall now read out, should be deleted: ‘including the completion of the transatlantic market’."
"I also ask that the following be deleted: ‘aimed at achieving the free movement of goods, capital, service and persons’."
"In this instance, too, I ask for Mr Brok's agreement to this."
"Mr President, let me put to you another suggestion, one that will, I think, represent an even better solution to this."
"In Mr Elles' Amendment No 22, there is a paragraph 27a, which deals with the same point and incorporates what Mrs Mann is talking about."
"I put it to you that we should get rid of the whole of paragraph 15 and insert Mr Elles' paragraph 27a in its place."
"We will then have resolved the whole problem and could have the support of a broad majority for it."
"I see that you are in agreement, Mrs Mann."
"Mr President, as confirmed yesterday by the Irish Presidency during the debate on the De Keyser report, the Union is following the current repression of the mountain people of Vietnam with a great deal of concern."
"With the agreement of the rapporteur, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, concerning Item 4 regarding the defence of the interests of indigenous populations and of minorities, to add these few words reflecting a situation that again came visibly to the fore just a week ago."
"The text would read thus: ‘the defence of the interests of indigenous populations and of minorities such as the mountain people of Vietnam, victims of systematic repression."
"It is with the agreement of the rapporteur that I would like to submit this to you."
"(2)"
"Mr President, I would like to correct a small error that has slipped through into the text that we voted on in committee."
"Chapter 1, paragraph 3, line 4 states: ‘agrees with the Commission's position that the general guidelines 2003-2005 remain valid...’."
"In Parliament we are, however, as legislators, not obliged to say that we are in agreement with the Commission, but obliged to say what we ourselves want, as a Parliament."
"With the agreement of all the political groups, I propose the following oral amendment: ‘the general guidelines 2003-2005 remain valid but must be focused even more on boosting economic growth resulting in job creation and productivity growth’."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, it appears that being prudent in this House is penalised."
"I wanted to speak after the vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report, and not before, to avoid joining the general free-for-all, for one reason: to place myself at the disposal of the Presidency."
"I was on the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and saw the people looking for the documents when they disappeared."
"Mr Hernández Mollar is right in saying that he knew nothing and that no group got up."
"On this committee all the groups and the chairman worked very reasonably together until, after our work, this row blew up."
"Mr Barón is completely right, and he is not lying when he says that this is what happened."
"I am at your disposal to clarify any point concerning this issue and, of course, it is untrue to say that Mr Barón lied."
"I myself told him about the matter."
". – The programme of support for the production and marketing of honey is known to be very important for the survival of beekeeping."
"According to Portuguese beekeepers, one aspect of this programme has proved essential: the part relating to varroasis control."
"The beekeepers believe, however, that varroasis control should be carried out through a specific programme, as happens with other diseases in other animal species."
"In relation to the Parliamentary report, there is general agreement underlining the need to retain the programme of support for the production and marketing of honey."
"Lastly, it is considered important that other measures should be applied, namely:"
"- support for the restoration and development of the bee population, given the growing problems in this sector;"
"- restructuring of the agro-environmental measures so that this measure may be regarded as effective support, as happens in other sectors of agriculture."
"It is also essential, however, to take account of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union and to provide for an increase in the budget allocated to the beekeeping sector."
". – We voted against the report not because we disagree with it, but because everything it rightly points out is cancelled out by the first amendment, which promotes the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic crops, allowing beekeepers to manufacture honey which contains GMOs."
"We consider that this is extremely dangerous and destructive to beekeeping, precisely because honey is primarily a quality agricultural product."
"The existence of genetically modified crops, in conjunction with a 0.9% limit on GMOs in honey, presupposes that bees can choose between genetically modified and non-genetically modified plants."
"We condemn the 'zeal' of the European Parliament in speeding up the coexistence of genetically modified crops with conventional and organic crops – despite the warning bell being sounded by numerous valid scientific studies – and would point out that no legislative measure can prevent or combat the immense potential dangers."
"The argument that the cultivation and movement of GMOs is now a foregone conclusion and all that remains is its 'satisfactory' legal regulation, is hypocritical, given that what is presented as a would not exist if the ΕU had not bowed to pressure from the USA."
"We are categorically against the cultivation and movement of GMOs and we shall continue to fight for a total ban on them, because we do not consider anything to be a foregone conclusion."
"The European Parliament should take the same stand; however, it appears to have been converted by interests and pressure a long time ago."
". – I voted for the proposal for a regulation, because I believe that the enlargement of the European Union must not fail to take account of the changes that will necessarily affect the beekeeping sector, and that an increase in the budget allocated to it is justified."
"Similarly, I believe we must think carefully about what the best methods and practices are to address the problems facing this activity, namely diseases, high bee mortality rates, poisoning by insecticides, climate change, marketing problems (especially in the outermost countries and regions) and unfair competition from low-priced, poor-quality products from third countries."
"I agree that the lines of the previous programme should be maintained and I support the proposals added by the rapporteur, i.e. measures in support of honey analysis laboratories and other measures apt to improve the production and marketing of honey and apiculture products."
"The draft Commission regulation finally recognises the need to genuinely help the disaster-stricken European beekeeping sector, whilst carefully refraining from naming the main cause: the devastating effect of the new generations of neurotoxic insecticides."
"The Commission is, however, absurdly stopping aid programmes, in the form of measures in support of the honey analysis laboratories."
"Our rapporteur proposes to reinstate them, and she is right."
"There was a need, however, to go much further and, since they are obviously of common interest, make the perfecting of the indispensable new protocols, designed for testing whether the new molecules used in the new plant health products are harmless to bees and to human health, eligible for Community funding."
". – This is a matter of confirming the decision to reject the proposal to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the context of the communitisation of Justice and Home Affairs, which removes central competences from the Member States."
"I support the view rejecting this Commission initiative, partly because this proposal is remiss in defining the system and how it will operate, ‘including the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which they are to be entered and the criteria for their entry, the rules concerning the content of VIS records, the rights of access for authorities to enter, update and consult the data and rules on the protection of personal data and its control.’"
"Hence my vote."
". – I fully support the reasons given by Carlos Coelho for rejecting the Commission proposal, which is pointless and actually lacks any content."
"I voted for rejection of the proposal."
"We support the outcome of the conciliation for the second railway package, firstly because it would make for quicker and easier international rail freight services, to the benefit of the environment and of the transfer of freight from road to rail, and secondly because it would emphatically not entail the deregulation of rail passenger services."
"We believe that the consequences of deregulation in Sweden must first be investigated, something that the Swedish Government too is at present doing, before we possibly proceed with further deregulation."
"The thinking behind the radical reform of the railways is commendable."
"The initial intention was, in fact, to rebalance rail and road and to favour recourse to a mode of transport that is respectful of the environment."
"On the pretext of drawing power, we have initiated an excessive and poorly controlled liberalisation."
"Let us not be fooled; the real objective of this liberalisation is to entrust the division of particularly lucrative markets to a few large private groups."
"What will happen to life in the more remote and less profitable geographical areas, which will provide little interest for the private operators in search of profits?"
"Let us not forget the specificity of rail transport, particularly in France, which, as a public service, contributes to social cohesion and harmonious national and regional development."
"Furthermore, liberalisation seems to be incompatible with safety, since some countries have had to renationalise following repeated accidents."
"Finally, as the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, admitted, the market-opening of rail freight services will lead to increased competition, which may mean a reduction in the number of jobs."
"For all these reasons, the Hunting Fishing Nature Traditions (CPNT) Party Members will vote against a common rail market created on the basis of social dumping and with no prior study of its impact on the main interested parties: rail users and employees."
". – It is deeply regrettable that a majority in Parliament has voted in favour of the liberalisation of international rail transport from 1 January 2006 and of national rail transport from 1 January 2007, the year 2010 having been set as a standing objective for all operators to prepare in an appropriate manner for the liberalisation of passenger transport services, in advance of current Commission initiatives to accelerate the opening-up of this sector to competition."
"This is the corollary of the initiative that the Commission submitted on 24 January 2002, with the aim of accelerating the liberalisation of rail transport without first taking account of experience already gained, particularly in Great Britain."
"Public services and rail safety have deteriorated there, because private companies only try to ensure maximum profits for themselves without fulfilling their obligations to maintain rail infrastructure and equipment."
". The results of the conciliations on this second railway package are, quite simply, unacceptable, as they are contrary to the interests of rail users, railwaymen and safety."
"The creation of a European Railway Agency and the interoperability measures unfortunately do not reverse the liberal tendency."
"The amendment of Directive 91/440 increases even more the liberalisation of rail transport."
"International freight services will be handed over to the market on 1 January 2006, and national freight services on 1 January 2007."
"In addition, the date of 2010 has been clearly announced for the liberalisation of passenger transport services, ‘objectives allowing all operators to prepare in an appropriate manner’."
"We cannot approve such relentlessness and we express our most vehement concerns regarding the future third railway package."
"How many disasters and problems do there need to be before we finally abandon this frantic race towards liberalisation?"
"As far as we are concerned, this sector is common property and must continue to be owned by the community."
"Rail transport must remain a public service, extended to the European continent, modernised and placed under the democratic control of the people."
"In rejecting these results, this is the perspective that we mean to stand up for, together with our citizens, the railwaymen and their trade unions."
",. – The Conciliation Committee has reached an agreement on the directive on the development of the Community’s railways."
"The main points of the compromise can be summarised as follows."
"Licensed railway undertakings will be granted access rights to international rail freight services from 1 January 2006 at the latest, and to national rail freight services from 1 January 2007."
"It was also agreed that the Commission would submit, by 1 January 2006 at the latest, a report on the implementation of the directive as well as on developments in the area of traffic, safety, working conditions and the situation of operators."
"At the end of the negotiations, Parliament accepted the Council’s refusal to include the liberalisation of rail passenger services in this directive."
"The Council, however, accepted a recital whereby, with regard to opening up the international passenger services market, the date of 2010 must be considered as ‘an objective allowing all operators to prepare themselves as necessary’."
"What, though, of the transposal of the first railway package?"
"While it has not been transposed in the various Member States and a real assessment of its impact has not been carried out, …"
".Yesterday evening, I gave Mr Caudron the opportunity to make his final speech after 15 years as a Member of the European Parliament as he is due to retire shortly."
"He presented our group's final position on the railway package, making it clear that this liberalisation proposal is suitable for a Europe quite different from the one the Confederal Group of the European United Left would like to see."
"In 2000, the European Commission tried to force the Member States to privatise the whole of public transport."
"Since this Parliament excluded significant portions of urban and regional transport from this attempt on 14 November 2001, the Commission has turned its attention to the railways."
"It wants to liberalise not only international freight services but also domestic passenger services."
"In the meantime, we have gained bad experiences of this in the Netherlands."
"The move to sell shares in the state-run rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen on the stock market appeared to lead to neglect of rolling stock and rail infrastructure, delays and industrial unrest and so has been stopped."
"This was done not as a political choice but because staff, passengers and eventually politicians too learned the lessons."
"The provision of train services by a competing company, since bought up by the international transport giant Connex-Vivendi, has also been terminated."
"Similar plans for Europe are now being held up by the Council, but are still not off the agenda."
". – Rail transport has not developed to the same extent as other forms of transport."
"Indeed, it has suffered significant cutbacks, especially as regards freight, to the advantage of competing sectors."
"We had a first package to revitalise the railways back in 2001."
"Now this is the second package, and the Commission is continuing down the road to liberalisation."
"The rapporteur invited us to approve the joint text after the Conciliation Committee had achieved consensus by weighing up the divergent positions of the Commission and of Parliament, through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the timetable for the opening-up of the market to freight services, the main point of disagreement."
"The only aspect to which I might have objected was the suppression of the safety provisions, but this area is specifically targeted by another proposal for a directive."
"The measures proposed will make it possible to revitalise rail transport."
"Since that is my conviction, and since I have long advocated the revitalisation of both the passenger and particularly the freight sector as being essential for European development, I support this whole package of measures."
"Besides, we are witnessing a serious crisis, as at , which wants to close its factories in Europe."
"What is really justified, then, is heavy investment in the whole railway industry."
". – This initiative is part of the package liberalising rail transport."
"I must stress that the first article in this directive points out that the objective is the opening-up of the rail network to competition, with the intention of harmonising safety rules across the European Union."
"While improving rules and ensuring safety are fundamental issues, which of course deserve our full support, I cannot comprehend how they can be subordinated to the ‘market’, subordinating the introduction of higher safety standards to the non-distortion of competition."
"The Commission’s power of control in this area is also strengthened: it is specifically given the power to suspend the application of a national safety rule for a maximum period of six months."
"I therefore voted against the initiative."
". – In this other proposal for a directive in the framework of the second railway package, the objective of which is to revitalise the sector, the Commission is concerned with safety issues, an area that has always been central to European Union policies."
"In view of the significant differences that exist between Member States, the path that has been chosen is the harmonisation of safety rules, which will greatly help to improve and develop safety levels in the railway industry."
"I must highlight the suggestion by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to introduce a safety certificate for railway undertakings and infrastructure managers."
"The Member States have agreed to an extension of the Commission’s powers in this area so as to facilitate the enforcement of the Community rules without, however, ruling out the enforcement of tougher national legislation."
"The importance of the role of staff training measures in the development of rail transport has also been enhanced."
"I realise that this is an important step on the way to creating a European railway system which must, above all, be safe."
"I agree with this report and voted for it."
". – We have here an integral part of the so-called second railway package drawn up by the Commission, which seeks to revitalise this particular transport sector."
"Important proposals are presented, such as those that aim at improving investment by the various Member States, ensuring the application of technical specifications for the interoperability of both high-speed trains and conventional networks through greater financial support, and equipping trains with a recording device."
"The proposal also provides for a new institutional approach, through the idea of setting up a European Railway Agency as a regulatory body for the system and a joint supervisory authority that can manage and ensure safety in the sector."
"If the aim of the directive is achieved, it should lead to the specification of a high level of technical harmonisation, as shown in the agreement that has been reached."
"The result of the conciliation process may be considered highly satisfactory for the European Parliament, and I am delighted with the approval of this joint text at third reading, with a view to speeding up the application of interoperability in the various aspects of the railway sector."
". We believe that the EU’s forthcoming budget should give priority to sustainable growth, in line with the Lisbon strategy, and support for the new Member States so that the historically important enlargement is a success."
"The budget’s priorities must be changed so that less money is invested in agricultural aid."
"We are, at the same time, anxious about budget discipline and critical of the Commission’s proposed increases in expenditure."
"In this situation, we do not wish to express an opinion on the precise levels to be achieved by the new budget, partly because the costs are difficult to predict and the priorities not established and partly because we do not wish to tie the new Parliament to precise figures."
".We voted in favour of this report, thereby endorsing the wishes of the unions, although it even denies the right to vote to union representatives who sit on executive boards, something which should be a minimum requirement."
"That being said, and given that this report is part of a package aimed at the ‘liberalisation’ of the railway system, we must reiterate our absolute opposition to any form of privatisation of the railways, which should be a public service throughout Europe."
". – This report supports the draft regulation establishing a European Railway Agency, which is a further fundamental step towards the Commission’s objective of revitalising the whole European railway industry at both freight and passenger transport levels."
"The purpose of this agency is essentially to ensure the constant harmonisation and coordination of railway employees and to issue recommendations and opinions for the Commission."
"Its duties will not include any kind of legislative competence and it will not have powers of regulation or independent control – it will merely play a consultative role, submit proposals and oversee safety."
"The agreement in question is a further pillar in the second railway package."
"In view of the fact that I also agreed with the other texts in this package and as I have always advocated that the future of Europe requires major development in this sector, principally because it is an excellent alternative to our already saturated road sector, I voted in favour of it."
"The revitalisation of our railways has to be a top priority for the European Union."
". – I support the extension of Regulation (EC) No 975/1999 – which underpins the European Union’s human rights activities in the framework of development cooperation – so as to take account of the financial perspective, which runs until 2006, and at the same time to adapt it technically to the new Financial Regulation."
"In particular, I greatly welcome the proposal for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to create specific institutional mechanisms to allow for greater involvement of civil society and non-governmental organisations, with the principal aim of promoting democracy and human rights."
"On the other hand, I am concerned at certain details that indicate the great difficulties faced by small and medium-sized organisations in civil society to have their applications for funding granted – despite the micro-projects facility – because of complicated administrative mechanisms."
"The European Union is, as we all know, the largest source of development aid in the world; it gets visible results and raises genuine expectations in many who courageously and persistently fight and hope for the consolidation in their countries of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
". Having praised Mr Rocard for his excellent report, I would like to take this opportunity to mention the importance of that annual European scheme which puts a European city in the spotlight in the name of culture."
"It remains necessary for Europe certainly and, above all, the nominated city, to provide themselves with the human and financial resources for the scheme."
"Lille in 2004 gives us a perfect and remarkable illustration of this being done."
". Culture is an area that falls into the much-vaunted but little-practised category of subsidiarity, where Europe should take a hands-off approach as far as possible."
"European cultural policy should really be no more than encouragement in the form of subsidies, for example when a town is nominated as a capital of culture."
"The rapporteur has raised a number of practical problems in the system of designating capitals of culture."
"We will all agree that we need to find a fairer way of ensuring that all Member States have an equal opportunity to promote their culture, particularly following the enlargement which is due to take place in a few weeks."
"The idea of having two capitals of culture would appear to be a reasonable option."
"At the European summit last week in Brussels my country was not considered on the issue of appointing a director to the ECB."
"The large Member States share out the posts among themselves."
"There is no real respect for the smaller Member States, merely lip-service."
"I hope that the symbolism of the European capitals will not go the same way."
"That is just a wish that I wanted to express here."
".– I congratulate Michel Rocard on his excellent report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the ‘European Capital of Culture’ event for the years 2005 to 2019, to which I give my full support, especially as regards designating two European Capitals of Culture every year from 2009."
"The intention is thus to impart a new impetus and dynamism to the process of selecting the European Capitals of Culture, promoting competition at a European level through encouraging the nomination of several candidate cities every year."
"The aim of doing this is to ensure the success of the initiative."
". – The Commission proposal aims only at supporting the nomination of one city from a new Member State in addition to the one from a current Member State from 2009 to 2018 and does not regulate the procedure for any other enlargement candidates."
"I believe, however, that the ‘twin-headed capitals of culture’ proposal may prove inappropriate in that it will tend to reduce public interest in these events."
"I share the opinion of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that, in the current situation, there is a serious danger that interest in this procedure may fall off quickly and may jeopardise its future."
"I believe, therefore, that success depends on not diluting attention by multiplying events and on giving new impetus and dynamism to this process by reintroducing competition at European level and encouraging the nomination of candidate cities each year."
"The selection panel, whose role is both to encourage nominations and to judge them, should set requirements and give advice to encourage the nominated cities’ projects to include a real European dimension."
"I therefore believe that the amendments made by the rapporteur to the Commission proposal are fully justified, as can be seen from the unanimous approval that the report received in committee."
"I voted in favour of it."
". – The purpose of the Europass is not to serve the workers, but to make it easier for employers to compare job applicants and select those who, with the lowest demands, will 'yield' fastest, whatever their country of origin."
"In conjunction with the 'freedom' of movement of workers, who will have to wander about like nomads from country to country looking for work, this measure helps to depress wages and demands, using workers from poorer countries as a pressure lever."
"At the same time, the Europass makes big business responsible for evaluating the educational and professional qualifications of the workers, taking this role away from the education system, and helps to decouple qualifications from the right to work."
"Various forms of training and informal types of learning are taking precedence over qualifications acquired through systematic education."
"In this way, the Europass is being converted to yet another tool which results in the replacement of substantive, integrated education with 'flexible' sporadic training and fragmented skills in order to meet the demands of the market."
"It is certain that soon information will also be demanded on the so-called 'social' skills of the workers, such as their conduct at work and degree of compliance with every type of demand made by employers."
"For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
". – Taking this action aimed at ensuring the transparency of diplomas and qualifications by means of appropriate instruments falls within the same process, designed to promote mobility, as the ECTS system, certificate supplements, the European CV and the Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus programmes."
"The Europass, allocated rational resources and adequate information networks at European level, and with which the social partners will be associated, will be an effective tool for helping people communicate their qualifications and competences."
"The two objectives of this decision, ‘to rationalise and to coordinate’, will only be achieved if all the Member States increase their efforts to implement these ‘Europass’-labelled documents quickly and effectively."
"The Europass will make it possible to give European citizens the means for their mobility and should become the essential and ubiquitous document for all young Europeans."
"In the light of the ambitions at stake, the meagre budget allocated to this project by the Commission may be cause for surprise."
"Without impairing other programmes, we must nevertheless allocate ourselves the resources to match our ambition to ‘make Europe’s education and training systems a world quality reference by 2010’."
". – This proposal has the objective of drawing together into a single framework, to be known as a ‘Europass’, various initiatives aimed at ‘helping’ workers to set out their competences and experience in a way that employers and education/training providers in other Member States may be able to understand."
"The ‘European CV’, to be known as a ‘Europass’, may include other documents, such as:"
"- a ‘MobiliPass’: designed to record a specific European learning pathway in a common European format, and awarded to students/trainees who have undertaken periods of learning in another Member State;"
"- a ‘Diploma Supplement’: attached to a higher education diploma to help third parties to understand the meaning of that diploma;"
"- a ‘Certificate Supplement’: attached to a vocational qualification to help third parties to understand its meaning;"
"- a ‘European Language Portfolio’: a record of linguistic and cultural skills."
"Each of these documents already exists, as a result of cooperation with the Council of Europe and/or UNESCO."
"The only document to which the Commission proposes substantive changes is the MobiliPass, which would cover all kinds of learning and not just vocational training."
"The question that arises is what basic motive lies behind the development of these instruments: is it to add value to a country’s human resources, or is it to enable economically more developed countries to exploit the workers and their mobility?"
". I am very pleased with Mr Zissener’s report, which will allow everyone to have their qualifications and competences recognised within an enlarged Union."
"I am all the more delighted since on several occasions, by means of amendments, I have emphasised lifelong learning and training, and have proposed that we map out and identify a genuine European pathway of learning enabling young people to optimise their training in several countries of the Union, so acquiring a greater diversity of skills and adding a European dimension to their career path, which will be a ‘plus’ on their CV and in the performance of their work."
"While this report is a very good example of what we can put in place for training young people and stimulating employment in the Union, I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that standardisation ‘at any cost’ is a mistake."
"Applying this policy to the curriculum vitae would once again illustrate the Commission’s regrettable tendency to want to interfere in even the smallest details of our daily lives to the detriment of individual peculiarities and originality that are sources of mutual enrichment."
". – This is a very important proposal for the mobility of workers."
"Its aim is to establish a Community framework to achieve transparency in qualifications and competences by creating a portfolio of interlinked personal documents, to be known as a Europass, which citizens may use on a voluntary basis to communicate and set out their qualifications and competences better throughout Europe."
"The Commission proposes to provide Europass National Agencies with financial support for 2005 and 2006 (corresponding to a development phase) through annual co-financed grants (of up to 50% of the total cost), after which Europass activity should be treated as a horizontal action in the new generation of Community programmes for education and training."
"Like the rapporteur, I welcome the extension of the Europass-Training to cover all aspects of education and training."
"I voted in favour of the report."
". – Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for about 99.8% of the enterprises in the European Union and about two-thirds of the employment."
"These companies, covering a broad spectrum of business areas, are thus vitally important for job creation and local/regional development, but they encounter certain difficulties, such as access to finance, which require an urgent solution."
"A policy of suitable support mechanisms directed at this broad sector is therefore needed."
"The Growth and Employment Initiative (1998-2000), despite its shortage of funds and much publicity, had the objective of promoting job creation through support for SMEs."
"It was replaced with the Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship (2001-2005), which introduced mechanisms providing guarantees and access to risk capital, such as the Joint European Venture (JEV), which is now being wound up, thereby jeopardising the EUR 42 million of unused funds."
"The programmes aimed at SMEs need an injection of funds but also a change in objectives: they must promote job creation; support the formation of associations; support research and training; provide guarantees for all the critical phases in the life of a start-up company; improve the geographical spread of support (broadly concentrated in the countries in the centre of the European Union); and support not just high-technology companies but also traditional and craft enterprises."
". – This Commission proposal suggesting amendments to the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, is very important."
"One of the proposed amendments, which the rapporteur supports, is the winding-up of the Joint European Venture programme (JEV), designed to support traditional joint ventures."
"This measure is justified by the impossibility of using the remainder of the budget for projects involving accession and candidate countries, and by the fact that simplifying, as opposed to deactivating, the project would entail losing the unused budget commitments of approximately EUR 42 million."
"The Commission also insists on improving the coverage of research activities under the ETF Start-up Facility, so as to increase the availability of risk capital to new and innovative SMEs."
"The rapporteur suggests that, in addition to support for the start-up and initial development phase, as the Commission proposes, there should also be better coverage of other phases in the life of a new company, and he also underlines the importance of improving the geographical spread in the take-up of the remaining facilities."
"The proposal is enhanced by these contributions by the rapporteur, and I therefore voted in favour of it."
". – The aim of this proposal is to continue the Content programme on digital content."
"The aim of the new Content programme is to make digital content in the European Union more accessible, useable and exploitable, in order to facilitate the creation and diffusion of information and knowledge in areas of public interest at Community level."
"The programme will have EUR 163 million available for the period 2005-2008, and a specific aspect of the programme will be to improve the quality of digital content."
"I have no objection to the promotion of tools, processes and services associated with the design, development, access and distribution of digital content or to the emphasis on the multilingual aspects of cultural, educational and scientific content."
"I do have reservations, however, when it comes to exploitation, particularly at the level of the reuse of public-sector information or the promotion of cross-border services – a pan-European market for digital content, which must not take place to the detriment of universal access to public information or limit the benefits of development in the sector, either to consumers or to the main operators."
"It must ensure that dynamism and innovation in the digital content sector are maintained."
"Despite this, the programme deserves our support, principally for its objective of promoting linguistic and cultural diversity."
"Parliament’s amendments neither improve nor help to clarify the Commission’s proposal."
"Mr President, I wanted to speak on the Brok report to explain why I believe this Cooperation Agreement to be vital for the promotion of cultural, economic and investment links between the EU and Pakistan."
"I warmly welcome the agreement because trade is a means of opening up dialogue on those areas in which there are still major concerns about democracy and human rights."
"We know Pakistan suffers from acute poverty and I hope that the approval of this agreement will help the government and people of Pakistan to deal with the poverty issues within their country."
"Constructive engagement between the EU and Pakistan is urgently needed."
"That is why I voted in favour of this agreement."
"I appreciate there are still many concerns over human rights and democracy in Pakistan, but these are highlighted in the resolution."
"This report and resolution clearly convey the importance that Parliament attaches to upholding human rights and democracy."
"However, Pakistan has made considerable progress in this area, and the most effective way of ensuring that this continues and is strengthened is through enhanced dialogue and cooperation rather than isolation."
". As the former rapporteur for this report and former chief observer to Pakistan, I have opposed the ratification of the third-generation agreement."
"Ratification would confer legitimacy on a quasi-military regime, responsible for human rights abuses, a 'flawed' general election and nuclear proliferation."
"Before the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I contacted Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Christian Solidarity Worldwide to request that they lobby MEPs to oppose ratification."
"Christian Solidarity Worldwide promptly circulated a briefing to MEPs."
"Human Rights Watch did not respond."
"Amnesty International said that it was 'not able to provide more help … due to the short notice given'."
"Ratification was approved by only one vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"Before plenary, I contacted both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch again."
"Neither responded."
"In 2003 both issued reports condemning Pakistan."
"In 2003, Amnesty described the 'systematic human rights violations'."
"Human Rights Watch in 2003 called on Musharraf to 'transfer power to a legitimate government'."
"Given the recent comments by Lotte Leicht in the European Voice that the EU has been weak in implementing human rights and democracy clauses, the lack of response is appalling."
"It betrays those in Pakistan who risk their lives to defend human rights and democracy."
". The Agreement with Pakistan includes measures concerning a quota increase of 15% for textiles and clothing products and, under the Generalised Preference System (GPS), there will be a zero duty on EU imports of clothing between 2002 and 2004."
"In a previous question to the Commission concerning the existence of studies on the impact of this Agreement on the textile and clothing sector in the EU, in Portugal for example, the Commissioner said – so as to avoid having to say that there were no such studies – that it was ‘unlikely to have a significant impact’."
"Analysis of EU exports to Pakistan and exports from Pakistan to the EU shows that the textiles and clothing sector – in which Portugal is a producer – is one of the bargaining chips that allows Pakistan to import chemical products, transport machinery and equipment, and electrical goods from the most industrialised countries in the EU."
"I must also express my opposition to the fact that, among other elements, the Agreement requires a commitment from Pakistan to conclude readmission agreements concerning Pakistani nationals living illegally in the EU."
"This measure seeks to control illegal immigration by repressive means, such as repatriation."
". Parliamentary democracy in Pakistan has never had a real chance thanks to the involvement of the army."
"Whenever voters elect a decent government to power, it is eventually overthrown by the military."
"Former Prime Minister Bhutto was even killed after being deposed, and his daughter, popular so long as she was regarded as his political heir, was also later thrown out of power."
"This military intervention against progressive governments has created a breeding-ground for Islamic fundamentalism and for groups that want to set individual sections of the population against each other."
"These groups have been able to continue their activities legally under the military regime."
"Current President Musharraf was until a few years ago regarded as a dangerous general who had seized power in a coup, who wanted to make his country a nuclear power, was creating space for a very conservative interpretation of Islam and cooperated with the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan."
"Once he helped the American military intervention in Afghanistan he suddenly came to be seen as an American ally."
"This proposal gives him the same status in Europe."
"Once again, commercial and military interests take precedence over human rights."
"It is astonishing that this Parliament should first approve an agreement with Pakistan and then later in the meeting adopt a resolution regretting the lack of human rights."
". With the events of 11 September 2001 still fresh in our minds, we must not forget the active role played by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism."
"Pakistan has since shown itself to be a strong ally of the international community, notably in the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda."
"In view of Pakistan’s excellent contribution, the European Union resumed political dialogue in November 2001."
"The areas of cooperation between Pakistan and the EU contained in this Agreement are extremely varied."
"I should like to highlight those commitments aimed at combating discrimination and violence, developing democracy, strengthening trade and fostering economic cooperation."
"It should be emphasised, however, that although human rights are considered to be a universal objective, observance of these rights must not be a prerequisite or a condition for relations between States."
"In any event, this is the rapporteur’s opinion when he calls for this Agreement to be concluded."
"Consequently, I voted in favour."
". The title of the explanatory statement of this report, ‘Employment: a European Ambition’, sounds like a sad joke when we know that there are 16 million unemployed in the European Union, and 5 million more if we take account of the new Member States."
"Europe is, however, one of the richest regions on the planet."
"The fact that old industrial nations such as Great Britain, Germany or France, which have further enriched themselves by pillaging the whole planet, are incapable of providing regular work and an adequate income for each member of society is a sign of ailing social organisation."
"What the European Parliament proposes administering to the patient are the same snake-oil remedies, couched in mainly empty words, as are applied by the national States, ranging from the promise of training to proposed subsidies for certain sectors."
"In this economic system, production and employment are the monopolies of a minority of capital holders who would have to be compelled to create jobs, but neither the Member States nor the European institutions are considering any such compulsion, any more than they are doing so where public services are concerned."
"We voted against these so-called ‘employment policies’, which are at best indecisive declarations and really just an excuse to give employers additional subsidies."
". Whilst it is said that employment is one of Europe’s ambitions, the primacy of monetary policies, and in particular the Stability Pact, prevents us, regrettably, from prioritising jobs."
"In fact, the opposite is true; all we have are statements of intent to please the public."
"Where, indeed, are the practical measures to achieve full employment, to improve job quality and productivity and to enhance social cohesion and integration?"
"Unemployment continues to rise in the European Union – by 1.5 million between 2002 and 2003."
"The number of multinational company relocations continues to rise, a phenomenon, which, in Portugal, has already led to thousands of job losses."
"Poverty and social exclusion continue to rise."
"Social inequality continues to rise, caused by liberalisation and privatisation, which have speeded up following the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy, especially in Portugal."
"Against this backdrop, we could not vote in favour of this report."
". – The Lisbon guidelines, the decisions by the Spring Summit and the guidelines in the Commission communication constitute the framework for a violent attack on the workers."
"In the name of competitiveness and productivity, the aim is to reduce labour costs or non-wage costs, for which read step up exploitation and overturn social security rights."
"Strict prudence, freezing/reducing wages/pensions and new privileges for businesses are being imposed, for the sake of the profits of big business."
"ΕU employment policy aims to replace full/stable work with partial and temporary employment and, at the same time, overturn basic employment, wage and social security rights under the misleading title coined in Lisbon of 'sustainable development and full employment'."
"The 8-hour day and collective agreements are under attack and the renting out of workers, a slave trade, unacceptably low pay and increased profits for the plutocracy are being imposed."
"The millions of unemployed are now being joined by millions of underemployed."
"These policies have not solved and cannot solve the unemployment problem, nor do they establish rights to safeguard the right to full/stable employment, because the real causes lie in the laws by which capitalism itself moves and operates."
"We support the workers' fight to overturn these policies and claim a different, grass-roots orientated policy with enhanced social rights and higher pay in keeping with modern requirements."
". The recent Commission report presented to the Brussels European Council, concerning the state of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, reveals alarming delays and gaps, both in terms of the transposition of the in question, and of raising awareness among Member States of the need to meet the ambitious targets that have been set, especially on the theme of ‘more and better jobs’."
"The increase in unemployment in Europe is certainly disappointing."
"The citizens of Europe as a whole, and those in Portugal in particular, demand more rigorous action from the European Union and the credibility of the process depends on reforms being stepped up at Member State level."
"It is essential that we improve the monitoring of national performance (...)."
"It is, therefore, an increasingly ‘urgent’ priority, as the Commission has, indeed, acknowledged, to make the entire European project more credible, and to act with greater determination."
"Priority must be given to helping young people enter the labour market and get their first job; to penalising fraud arising from the phenomenon of relocation; to preparing for technological and economic change, by exploiting new areas of work in the field of information technology; to taking practical steps to promote and encourage vocational training courses – including lifelong learning, by simplifying the procedures for access to funding; and to improving ways of disseminating best practice."
"Mr President, when I arrived in this Parliament, 18 years ago, in a situation very different from the one that is allowing me to speak now, and even before financial perspectives were discussed, there were already arguments about own resources and the Spanish Socialists were already fighting for idea of a citizens' graduated tax system."
"Therefore, in the vote on the report by Mr Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I voted with the French Socialists and with the Spanish Socialists in favour of the idea that, before enlargement, the Committee on Budgets – and this Parliament also – should have promoted the idea that to finance this Union, this Community, the easiest thing is to do it on the basis that everyone must pay, under a tax system which the citizen understands and which is not based on the tax-paying capacity of the States, but on the incomes of each of our fellow citizens."
". We believe that the EU’s forthcoming budget should give priority to sustainable growth, in line with the Lisbon strategy, and support for the new Member States so that the historically important enlargement is a success."
"The budget’s priorities must be changed so that less money is invested in agricultural aid."
"We are, at the same time, anxious about budget discipline and critical of the Commission’s proposed increases in expenditure."
"In this situation, we do not wish to express an opinion on the precise levels to be achieved by the new budget, partly because the priorities have not been established at this early stage and partly because we do not wish to tie the new Parliament to precise figures."
"Where military action is concerned, we believe that this must be decided at national level."
"Peacemaking efforts must take place within UN mandates."
". The members of the Venstre, or Liberal, group present in the European Parliament voted against Amendments Nos 17 and 18."
"Basically, we think that the Commission’s proposal is too expensive."
"It is too early, however, to tie ourselves to a percentage limit at a time when we do not know more about the political content of the future financial perspectives."
". I voted against this report for the following reasons:"
"Firstly, I believe that the Commission’s proposal for a financial framework for 2007 to 2013 is patently inadequate in terms of ensuring social and economic cohesion in an enlarged EU and of meeting our commitments to the least developed countries of the world."
"Secondly, I am opposed to the political objectives of the established framework, which are already in line with the so-called ‘European Constitution’, and which reinforce the federalism, the neo-liberalism, the militarism and the excessively security-conscious face of the enlarged EU."
"Thirdly, this report is ambiguous and implicitly accepts the Commission’s proposal."
"Lastly, I am opposed to extending the British correction mechanism to the remaining net contributors, and to replacing current national budget contributions with some kind of European tax."
"I am, therefore, sorry that the amendments we tabled were rejected."
"I welcome the fact, however, that Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 16, 17 and 18, which were intended to restrict the average annual Community budget to a maximum of 1% of Community GNP – in line with the wishes of the signatories of the ‘Letter of the Six’ – and to renationalise, or, to put it more accurately, to do away with the Community regional policy."
". The Netherlands is a significant net contributor to the European Union."
"Unfortunately the reason for this is rarely discussed."
"To start with, much of the European Union's imports arrive through the port of Rotterdam."
"The relevant import duties are levied by Dutch customs and then transferred to Brussels; in fact, none of this is Dutch money."
"A second reason lies in the agreements reached in Berlin by Mr Kok and Mr Zalm in 1999."
"The outcome of these agreements is that Dutch agriculture now receives much less from the Brussels coffers than before."
"Dutch farmers account for 7% of European agricultural production."
"In 1999 the Netherlands still received 3.5% of the European agriculture budget, but by 2004 this had fallen to 2.1%."
"In addition, the Netherlands receives only 1.2% of rural development funds because the then Dutch Government set a low priority on this issue during the negotiations."
"The best way of improving the Netherlands' position as a net contributor is to ensure that in future the Netherlands receives a greater share of European Union agricultural and rural funds."
"In the end it is not The Hague but the Dutch countryside that pays the European bill."
"Correcting the flaws in the Berlin Agreement is the best way of restoring the Netherlands to its rightful position in the European Union."
"That is far better than now restricting expenditure to just 1% of European GNP."
". Enlargement is an historic event for which we Liberals have been working for a long time."
"We are aware of the fact that there is a cost to enlargement and that this must be funded jointly."
"Naturally, we must show solidarity with our new Member States."
"Before we increase the budget, we must, however, review what can be cut down on, since the present budget is anything but watertight."
"The holes must be filled before we demand further funds."
"Where tax money is concerned, it does not matter what level of society we are talking about."
"We need to nurture people’s confidence."
"That is why the EU must set a good example by making better and more efficient use of already existing resources."
". We voted against the Commission proposal and the report on the budgetary means of the enlarged Union for 2007-2013 because we disagree with core approaches to resources and objectives which they are called on to serve."
"These objectives express basic choices of big business: the promotion of the anti-labour forecasts and arrangements of the Lisbon process, on the pretext of combating unemployment, support for and massive enlargement of a supranational and uncontrolled mechanism for prosecuting grass-roots movements, on the pretext of security, and the strengthening and militarisation of the ΕU, on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"We condemn the endeavour to reduce the resources available for social and regional cohesion, however fake these objectives may have proven to be, and to increase resources to serve plans to wage war on and persecute the peoples of the ΕU and third countries."
"We are against reflecting in future Community resources the principle of dealing at national level with the consequences of policies decided at Community level and we are against calling on the peoples to foot the bill twice."
"The solution to the problems of the peoples of the Member States of the ΕU does not lie in a few pennies more or less; it lies in the fight by the workers for radical change to the policies exercised by their governments and the ΕU, in the fight for the sovereignty of grass-roots choices against those of big business."
". I voted in favour."
"A financial framework for a multiannual period (from 2007 until 2013, or a minimum period of five years), arising from the adoption of the financial perspectives, has undeniably lent financial and political stability to the European Union’s actions."
"Against this backdrop, the expectations of administrative operators, Member States and the public have resulted in efficiency gains and have led to more ambitious and significant projects."
"The European Commission is proposing to meet three strategically crucial aims of the forthcoming financial perspective: to improve competitiveness, growth potential and territorial cohesion, to establish an area of security, freedom and justice and to develop external relations."
"These aims will hopefully not be thwarted by the proposed top-down approach set out in the ‘Letter of the Six’, which seeks, primarily, to set an upper limit, as distinct from the bottom-up approach – which identifies political priorities and assesses needs and amounts required – as proposed by the Commission."
"I warmly welcome the rapporteur’s work and would like to quote a most apt question that she poses: ‘is it fair to pretend that the amounts proposed allow matching resources to needs, especially the goals of Lisbon for growth and employment in an enlarged Union?’"
"I should like to mention at this juncture that the Bradbourn proposal for an amendment was resoundingly rejected – more than two-thirds voted against – and..."
". A question mark may be placed over how useful the cohesion policy will prove to be in an enlarged Union."
"Even though the cohesion policy has been beneficial for certain countries such as Portugal, Spain or even Greece or Ireland in a Europe of 15 Member States, it can only arouse our concern in a Europe of 27 Member States."
"With a population increasing from 68 to 116 million people, socio-economic disparities will double and the average GDP of the Union will fall by 12.5%."
"What, moreover, can be said about employment in the current difficult context?"
"This enlargement can therefore only be accompanied by a general reduction in financing, in particular for the existing Member States."
"Furthermore, the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions (CPNT) members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities believe that the disappearance of the Community initiative known as Leader + is particularly regrettable since the cohesion policy will now focus on cities to the detriment of rural areas."
"The increasing desertification of these areas therefore appears, unfortunately, to be inevitable."
"For all these reasons, we shall vote against this report."
". I voted in favour of the report."
"Solidarity between the peoples of the European Union, economic and social progress and the strengthening of cohesion feature among the European Union’s general objectives."
"For many, the main fear elicited by enlargement is that of seeing the regional funds currently available in the fifteen Member States disappear to the sole benefit of the ten new members."
"Although this solidarity is at the core of the European contract, under no circumstances could partnership be abandoned."
"The European Union must continue its support in the regions of the Fifteen affected in particular by natural geographic handicaps."
"I am thinking in particular of mountain regions."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament cannot remain idle on this issue."
"For a long time, the mountains have been comprehensively ignored by European programmes."
"These areas have many resources. They require special attention in the agricultural sector (aid for the countryside and for young farmers) and within the framework of sustainable tourism development, as well as requiring specific support for SMEs (to avoid desertification and protect employment) and support for maintaining services."
"The success of these guidelines hinges upon the European budget, which must match the ambitions we have set ourselves."
". – The report again finds that EU regional policy has failed."
"There are still huge inequalities in the development of several areas, while the prospects for the poorer Member States are unpropitious."
"With enlargement, due to the purely statistical approach, numerous areas in the existing Member States risk being excluded from funding."
"In Greece, for example, four areas will not be funded under the fourth CSF, while another three are on the borderline."
"These areas account for 75% of the country's population and to date most of them were eligible Objective 1 areas, with acute and increasing social and economic problems which the proposed transitional 'temporary support' will only extend."
"Greece is a typical example for another reason: the promotion and concentration of resources in certain areas, such as Attica, which exacerbates the wider regional problem of the over-concentration of the population in the towns."
"At the same time, while there is a great deal of talk about supporting remote areas, the ΕU continues without justification – and despite our repeated proposals – to exempt the Aegean islands from special treatment for remote areas, despite the very serious problems they face."
"'Cohesion' and 'increasing levels of development' clash in practice with the policies which preach them, in that these policies serve big business."
"In practice, only divergence, marginalisation, unemployment and underdevelopment can be created."
". I agree with the overall thrust of Mr Hatzidakis’s report."
"I must, however, register my disappointment at the treatment of the outermost regions, and in particular Madeira and the Canary Islands."
"A common approach to the outermost regions, as provided for in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, is conspicuous by its absence from the Commission’s proposals."
"I feel that it is inadequate merely to allude to a specific programme being established to offset the particular difficulties faced by the outermost regions, or to implement a ['wider European neighbourhood'] action aimed at facilitating cooperation with their neighbouring countries."
"These instruments strike me as inadequate, given that when it comes to the crucial issue, it does not make sense, for example, for any future phasing out applied to Madeira and the Canaries to be exactly the same as that applied to continental European regions."
"Where, then, is the special access to structural funds, as provided for in Article 299(2) of the Treaty?"
"We are aware of the permanent handicaps affecting the outermost regions."
"We know how those handicaps seriously hamper their development."
"We know that the outermost regions are, accordingly, the parts of Europe that have the greatest difficulty in making the most of opportunities arising from the great internal market and from the impending enlargement."
"For these reasons I should like to ask the Commission to think again about..."
". The European Parliament appears to be edging towards agreement as to the funding of future regional policy."
"A majority wants more money for the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"That will allow payments to the richest Member States to be held in check, not depriving the currently poorest Member States, and giving priority to the new Member States as they will for the time being have the lowest standard of living."
"The thinking behind this is that the European Union will be more popular if everybody gets more."
"It is expected that a Union that is generous to everyone will be looked on favourably by public opinion, the broadest section of society and local authorities."
"So we still see placards wherever a project is being co-funded by the European Union publicising the fact."
"The question of whether the money in question actually becomes available is not raised."
"Far less the question of whether these projects, many of which are undoubtedly beneficial, are most usefully conducted via the intervention of European officials and with European money."
"EU funds can be better targeted at development aid to help those lagging behind."
"Less money and less bureaucracy can produce better results."
"All other projects should revert to the Member States."
". Past experience has shown clearly that the policy of economic and social cohesion can make a significant contribution towards developing a region, provided that the provision of resources is reflected in high-quality projects."
"Such projects can have a major impact in an area, and this has, fortunately, been the case in Portugal."
"The unanimous support given to this report in the relevant committee also reflects the wide consensus among European citizens in favour of genuine European social cohesion throughout the European Union."
"More specifically, I welcome the confirmation of principles such as, for example, the need to retain temporary phasing-in support, which will vary between 85% and 60%, for regions that no longer belong to Objective 1, because they are victims of what is known as the statistical effect of the limit of 75% of GDP being reduced due to enlargement."
"I am also pleased that the Cohesion Fund is to be maintained as a support mechanism for major projects in the sectors of transport and the environment in Member States whose GNP is below 90% of the Community average."
"I applaud the particular emphasis given to the needs of the outermost regions and of regions with the greatest structural problems."
"Lastly, I welcome the move to encourage the various procedures to be simplified effectively and efficiently, as far as possible, since these often represent major obstacles to the implementation of programmes and projects."
"Naturally, I voted in favour."
"Mr President, in 18 years I have also heard Mr Balfe speak on very many occasions and almost always I have held opinions on the subjects he has spoken about."
"Today I have the opportunity to speak on an amendment to the Kuckelkorn report which he has presented, in which Mr Balfe once more asks that he be treated as a European official."
"But he is not telling the whole truth."
"He forgot to mention that European officials – a body from which I am proud to come – only have one social security system."
"The honourable Members – amongst whom I now find myself – also only have one."
"He is asking for another one, so if he wants to go on asking for privileges in addition to those provided by the laws and regulations of his own country, let him do so."
"But since – as I hope and believe – he will not come back as an MEP in the next session, I urge Mr Balfe to prepare himself for an examination to become a European official and thereby obtain everything he has repeatedly been asking for."
"Your timing is impeccable, but I am a bit worried that you will try to become another Mr Fatuzzo."
". The main function of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is, in conjunction with the European Investment Fund, to support capital investment that promotes sustainable development and economic and social cohesion."
"It provides financing for small businesses (45% of the overall total of loans), for research, for environmental protection and for basic infrastructure."
"Of course, these projects go hand in hand with the Community regional policy, but the EIB also supports the implementation of the Lisbon neo-liberal agenda."
"For the first time, the EIB is to present to Parliament its Supervisory Committee’s report, which complements its annual report, and this is something that we welcome."
"We must, however, look carefully at the doubts raised as to the competence of the bank’s management and at accusations of a lack of transparency at the EIB."
"Parliamentary control must be strengthened."
"We therefore welcome the decision to hold a public hearing in Autumn 2004 into the EIB’s activities and political guidelines."
"I am unhappy that the information published by the EIB on its website is presented in only three Community languages."
"Given the range of the EIB’s work, information on it should be available in all of the Community’s official languages."
"Mr President, I wish to give an explanation of vote to explain my extreme concern over the Eurostat scandal and the European Commission's failure to take responsibility."
"Five years ago, almost to the day, the Santer Commission was forced to resign because it was 'difficult to find anyone with the slightest sense of responsibility'."
"That caused the collapse of the previous Commission."
"Nothing has changed, because no one has been prepared to take responsibility for Eurostat."
"Despite the fact that EUR 5 million has gone missing; despite the fact that money has been channelled into bogus research by bogus companies, some of which it appears are owned by senior members of Eurostat; despite the fact that taxpayers' money appears to have been channelled into staff perks – such as a riding school and a volleyball team – we have seen no resignations from the Commission over this issue and no acceptance of responsibility."
"Mr Solbes Mira's response seems to be just that he did not know what was happening."
"This seems to be a charter for Commissioners just to tell their civil servants not to inform them of the dubious activities going on in their departments, so that, on the basis of the Commission's analysis, the Commissioner will get off scot-free."
"We know that Mr Solbes Mira has resigned from the Commission but not over this issue, so there is still a complete failure on the part of the European Commission to take responsibility for this waste of taxpayers' money."
"That is a matter of extreme concern to me and my British Conservative colleagues."
"I hope that before our vote on the motion of censure in May the Commission will accept its responsibility and do something serious to take responsibility for Eurostat and to clean up the EU and stop the unacceptable waste and abuse of taxpayers' money."
". We voted in favour of this resolution, because asking the European Commission for explanations regarding the management of Eurostat, in the same way as regarding all other activities or decisions, is the least we can do."
"We are in favour of all institutions operating with total transparency and of the whole population being able to monitor not only the decisions taken, but also the reasons for which they are taken."
". There are aspects of the Eurostat affair – nepotism, conflicts of interest, secret accounts – that are redolent of the situation that led to the resignation of the previous Commission."
"Fraud and irregularities exceeded EUR 6 million, which in some cases is probably only the tip of the iceberg."
"This affair has also shed light on serious problems and irregularities in working methods and internal monitoring, on the part of both the Commission and OLAF, such as the lack of effective enforcement of existing rules."
"The Commissioners directly involved must not be allowed to get away scot-free."
"It is appalling that the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat has not accepted political responsibility and that the Commission President has not asked him to resign."
"This fresh case shows, among other things, how the outsourcing of services by the Commission readily lends itself to such situations."
"The very least we can hope for, once again, is that the Commission learns its lessons and tells us how it proposes to avoid a repeat of this type of problem in the future."
". I voted against the ‘Eurostat resolution’ to protest against the way Parliament acted in this affair."
"At the root of the ‘scandal’ are accusations by certain newspapers regarding ‘misappropriation of funds’, ‘personal enrichment’ and ‘nepotism’ on the part of Eurostat managers."
"Certain fellow Members in need of publicity demanded the heads of four Commissioners."
"Even though the final report on the enquiry conducted by OLAF, promised for June 2003, is still not available, the resolution indicates that the ‘scandal’ is limited to breaches of procedures."
"Procedures are important."
"Our Union, however, is in the process of multiplying procedures to the point where there will soon be more inspectors than people being inspected."
"Meanwhile, and on dubious grounds, the reputations and careers of many Eurostat officials have been destroyed."
"More than 400 people have lost their jobs."
"Parliament is content with an innocuous and useless resolution."
". In July 2003 the European Commission suspended the activities of the managers of the statistical office Eurostat as frauds which had been brought to light some time ago were still continuing."
"At that point I immediately demanded transparent action."
"Investigations by bodies dependent on the Commission are pointless as they have to keep their findings secret."
"Fraud, embezzlement and nepotism will only be prevented in the future if public opinion is properly informed and able to form a view."
"This could be done by a parliamentary inquiry."
"At the end of September 2003 a secret report was submitted to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and still the European Commission acts as if it bore no responsibility in the matter."
"The person first appointed to handle the matter, Commissioner Solbes, is now a Minister in the new Spanish Government."
"All efforts are being made to prevent discussion of a motion of censure against the European Commission signed by me and others."
"Malicious delay in placing this issue on the agenda means that this motion cannot be put to a vote this week."
"After 1 May the number of signatories will fall to below 10% as a result of enlargement of this Parliament."
"The chairman of the Green Group has called on his members to sink this initiative by withdrawing their signatures."
"The problems of 1999 persist, but the Prodi Commission is now ignoring them."
". We voted in favour of the report, despite our not agreeing with the extremely watered down way in which it describes the stranglehold of big business upon the means of expression, everywhere making little more than a nonsense of the term ‘freedom of expression’."
"Mr Berlusconi, who is both Prime Minister and one of the largest Italian press magnates, is, in himself, almost a caricature of this stranglehold exercised by big business over the media."
". The British Labour Members voted against paragraph 53."
"We do not accept the criticisms and overall content of this paragraph."
"Nonetheless, we voted in favour of the resolution with our reservation, due to the importance of this timely report."
". The media holdings of Silvio Berlusconi are far from ideal and could cause a conflict of interest."
"However, this report is far from balanced."
"The title alone must suggest that freedom of expression and information are in question in Italy under the Berlusconi government."
"That is stretching a point to say the least."
"Practically all strands of political opinion in Italy are represented by their own newspapers."
"RAI, the State broadcaster, gives a voice both to the majority and the opposition."
"Indeed, even Berlusconi's own vehicles express criticism of the government."
"We in Belgium, where as in many other Member States, the media is concentrated in a small number of hands, can only dream of this."
"A certain trend in left-wing opinion is very unhappy at the idea that they cannot entirely monopolise the media."
"The existence of a right-wing, or apparently right-wing, counter-force in the media is seen by them as unacceptable provocation."
"That is the spirit emanating from this report."
". We are concerned at the growing concentration of media ownership among an ever-decreasing number of companies."
"As has been highlighted, the highest concentration of the audiovisual market anywhere in Europe is in Italy, where the market is dominated by two players, RAI and Mediaset."
"Criticism of the situation in Italy must not, however, be used to deflect attention from what is happening in other countries."
"In Portugal, more than one hundred of the main national media organisations are in the hands of half a dozen large companies, which, at the very least, is an alarming state of affairs."
"Freedom of expression, access to information and freedom of employment are all in danger; this is the logic of business taken to extremes."
"This reality is reflected in the concerted assault by neo-liberal policies, of which media domination is one weapon."
"The media is, indeed, one of the areas in which the battle over ideology and class domination is most obviously being fought."
"Everything must be done, through legislation and other means, to reverse the situation, to reduce the excesses and abuses taking place, and staunchly to defend public radio and television worthy of the name."
". Ownership of or control over newspapers, television and websites is becoming increasingly important in managing information and propaganda."
"If all media become concentrated in the same hands then we will be going back to the days in the past when the media had less reach and often a monopoly was created involving the authorities, a powerful party, the Church or a regional publisher."
"People only heard one opinion as to what was good or bad, and how society should develop."
"Government and big business are still trying to achieve that."
"In Spain recently the previous government tried to shift the blame for three major bomb attacks onto a separatist movement rather than an international movement because that would be better for them in the elections."
"In Italy, the Prime Minister controls the commercial company MEDIASET as its owner and the State-run company RAI thanks to his role in government."
"The Christian Democrat group shies away from criticising this situation and have attempted to keep this topic off the agenda by ignoring the problems, holding endless procedural debates and submitting enormous numbers of amendments."
"They are abusing democracy in order to abolish democracy."
"I support the rapporteur in her attempts to deal with cable monopolies as well and to push for statutory measures aimed at protecting freedom and diversity of opinion in the media."
". We would fully welcome – and indeed we would have done so a long time ago – a serious and fitting condemnation of illegality and lack of democracy – not just concerning correct and acceptable information."
"On the specific point of information, our complaint about the current situation in Italy would have been, and indeed is, much more radical, but this is due to the fact that Mr Berlusconi, who put himself forward as an alternative to the Italian situation of contempt for the law and even for democracy in Italy, has today become the last in a long line of those who, for a second time, risk bringing a type of Italian disease to Europe."
"Those who have today accused Mr Berlusconi are the very ones who for decades created, practised and imposed what is at the root of what still happens today and what is clearly getting worse in Italy."
"This is why, together with other radical Members, I voted against the Boogerd-Quaak report."
". Regretting that the motion was rejected, I would like to finish presenting the arguments interrupted when the motion was presented in plenary."
"Some say that the subject of the report is covered by Article 7 of the Treaty."
"In that case, however, we should have acted accordingly, which we have not done."
"Others say that the report has its basis in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Even if, however, this were already in force, note should be taken of Article 51 – retained, moreover, in the draft Constitution – according to which the Charter is applicable to the European institutions and the Member States only in the case of national actions implementing Community law."
"In fact, that is not the case here."
"Finally, this report is not there to settle an Italian issue."
"It is clear to everyone that this is an Italian dispute, but we must specifically refrain from interfering in national conflicts, whether they break out in Italy or in any other Member State."
"This resolution tries dangerously to usurp powers that do not belong to us."
"It is detrimental to us all."
"It represents an injustice and a threat."
"We must, moreover, be very aware that an injustice caused to one Member State – in this case, Italy and other Member States mentioned – is always a threat hanging over the heads of us all."
"It is a threat to democracy. It is a threat to the rule of law."
". This report is worthy of our full attention and represents a serious breach of the law, as I made clear at the end of the vote in the parliamentary committee and in plenary when I tabled motions of inadmissibility and for the matter to be referred back to the committee."
"Because I was shocked by the flagrant violation of European law, imposed by the left-wing ‘dictatorship of the majority’, I did not take part in the vote, in line with the outcome of discussions between the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"This situation has had a genuinely tortuous history, which began last summer."
"Since last summer, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, claims to have used the procedure laid down in Article 7(1) of the Treaty as a means of demonstrating supposed violations of freedom of expression and of information in Italy."
"They did no such thing, however, and, in any event, such an attitude is disgraceful."
"What this amounts to is a purely political attack on the Italian Government and, as such, it is appalling that Parliament has been hijacked for this purpose."
"Furthermore, the subsidiarity principle has clearly been violated."
"We cannot allow Parliament to be used to mount purely political attacks or to impose its will on the sovereignty of States."
". This matter includes a number of important points concerning the need for media pluralism, the value of protecting consumers through transparency in advertising, and the right of reply."
"Moreover, criticism was directed against the ownership structure and the concentration of power within the Swedish media."
"The basic problem, however, is that, through a dubious issue of procedure, Parliament was not given the opportunity to vote on the amendments that had been tabled and that were aimed at improving the report."
"No less than 338 amendments had been submitted to plenary, and not a single one of them was debated."
"Most of these amendments came from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, as a result of the proposals never having been put to the vote, the PPE-DE Group chose not to take part in the vote."
"I agree with the PPE-DE Group’s criticism to the effect that the amendments should have been debated in plenary, but I nonetheless think that it is the duty of each elected Member to take part in the vote."
"I therefore chose to participate by consistently abstaining in all the votes, including the final vote."
". I would like to underline the legitimacy of this report."
"One of the roles of the European Parliament is to use its legitimacy as a representative voice of the citizens of the Union constantly to promote and defend fundamental rights."
"Freedom of expression and information necessarily implies pluralism of the media, especially the audio-visual media."
"We therefore find ourselves faced with a real European problem, since this pluralism of the media, which is absolutely essential both for cultural diversity and for democracy, is still not guaranteed."
"The Italian example, characterised by almost exclusive control by the same person, in his capacity both as Prime Minister and as a private owner, is unfortunately only the most flagrant and grotesque example of what is in danger of happening to us all if measures are not taken quickly."
"In this regard, we can only wonder about this Commission and this Council, which do not hesitate to take heavy-handed action, for example in dismantling the public rail service – as we see again today – in the name of the fight against monopolies in the single market and of supposed benefits for users, but which seem paralysed when it comes to preventing private monopolies in television."
"Mr President, many of us today have voted for the trade agreement with Pakistan in the belief that this is a sensible and essential step forward to progress the issue of human rights and further democratisation of Pakistan."
"It may at first seem a little peculiar to see who is voting on the one hand for the trade agreement while at the same time supporting the resolution on the issue of human rights in Pakistan."
"I do not believe there is a contradiction."
"The votes today are quite sensible and straightforward."
"We have pushed forward the issue of developing economic and trade links with Pakistan."
"We have pushed forward the issue of developing Pakistan's economy which, I believe, was an important step in ensuring that we will see further democratisation in Pakistan, further work towards the development of human rights, and fulfilment of the demands made in our second resolution which I was happy to support."
"It is a good day for Pakistan, for Kashmir, and for the Indian subcontinent and I am very pleased to have been here today."
". The resolution on which we voted today concerning the state of human rights and democracy in Pakistan, should be viewed in the context of the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on partnership and development."
"Voting in favour thus entails, first and foremost, being perfectly aware of the serious breaches of human rights and democracy that occur in Pakistan and, consequently, exerting on Pakistan all the pressure that we can and must exert in order to reverse that trend."
"Additionally, the resolution has enabled those people who fight for human rights and democracy to vote in favour of signing the Agreement."
"Given that human rights and democracy are two of the main aims of the European Union – and ones to which I subscribe completely – they must be seen as such: as aims and not as conditions for relations between countries."
"The pragmatic context of international relations would justify such prerequisites, but the countries involved would become isolated, and therefore unable to persuade other countries to meet these aims."
"This explains why I voted as I did."
". I have chosen to vote against entering into this cooperation agreement with Pakistan because of the absence of human rights in the country, for example in the area of religious freedom, with the Christian minority living under difficult conditions."
"The Pakistani regime chooses to continue to give the military major influence over the country, and this at the expense of more democratic development."
"The development of events is worrying, especially in the light of the fact that the Senate has passed new constitutional laws that extend the military’s influence and make it a permanent feature."
"Moreover, the regime has chosen to imprison opponents."
"Given that the European Union has a major responsibility for promoting human rights in the world and the fact that these values are to form the basis of cooperation agreements with third countries, I find it illogical that the European Parliament has now, for all that, recommended this agreement."
". The resolution before us reflects the contradictions of current relations between the various countries of the EU and the USA."
"By failing to point out the seriousness of the international situation – of which the most glaring examples are the unacceptable military occupation of Iraq and the impossible situation in Palestine – and by making only mild criticism of the USA, the resolution reaffirms the desire to reach an understanding with the USA to join forces to dominate the world."
"Once again, the need is stressed for a ‘well-balanced partnership’, the ‘division of tasks’, ‘burden sharing’, creating a ‘community of action’ with common priorities (, the UN, the Middle East, terrorism, the proliferation of WMD, China, Russia and the International Criminal Court), completing the ‘Transatlantic Market’ by 2015’, strengthening NATO and militarising the EU as its ‘European pillar’, developing Transatlantic defence companies and markets, and so forth."
"It is significant that, at a time when the Spanish Government has taken the decision to withdraw its troops from Iraq, the majority of Parliament chooses not to adopt a position."
"This is understandable."
"At a time when the major powers are seeking to overcome their differences by legitimising the occupation of Iraq with a UN resolution, the resistance of the Iraqi people to the occupying forces and the clearly expressed will of the Spanish people are obstacles to overcoming those differences."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party reiterates that if we want to pursue our policies of multilateralism then positive engagement with the United States is required, not simply criticism in areas where there is disagreement."
"In particular, pre-emptory withdrawal of troops from Iraq would simply further threaten the security of the Iraqi people."
"The solution can only lie in the transfer of political control, working with the support of the United Nations, in order to support the emergence of a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Iraq."
".– The resolution on Transatlantic relations proposes strengthening cooperation between the ΕU and the USA, through the creation of 'a long-term collaborative framework for cooperation and the launching of a joint Action Programme', including in the military sector, the main pretext being 'the Fight on Terrorism'."
"Of course, it does not fail to formulate a wish list about the need for this fight to be carried out with respect for 'human rights', but it does not say a word about the drastic measures for restricting individual rights which have been launched."
"At a time when the aggression of the USA has exceeded all precedents, the resolution comes to silence all those, including in Greece, who insist on seeing the ΕU as a worthy opponent of the USA and ΝΑΤΟ, stressing that 'ΝΑΤΟ remains a fundamental guarantee of transatlantic stability and security' and that the ESDP will be developed 'to complement ΝΑΤΟ' and will be its 'substantial reinforcement'."
"Despite the fact that the report also formulates proposals for controlling arms, it remains a report which is absolutely in keeping with the new imperialist order."
". We have today voted on the report on human rights in the world in 2003 and the EU’s policy on the matter."
"It is in many ways a good analysis with well-formulated conclusions."
"We believe, however, that the report should have been confined to those areas of human freedoms and rights that are part of the UN Charter."
"By extending the report and introducing new so-called human rights with the character of social rights, the demands for traditional human freedoms and rights and the criticism of countries that do not comply with these are weakened."
"We are not, for example, opposed to social rights, dependent upon a country’s economic conditions."
"The position of the disabled is, of course, infinitely better in Sweden than in poor countries such as Bangladesh and Laos."
"There is, however, no reason for taking a less serious view of violations of human and democratic freedoms and rights, just because these are committed in poor countries."
". Whilst I agree with numerous points in this annual parliamentary report, I must highlight the way in which I believe it is being used, yet again, as a political tool, whereby countries considered ‘friends’ are protected and others singled out as targets by the USA or by the EU are subject to criticism; a clear case of double standards."
"Nevertheless, this year it expresses ‘grave concern at the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’."
"Despite holding the Israeli Government and the Palestinian people almost equally responsible – a position to which I am strongly opposed – it does condemn the assassinations carried out by Israel and the ongoing Israeli activity to establish settlements, which includes allowing settlers illegally to move into the occupied territories."
"There is mild criticism of the continued expropriation of land for the construction of the so-called ‘security fence’."
"This is the very least we can do, in light of the denial by the Israeli Government, with the complicity and support of the USA, of the most basic rights of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to the most brutal violence."
"As for the brutal aggression and occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies, not one word in the report..."
". – 2003 was an even blacker year for human rights, a year in which the people of Iraq were subject to the unprovoked and murderous attack of the USA and its European allies, while the people of Afghanistan and the Balkans continue to sigh and bleed beneath the boot of the conquerors."
"The crude interventions by the imperialist powers, with the fomentation of conflict in every corner of the world, are a daily occurrence."
"The murder of the Palestinian people continues."
"Human rights are trampled over on a daily basis, while poverty and misery in both the third world and the developed countries grow worse."
"The ΕU and other imperialist centres bear almost sole responsibility for this situation."
"The resolution, despite its positive references, states that 'progress has been made' on respect for human rights, 'in particular through the European Union's commitment'."
"At the same time, it fully supports the hysterical stance of the EU and the USA on terrorism and says nothing about the trampling underfoot, on the pretext of combating terrorism, of basic democratic and social freedoms or the countless violations of the USA, simply hinting at some, without saying who is responsible, with the exception of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay."
"For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not vote for the report."
"We express our support for the peoples who are fighting against the New Order for their rights."
"The report before us is an annual report, which is wide-ranging and addresses a variety of subjects and should be analysed with great care."
"The original version of the report focused on just three areas and contained some provisions that were entirely out of place, particularly in areas such as terrorism and so-called reproductive health."
"The rapporteur accepted a large number of amendments, which led to this less unbalanced version."
"The various situations highlighted in the ‘new’ report are, nevertheless, almost all taken out of context."
"The document contains issues that do not fall under the traditional concept of ‘human rights’; indeed, they go far beyond the original meaning."
"I voted against the report."
"I object to the way in which the report has far exceeded its scope."
"I cannot allow the European Union to use this method – endeavouring to bring, on a permanent basis, all other kinds of rights under the umbrella of ‘human rights’ – to find an easy way of extending its scope for action."
"It is wrong for the EU to seek to increase its competences by means of deliberately blurring concepts which, in turn, makes it more difficult effectively to safeguard fundamental human rights."
"What we are seeing is a clever move that will subtly pave the way for the European Union to deem the most diverse fields ‘human rights’ and to intervene in any area it wishes."
".– The procedure to repeat the trial of Leyla Zana and her three other Kurdish fellow members of the Turkish parliament, at the request of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, was a parody of a trial just like the original proceedings which sentenced her to 15 years in prison for 'crimes' of opinion."
"The new judgment against Leyla Zana and her three fellow members is a fresh insult to the European Parliament, which honoured Leyla Zana with the Sakharov prize in 1995, it is an insult to the European Court of Human Rights and it is an insult to European law and civilisation."
"As long as Leyla Zana and her fellow members remain in prison in Turkey, as long as people are being sentenced for crimes of opinion, it is clear that any reforms in Turkey clash with the deeply conservative state."
"We expect the Commission, in view of the report on Turkey to be issued towards the end of the year, to multiply its efforts to bring about the release of Leyla Zana and a general amnesty for prisoners being detained for 'crimes' of opinion."
". I am appalled by the decision by the State Security Court in Ankara to reconfirm the fifteen-year prison sentences, first handed down in 1994, to Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak, Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin representing the Democracy Party (DEP), due to their activities in support of the fundamental rights of Kurdish people."
"This was a disgraceful decision that brought to a close a new trial, begun on 28 March 2003, which was the result of a concerted international campaign to free Leyla Zana and her fellow MPs."
"The fresh trial had been prompted by the 2001 ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, which noted the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court, and breaches of the defendants’ rights, which were to occur again in this second trial."
"The European Union is called on simply to condemn this decision and to request that Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak be freed from prison."
"The verdict is an illustration of the current situation in Turkey, a country that wishes to accede to the European Union, but which has thousands of political prisoners, where the Kurdish people are denied the most basic rights and which continues its military occupation of part of Cyprus."
". By noting the continued stagnation of the European economy, the report takes the opposite view to the Commission."
"Unfortunately, the only aim of this realistic observation is to serve to justify the call for the Member States and the European institutions to come still more to the aid of the employers."
"It is somewhat comical to hear this Parliament, dominated though it is by defenders of the free-market economy and by destroyers of public services, resort to support from the state in coming to the aid of the European economy."
"In fact, this report describes what some Member States, such as France and Germany, are already doing."
"Whilst observing the Maastricht criteria, these countries are shamelessly running up their budget deficits in order to help those same employers who remain extremely determined to maintain, or even increase, their profits in a period of stagnation."
"Whether the Member States choose to support employers through inflation, that is to say by lowering purchasing power, or through budgetary austerity, that is to say by cutting back on public services, shedding jobs and freezing salaries, or through a combination of the two, it will in any case be the working classes that will pay."
"What you call your broad economic policy guidelines actually seek to reduce the share that the world of work has in the national revenue in order to increase the share of the wealthy class."
"Clearly, we cannot but denounce this policy and oppose it."
". We voted against this report because Parliament supports the monetary and budgetary orthodoxy – the neo-liberal politics – of the EU’s economic policy guidelines."
"The report maintains emphasis on the structural reforms of the Lisbon Strategy, such as measures to make the labour market more flexible, in other words making workers more adaptable and contractual provisions more pliable, which has led to greater insecurity in industrial relations."
"This is not all, however."
"The report paves the way for the private sector to enter the fields of pensions and health, at a time when over 1.5 million workers in the European Union have swelled the ranks of the unemployed since 2001, at a time when more and more companies are closing down and others relocating, and when the long-trumpeted upturn is taking its time to appear."
"The right approach would be a policy of economic regeneration, committed to reinvigorating production and labour, with the aim of promoting economic growth, jobs and social and economic cohesion."
"The Stability Pact and the process of liberalisation and privatisation must be suspended immediately; we must combat company relocations, promote productive investment and stop encouraging precarious contractual arrangements, such as short-term contracts."
"We were consequently very unhappy to see that our proposals were not included in the final resolution."
"That concludes the explanations of vote.(3)"
"(4)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0182/2004) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women in South-East Europe (2003/2128(INI))."
". – Mr President, as you know, following the fall of the Berlin wall, the area of south-east Europe was shaken by ethnic quarrels and armed violence, resulting in deep political, economic and social changes."
"In the report I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I present the situation of women in south-east Europe as configured during the transitional period, compared with the previous situation."
"My report complements the reports on relations between the Union and the countries of south-east Europe and the progress of these countries within the framework of the stabilisation and association agreements."
"My intention was to present an integrated picture of the position of women in an area in which there are important differences between countries, but a great deal of similarity in the problems which they face."
"The report focuses mainly on the following sectors: education and economic activity, participation in democratic institutions, violence against women and sexual exploitation, health and reproductive rights and trafficking in women and children."
"In most countries of the Balkans, there has of course been a considerable improvement in the situation of women over the last five years."
"Nonetheless, the basic problems remain and the question of addressing them is not very high on the political agenda of the countries in the area."
"There is no sign of change in numerous sectors and, where there is some change, it is very slow in coming."
"Armed conflicts, the perceptions of the regimes, traditional social prejudices, outdated practices and attitudes and ethnic quarrels have marginalised women."
"It is telling that women from various minority groups, such as the Roma, receive no or little state care."
"The report analyses the problems, giving typical examples of the weaknesses in each individual country, in order to send a strong message to the governments of these countries, so that they can immediately develop actions and initiatives to combat discrimination against women and actively promote gender equality."
"As far as education and the economy are concerned, the acute changes have differentiated to a major degree both the positions and possibilities of different generations of women."
"Demographic trends today demonstrate that family life is no longer a primary life objective for women, who are more interested in their economic independence and professional achievement and are therefore investing more time and energy in education."
"In numerous countries in the area, such as Greece, most university students are women."
"As far as professional life is concerned, women are more often employees, in other words they are employed in the tertiary sector, in services, and are less often employers than men."
"They are also less often self-employed."
"In the sectors in which women are mainly employed, pay is generally low and there are few prospects."
"I also note the higher percentage of unemployment and poverty among women in the Balkans."
"As far as the participation of women in political decision-making is concerned, the situation is rather disappointing in most countries, although this participation is tending to increase constantly."
"One of the main similarities between these countries in the political sector is the fast spread of non-governmental organisations which are active in women’s rights and are making a significant contribution to strengthening the position of women in employment and politics."
"However, I must point out that, in comparison with other regions of Europe, such as central Europe, the Balkan countries have the highest level of exclusion of women from political decision-making positions."
"As far as women's health and reproductive rights are concerned, I stress that particularly stressful living conditions, by which I mean the economy of survival based on the intensive exploitation of female human resources, the increase in violence against women and the fact that, in numerous countries, the health care systems have collapsed, put women's health at real risk."
"Similarly, in the Balkan countries, domestic violence is often one problem with dramatic dimensions; it is also basically a problem which is inadequately recognised and addressed."
"This problem, together with trafficking, has reached explosive dimensions."
"Nonetheless, in the entire area, there is a lack of serious and systematic statistics on the problem, a lack of adequate legislative regulation, monitoring and guidance and a lack of economic and psychological support for victims."
"As far as trafficking in women is concerned, south-east Europe in general has been identified in recent years as an area in which the trafficking networks act almost unimpeded."
"Trafficking prospers because it is of course economically viable and it constitutes a basic part of the sexual economy and part of consumer society."
"Trafficking in the area is a real industry, consisting of small- and large-scale businesses and local and international networks."
"The industry in question has political support and economic resources in the countries of origin, transit and destination, in the form of corrupt officers, and I should like to quote as a typical example the scandal of sexual slavery in Montenegro."
"A woman from Moldavia, the victim of trafficking, recognised key political figures as clients and/or as those involved in the white slave trade."
"I should also like to stress that the peace forces in the area have increased this phenomenon."
"To close, I should like to say that it is certain that the road towards the economic and social development of south-east Europe and respect for the rights of women depends on their integration into European structures and I should like to remind you that the European Council in Thessaloniki in June 2003 emphasised that it supported the European prospects of the countries of the western Balkans."
"Europe cannot be secure and at peace while violence, ethnic hatred and violations of fundamental rights are a daily occurrence within its borders."
"The role of women in reconciliation, peaceful coexistence and development in the countries of south-east Europe must be given the recognition it deserves by the European Union and strengthened in every possible way."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes the adoption of the Karamanou report on women in South-East Europe and the many valuable observations and proposals which it contains."
"In its relations with the countries of South-East Europe the EU is striving to promote stability, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights, including of course gender equality."
"The Commission pays the utmost attention to ensuring that gender issues are integrated into the mainstream of all European Community assistance programmes as a cross-cutting issue."
"It is nevertheless clear that in a number of countries the situation is far from ideal and is a problem of great political importance."
"The Thessaloniki agenda for the Western Balkans as endorsed by the EU-Western Balkans Summit in June 2003 specifically states that support for activities to defend women's rights and improve their situation should be better reflected in EU policies towards the region."
"Involvement of non-governmental organisations, civil society and local authorities in EU-supported policies and activities is of paramount importance."
"Regarding trafficking in human beings, in the Thessaloniki agenda the EU also urges the countries of the region to act both domestically and regionally in line with the principles of the EU and proposals contained in the Brussels Declaration of September 2002."
"The EU assigns high priority to victim assistance, training programmes for competent bodies, exchange of information, public awareness, and strategy development."
"In this context, coordination of all international actors is essential."
"Most recently the Commission has pointed out in its 2004 report on the Stablisation and Association Process for South-East Europe that gender is insufficiently ensured and domestic violence remains a problem in several countries."
"Although improvements have been made in certain countries on issues such as equal salaries, equal treatment of men and women concerning employment, training, career advancement and working conditions, and women's participation in government, progress is generally slow and insufficient."
"Under the regional CARDS programme for 2002, the Commission published an open call for submission of proposals for support for the rule of law, good governance, public accountability and freedom of opinion."
"Promoting the equal participation of men and women in the democratisation process was one of the priorities of the CARD stabilisation programme for 2002."
"Of the twenty-two projects selected for funding which are ongoing until 2005, one is funding a women's leadership programme and another a project on women in media."
"The rest relate to work with various representatives of civil society to improve the access of citizens more generally to the democratic process."
"With regard to the 2003 CARDS regional programme on democratic stabilisation, an open call for submissions was issued recently and the deadline for receiving proposals is 28 April."
"While this programme does not specifically target women, it supports equality of men and women and the participation of diverse civil society groups and associations at local grassroots level in the process of strengthening democratic structures."
"Furthermore, an additional call for proposals under the 2003 CARDS regional programme is due to be issued soon."
"The programme proposes to strengthen capacities of civil society network associations in order to deliver better services to their member organisations."
"This constitutes a logical continuation of the 2002 initiatives and we expect and hope that women's associations will submit sound proposals in response to this call."
"Finally, a new CARDS multiannual programming cycle is currently under preparation and the suggestions in the Karamanou report will be duly taken into account in the context of this exercise."
"As pointed out in the report, problems have also occurred and still exist in certain candidate countries."
"In order to address this situation, from 1999 to 2003 gender equality projects under the PHARE national programme and MEDA totalled more than EUR 13 million."
"During the same period, participation by the candidate countries in the Community programmes involved close to EUR 1 million and gender equality projects financed under civil society programmes totalled EUR 2.5 million."
"Once they are members of the European Union, these states will obviously be subject to the same obligations and benefit from the same instruments as other Member States."
"Issues related to gender equality and the improvement of women's employment are raised in the regular reports on Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey."
"This matter is being dealt with in the negotiations on the Union's social for the first two countries."
"Furthermore, as pointed out by the honourable Member, more that 20 projects have been financed for civil society actions to improve women's conditions."
"Recent legislation adopted in the three countries is improving the legal situation of women and the Commission is following the implementation of this legislation very closely."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Balkans are an area of vital importance to the European Union."
"My political group has supported their move towards Europe and all the development and cooperation procedures which have been applied."
"Historic experience and daily life in the European Union have demonstrated that development and prosperity cannot be achieved without democracy, without respect for human rights and special attention to women's rights, without making full use of the manpower of both sexes, without a dynamic civil society."
"That is why I wish to welcome the initiative by Mrs Karamanou in drafting a report on the rights of women in the Balkans."
"Within the framework of the monitoring of the stabilisation and association agreements, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has drafted various opinions, one of which I had the honour of drafting, in which it emphasises the problems faced by women in the Balkans and the need to integrate equality into all policies."
"The seriousness, however, of the issues, as presented to us by the rapporteur in her report, and the challenge of addressing these issues, for the sake of development in the area and good collaborative relations with the European Union, warrant a special report."
"I also take this opportunity to welcome the statement by Commissioner Nielson on including many of the proposals by my fellow Member in her report in the new CARDS programme."
"Finally, I wish to say that, in the face of this challenge, we are responsible on both sides."
"We, as the European Union, must activate all the mechanisms and potential for a good collaborative approach with the Balkans, but also the countries of the Balkans must take serious account of the fact that democracy and standards are the best guarantee of their development and their integration into the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate my colleague, Anna Karamanou, on the report she is presenting today, which contains an enormous amount of information and which will be very useful when trying to resolve some of the problems we are facing today."
"We are fundamentally talking about democracy, Mr President, because we are talking about equality and freedom, the combination of which should result in democracy."
"Democracy has not reached the women of the Balkans."
"Trafficking in women, domestic violence, difficulties accessing reproductive rights, lack of political participation, unemployment, poverty and prostitution are the reality of thousands of women living in the region."
"Each country has its own distinctive reality."
"In Albania we could emphasise the serious increase in the trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation."
"Bulgaria is entirely lacking in mechanisms for creating equal opportunities between men and women, which is a prerequisite for transposing our rules."
"Trafficking in women and girls in Bosnia Herzegovina is also increasing."
"In Croatia, violence against women goes unpunished."
"In Greece, we are faced with serious problems in terms of the political representation of women."
"In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the sexual abuse of Albanian and Roma girls takes place on an almost daily basis and the legislation does not include any law relating to the crime of trafficking."
"In Romania there are crimes on ethnic grounds, mainly against Roma women."
"These women have practically no access to contraception and forced marriages and poverty are also part of their reality."
"In Serbia and Montenegro, there is a very clear increase in trafficking in women, also influenced by the arrival of Kafor troops."
"In Turkey, violence against women is widespread and sentences are still reduced for what are so wrongly termed ‘crimes of honour’."
"We must open our eyes, Mr President."
"We must pay attention to the situation of women in this region and we must not move ahead without taking account of the daily reality of thousands of women and girls living in poverty, exploitation and hopelessness."
"The European Union must serve as an essential lever, as the incentive for these countries to commit themselves seriously to human rights and freedom for their citizens."
"No cultural tradition can be placed above universal human rights."
"There cannot be first- and second-class citizens."
"Inequality for women in south-east Europe must be a priority for all of us, because we are talking about democracy and not about women's problems."
"We therefore call for exhaustive monitoring of the accession agenda in relation to the candidate countries, and greater solidarity with women, for this is what they expect."
"Mr President, first of all I would very much like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on her excellent report on the situation of women in south-east Europe."
"Indeed, equal opportunities between men and women in this region deserve our utmost attention in light of the problems caused by all types of exploitation of women."
"Human trafficking in south-east Europe is giving us the greatest cause for concern and worry."
"I am sorry to say that women are, in large numbers, the main victims of this terrible trafficking."
"The countries of this region too are called upon to take all measures necessary in order to put a stop to this modern slavery."
"For my part, it is true that combating the trafficking in women is an absolute priority, in line with our European values based on the principle of respect for fundamental rights."
"The horror of testimonies from Romanian, Moldavian and other women who have been sold for a handful of dollars is intolerable."
"The marketing of women must be very strongly condemned."
"Some Balkan countries that persistently hammer on the door of the European Union with the aim, of course, of becoming Member States should make it their absolute priority persistently to target these mafia-like organisations, break them up and severely punish those guilty of this horrendous trafficking."
"I would reiterate that we cannot tolerate the exploitation and abuse either of women or, especially, of girls, who are slaves of unscrupulous networks."
"Nor can we tolerate any longer the indifference of governmental authorities that all too often tend to close their eyes and ignore what is not only a problem but also a curse."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Karamanou on her excellent report."
"I should now like to make some comments on trafficking in human beings in that region."
"I have spent a lot of time working in the Balkans and continue to do so. I notice that a lot is happening there."
"Action is being taken and, as the Commissioner said, many programmes are in place."
"I have mixed feelings though."
"Yes, on the one hand there is progress, but what about the other hand?"
"I am seeing more and more well-motivated young politicians, both men and women, who want to do something."
"Improvements can be seen in the towns, but things are still very different in the countryside."
"Much has been said of the humiliation of the victims."
"We identified 5 203 victims between 2000 and 2003, but the actual number could be over 175 000."
"So a lot of work remains to be done."
"Since 2003 we have been seeing far fewer victims because the criminal sector is going more and more underground."
"What are they doing?"
"They are bringing their victims, the girls, not to bars or brothels, but to private flats."
"This makes the networks much more sophisticated."
"Previously they operated in small groups, but now they are on their own – one dealer for each victim, and so the chance of catching them is smaller."
"It takes a lot of work."
"Secondly, blood vengeance is on the rise, not only among men but also involving women and children."
"If you are an Albanian woman, raped and kidnapped and taken to the West, what happens then?"
"According to Albanian custom, this woman has shamed her family and even today they have the right to kill her."
"That is the current situation."
"So, Commissioner, I would urge you to support actions aimed at gender equality and activities and training aimed at the police, the military and the authorities."
"Jobs must also be created, jobs with a reasonable wage, in order to deal with the problem of corruption."
"In addition, we should involve Balkan countries in the European institutions."
"Invite people from these countries to attend courses so that they can see that there is another, less corrupt, way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the preparations by the European Union for the Review Conference on the Ottawa Treaty on anti-personnel mines."
". Mr President, the Ottawa Treaty is a corner-stone of multilateral disarmament policies."
"Its political success and practical impact have become a guiding light for multilateral efforts to eradicate the legacies of hatred and lingering threat left by conflicts."
"Since its entry into force significant progress has been made by the international community: 141 countries have ratified the MBT, 9 more countries have signed, over 110 countries are not using anti-personnel landmines, more than 30 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed by states parties to the Convention and, last but not least, mine action programmes are being successfully implemented in many mine-affected countries."
"However, much still remains to be done."
"A number of countries continue to use anti-personnel mines, and some are also believed to be continuing to produce landmines."
"Approximately 65 countries are still affected to some degree by mines and unexploded ordnance and, unfortunately, new areas of conflict are adding to this list."
"Global estimates of new landmine casualties each year vary between 15 000 and 20 000 people, many of whom are civilians, including children."
"The upcoming review conference on 29 November to 3 December 2004 in Nairobi will be a major opportunity to take stock of past achievements and the lessons learned and to trace the course of action for the years ahead."
"What has the EU done so far and what does it intend to do in preparation for this review conference?"
"The importance attached by the EU to the goals of the Ottawa Convention became a tangible fact in 1997 when Parliament created the anti-personnel landmine budget line."
"In March 2000, the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Ottawa Treaty, the European Commission issued a communication and forwarded to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation on the reinforcement of the EU contribution to the fight against landmines."
"In July 2001 Parliament and the Council adopted the legal instrument and its financial envelope."
"These lay the foundations of an integrated and focused European policy."
"In 2002, the new legal instrument was put into practice through the multiannual strategy for the years 2002-2004."
"The strategy is the first of its kind since the anti-personnel landmine regulations entered into force."
"It constitutes an operative framework for coordinating and prioritising EU-financed projects in this field."
"It contains an overall approach and detailed programming covering 33 countries for an average yearly EC contribution of about EUR 42 million."
"The Commission is in the process of launching the multiannual strategy for 2005 to 2007."
"The figures here also contain the contribution from sources within the European Development Fund and reflect the total level of activity we are supporting."
"The setting of priorities will be conducted on an informed and coherent basis."
"We will do this against a background of perspectives and goals shared with the international community and reflecting a jointly-defined orientation and policy."
"We will ensure that in the preparatory work for the Nairobi Summit we coordinate within the European Union both at government level and non-governmental level, and also with a wide range of non-state actors."
"This consultation is important if we are to create 'ownership', within a very broad framework, for what we do in Nairobi."
"Since the adoption of the APL regulation, the European Union has played a substantial and visible role in the fight against landmines, both in political terms and also in terms of financial commitments."
"Looking at the broad picture for the years 2000 to 2002, contributions to mine action from the EU Member States and the European Community stood at a sum total of EUR 410 million."
"We hope to be able to continue our engagement at this impressive level."
"We know that failure to award sufficient priority to mine action would have enormous human costs and render its development fragile and fragmented."
"The mine threat can be overcome."
"The deadlines were set in the Ottawa Convention and clearly challenge us to swiftly eradicate this scourge."
"The Nairobi Summit will be an appeal to all of us to do more and to do it faster."
"Parliament's resolution provides a forceful and positive signal in this direction."
"Mr President, by definition all modern military weapons are a source of death and destruction, but antipersonnel mines are particularly pernicious as, after the cessation of hostilities, their continued presence results in the ongoing death and mutilation of innocent civilians, particularly children."
"This often causes, for prolonged periods of time, massive social and economic problems in countries, many of which are already amongst the poorest in the world and suffering from the ravages of long-term war and disease."
"That is why I particularly support the 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and their eventual destruction."
"I congratulate the 141 States which have ratified or acceded to this Treaty and call upon the four EU Member States remaining after enlargement on 1 May which have not yet done so – namely, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Poland – to do so without any further delay."
"Although it is true that some 68 states have destroyed more than 31.5 million mines, it is estimated that 78 countries still have between 200 and 250 million antipersonnel mines stockpiled, that tragically there are still between 15 000 and 20 000 new landmine victims per year and that landmines still litter 82 countries around the world."
"Much still remains to be done, to echo the words of Commissioner Nielson."
"The EU has pledged EUR 240 million for the period 2002-2009 to support the total ban and assist with mine clearance, victim assistance and stockpile destruction, and this support is at least part conditional on the recipient country demonstrating a commitment towards accession to the Convention."
"I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague, Mr Van Orden, who has been particularly active in this campaign."
"I also wish every success to the November 2004 Nairobi Conference, which seeks to review the operation of this Convention and what further measures can be taken to implement its contents, in particular how to encourage armed, non-state actors to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines without recognising their legitimacy."
"This is particularly salient in Africa – the venue of the conference – which has been blighted by a series of tragic civil wars from Zaire to Liberia and Sierra Leone and which are characterised by insurgents and rebels, often heavily armed and financed by third parties."
"I do not, however, accept – unlike some Members of this House – that this ban can be automatically extended to the legitimate military use of other munitions, such as anti-tank mines, as they, for instance, are less readily available to non-regular forces, because they are much more expensive and tend to be laid in a well-mapped and systematic fashion, which enables speedy clearance in peacetime after the cessation of hostilities."
"Furthermore, they are not capable of being detonated by the foot of an innocent child, as is the case with antipersonnel mines."
"These issues need to be considered separately as, otherwise, there is a danger of losing cross-party political consensus on this important issue."
"I also support that this Parliament sends a delegation of Members of this House, as observers, to the conference so that they can report back to the House on the progress in this very important area."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, often in the political arena there is confirmation that small policies, when applied, produce big results and that big policies, when announced but not applied, produce nothing."
"In this particular case, the Ottawa Treaty, which was essentially signed seven years ago and has been in application for a very short time, has proven its applicability and efficacy and is therefore a successful policy ."
"The choice of holding the first conference to review this Treaty in Nairobi is particularly symbolic, because we all know that sub-Sahara is one of the areas which has the biggest concentration of anti-personnel mines, given that mines are considered to be the weapon of the poor."
"I should like to take this opportunity to point out that my country, which remained outside this Treaty several years ago, also recently agreed with and ratified the Treaty under the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Georgos Papandreou, and has applied it in connection with its border with Turkey where, for reasons which we all understand, there was a cold front of confrontation."
"The ultimate objective of the Ottawa Treaty is to overcome the problem of land mines through coordinated action against mines at international level within the next ten to fifteen years."
"This objective is considered to constitute a challenge, because over sixty countries have stated that they are facing problems on this issue and 20 of them are very seriously affected."
"The experience of Europe itself after the cold war, and recent experience in the Balkans, demonstrates that this huge problem even exists on our continent."
"Of course, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where hundreds of millions of mines undermine health and economic development every day, the issue is even bigger."
"The United Nations plays the central role in organising and coordinating international efforts, while the European Union provides the greatest individual contribution."
"Since 1992, before the Ottawa Treaty even existed, the sums quoted by the Commission to date are significant but should possibly be increased."
"The European Parliament has undertaken a great many initiatives since 1992 in connection with a complete ban on this murder weapon, which exterminates human lives and prevents economic development."
"However, our greatest contribution has been in implementing these programmes in a great many countries of the world; in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in the Balkans, in dozens of countries in which both non-governmental and governmental organisations are involved in removing anti-personnel mines."
"Apart from neutralising mines, however, they need to pay greater attention to education, research and more general information in connection with the danger and how to prevent it."
"The conference in Nairobi will provide a huge opportunity to apply all aspects of the Ottawa Treaty which have somehow not been applied due to technical shortcomings, to supplement the Treaty, to complete it and to give the world a new Treaty, a highly effective, albeit small-scale Treaty for the peace and security of the developing and, more importantly, the poor areas of the world."
"Mr President, the mine is an economic weapon, which has effects that are both physical and psychological, the latter being increased because of the insidious nature of mines."
"Easy to put in place and relatively cheap, mines are a recurring threat long after the end of fighting."
"Although the Ottawa agreement banning anti-personnel mines has now entered into force, only future conflicts are affected. The fight against the approximately 110 million mines across the world sadly remains a reality."
"There are stocks that pose a threat of proliferation, and several Phare countries, such as the former Yugoslavia, the United States, China and Russia, should be encouraged to ratify this treaty."
"Nor, unfortunately, has the time come to bring an end to the humanitarian action, carried out either by NGOs or the UN, to combat this scourge."
"I also welcome the preparations for the Ottawa Conference."
"Six years after the signing in Ottawa of a convention banning the use, stockpiling and production of anti-personnel mines, let us remember that it is said that, every year, there are still between 15 000 and 20 000 people in the world who are victims of such mines."
"In particular, children continue to pay a heavy price for the spread of the poor man’s weapon, and children make up a quarter of the victims."
"This is why it is our duty to continue the battle and, above all, to do everything possible to ensure that, finally, production of these mines comes to an end."
"Mr President, our fellow MEPs have rightly listed the problems caused by the enormous number of mines left behind, often for years, after conflicts throughout the world."
"The European Parliament recently sent a delegation to Sudan where a civil war has been raging for 20 years."
"Thankfully the war is over in some parts of the country, such as the Nuba Mountains in the south, but the people living there are now faced with the continued presence of thousands and thousands of mines."
"Not only are more people regularly being injured in mine-related accidents, but mines are restricting access to the fields and other villages."
"This makes it very difficult for people to earn a living."
"I would therefore like to appeal directly to all those in the world who are responsible for making these mines."
"We have no idea how long mines can remain active or how long they will still be around."
"I was shocked to discover in Sudan that Belgian mines are still being found there 20 to 30 years after they were made."
"And that is despite the fact that my country, Belgium, was one of the first countries to work for the abolition of mines."
"That was in Africa, but the problem reaches as far as the borders of Europe."
"For example, remember that mines are still being used in Cyprus to protect the border between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot parts."
"I hope that the largest countries – China, the United States and Russia – will stop producing and using these mines as well."
"A general global ban is essential, because the effects of mines still remain a threat to the existence of poor people every day."
"– Mr President, as has already been said, this House has a long tradition of concern with this issue."
"I remember how, before 1999, it was above all Mrs Maren Günther who devoted herself to this cause, in which we have achieved a number of successes and made significant progress."
"Today, we can see how most of the Member States – almost all of them, in fact; only a few have not yet done so – have already ratified the Protocol, so the assertions made only a few years ago that it was, for this or that reason, quite impossible to accede to it, have proven to be without substance."
"What this shows is that this is all about political will, so I can do no other than appeal to our Estonian, Latvian, Finnish and Polish friends to see to it that they sign up as soon as possible."
"I would say the same thing to our important ally, the United States of America."
"They and we may be partners in the war on terrorism, but in that anti-personnel mines have no part; they are themselves an instrument of terror."
"It is for that reason that we must do everything we can to prohibit production of them and trade in them, whilst also doing more to support the clearance of mines."
"It has been said, and rightly, that mines hit the poorest regions hardest."
"A few days ago, we heard from the Commission – and I am right behind them in this – that we intend to conduct accession negotiations with Croatia."
"Croatia is suffering in that, in the fields of one of its most fertile regions, that between Vukova and Ilok, with its wonderful vineyards, mines continue to be present on a large scale, thus preventing the people from returning home."
"It is even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Kosovo, right in the middle of Europe."
"The same is true, of course, in those regions to which we are particularly committed, such as Africa, which we have been discussing today – and I agree with all those Members who have said that things are at their worst there – and also in Afghanistan."
"Although we are doing everything to help Afghanistan, our aid is concentrated on a few cities; this is due not only to errors of political judgement on our part, but also to the fact that there are so many mines scattered over wide stretches of the country that reconstruction there is making little if any headway. That, though, is not where the eyes of the world are focused."
"It is for that reason that I am glad that our resolution states that we have to pay more attention to mine clearance, to ridding the world of mines."
"It would be utterly absurd, though, if we were to deploy massive resources – as we must – in support of mine action programmes, while, at the same time, states such as our partners or even certain prospective Member States were to be producing new mines, which would then be laid."
"That would be nonsense from any rational person’s point of view."
"For this reason, there is no alternative to a ban, which must include all Member States of the European Union, and behind which we must throw our whole weight, both economically and in terms of foreign policy. Commissioner, I want to endorse your statement that it is not only Europe that must unequivocally ban these mines, but all the states on this earth, including the 44 that are still creating difficulties."
"Mr President, I am pleased to say that on this occasion I totally agree with Mr Posselt, which is not always the case."
"In reply to Mr Tannock, it is true that there is a big difference between antitank mines and antipersonnel mines."
"However, they too can be used in a perverse manner: an antipersonnel mine can be stacked on top of an antitank mine, which is extremely dangerous."
"There are all kinds of perverse ways of stacking and combining these mines."
"I do not mean that we should move beyond the scope of the Ottawa Treaty."
"We should use it forcefully and constructively and then consider how we can move on."
"The problem of increasing the number of countries actually complying with and ratifying the Treaty is still a real problem."
"As a Danish government minister I signed the Ottowa Treaty on behalf of my country."
"Immediately after signing, the Canadian Government gave us all a nice ballpoint pen."
"I subsequently had a meeting with the roaming US ambassador."
"I felt sorry for him and gave him the pen I had just used to sign, saying that at least his government would have a pen that knew how to sign the Treaty."
"We still need to exert pressure on those countries that are not on board, including the EU Member State named during the debate."
"The most important and effective thing way of proceeding in post-conflict situations is, if possible, to have the two sides in a conflict join together in demining mapping."
"Nicaragua was a good example of this, even though that was never a dirty guerrilla war."
"It was well-organised and both sides had mapped what they had done."
"In Nicaragua, working together became in itself part of the reconciliation and confidence-building process."
"In this case it was possible, but in many cases it is not."
"This is part of the problem."
"Having said that, local communities were mobilised in a fantastic way in Cambodia to provide intelligence for mapping, and a long-term broad participatory approach was taken to moving things forward."
"We have to use our global presence not only to provide money but also to act as a catalyst for the use of best practice."
"We should probably also be doing more in terms of research and development in the field of detection technologies."
"This is all part of what we intend to do in the coming years."
"Let me conclude by thanking Members for their very positive contributions."
"We thank you for your commitment to this issue, Commissioner."
"To end this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions tabled by:"
"– José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Concepció Ferrer, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Cuba (B5-0192/2004);"
"– Cecilia Malmström and Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Cuba one year after the mass detention of dissidents (B5-0201/2004);"
"– Alain Lipietz, Josu Ortuondo Larrea and Monica Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Cuba one year after the mass detention of dissidents (B5-0204/2004);"
"– Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Cuba one year after the mass detention of dissidents (B5-0207/2004);"
"– Ana Miranda de Lage, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Cuba (B5-0208/2004);"
"– Luisa Morgantini, Pernille Frahm and Herman Schmid, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Cuba (B5-0212/2004);"
"– Luís Queiró and José Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on Cuba (B5-0214/2004)."
"Mr President, it appears that today, at the request of the Cuban Government, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is going to vote for a draft resolution on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo."
"I would ask the following question: with what authority can the Castro Government demand explanations of the situation of these prisoners and demand measures to guarantee that their rights are respected, when Cuba still has 74 citizens imprisoned in inhuman conditions, hundreds of kilometres from their homes, for the sole crime of wishing to exercise their inalienable right to freedom of expression and thought?"
"We also roundly condemn what is happening in Guantánamo."
"However, precisely because we are demonstrating the consistency that the Castro Government so cynically demands from the European Union in Geneva – a consistency that Fidel Castro himself is incapable of showing – we also once again condemn the arbitrary detention of the Cuban dissidents."
"It is true that Julio Antonio Valdés has been freed, and we are delighted about that."
"But what we do not want is to allow ourselves to be deceived and forget that the other dissidents are still in prison and that this imprisonment and the conditions involved, which contravene all international conventions in the field, are a flagrant violation of fundamental rights."
"Neither do we wish to forget that the Varela Project has not yet gone ahead and that Osvaldo Payá, whom Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize, is still unable to leave Cuba."
"Hence the timeliness of the Resolution we are discussing, which is perhaps a repetition, according to the Socialist Group – and this is the reason why it has not wished to sign up to this resolution – but nevertheless necessary, because events in Cuba are, regrettably, repeating themselves and the situation not only remains unchanged, but as the months have passed has actually deteriorated."
"We do not want either Parliament or the Commission to abandon people who fight peacefully to defend freedom to their fate, and nor do we want to remain silent about their suffering or about that of their families."
"We want to tell them from this House once again that we are still standing by them and that, despite the isolation in which they have been confined, we are not forgetting them and we are still with them in their fight, in the hope that one day Cuba can begin to move toward democracy."
"Mr President, an unprecedented wave of repression hit Cuba in March and April 2003 under the pretext of the active role played among political opponents by those representing the interests of the US in Havana."
"Almost 80 civilians were arrested, tried and given very heavy prison sentences, ranging from six to 28 years."
"Those arrested were tried very quickly: in a matter of weeks – or even days – in the course of trials not open to the public."
"The defendants were aided by lawyers not belonging to independent bar associations."
"The conditions of detention of these people raise serious concerns, insofar as the Cuban authorities are providing hardly any information on the matter."
"Faced with this situation, we urge the Cuban authorities to free these political prisoners and are anxious to remind them that freedom of expression is a fundamental right."
"Last month, a delegation from Reporters Without Borders, accompanied by relatives of unfairly condemned prisoners, came to protest and call for the help of the European Parliament in fighting to defend freedoms."
"I am anxious to stress that Cuba has ratified a number of conventions in the area of human rights and I call on the Cuban authorities to respect their undertakings."
"Cuba cannot, for all that, use the admittedly disastrous consequences of the embargo, which has lasted for more than 40 years, to claim that some of its nationals, described in particular as mercenaries in the service of foreign powers, have had their human rights systematically violated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am speaking personally and not on behalf of my group."
"Secondly, I am not the author of this resolution but am actually more opposed to it."
"I therefore want to throw another light on the topic."
"I have recently been to Cuba to investigate possible ways of cooperating to combat trafficking in and smuggling of human beings."
"This phenomenon is a serious and pressing problem in Cuba too, and the Cuban Government is working hard on it."
"In the first two and a half months of this year no fewer than 30 people-smuggling operations were closed down and about 70 attempts to leave the country illegally were thwarted."
"Half of these involved people-smuggling."
"Furthermore, five people died in a dramatic attempt to reach the United States, one person is still missing and three were found alive."
"People-trafficking generally involves fake marriages and false promises of work."
"Why do ordinary Cubans take such risks?"
"When talking about people-trafficking we often use the terms 'push factor' and 'pull factor'."
"We know that poverty is the principal reason, the push factor, both social and economic poverty."
"As far as pull factors go, we almost immediately think of the force of attraction exerted by the rich West, in this case the United States."
"That picture is not entirely accurate."
"What promises do people-traffickers usually make?"
"As in Europe, they promise the chance to earn more money, sometimes a lot more, and claim that their victims will be grateful to them."
"A rose-tinted picture, bearing little relation to reality, is painted."
"US President Lyndon Johnson approved the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966."
"This law automatically gave all Cubans reaching the United States residence and employment rights after they had been in the US for a year."
"This is a clear pull factor, possibly the most important as far as Cuba is concerned."
"The assumption has always been that life in the United States, even for people on the breadline, is much better than life in Cuba."
"But the World Bank, not exactly known for its anti-American pronouncements, has praised Cuban healthcare and education."
"Compare this to the situation in the so-called Promised Land, the United States, where access to healthcare is far from universal, where affordable education is of low quality and where many prisons are privatised and outside democratic control."
"I have personal experience of this."
"If we are to criticise the human rights situation in Cuba we must bear two things in mind."
"Who is criticising, and is the criticism reasonable and balanced?"
"Listening to the official voice of the European Parliament over the past few months it is clear to me that double standards are being applied, as whenever values that we ourselves regard as universal come into the picture we suddenly take a very selective approach in the case of Cuba."
"Certain Members have informed me that they are incorrectly named as authors of resolutions."
"If this is the case, please forgive us, but the agenda delivered to us indicates that there are seven motions for resolutions, each with its own authors."
"It is therefore correct."
"In any event, we are going to go ahead with the debate and later on we will look at the real motions for resolutions or see if there is a joint one."
"Now is the time for expressing your ideas."
"Mr President, I am a signatory to this resolution."
"Good news from Castro's Cuba; is that possible?"
"Yes indeed, and I refer you to the full-page article in yesterday's devoted to unceasing internal efforts to bring about peaceful regime change on the island."
"The title of the article speaks for itself: 'Third run-up to a referendum in Cuba'."
"The driving force behind this planned plebiscite is still Oswaldo Paya, winner of the Sakharov prize awarded by this House."
"The enmity and quibbling of Castro and his associates do not worry him;"
"Paya sees the growing popularity of his initiative as more important."
"Increasing numbers of Cubans are losing their fear of government repression."
"In May 2002 Paya and his supporters handed over 11 020 signatures for a referendum to the national parliament."
"14 384 more signatures were added at the start of October 2003."
"About half of these were obtained in the period following the wave of arrests in March 2003."
"The muzzled parliament did not respond, but this has not stopped Paya from organising a third petition."
"In this resolution, the European Parliament is clearly lending its support to Cubans longing for the achievement of a democratic, constitutional state."
"This House expects the Council, the Member States of the Union and the Commission to have the same supportive attitude."
"I sincerely hope that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will make good its intention to produce a full report on the situation in Cuba during the next session."
"We owe it to the peace-loving people of this island which attracts so many European tourists."
"Mr President, I am going to vote against the so-called compromise resolution, which my Socialist Group has not signed, because I believe it is unfair, biased and does not take account of the aggression and threat suffered by Cuba from the United Sates for almost 50 years."
"There are several dozen countries in the world in which the situation in terms of human rights and freedom is objectively worse than in Cuba, but we do not talk about those countries with the same concern."
"Instead, the European Union maintains relations with almost all of them and, incidentally, just today we have voted without any fuss to renew a cooperation agreement with one of these countries."
"What we do not have in the world is several dozen countries on which the United States is obsessively fixated as it is with Cuba."
"In this area, both our agenda and the scandalous double standards of our positions are set by the United States, with the naïve or deliberate complicity of some of our fellow Members."
"In principle, I am in favour of the 70 or so prisoners in Cuba being released."
"I am aware, however, that people who have been shown to have collaborated with an aggressive power would be imprisoned in our countries as well."
"I would also contradict those who distort the truth, both in relation to the trials undergone by those prisoners and the conditions in which they are carrying out their sentences."
"Nobody would be surprised, Mr President, least of all the Cubans, if following its ‘bringing democracy to Iraq’ venture, the Bush administration were to embark on a similar ‘bringing democracy to Cuba’ operation."
"For this venture as for the previous one, the White House would find supporters amongst us, but I will certainly not be one of them, and nor will I be one of those who end up regretting not having resisted before."
"I would also point out that within Cuban territory there are cases of human rights violations, violations of the rule of law, illegal imprisonment and inhuman conditions, not for the 70, but for more than 600 men who have not been sentenced nor subject to any judicial procedure."
"But that is happening in the part of the island occupied by the United States: in the base at Guantánamo."
"I am shocked that those Members who collect signatures so that the rights of prisoners in Cuban jails are respected and in order to visit those jails, do not include the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo and a visit to the jail there."
"On the subject of the human rights of Cuban citizens, I would point out that in the United States there are five Cuban prisoners who have been handed down horrendous sentences, in trials which are dubious in terms of legal security, all as a result of actions in defence of their people from attacks from terrorist groups based in Miami."
"The US Administration is denying them and their families their legitimate rights as defined in the most fundamental rules of international humanitarian law."
"In this regard, we have called for the mobilisation of the Council and the Commission, today we reiterate our support and we call on Parliament to support the five people who the Cubans see as their heroes, and their families, several of whom have not been able to visit, not for months, not for years, Mr President."
"Mr President, my group has always defended the principles of respecting and protecting freedoms, human, social and national rights and rights to sovereignty and democratic development."
"We must always work from an objective point of view and nobody in this House can deny that Cuba has achieved a high level of social, economic, scientific and technological development, which is objectively verifiable and indisputable, despite its international isolation and the asphyxiating blockade by the United States, which it has been suffering for almost half a century."
"This development has been demonstrated by the indicators in the most advanced and reliable studies and investigations by numerous United Nations bodies."
"This development also includes fundamental aspects of daily life, such as education, culture, sport and health."
"I regret that certain Members of this House are still expressing fury at the Cuban Government in such an irresponsible way and with so little objectivity, while refusing to condemn very serious situations in other parts of the world, resulting from the orders of Washington, that is to say, restrictions of freedoms, interference in the politics of other countries by the United States, as well as the prisoners in Guantánamo, about which you say nothing and whose subhuman situation you do not condemn."
"Their human rights are not recognised, because the United States has decided that they are in no man's land, but this territory belongs to the United States, it is on Cuban territory and Cuba is a sovereign country."
"We cannot have two different yardsticks when it comes to applying human rights at international level."
"It is highly regrettable that certain groups in this House continuously condemn the situation in Cuba in terms of political prisoners, opponents of the Cuban Government but, nevertheless, avoid debating the horrendous conditions of the five Cubans jailed in the United States, who are denied family visits and fair trials."
"Our group has been condemning this in this House and nobody has spoken out on behalf of these prisoners."
"And I ask myself, do the prisoners in the United States, Guantánamo, the 10 000 in Iraq and other countries not deserve the same consideration and treatment by the European Parliament?"
"My group considers human rights to be universal, and we defend freedom of expression, the recognition of family visits to prisoners and respect for the government of each country, without political interference from other countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to welcome the fact, on my own behalf and on behalf of my group, that four political groups were able to agree on a compromise resolution, one that is in favour of Cuba, not opposed to it; a resolution that is in favour of the Cuban people, and opposed to a tyrannical regime."
"I should like to mention two dates, so that we can be absolutely clear as to what is at stake: on 1 May, ten new Member States are to join this Parliament, our milieu, the house of democracy that we share."
"Ten years ago, eight of these States were languishing under the tyranny of Communist dictatorships."
"Once the Wall came down, they were able to develop democratically, to share the same cornerstones of the rule of law, democracy and freedom, and to live side by side with us."
"This is what we would like to see happen in Cuba."
"Next Sunday, 25 April, sees the thirtieth anniversary of the ‘Carnation Revolution’, a democratic revolution, which was promptly hijacked by the extreme left and the Communists, who wished to turn Portugal – to use the expression of the time – into ‘the Cuba of Europe’."
"We strove hard in 1974 and 1975 to be able to call ourselves a free and democratic country and not a ‘Cuba of Europe’."
"What we would now like to see is Cuba become ‘the Portugal of the Caribbean’; we would like to see the carnations that brightened up Portugal do the same in Cuba; we would like to share the vibrancy, the colour and the warmth of Cuban culture, a culture we hold in high regard and which we would like to see smile and grow in freedom."
"This is what is at stake."
"Mention has been made here of double standards."
"What I deplore here is the lack of solidarity, on the part of some Members of this House, with the terrible suffering in Cuba, with people sentenced one year ago to twenty or more years in prison for their beliefs."
"This is a diabolical state of affairs."
"If you do not wish to see double standards, then use your vote wisely, otherwise the accusers may soon find the tables turned on them."
"As revealed recently in Parliament by the organisation, Cuba is currently the world’s largest prison for journalists."
"Since March, twenty-seven journalists have been imprisoned, and three were already in prison."
"We must, therefore, show unstinting solidarity with all those who advocate freedom of speech, of opinion and of expression, and political freedom in Cuba."
"Lastly, one or two words of support for campaigns to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Cuban democrats, such as Rivero Castañeda, a great writer and poet who is in prison, or Oswaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2002."
"We must not tire in our efforts and must never give up on promoting the Sakharov initiative until, as we have requested and as is his right, Oswaldo Payá is able to come here and speak to us."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, on the first anniversary of the mass imprisonments on political grounds, carried out by Castro, we Christian Democrats from Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made a joint appeal in a letter addressed to the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan."
"We wished to draw attention to the fact that, on 18 March 2003 in the shadow of the Iraq war, Fidel Castro instituted a wave of repression in which 75 advocates of democracy were falsely imprisoned following summary trials."
"They were each sentenced to between 15 and 27 years’ imprisonment."
"A total of 1 456 years’ imprisonment was thus imposed upon these 75 constitutional activists."
"Their fate must not be ignored by the surrounding world."
"It is therefore a matter of extreme urgency that we in the European Parliament make this statement today."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we believe that the judgments must be overturned inasmuch as the trials in Cuba were clearly conducted without legal rights for the accused, who were sentenced on exclusively political grounds."
"We ask for these 75 human rights activists to be released, and for them to be so without delay."
"Their so-called crime is that, in accordance with the Cuban Constitution, they collected approximately 10 000 signatures calling for a referendum on a more pluralistic and more democratic Cuba."
"For that, they were given extremely long sentences."
"The majority of those advocating democracy belong to the Christian and Christian Democratic human rights movement, Movimento Cristiano Liberación."
"I, together with Mr Ribeiro e Castro and 206 other MEPs, took the initiative of inviting Sakharov prizewinnerOsvaldo Payà Sardiñas to visit us here in Europe."
"Commissioner Nielson, let this invitation bear fruit by putting pressure on the Cuban regime to enable Osvaldo Payà Sardiñas to visit us."
"– Mr President, I must congratulate the organisers of today's debate on their inventiveness."
"Having failed to find any other excuse to regurgitate their slander of the Cuban people, they remembered the anniversary of the decisions by the courts which sentenced agents of US imperialism and decided to celebrate it."
"However loud you attack socialist Cuba, my dear fellow Members, you cannot deny the fact that Cuba is the only free country on the American continent, the only country where the people take authority into their own hands."
"That is why it has endured exclusion, threats and invasion."
"That is why the United States of America and the European Union want to overturn the Cuban revolution."
"If, therefore, you are truly interested in the people of Cuba and in human rights, organise a debate on its long-term exclusion or on the five Cuban patriots who are rotting in gaol in Miami, without even being able to see their families, because they acted against the terrorism which is striking their country."
"– Mr President, I have to say that what we have just heard from Mr Alyssandrakis is quite eerily reminiscent of a past that will at last be finally behind us when, in just a few days’ time, we welcome the States of Central and Eastern Europe into the European Union."
"For decades, this House has contended for freedom, human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination in Central and Eastern Europe."
"It has helped to sweep away Communism and its dictatorship, banish the ghost of Stalin, tear down the Iron Curtain and now unite the whole of Europe in freedom, and it is positively spooky that a relic of this inhuman ideology such as Mr Alyssandrakis should get up in this House and defend the dictatorship in Cuba."
"Let me say it loud and clear, my good friends: we are not, as you suppose, against the Cuban people."
"On the contrary, we defend them."
"Those who, before 1989, spoke in this House in defence of the Communist dictatorships must be ashamed when their words are dredged up from the Minutes."
"In the same way, you too will one day have to be ashamed of what you have said today about Cuba, one of the last brutal and repressive Communist dictatorships in the world."
"We do not have an uncritical attitude towards the United States, and God knows that I am not going to defend all the things that a blockade entails."
"I take a thoroughly critical view of it."
"I have to say, though, that it stands to reason that it is our duty as democrats to defend with all our might Cuba’s democracy movement, the rule of law there, and its freedom, against those who repress them, represented by the old-school Communist Fidel Castro, a man as lacking in understanding as you are, Mr Alyssandrakis, and, like you, forever yesterday’s man."
". Mr President, this is clearly an issue on which this Parliament likes to be divided."
"This reflects political reality, but I have one plea."
"I direct it to Mrs Bergaz Conesa who highlighted Cuba's fine performance in areas such as health, sports and education."
"That is fine, but I would add, 'and so what'?"
"It should be possible, without being misunderstood, to discuss the issue of human rights on its own merits, not just in Cuba, but everywhere."
"It is as if this is a sort of balancing game, a sort of political scoreboard relating to the totality of Cuba's situation, character and state of mind politically."
"This is not the case."
"As I understand it, this is about expressing concern – to put it mildly – on human rights issues there, and as friends of that nation we in Europe are entitled to do that here without being seen as escalating or creating even more problems than we have already."
"The Commission shares Parliament's concern about the human rights situation in Cuba."
"We need to see progress on democracy and the opening-up and normalising of political life, especially now, one year after the mass detention of dissidents."
"In our analysis things have not improved."
"The EU continually follows the situation of political prisoners through the Human Rights Working Group in Havana and through contacts with family members of those imprisoned."
"Last February, the wives and mothers of the political prisoners expressed their appreciation to the European institutions for the support they give."
"The European Union intends to continue to raise the cases of prisoners of conscience with the Cuban authorities and to exert the pressure we can for real democratic reform and respect for human rights in Cuba."
"The recent declaration by the Council presidency, congratulating the Cuban journalist Raúl Rivero on the award of the Word Press Freedom Prize from Unesco, called again on the Cuban authorities to release all the imprisoned dissidents without delay."
"The Member States supported the recent resolution on Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission, lamenting the sentencing of political dissidents and journalists last year and expressing hope that the government of Cuba will take measures to promote the full development of democratic institutions and civil liberties."
"The European Union considers dialogue with Havana important to promote political, economic and civil rights reforms."
"However, positive moves by Cuba on its political prisoners are needed."
"If Cuba took concrete steps to improve the human rights situation, I am sure that the European Union would immediately respond."
"We regret the current situation."
"We not only see scope for improvement, we also see the for improvement."
"The Commission supports Parliament's initiative to invite Oswaldo Payá."
"Our delegation in Havana is in regular contact with him and is trying to facilitate the visit."
"Finally, despite Cuban decisions which impede our development cooperation activities, the Commission remains willing to provide aid to promote democracy and improve living standards for ordinary Cubans."
"We regret the lower level of activity in what we are doing together for the time being and, without wanting to create further political tension, we hope and work for a normalisation of the situation."
"– Mr President, I requested the floor on a personal matter because the stand taken by Mr Posselt, who did not make the effort to listen to me, whereas I made the effort to listen to him when he spoke, has gone beyond the bounds of political confrontation."
"I can accept any political argument in response to the political arguments which I put forward."
"I cannot, however, under any circumstances accept revenge policies, excommunications and witch hunts."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four motions for resolutions presented by:"
"– Stephen Hughes, Margrietus J. van den Berg, Marie-Hélène Gillig and Anna Karamanou, on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the PSE, Jean Lambert, Theodorus J.J. Bouwman and Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Gerhard Schmid, Emmanouil Bakopoulos and Dimitrios Koulourianos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0191/2004);"
"– Anne Elisabet Jensen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0200/2004);"
"– Bartho Pronk, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0202/2004);"
"– Brian Crowley, on behalf of the UEN Group, on respect for basic working standards in the production of sport products for the Olympic Games (B5-0191/2004)."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the holding of the 2004 Olympic Games at their birthplace, in Greece, is a very good opportunity for us to highlight the humanitarian values connected with the Olympic spirit and with the letter of the Olympic Charter, which emphasises respect for fundamental human rights throughout the world."
"On the basis, therefore, of the serious violations of the rights of workers which we have noted, including of a great many women and children, in the production of sports clothing and footwear, we call on the European Commission to take initiatives and to demand that sport article industries and their world federations apply the rules of the International Labour Organisation."
"The Commission also needs to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee in order to ensure that the International Olympic Committee includes respect for the internationally accepted rights of workers in the Olympic Charter and the Ethics Code."
"We also call on the International Olympic Committee to demand that contracts concluded with sponsors and commercial companies include compliance with internationally recognised employment standards and fundamental rights."
"In other words, all products which bear the logo of the International Olympic Committee must have been manufactured in accordance with the rules of the International Labour Organisation."
"I should also like, Commissioner, to stress the importance of a campaign to raise awareness and inform Europeans in the run up to the 2004 Olympic Games."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in ancient times when the Olympic Games were being held in Greece, all wars stopped for the duration of the games."
"What a pity that this no longer happens."
"It was a tribute to human individuality and dignity."
"However, now we see that it is precisely sports shoes that have become a symbol for human exploitation."
"This resolution is a justified response to this exploitation."
"The standards of the International Labour Organisation ought to be binding throughout the world."
"The reverse is true at present."
"Ethical investors are punished because they are the victims of unfair competition."
"We must devise systems of inspection and raise awareness among our consumers and trade unions."
"The International Olympic Committee should not permit advertising of goods that are not made according to ethical standards."
"Europe should use these ILO standards not only as a label demonstrating social acceptability and fair trade but also as an organisational principle that we regard as binding for imports and exports."
"Of course, that is not yet possible but I hope that we can develop a strategy towards this end, so that in years to come when the Olympic Games take place we will be able to say that the rules for equitable world trade and production methods have been integrated into the world trade system itself."
"It is tempting to look well into the future."
"For example, Flanders is now putting itself forward as a candidate to host the 2016 Olympic Games."
"Can we not say that by 2016 we want a fairer world trade system based not on market value but on human dignity?"
"Mr President, the Olympic Charter and its fundamental principles stress that Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles."
"It is therefore crucial that these fundamental principles embrace respect for core labour standards in the production of sports articles for the Olympic Games."
"Today, in the context of such production, the failure to respect labour law as laid down by the International Labour Organisation has been observed."
"Several factors indicate that many sports articles are produced by subcontracting firms which, through their improper conditions of work and employment, breach not only labour law, but also human rights. They do so by failing to respect humane working hours, by not giving their employees a safe and healthy workplace and, in addition, by providing nothing like decent and reasonable remuneration."
"Again, the problems relating to child labour might also be cause for reflection."
"We also call on the sports industry to be vigilant in tackling this unfortunate state of affairs, which it is greatly responsible for and party to, and we call on it to adopt and respect, as quickly as possible, a genuine code of good ethical conduct, aimed at increasing human dignity."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the lack of respect for ILO (International Labour Organisation) labour rights perpetuates poverty and hampers development by driving wages down and denying education – something that constitutes a violation of human dignity."
"We know that the production of sportswear and athletic footwear is organised through an elaborate international system of subcontractors."
"Therefore, the European Parliament today expresses the view that the issue of working conditions for employees, especially in the developing world, must be addressed by the Commission and the International Olympic Committee."
"Some leading sportswear manufacturers and socially responsible investment firms have also stated that the current ruthless business and labour practices in the global supply chain are unsustainable, lead to unfair competition and constitute an obstacle to sound enterprise."
"There is also anxiety amongst ourselves, as consumers, regarding irregularities where conditions of employment and labour are concerned."
"I would therefore appeal to yourself, Commissioner Nielson, and to the Commission to add to all your very many other tasks that of taking such action in respect of the International Olympic Committee and the business and sports sector and its subcontractors as to ensure that they recognise the ILO’s international labour standards and such action as to ensure that these labour standards are incorporated into the International Olympic Committee’s regulations."
"This is an issue of human dignity."
"I wish you success, Commissioner, in this important work."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I think, it is only proper to thank the manufacturers of sporting goods for providing the least developed countries with employment, wages and taxes."
"That there is room for improvement here is not a matter of dispute."
"My belief is that we should concentrate on commending, and publicly encouraging, those who adhere to the ILO's rules."
"We should call them in front of the curtain and congratulate them on maintaining standards."
"We should be showing them how best practice works even in the least developed countries; such incentive systems would, I believe, be the best way in which we could help promote economic activity in these countries."
"We stress the importance of acknowledging and integrating the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, and also especially family firms as suppliers, and of encouraging that both internationally and globally by means of objective and proper invitations to tender."
". The European Commission supports the strengthening of core labour standards and social governance in the context of globalisation."
"It has taken various policy initiatives in this field."
"It considers that more should be done to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation, and will contribute to the follow-up to the report recently presented by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation established by the International Labour Organisation."
"With regard to the Olympic Games, the European Commission financially supports the implementation of the Charter of Intent adopted by the Organising Committee for the Winter Olympic Games in Turin in 2006."
"This sets out the organising committee's commitment to dealing with ethical, environmental and social issues and to reporting on the social impact of the activities and compliance with the ethical standards."
"This initiative could also be very relevant for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games."
"The European Commission also contributes to the promotion of corporate social responsibility, workers' rights and decent work in the sports goods industry."
"It encourages the involvement and commitment of all actors, for example to combating the use of child labour in the production of FIFA-licensed sportswear and footballs."
"A similar approach covering all core labour standards could be developed for the upcoming Olympic Games with relevant partners such as the global trade unions, broader civil society, the International Olympic Committee, the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry, the different brands and companies and the ILO."
"The Commission will continue its efforts to promote a more cohesive approach to harnessing globalisation, also tackling issues such as the application of fair rules in global supply and production chains."
"This is what the Commission can provide in response to the concerns raised."
"However, with the organisers of the Olympic Games having given up the ideals of amateurism and voluntarily buried themselves in the deep dark hole of big money, there is a limit to what we can expect from them in the sphere economic ethics."
"They represent just another case in which we could discuss corporate social responsibility."
"In my view they are not a special case."
"They lost their innocence ages ago."
"The real problem is so huge that we must dig deep into our resources to continue the broader general struggle of ensuring decency triumphs in a world capable of producing child labour, etc. – with or without the Olympic Games."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions tabled by:"
"– Niall Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group, on Nigeria (B5-0194/2004);"
"– Charles Tannock, John Alexander Corrie, Lennart Sacrédeus and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Nigeria (B5-0203/2004);"
"– Didier Rod, Marie Anne Isler Béguin and Nelly Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Nigeria (B5-0205/2004);"
"– Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Nigeria (B5-0206/2004);"
"– Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the PSE, on Nigeria (B5-0209/2004);"
"– Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Nigeria (B5-0211/2004);"
"– Yasmine Boudjenah, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Nigeria (B5-0213/2004)."
"Mr President, Nigeria is Africa's most populous state."
"It is a regional superpower and has made progress in terms of democracy, as well as contributing to vital peacekeeping military operations to settle regional conflicts."
"It is also a member of the ACP and the Commonwealth."
"I have many Nigerians living in London, my constituency."
"Like a number of other countries with co-existing Muslim and Christian communities, such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, there have been periodic clashes."
"This most recent outburst of violence in the Nigerian state of Plateau is particularly troubling as not only has the violence been horrendous, but also there is evidence that Islamist extremists have been recruited from neighbouring Muslim countries, such as Chad and Niger, possibly with international Islamic terrorist connections."
"Sadly, Nigeria is a country divided by ethnic and religious differences and every effort must be made by the government to build solidarity and social cohesion nationally."
"The introduction of Sharia law since 1999 has been particularly divisive and we have witnessed the imposition – although not yet carried out – of lapidation, or stoning to death sentences on women convicted of the so-called crime of adultery."
"It is only a matter of time before this issue resurfaces to disturb the consciences again of the western world."
"In the past, I have personally called in this House for the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth in the event of such a barbaric punishment occurring."
"After all, the 1999 Nigerian Constitution guarantees total freedom of belief, and the country has signed international convenants on human rights."
"Therefore, I appeal to the federal and state authorities of this big African country to rapidly re-establish law and order, conduct a full investigation into the identity of the culprits and, in particular, where there has been outside provocation or infiltration, bring all those concerned speedily to justice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long to discuss the enormous problems facing the large and densely-populated country of Nigeria."
"We were present as guests along with the ACP conference when Mr Obasanjo 'replaced' the military set-up with a democratic system."
"Hope was strong and sincere."
"But since then thousands of people have died in ethnic conflicts and all manner of violent clashes."
"We were also in Kano, in the north, where a wonderful Islamic culture is flourishing and had the opportunity to compare this culture with that of other regions in the south."
"But this astonishing diversity of tribes, ethnic groups and cultures risks being submerged in severe armed conflict."
"Oil, which ought to be this large country's blessing, is in fact a curse because it is used mainly to buy arms and set up one power base against another."
"Smaller groups, like the Ogoni people, are at risk of becoming the victims of all this."
"I believe that we must take Nigeria seriously in the context of the ACP and that we must closely monitor what is happening in this large country, because it is a kind of Africa in miniature."
"I hope that the recommendations contained in our resolutions, focusing mainly on the danger of intolerance, the danger of Sharia law in those countries, stoning women and so on, are taken to heart because there is a risk that the whole situation could degenerate further if we are not much more closely engaged in dialogue, but also with strong sanctions if the rules are flouted."
"Mr President, can anyone justify an attack on a church where women, men and children are worshipping?"
"When the attackers shout at them to surrender and lie face down on the ground, only to kill them mercilessly with machetes and axes?"
"Thousands dead, many tens of thousands fleeing, hundreds of churches burned, fear."
"The only thing the victims did wrong was to be Christians."
"These dreadful things are happening in central and northern Nigeria."
"The perpetrators are, once again, Muslim fundamentalists."
"Not all of them are Nigerian, some are Islamic mercenaries from Chad and Niger."
"It has been discovered that some of the funds needed to pay for this sort of horrific murderous spree come from Saudi Arabia."
"What should be done?"
"Further to this resolution, I call on the Nigerian authorities to take immediate effective measures to protect their fellow-citizens, especially Christians, who are continuing to suffer from the ongoing attacks."
"They must also take steps to put an end to this Islamic terrorism, by preventive action if necessary, and to abolish Sharia law in the twelve states where it has been introduced."
"If the government does not take firm action to deal with the violence, we would be justified in fearing that Nigeria could become the stage for a religious war."
"I call on the Council and the Commission to monitor this situation closely and to press the Nigerian authorities to take effective action."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ethnic and religious violence in Nigeria has concerned our Parliament on countless occasions."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, has repeatedly intervened and denounced the revival of religious hatred in Nigeria, especially against women, with the application of Islamic 'Sharia' law, which even makes provision for sentencing by stoning for adultery, over and above the laws and Constitution of Nigeria and also over and above the Cotonou Agreement and the clauses about respecting human rights and women's rights."
"It would appear, Commissioner, that the Nigerian Government either does not have the power or the political will to impose the 1999 Constitution and the laws on the country."
"Recent violence by fundamentalists and the outbreak of religious violence in the state of Plateau, which has cost 1 500 people their lives and destroyed 173 churches, is the culmination of a series of bloody events in which Islamic extremists are the protagonists."
"In my opinion, the European Commission should exploit its powers and international standing to contribute more actively towards strengthening security, putting an end to the violence and promoting respect for religious tolerance and basic human rights in Nigeria."
"In other words, we need closer cooperation and pressure on the Nigerian Government and President Obasanjo so that the Constitution and laws are applied in the country."
"Mr President, Nigeria, the largest African country with 120 million inhabitants, seems to be under permanent threat of implosion."
"This oil-producing country,where the extreme wealth of a tiny minority contrasts with the extreme poverty of the population, is once again the scene of religious confrontations which, last month, caused 20 deaths when a village was attacked in the state of Plateau, a state principally inhabited by Christians."
"For a long time, this region has been plunged into a genuine conflict between Islamic and Christian fundamentalists."
"It is a conflict that has already killed more than 100 people in the region since February."
"These sad events once again show that poverty and the social divide, added together, constitute the ideal breeding ground for all fundamentalists."
"Today, Sharia law is practised in 11 northern states out of the 36 states of the Nigerian Federation."
"In order to react to the Islamic threat, governors of the South, where animists and Christians are in the majority, have created a forum for the Southern states."
"There are reports that in all areas, including in the institutions, mechanisms that could lead to a new explosion in the country are being put in place."
"Today, faced with this spiral of violence affecting a battered population, we are anxious strongly to condemn any type of intolerance and religious violence."
"Since 1999, thousands of people have perished following inter-community confrontations."
"At the time, the detonator had been the introduction of Sharia law in several northern states."
"We are therefore calling on the Nigerian Government to take the necessary measures and find a practical solution designed to bring this ethnic and religious violence to an end as soon as possible. We hope, moreover, that this will not just be one more debate in our institution."
"– Mr President, we must take a very firm stand against the human rights violations and acts of aggression in Nigeria; about that there can be no doubt."
"In contrast to Islam, which is a great world faith, Islamism is a criminal ideology, and a very clear distinction must be drawn between the two."
"We have to be careful, though, not to consider these things from one angle alone."
"As we know, most of the states in West Africa are artificial creations drawn on the map by the colonial powers, so that peoples in the South are divided, two examples being the Ibo and the Ewe, who are Christians and animists and live on both sides of the border."
"The same can be said of the peoples of the North, the Hausa and Fulbe, most of whom are Muslims and also live in a variety of states."
"This simply happens to be the way these states’ borders were drawn; never, throughout history, have they corresponded with the ethnic realities."
"This is something that has to be clear to us, and this is something for which we Europeans really do share responsibility."
"The resolution quite rightly refers to the state of Plateau."
"It is in Plateau that these ethnic groups collide, and the situation is made even more acute by economic inequalities and migratory flows."
"The whole place is a highly unstable melting pot and could easily explode."
"It also has to be borne in mind that Nigeria is a multi-ethnic state, one of the most populous countries in the world and probably the most populous in Africa, and that there are massive oil interests at stake there, so it really does call for extremely sensitive handling and subtle thinking."
"That notwithstanding, what I would like to say to Mrs André-Léonardis that it is taking sophistry a bit too far to say that there is fundamentalism in both the Christian and Islamic camps."
"There is no Christian fundamentalism in Nigeria."
"There is no Islamic fundamentalism there either; there is, instead, on the one hand, this complex conflict situation, and, on the other, Islamist ideologues attempting to exploit it for their own ends."
"If we are to address this situation, we need sound knowledge of these countries’ history and ethnic make-up; only then will we be able to support the peace process and prevent Nigeria from disintegrating in a bloody war compared with which the carnage in the former Yugoslavia will seem trivial."
"That, as has been said, is why our task is to get actively involved in the peace process, but to do so with precise knowledge of the realities of these countries, on which we can draw in our deliberations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, I feel that this parliamentary resolution is most timely, since it addresses what is possibly the most serious human rights problem that we face at the beginning of the twenty-first century."
"The situation in Nigeria is extremely delicate, but is not unique."
"It is repeated elsewhere, in Sudan, for example, although this has not been sufficiently publicised in view of public attention on Iraq, where events are all the more unforgivable since they are occurring with the complicity of armed forces from the European Union."
"I feel that what we are seeing is a fanatical regime gradually taking hold, in particular in Southern Iraq, in Basra to be specific."
"This is a regime in which Christians are persecuted, alcohol is banned, western clothes are banned and veils must be worn, and all of this is happening with the complicity of the British troops on the ground."
"The real issue at the heart of the situation in Nigeria is Islamic fanaticism."
"This is more of an issue than the existence in the country of people of various ethnic backgrounds and beliefs, which is the case in most corners of the globe and is the result of the way in which history has unfolded."
"This problem must be combated, and we must not continue to play it down for the sake of short-term commercial interest or our oil-based diplomacy."
"This strikes me as the overriding message that we must convey to the Commission and the Council."
". Mr President, the Commission shares the concern at conflicts between communities in Nigeria and condemns all attacks and violence, whether apparently ethnic, religious or social, etc. in origin."
"We caution against a simplistic analysis of the situation which focuses on just one area or religious group."
"The violence is often related to conflicts over access to resources or triggered by political tensions."
"In the case of Plateau State, the causes of violence are related to both these reasons and the perpetrators have come from both sides of the community."
"It is factually wrong to describe this as something driven only by Islamic fundamentalists."
"For information, I would add that Plateau State is not a state which applies Sharia law, and it is not likely to because it has an overwhelming Christian majority composed of groups of indigenous people and settlers."
"In very manycases, there is a sort of social clash between incomer settler groups and the original inhabitants – a version of a conflict that we see in very manyother places."
"The problem with understanding Nigeria is that there are several layers of problems, and each layer is normally enough to create a conflict."
"Therefore this complex situation is something we really have to respect in order to do something useful."
"For the second time this afternoon I have to say that I agree with Mr Posselt's contribution."
"We have similar views on this situation."
"His reference to Yugoslavia is also very important because there we have assisted in a so-called solution which is contrary to what we, for very good reasons, find necessary for Africa, namely to avoid changing the geography."
"Even though we gave them nonsensical borders, Europe and others rightly agree with Africa itself that, as long as Africa does not want to change the borders, we definitely should not advise it to do that, even if it is difficult."
"Conflicts between communities in Nigeria have been evident for some time and we have been following the situation as part of the early warning system for conflict which the Commission is setting up."
"The Commission has also adapted its cooperation programme to reflect that situation."
"Support for human rights in Nigeria is a significant component of our cooperation strategy for the country."
"Nigeria was also selected as a focal country for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to respond to precisely the sort of concerns raised by Parliament."
"Three projects were approved last year, including one with a Nigerian NGO working in Plateau State and Kaduna State to promote peace between Muslims and Christians."
"The project also covers improving the drafting and application of Sharia law in conformity with the guarantees of religious freedom provided in the Nigerian constitution as well as respect for the international conventions providing protection for human rights which the country has signed."
"In other words, reasonable co-existence between Sharia law and the constitution of Nigeria is an option."
"This is what the country is trying to organise."
"I mention this simply by way of a warning that we must not move blindly in one direction without really reflecting on the complexities involved."
"As I have already said, other conflicts relating to religious differences are very important and we should be careful not to overlook or marginalise these other aspects."
"If we fail to understand this, we will not be of much use in a dialogue aimed at stopping the conflicts."
"Social, economic and ethnic problems – all these other layers of problems I have mentioned – have to be given a proper place in the analysis."
"At federal level the Commission is working with Member States to strengthen political dialogue with Nigeria."
"This dialogue is one of the instruments provided by the Cotonou Agreement and the Federal Government is participating actively in that dialogue."
"We have adapted to the special realities of Nigeria, where the states play a powerful role, and in fact the bulk of our work relating to water and sanitation is being done in six of the 36 states that make up the Federal Republic of Nigeria."
"We have chosen the six states not on the basis of where it is easiest to work, but where need is greatest."
"Although, in so doing, we are inviting problems, this is the most meaningful way of working on matters that relate to the core of the problems underlying what we are discussing here this afternoon."
"We share this House's call for the Federal Government to do everything in its power to protect its citizens, put an end to violence and promote respect of human rights, including of course freedom of religion."
"We hope that Parliament's adoption of a resolution which is balanced on this issue will be seen as meaningful encouragement along these lines."
"Mr Rübig has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, may I make a request?"
"I would like an investigation into whether, during the vote on the van Hulten report, it was noted by Mr Ferber and recorded in the Minutes, that a Member was not present, which that Member subsequently confirmed."
"Is he entitled to call for a subsequent correction of the vote, which did not take place in the Chamber, which the Minutes indicate that he did?"
"Thank you, Mr Rübig."
"We take note of what you say, which will be dealt with in the appropriate manner."
"My request to you, Mr President, is that, when we sign ourselves into the central register tomorrow morning, we should be given ample protection from the media, who we expect to be there, and who are working for a certain Mr Martin."
"Although we have nothing to hide, we do not want to be harassed."
"Let me assure this House right now that I would not, until very recently, have thought it even possible that I could have been systematically spied on by a certain Mr Martin, using his buttonhole camera, since at least 2002."
"I was not aware of being spied on."
"Had I been aware of it, I would have given this Mr Martin a wide berth ever since 2002."
"I am equally strong in my condemnation of certain German media, who are making use of a certain Mr Martin as what they call their principal witness and have thereby subjected me, among others, to a disgusting campaign of defamation in Germany."
"Here in this House, I have always obeyed the rules as they were in force at the time."
"Mr President, as a personal reference has been made to me, I am glad to have been given the opportunity to reply to it, so that it is not only others who can bandy statements about in this House."
"I just want to make it clear that it is in no way the case that there are people in the media working for me."
"I also want to make it clear that I have not been using a camera concealed in my buttonhole, and, above all, that I am very sorry, for the sake of Europe's taxpayers and voters, that it is evidently still not understood in this House that the rules are the problem and that a self-service mentality has got a foothold in this place. What this shows, quite simply, is that only pressure from the public will bring about awareness of the need for reform, which has been long in coming and is what a number of my fellow-Members and I are working for."
"Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that I had expected more from Mr Martin's statement."
"I thought he was going to explain why the Minutes state that he voted on many of the amendments to the van Hulten report, even though he was not in the Chamber at all."
"It is an inexplicable phenomenon how someone can claim to have voted on innumerable amendments, even though he was outside."
"We could all do the same thing, with interviews of one sort or another out there and, later on, the President's lists..."
"We are not going to deal with this issue any further."
"It has been fully debated in recent days and the President of Parliament has made several eloquent statements in relation to it."
"The debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law are closed."
"We shall proceed to the vote(1)."
"(2)"
". I agree with the overall thrust of this report, which notes with concern that the region’s economic decline has a greater negative impact on women than on men and that the feminisation of poverty is growing rapidly."
"I should like to highlight the fact that poverty and unemployment, combined with a strong patriarchal tradition, are the main causes of prostitution, trafficking in women and violence against women."
"Women’s human resources, which are relatively plentiful due to women’s generally high standard of education, are under-utilised in the economic, social and culturaldevelopment of the region because of discriminatory practices and prejudices."
"Accordingly, the governments of South-East Europe, in the light of increasing religious fundamentalism and the return to patriarchal societies, must guarantee fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights and freedom of thought, conscience and religion."
"They must also ensure that tradition does not impinge upon personal autonomy or violate women's rights and the principle of gender equality."
"I am concerned to note that, in most countries in South-East Europe, the rate of women’s participation in political life is currently below 20%, which, in comparison with other parts of Europe represents the highest level of exclusion of women from..."
". Human rights violations in the Western Balkans are particularly alarming and must, therefore, be condemned."
"As Mrs Karamanou rightly points out, however, problems do exist that are not solely related to women."
"I agree with the special emphasis accorded to women’s rights, yet there are other problems, which, given their magnitude, are worthy of greater concern."
"Indeed, the rapporteur acknowledges that positive developments have taken place in the situation of women."
"Let us not forget that some of these countries only acquired their independence relatively recently, and that they have lived through periods of major instability, and in some cases even war."
"This region is made up of a variety of ethnic and cultural groups."
"Major change does not, therefore, occur overnight."
"In light of all of these points, I abstained in the vote on the resolution."
"I feel that the European Union must redouble its efforts to raise the level of development in these countries, and not to focus all its attention on the situation in one group only, whichever that may be."
"In so doing, we will see not only positive development for women, but also, more importantly, a reduction in many of the problems that ravage the Western Balkans."
". The call to eliminate the use, production, storage and transfer of anti-personnel landmines is right and appropriate."
"We are particularly concerned to note the existence of vast mined areas, which claim thousands of victims – mostly children – and which prevent people from returning to their homes, from cultivating their land and from starting their lives afresh following military conflict."
"This situation must stop."
"We must mobilise, as swiftly and effectively as possible, the resources required to clear mined areas, to help with the social and economic rehabilitation of victims and to destroy stockpiles of anti-personnel mines."
"It is similarly shocking that the United States – the country leading the arms race and the one that undertakes the highest number of military interventions – has announced that it will not sign up to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines, and that it has decided to retain its 8.8 million so-called ‘intelligent’ anti-personnel mines (equipped with self-destruction mechanisms)."
"The USA has also said that it will only stop using ‘conventional’ anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines after 2010, or, put another way, four years after the previously agreed deadline."
"Parliament has reached the end of its agenda(1)."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 22 April 2004."
"The first item is the formal opening of the first sitting of the enlarged European Parliament."
"Colleagues, today it is a very pleasant duty on behalf of Parliament to open this part-session."
"This Parliament now comprises the 626 Members elected for the fifth mandate of Parliament and the 162 new Members from the 10 new Member States, which acceded to the European Union on Saturday, 1 May."
"It is for our Parliament – as we have already marked in a symbolic ceremony outside – a special and extraordinary moment."
"In Dublin last Saturday, Ireland's Nobel literature laureate Seamus Heaney captured this special event with the words 'On a day when newcomers appear, let it be a homecoming.'"
"This is indeed a homecoming and we are so pleased that so many new colleagues join us today."
"It is a moment of hope, a moment that shows that determined will within the European Union, its institutions and Member States can deliver real results: a win-win situation for all involved."
"Fifteen years ago, early in 1989, this would have looked like an impossible dream, but it has come true: what a wonderful moment."
"From this platform I should like to issue – on behalf of the 626, to the 162 – a heartfelt, warm welcome to this Parliament."
"I should like to pay tribute to all who have contributed to this moment, parliamentarians – European and national, Member State governments, many presidencies of the European Council and the determined leadership of the European Commission."
"I am sure the House would want me in particular to thank Mr Verheugen for his extraordinary personal leadership."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me also to express the emotion of this moment."
"We all felt this emotion when, accompanied by the Ode to Joy, our European anthem, we saw the ten new flags hoisted alongside the 15 already flying on the masts in front of Parliament."
"The emotion of a day on which we are seeing the fulfilment of the ambitions and hopes of so many people who have fought for freedom for so many years."
"A moment which means overcoming brutal scars, which for too many years have marked an artificial division of our Europe, the division which originated in war, the division which left many European countries separated by this wall of shame, by this completely artificial Iron Curtain, which goes against our very nature, which left all of those countries in a situation of oppression and communist dictatorship."
"The twenty-first century must overcome the horrors of the twentieth century, and we are overcoming the horrors we have experienced in Europe for good."
"The twenty-first century is the century which will see Europe burst onto the international stage as a leading player, in the concert of nations."
"To this end, we must conclude the agreement on the Constitutional Treaty as soon as possible, which would genuinely provide us with the instruments and capacities Europe needs in order to become a reality not only on our continent, but as a principal player on the international stage."
"That is what we must all achieve together."
"We are witnessing an historic moment in this Parliament."
"An historic moment which is a repeat of what we have seen on the television or personally, in some cases, in recent days, on 1 May 2004, which will forever remain a fundamental milestone in Europe’s full recovery."
"I would like to say to these 162 new Members of Parliament, Mr President, that we in the Commission hope to continue with the cooperation that has taken place over all these years between the two institutions, together with the Council, building this thrilling project which is Europe."
"A project which ultimately seeks peace and to guarantee freedom, democracy, human rights, human dignity, on our continent, but which also wishes to be a beacon and to support our values, our principles and our aspirations at international level."
"I would like to say that we see the Commission, and we all agree on this, as the true heart of this European project."
"But this heart beats thanks to the support it receives systematically in this Parliament."
"This Commission, which has been key to promoting enlargement, this Commission, which throughout these years has been able to promote a cooperative, collaborative and respectful working relationship with Parliament and also with the other essential institution, the Council."
"Mr President, these are historic days and moments."
"Days which will remain in our memory, which will be an example for future generations: everybody working as one – Parliament, Council and Commission – for this great project, for this great ambition which is Europe."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the hour in which a dream becomes reality, a moment of such magnitude that I have to admit that I am overwhelmed by it and can scarcely keep a grip on my emotions."
"A freely-elected European parliament, representing 25 self-aware, free and sovereign European nations, having voluntarily bound themselves together in an association, goes far beyond the boldest hopes of those who first dreamed and thought of European integration."
"More now than ever, am I convinced that this great enlargement, which has now been completed, is a shining example of the attractiveness, dynamism and youth of the European ideal, an ideal that has not grown old, and whose attractiveness is demonstrated by the nations that have had to walk a hard road in search of freedom, democracy and the rule of law."
"This enlargement is also evidence of what we Europeans can do when, together, we get stuck in to a great project and when we have the will to see it through to completion."
"There were not many who thought we would do it, and we can take pride in what has been achieved."
"As I see it, this is final proof that the idea of European integration has a future."
"There are a number of popular beliefs going around at the moment, and I would like to lay them to rest."
"Firstly, European integration is not an elite project; this enlargement, in any case, was a matter of the peoples’ express desire and stated will."
"It would not have come about had not the peoples of the Baltic states, the Poles, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the Hungarians and the Slovenes made it unequivocally plain that they wanted to belong, once and for all, to the democratic family that the united Europe is, rather than to be left isolated in the no-man’s-land between East and West."
"Secondly, this great enlargement makes Europe stronger rather than weaker, both in political and economic terms."
"There are risks and problems involved in it, as well we all know, but the chances and opportunities far outweigh the risks, and we have good cause to be optimistic."
"Those of you, honourable Members, who hail from the new Member States will have a difficult task back home; you will encounter scepticism and doubt because things are not going as quickly as people would like."
"Whether or not the belief in European integration will remain strong enough to sustain future great projects will, to a large degree, depend on you."
"Thirdly and finally, joining in this great work of integrating Europe does not mean the surrender of sovereignty or of national identity."
"Those who – in both the new and old Member States – assert that European integration means the end of popular sovereignty do not understand the world as it is today."
"Not one country in Europe today is capable, on its own, of dealing with the problems that beset us."
"Not one country in Europe can cope with the consequences of globalisation on its own."
"Not one country can single-handedly balance growth and social justice."
"Not one country can, relying on itself alone, win the war against terrorism and international crime."
"We can only do it together."
"National sovereignty can be exercised and defended only if it is exercised jointly with others."
"That is the fundamental idea, and that is why we are here."
"I thank all those who have played their part in getting us this far, especially your House and your President, Pat Cox, who has given you firm political leadership."
"I wish to thank the committees, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and its Chairman, Mr Brok."
"My thanks go to all the political groups that have been with us throughout in a critical and constructive spirit."
"From the depths of my heart, I welcome you all here and rejoice at being able to work with you."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President de Palacio, Commissioner Verheugen, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to start by saying something personal."
"It is my privilege to have been a Member of this House ever since 1979, when it was, for the first time, directly elected."
"If, during the 1979 election campaign, somebody had said that, on 1 May 2004, the European Union’s Member States would include three nations occupied by the Soviet Union – those being Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Warsaw Pact states of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, part of Communist Yugoslavia, not to mention Malta and Cyprus – the latter of which will, we hope, one not too distant day be a united country – then, in 1979, when the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our answer would probably have been that this was a lovely vision, a wonderful dream, and a great hope, but that we feared that this dream, this vision, this hope – much though we desired it – would not become reality in our lifetime."
"That dream has become reality."
"The fact that we are able, today, to welcome 162 Members of this Parliament from these 10 countries makes this a great day for democracy, and a great deal for parliamentarianism."
"Let us rejoice that we can welcome as colleagues our new Members today!"
"Let us not forget that it was our House, with every political group playing its part, that insisted that we would be negotiating not merely with five countries but with 12, and that those who were not yet ready would be given the opportunity to catch up."
"The fact that ten countries have joined the European Union today is attributable to our demand, in this House, that the negotiations should include Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and they have made it."
"We should congratulate them all."
"Let us not forget that, as we know, the reports on the European Parliament in the media do not always reflect the decisions taken in it."
"It was our House that demanded a timetable for the negotiations – which the Commission and the Nice Summit accepted – so that they could be completed in time, enabling the countries capable of doing so, and their people, to take part in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament."
"It was our House that did that!"
"That is what we should be telling people, and it is something of which we can be proud, for it helps to make democracy real in Europe and to give the people of the ten countries the opportunity to send freely-elected representatives to the European Parliament."
"Let us rejoice in that!"
"Everyday life will soon catch up with us, and, necessary though great speeches are, it is not by them that Europe is maintained."
"Today is a wonderful day, as 1 May was, but everyday life will soon overtake us; we will discuss things, we will argue about things too, but we, the people of the European Union, must remind ourselves of what is new and represents a great opportunity; that the great thing about this European Union is that our discussions and arguments are now carried on with words, no longer by force and weaponry."
"That is a great step forward for our continent of Europe in the twenty-first century."
"My dear friends … perhaps my addressing you as ‘dear friends’ was a slip of the tongue, and I apologise, but we do somehow belong to one another through our shared ideal of European unity."
"At the impressive ceremony outdoors, Mr President, we heard not only from you, with your impressive speech, but from Lech Walesa."
"He embodies solidarity, and solidarity must mean for all of us a future in which we of course have to respect the national interests of individual countries, such as those of the Baltic States with their minorities, whilst not jeopardising those countries’ independence, an obligation that is reciprocal."
"Anything else, therefore, we have to speak out against, as Commissioner Verheugen has done, and I would like to thank him for making the important point that this Europe of ours in founded upon solidarity."
"That will benefit all of us."
"For the first time in its long millennia of history, this continent has the opportunity to face the future in peace and partnership."
"This is our continent, an ancient continent endlessly renewing itself, and nobody will succeed in dividing us."
"Side by side, we walk into the future together; this is a great day for us all!"
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in particular those of you from the ten new countries joining us."
"First of all, Mr President, I would like to thank you and congratulate you because you have been a worthy representative of the European Parliament during these events."
"I would also like to thank and congratulate the Prodi Commission and in particular Commissioner Verheugen for having pushed ahead with this task."
"Today we have a date with history and with our future."
"By means of the decisive step we took last Saturday we are taking a great and historic step forward by bringing together the majority of the landmass and population of our continent, for the first time in history, without an emperor, a king, a general or a dictator deciding to do so."
"This is a decision taken freely by all of us."
"And that is what makes the difference."
"We have heard the Ode to Joy by Beethoven, who was also someone who fought for freedom, and political censorship made him change the word to , and I therefore believe that we should call it the Ode to Joy and Freedom, because it is freedom which has united all of us."
"We have been able to take this step because we believe in democracy, in freedom, in respect for human rights, in governance, in the rule of law and in a secular Union which respects everybody's beliefs and philosophies."
"This is what has allowed us to unite in these circumstances."
"It is democracy that has allowed this to happen."
"Nor must we forget that on this continent we have lived through a twentieth century which has been the age of extremes and during part of which Nazi, fascist and communist dictatorships have predominated."
"First there was the liberation of Europe following the world war and then a chain reaction which has been gathering pace; little more than a week ago we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Revolution of the Carnations in Portugal, which was a key event in terms of ending the dictatorship of Salazar; then my country joined ..."
"... then we had in Poland; then came the fall of the Berlin Wall and now we are consolidating what we have done following that event, with the entry of the ten new Members."
"My Greek colleagues point out to me that they also defeated a fascist dictatorship, I believe that we can all congratulate ourselves because we have had to fight to win freedom and I also hope that now, with the entry of the ten new Members we can complete this historic process and that we do not have to wait long for the Republic of Cyprus to be reunited, since this too is an essential step."
"Never before in European history have so many people lived together in peace, democracy, under the rule of law and on the basis of a shared sovereignty and destiny."
"Europe is being reborn. This is a great challenge and a process of historic construction of the greatest importance, not only to live interdependently, but also to respond to globalisation;"
"Europe has a great deal to contribute."
"We have great challenges before us; firstly, to overcome our own fears, and we must not forget that the general public does have these fears; we must work to educate and explain, pointing out that the opportunities far outweigh the costs, and that we are prepared to confront that complexity."
"Why?"
"Because there is a spirit of solidarity and furthermore foundations which maintain us and fortify us through shared values."
"Shared values which are based on mutual tolerance and fraternity."
"The engagement – a long one – has come to an end, and we have wed."
"We now share the same house and the same future."
"Now we are a family with not just the same rights, but also with the same obligations, and this applies to those that were present at the outset, those of us that have joined, such as my own country and others, and those that are joining now."
"I believe that the best thing we could do to end this legislature and move on to this Europe of 25 Member States is to ensure the conclusion of the process of definitively approving the European Constitution which, fortunately, has been unblocked since March. I am justifiably proud to come from a country that has allowed the deadlock to be broken."
"I believe we should call on the Council, which is unfortunately absent today, and the Intergovernmental Conference, which you will have to address, Mr President, to fulfil its duty and its historic responsibility so that we may have a European Constitution by June."
"That is the next stage, which will complete this successful round of enlargement."
"I hold out my hand as a mark of friendship to all our new friends and colleagues joining us today."
"I should like to welcome to the House the former Prime Minister of Hungary, Mr Gyula Horn, under whose premiership the borders first opened in 1989."
"Mr President, as the very first speaker from the new countries I feel deeply moved."
"As a Liberal and Hungarian I should like to underline that on 1 May the legacy of the dreadful Yalta Pact was deservedly consigned to the dustbin of history."
"This is the most important thing, and I should like to express my thanks to you all for this."
"Please permit me to give my special thanks to the ELDR and the Liberal family, because the Liberals were already firm supporters of the enlargement at a time when others were perhaps still hesitating."
"I was pleased and proud of the fact that the Liberal group was the only one that voted unanimously for the enlargement, and they considered us to be full members of the group from the very first day."
"Now, when some governments have made a last minute decision to prevent the free movement of labour, once again it is only the Liberals who have unanimously rejected these unfair restrictions."
"Yalta is over, but Europe has not yet been fully united."
"I send you a message from here, that the Liberals want to remain the driving force of enlargement in the future, until Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, even Turkey, and at some point in time, the entire Balkans unite with Europe."
"We Hungarians and Liberals will do everything we can to help them comply with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Mr President, has the political transformation been a success?"
"Of course it has, since today we are all here together with you."
"However, you must also be aware that the transformation was far, far longer and more painful than we once hoped."
"The time has come for people to enjoy the advantages offered by the enlarged Union."
"Our people hope to have a life where their hard work bears fruit."
"We need to talk a lot about the opportunities offered by the Union."
"I am talking about money, but I should like you to know that this is not just about money."
"The Union has triumphantly united not only countries but also nations that had previously been at war with each other."
"This is why I believe that the Union will provide a splendid resolution of the Trianon trauma."
"Borders that have separated people until now will disappear, we will all become valued nations and citizens of Europe with equal standing."
"I believe that the Union will change our political culture, hatred will be replaced by fair competition and there will be opportunities for cooperation."
"I believe that respect for citizens in the Union will continue to increase, because not just in the countries that are joining now, but in also in the existing members there is a lot to be done in the area of human rights."
"We will be able to meet the most important challenges – terrorism for example – in such a way that we do not have to sacrifice our freedom just to protect our lives."
"In my capacity as the Liberal leader of 92 Members from 46 European countries in our sister organisation, the Council of Europe, here in Strasbourg, I also express my thanks to the Council of Europe."
"Its contribution in developing our liberal values has been essential and now in this Chamber I reiterate that the role of the Council of Europe, with its 800 million European citizens, continues to be essential in assisting a more democratic, safer and more stable Europe."
"These two organisations together can ensure that one day we can really say that Europe, after centuries of division, is now reunited again."
"Let me conclude by saying that Europe is already strong and successful but we can make it much stronger and much more successful."
"The potential in European citizens is ready to be released."
"What else could our task ahead be, other than the freeing of this European potential?"
"Mr President, we are witnessing one of those great moments which the history books of the future will talk about."
"Today we are expressing our hope for a Europe of unity, solidarity and peace."
"With a view to the many common battles we have before us in order to make this lovely dream into a reality, we warmly welcome the people from the ten new States of the Union."
"For several years our group has made visits to those countries to promote dialogue and build partnerships with the forces of progress and with many social actors."
"I thought of their hopes and expectations on seeing the moving images of the events in the various capitals marking the enlargement from the Europe of Fifteen to the Europe of Twenty-Five."
"The conclusion I draw from this is that, if we want to succeed in this wonderful project, we must have the courage to open up the in-depth debate with all our citizens that we should have launched a long time ago."
"It must deal with a fundamental question, which I have often raised here and which is in all our hearts: what do we want to do together and what means should we create in order to achieve it?"
"So, is not the main of this enlarged Union, for many of our compatriots, to be stronger in order to defend a progressive model of solidarity within globalisation?"
"If that is the case, we cannot, for example, accept companies in this part of Europe indulging in the blackmail of relocation and, in the other part, seeking the least social and fiscal obligations."
"We must reverse this Malthusian approach with no future and accept that the real driving force for our common development is social progress and the promotion of the human capacities of all the peoples of the Union."
"All the instruments available to us must be employed in order to achieve this ambition."
"In order for enlargement to succeed, it is not sufficient to unite Europe, we must unite the Europeans!"
"Is not another reason for building this enlarged Union together to recover, for the citizens, the powers that have gradually been handed to market forces?"
"A document produced by the Commission’s forward studies unit stated in 1998, and I quote: ‘the Europeans are less and less willing to accept being presented with the ."
"Enlargement increases the urgency of this demand tenfold."
"The more we remove borders, the more we must increase the new rights of the citizens."
"Otherwise, the law of the jungle will prevail."
"We must create new rights for employees, for the general public, we must promote a genuine participative European democracy, from the places where we live and work to the heart of the institutions."
"We should set ourselves the objective of uniting the Europeans by means of common projects, with which they identify themselves and which they have crafted."
"Finally, what view of the world should the enlarged Europe promote by means of these initiatives?"
"In a recent article, Mr Cimoszewicz, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, wrote, and I quote: ‘It is life itself that settles the controversies not resolved by politicians’."
"That is true."
"I am convinced that, in recent times, life has in fact resolved many points which are controversial, particularly on the part to be played by the united Europe in the debate on how the world’s affairs should be managed."
"I believe that those are the challenges we now have to deal with together."
"It is in that spirit that I say – without hesitation – ’yes, I welcome the people from the new countries of the Union!’"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not everyone has the opportunity to experience an historic moment such as this: a positive historic moment of peace, of joy, of real progress, where the light of hope can easily outshine the slightly grey cynicism which we often come up against."
"It is a great privilege for which we should be proud of and grateful to all the men and women who have made this day a reality."
"Europe has not been reunited today: it has been united for the first time, and it is united today as never before, because it has never been united on the basis of democracy and the free will of the peoples."
"Over the past few days, when watching the television or personally taking part in the enlargement celebrations, I have found myself thinking often about my grandfather, Roberto, who was born in 1899 in a small town near Mantua, in Italy. He was part of the final conscription of young men sent to the front during the First World War."
"It is also to him and people like him that we should dedicate this day."
"Only three generations later and we are celebrating an unimaginable event, one which for a long time we did not even imagine."
"How many of us today have the same memories and have suffered the same anguish, but until today it was all characterised by different coloured flags?"
"Today our joy is painted in the same colours and plays to the same marvellous music."
"Nevertheless, this unification – and this is something which we should all know and tell ourselves – is unfinished; it is also pointless to deny that the happiness that we feel today – here, we, perhaps, to a certain extent the initiated – is less intense and more superficial in the streets of our cities, among the people."
"This is our challenge, the challenge of our generation: awareness of the path we have travelled must guide us in order to achieve the great dream, as yet incomplete, of a great united and democratic Europe."
"Over the next few months, before the end of the year, we have three significant opportunities to address together, not least to win over those who still have not gauged or do not believe in the importance of this day."
"The first – as has already been mentioned – is the Constitution."
"We still do not have a Constitution and negotiations may have recommenced, but certainly those who are still digging their heels in are very determined."
"We still do not have one, and we are not sure that we will have the Constitution that we want."
"Today we have to repeat unequivocally: the Constitution we are calling for is the one adopted by the Convention and not the one put forward in part during recent summits and intergovernmental conferences."
"The Europe, the Constitution that we want are still in danger, and have not yet been obtained."
"Therefore, we must all take action."
"The second issue which we must address – and if possible conclude by the end of the year – together in this Chamber, but also in the Commission and the Council, is the Cyprus question."
"Here again there is no point being hypocritical: it is a fact that enlargement will not be complete and real until the last wall in Europe has fallen."
"This, I repeat, concerns us all, because unfortunately this wall is still standing."
"The third and final issue which we must tackle before the end of the year, and which is undoubtedly urgent, is the war in Iraq."
"The European Union, both old and new, was unable to stop it and we must acknowledge this too."
"Preparing and having peace in that country, in that region, is a responsibility shared by us all, one which we must assume quickly and urgently, otherwise also this day, like certain others, will merely be a collection of rhetoric."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply honoured that it should have fallen to me to utter the first words in Polish in this House."
"Polish is the language of over 40 million Europeans."
"Before our eyes, ladies and gentlemen, the division of Europe is coming to an end, a division whose sources date back to the Second World War."
"In these days of joy and emotion, it is fitting, therefore, to remember all those to whom the New Europe is indebted for its reunification."
"I would like to pay homage to the millions of my countrymen, soldiers and civilians, who were victims of the Second World War."
"Unfortunately, their blood, spilled on the fields of battle, only secured peace and prosperity for one part of Europe."
"I would like to pay homage to all those in Poland and Central Europe who, in the Stalinist era, sustained the flame of freedom on the other side of the Iron Curtain."
"Their inspiration was varied: from democratic socialism through liberalism to Christian-democracy and conservatism."
"Today we must also pay homage to the political prisoners and victims of the Stalinist terror, although many of them did not live to see a united Europe."
"As a Pole, I take particular pride in pointing out to the House that today’s celebrations would not be taking place were it not for the spiritual inspiration of our great fellow countryman, His Holiness John Paul II."
"He inspired , the powerful social movement that led to the fall of Communism."
"President Lech Walesa, the leader of this movement became a symbol of the struggle for democracy and human rights for the world."
"He is our guest today in this Chamber."
"I also want to recall with pride that the leaders of my party, [Law and Justice], as well as many of its members, were active participants in the movement for political independence that was ."
"At this time I would also like to express gratitude to two great leaders of the Western world whose steadfast attitude in the eighties helped break the fetters that bound the nations of Eastern and Central Europe."
"I would like to thank Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan."
"The great task now before us is to make certain that the fruits of the reunification of the continent are fairly divided among all the nations of the New Europe."
"Our Union for Europe of the Nations Group will do everything to ensure that the New Europe gives new meaning to the word solidarity."
"Mr President."
"Welcome; now, what belongs together is being united."
"You are arriving in the nick of time and, with your hard-earned experience, you can help rescue our democracy."
"Democracy means bearing with each other on a daily basis and the right to get involved in elections."
"It is characterised by our being able to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and, subsequently, new laws and a new government."
"We get something in return for our vote."
"It can effect change and perform a monitoring function, and it can reward and punish."
"It counts."
"As a voter, I have some significance."
"I help to wield influence."
"This simple idea unites us, but it is unfortunately well hidden and not at all up front in the draft Constitution."
"We can still take part in national elections and change our vote in the Council of Ministers, but we cannot vote ourselves new laws in those areas in which the EU decides."
"We can take part in EU elections every five years but, here too, we cannot vote ourselves new laws or a new government."
"The EU President, the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister are all to be appointed by an alliance of 17 out of 25 prime ministers."
"The most important posts will presumably go to those who can no longer get elected in their own countries."
"Taken to its logical conclusion, this means you can be appointed if you can no longer be elected."
"The EU Prime Minister and the President of the Commission are to constitute their government through talks with the prime ministers."
"The indirectly appointed President is to decide who he wants from each country on the sole body able to table proposals."
"We shall never again be able to table proposals ourselves."
"This democratic deficit could be remedied by converting the EU into a democratic federation, but there is no common EU people that is ready for a common democracy."
"The only realistic democratic solution is to construct the EU from below as a Europe of democracies."
"Every country must have the right to elect its own Commissioner and send him or her to Brussels as our voters’ representative."
"Our Commissioner must come home every Friday and say what he has done in the past week and how he will vote during the following week."
"We should then have 25 elected representatives in Brussels, answerable to the voters in our countries."
"One fine day, we shall be able to unite the whole of Europe in equal cooperation between free nations gathered together to carry out the tasks we cannot successfully discharge in our own democracies."
"If we focus upon what we cannot deal with ourselves, we have nothing to lose."
"In that way, we should gain a share of influence when, otherwise, we should be without influence."
"Welcome to the work for openness, democracy and proximity to the people."
"Welcome to the fight for a Europe of democracies and diversity. To our Polish friends, we would say, moreover: congratulations on your national day."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the non-attached Members are too diverse for me to speak other than on my own behalf, apart of course from offering our new colleagues a ‘very great welcome’."
"They have learnt, over a much longer period of time and much more harshly than many of us, what independence and freedom mean."
"They have felt it in their flesh and blood, and I believe that, in this House, they will be able to maintain the true meaning of these words, rather than merely going through a rhetorical ritual."
"Today Europe is breathing with both of its lungs, the Pope has said."
"It is doing so for the first time since the end of the sixteenth century, when the Europe of the Roman Church had exactly the same borders, apart from Greece, as the Europe of 2004."
"History does not develop by chance."
"This Europe is going to breathe, and that is a good thing."
"Please allow me, however, to stress that this breathing is not without its worries."
"Europe is asking itself what its nature is and what future it has."
"It is asking this question, and the problem of borders, which is currently arising, highlights the point very clearly."
"I believe that this concern stems from an initial decision."
"Europe would like to be political."
"The European Union was created by men, by the founding fathers, who did not want it to be political: they wanted to create an area of peace through law and economics."
"But must I remind you that although peace on our continent has been ensured by means of law and economics, it was born out of balances of power and acts of faith?"
"It was the balance of power at the end of the war which brought peace, or at least ended the war."
"It was the balance of power in 1989 which brought down the Berlin Wall."
"There have been innumerable acts of faith such as those by de Gaulle and Adenauer, by Walesa, by Prague, by the countries of the East, by Chancellor Kohl reunifying Germany under the very noses of the Soviets."
"These are political acts of faith."
"If Europe wants to be a power, a real one, if it wants to map out its own destiny, its future, and if it wants to be able to defend, to sustain, to communicate its values, I believe we should return to reality and the reality is that Europe will not be built without the States."
"What are the true pillars of reality?"
"They are the States: it is they who can convince and lead their people not just to agreement on the superficial, but to agreement on the fundamentals."
"Not merely agreement on the good things, but also agreement on the difficult things, on crises, on hardships, on those which will inevitably come, since history is always littered with crises and pitfalls."
"Unless Europe is constructed with the States, it will be weak, it will be a sort of club founded upon the consumer – it is very interesting to note that we speak more often in this House of the consumer than of the citizen – it may or may not be comfortable, it may or may not be peaceful, it may or may not be rich, but either way it will be weak."
"And when one cannot communicate the values one defends, when one is, shall we say, a market, one’s future depends on predators."
"Protectors are often also predators, and I believe we should remember that from time to time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to make a small request."
"On 1 May, we saw the final defeat of Hitler and Stalin, and the victory of Walesa, Havel, Delors and Kohl."
"There are many, though, both in the acceding countries and in the original European Union, and in this House, who have played their part in bringing us to this moment."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to cause to be recorded in today’s Minutes the names of the ten rapporteurs for the ten countries."
"I will read their names in the order of the countries’ accession: Schröder, Poos, Gahler, Queiró, Elisabeth Schroedter, Souladakis, Stenzel, Gawronski, Volcic, and Wiersma; also the three rapporteurs who have passed on their brief to others: Mrs Hoff, Mrs Carlsson and Mr Matella."
"I ask you to honour them by having their names recorded."
"Thank you Mr Brok, the contribution by you and your colleagues will be recorded.(1)"
"–The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 22 April 2004 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"– Mr President, on a day like today, with its especially important debates on topics laden with emotion, I very much regret that we have to get back to something as banal as Minutes, but we have among us in this House a self-appointed hero, a courageous representative of the gutter press who is capable of anything."
"Mr Hans-Peter Martin has now gone so far as to falsify the Minutes of the European Parliament."
"Although Mr Martin had his voting on the van Hulten report corrected 13 times over, he was not even present for the vote."
"These 13 instances, right up to the final vote, include no fewer than seven votes by roll call, in which the name of Martin is not to be found anywhere in the Minutes."
"There were a total of 15 roll call votes on the van Hulten report, and this paragon of rectitude took part in none of them."
"All that, therefore, now has to be struck out of the Minutes all over again."
"In no document of this House is there room for deception and forgery."
"While it is not for me to advise you, Mr President, I find it impossible to refrain from referring to Rule 124 of our Rules of Procedure and to the possibilities afforded by it."
"– Mr President, I do, of course, strongly repudiate the accusation that I instigated falsification of the Minutes in any shape or form."
"I did no more and no less than to avail myself of my rights as a Member of this House."
"– The Minutes will record that the corrections do not stand on the grounds that the votes in question had not been cast."
"Mr President, in an interview with Mr Martin on prime time television in Ireland on Wednesday last week, I challenged him on two issues."
"I quote from the transcript of the programme: 'I want to put two questions to Mr Martin, if you don't mind."
"Is it not true, Mr Martin, that a Cologne court earlier this week ordered you to refrain from attacking the integrity of your fellow German MEPs on this issue or it will fine you EUR 250 000 or indeed imprison you for six months?"
"The second question I want to ask you, bearing in mind that you claim to be interested in reforming the expenses system, concerns the vote in the European Parliament last week."
"In fact I think there were just under 20 votes where proposals were being made to reform the expenses system and you were absent from every one of them."
"It seems to me that this is not the action of someone who is interested in reforming the system, it is the action of a hypocrite."
"You are proving what Pat Cox said about you, that you are doing this purely for personal publicity and not for genuine reasons.'"
"This is the man who is attacking our integrity and who is masquerading as a crusader."
"This is his answer – and people should listen to it – about Mrs Gebhardt."
"'I have never ever made these claims."
"I am an Austrian."
"I have never heard of these lawsuits or claims."
"I am very much surprised that they have suddenly come up with this.' The states: 'The court in Cologne advised Mr Martin not to further damage the reputation of Evelyne Gebhardt, threatening to sentence him to a fine of EUR 250 000 if he repeated his allegations."
"He further went on to say: 'As far as the participation in the vote, I was there.'"
"The interviewer then asked me: 'Is there not a need for some reform?"
"Do you accept that some reform is necessary?'"
"I replied: 'Absolutely necessary."
"We voted for it some time ago, but who stopped it?"
"Not the Parliament, it was the presidency, particularly the German and British Governments.'"
"Mr Martin interjected: 'But for additional privileges.'"
"I said: 'I also repeat: we voted it for last week again, but the alleged great crusader Mr Martin was absent for almost 20 votes.'"
"He said again: 'No, I was taking part in the votes – don't repeat this claim.'"
"I replied: 'You did not take part in the votes, the records show that.'"
"He then replied: 'I did, just look at the Minutes.'"
"He is a deceitful masquerader, damaging our reputation."
"Someone like him has no part in public life."
"Thank you, Mr Cushnahan, for returning to the Minutes at the end of your remarks."
"– Mr President, I do indeed repudiate all these insinuations and these utterly shabby assertions."
"Let me repeat that, at this vote too, on being called on to speak as the vote came to an end, what I said was that I had availed myself of my rights as a Member of this House."
"How that is to be recorded in the Minutes is a matter for Parliament’s administration."
"I have already told the House what the actual circumstances were."
"As regards what Mrs Gebhardt has said, I would like to reiterate, for the Minutes, that I have received no summons from the court in question, neither have I had any sort of direct communication from them, and I can only say that I never made the assertions attributed to me by the Press."
"That being so, I do not find it in the least difficult to refrain from repeating them, as I am in fact acquainted with Mrs Gebhardt’s circumstances, and have never said anything of the sort."
"All this is part and parcel of a reaction that Members of this House may find understandable, but the public will certainly know what value to attach to it."
"Just to be clear on the ruling concerning the Minutes on this matter, a Member may indeed seek to clarify a vote if the recorded vote is some way mistaken, even though it is on the record."
"A Member may not correct votes which were never cast in the first place."
"In this instance the votes were roll-call votes, and there is no roll-call indication of your vote in this regard, Mr Martin."
"It is thus not possible to correct a record which did not exist in the first place."
"These corrections will be struck from the Minutes."
"(1)"
"The final draft agenda adopted by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 29 April 2004 has been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I could not believe my eyes when I looked at this week's agenda; as you said, tomorrow, we will be voting on a request for the application of urgent procedure with regard to the agreement with the United States on passenger data."
"That has, in fact, been done and dusted; after all, what did we all do in this very Chamber two weeks ago?"
"This House decided then neither to approve nor to reject this agreement before the Court of Justice had ruled on it, because we want to respect the Court's verdict."
"It does appear, however, that the Council is unwilling to respect Parliament's verdict."
"COREPER is simply dissatisfied with the democratic vote we have held and wants us to do it again."
"Irrespective of what we decide, the Council itself will be rubberstamping the agreement as the first item on its agenda on Thursday morning and I have understood that our lawsuit may then be dropped."
"Although we in this House will need to deliberate on our subsequent plan of action, it seems evident that we will be unable to accept the Council's urgency declaration."
"We are not little children, and the decision previously taken by this House simply remains standing."
"Most of the coordinators of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs also share this opinion."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to remove this item from the agenda and not make us look complete fools, because otherwise we will open the floodgates to repeats of each vote whose outcome is not to the Council's liking."
"It seems to me that we have more than enough to do without having to do everything twice."
"The House is perfectly entitled to hear a speaker for and a speaker against and then, if it wishes, to vote to remove the item in question."
"In the light of our vote two weeks ago, the Council is perfectly entitled to make such a request if it wishes."
"I propose that if you are of the same opinion at voting time tomorrow, Mrs Buitenweg, we should hear a speaker for and a speaker against, vote on the procedure and then decide how to proceed as regards the substance."
"You are acting within your rights to object, Mrs Buitenweg; the Council is within its rights to make the request; and the House can decide what to do."
"Mr President, could you advise us before we vote as to whether there is any significance in the fact that the electorate on this issue will be different?"
"Two weeks ago the European Parliament had a different composition from what it will have tomorrow."
"Is it right to re-run a vote with a different electorate?"
"I would have thought that there is at least a question mark over that issue and I request that formal advice be provided on that point before we vote tomorrow."
"I agree with Mrs Buitenweg, and my Group opposed re-voting on this matter because it had already decided."
"The question is in the lap of the Court of Justice."
"It is important to know whether procedurally we are entitled to vote a second time."
"Procedurally, the House can decide that tomorrow."
"I will obtain a legal opinion on your question on how many may vote, but I was informed in earlier contacts that all those present who are now Members will be entitled to vote."
". Mr President, I could not agree more with Mrs Buitenweg."
"As I understand it, this item will be discussed tomorrow, and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that not only will a speaker for and a speaker against be allowed to take the floor, but the rapporteur will also be given the chance to speak."
"I have to say that I think it will be an extremely difficult job to convince a full House of people who have not followed the entire process to date, but I rely on the fact that the speaking time to which the rapporteur is entitled will be available to me tomorrow."
"Tomorrow the procedure will be as follows: I presume the Verts/ALE Group will sustain the objection made by Mrs Buitenweg."
"We will invite one speaker for and one speaker against."
"We will hear the rapporteur."
"We will vote on procedure and then, depending on the result of that vote, we may or may not proceed to a substantive vote."
"As regards the numbers voting, I will ask for a formal legal opinion to answer Baroness Ludford's question, although, in all probability, the number entitled to vote will be the larger number currently present."

"The next item is the commemoration of Jean Monnet and the twentieth anniversary of the draft Treaty establishing the European Union (1984 – Rapporteur: Altiero Spinelli)."
"Colleagues, members of the European Commission and Council, welcome to this special session of commemoration."
"In western Europe after the Second World War a number of people had the courage to look at the big picture."
"Among them were two people: Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli, whom we commemorate here today."
"We mark the 20th anniversary today of the adoption by this European Parliament of the first draft Constitutional Treaty for the European Union and the 25th anniversary of the death of Jean Monnet."
"I would like today to celebrate these two leaders of vision whose own leadership showed the will, political determination and capacity to think long, wide and big."
"They were not people who became lost in the petty detail: they rose above the detail."
"One thinks in particular of Monnet and the early generation of founders of the idea of modern European integration, who rose above the ashes of the Second World War, who were prepared to see hope at a time when there was only despair, to see opportunity when there was economic breakdown, and to see in the European project an ideal of reconciliation with opportunity and prosperity."
"This marked them out as a special generation among all the European generations that had gone before."
"The clarity and the strength of Monnet's vision has proven its worth because it has endured and because, even as we face the challenges of globalisation, that vision still holds true resonance today, rooted as it was and is in humanitarian values and supranational engagement."
"Monnet realised early that, acting alone, 'the nations of Europe are too circumscribed to give their people the prosperity made possible and hence necessary by modern conditions'."
"Monnet attached great importance to the moral and human aspects of the European idea, captured in the Schuman plan by the denunciation of the spirit of supremacy and discriminatory practices which had created complexes and ill-feelings between nations on our continent."
"They tackled the source of conflict at its root."
"Monnet was one of the first to understand and explain that the principle of European unification basically involves the search for a new humanism."
"On our continent war had followed war, creating a fatal cycle in which the victory of some led to the desire of revenge among others."
"His ambition was to break this vicious circle and to establish amongst the states the same relations founded on equality and arbitration that governed relations between individuals in democratic societies."
"In this spirit, Jean Monnet became the advocate of a new morality, relying on people and their capacity to make progress by drawing lessons from the most painful experiences they had been through."
"As Jean Monnet said, 'we are not uniting states, we are uniting people'."
"Today one of the major outstanding challenges we face is the adoption of a new Constitutional Treaty for the European Union."
"We recall here in the European Parliament with some pride the leadership that was given by this House, and in particular by Altiero Spinelli and his colleagues, some 20 years ago when they brought to fruition, through this Parliament, the first ever draft Constitutional Treaty for the European Union."
"I am proud to say that during this mandate, the determination to lead constitutional change and the capacity to show real parliamentary leadership has continued to manifest itself before, during and after the European Convention."
"In this context let me also pay tribute to the work of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to its chairman, Mr Napolitano."
"We thank them – and we thank you, Mr Napolitano – for your untiring work and your unfailing determination to make sure that we meet with success on this grand European project."
"So, as we commemorate these two visionary European leaders today, I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to call on the foreign ministers of the Union of 25 when they next meet to make a solemn declaration of political intent that they will urgently bring closure to a new Constitutional Treaty for Europe."
"If we do not have a Constitutional Treaty before the elections, then we want this declaration, because the people of Europe are entitled to know what they are voting on."
"This declaration is the minimum necessary if a Treaty cannot be concluded by the date of the election."
"I would ask Minister Roche to convey that to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"In recalling these two leaders, Monnet and Spinelli, the one clear lesson for us going forward is that we too are called upon to think long, to think wide, to think big."
"We too are called upon to bring the humanitarian and moral dimension into what we do, and if we do it, the Europe of values which took a great step forward in this House yesterday as we grew to a Union of 25, is a Union which in the future can touch its people as, at the time of these leaders, it touched them in the past."
". Mr President, if Jean Monnet were standing here today, surveying this Parliament he would have good reason to rejoice."
"He would see representatives of 25 countries and 450 million people sitting side-by-side, striving together for the common welfare of the people of Europe."
"He would see a Parliament in which parties operate on a cross-national and sometimes pan-European basis, where representatives from across our continent find as much common cause with colleagues from other countries as they do with their own compatriots."
"If Monnet were to look beyond this Parliament today, he would see countries which for centuries had been bitter enemies working hand-in-hand as convinced partners."
"He would have reason to rejoice."
"Like Monnet, Spinelli was a man of vision."
"His vision of a democratic and transparent citizens' Union gave impetus to the idea that a Constitutional Treaty would enhance the Union's credibility."
"It gave impetus also to the idea that we the citizens deserved a Union that was comprehensible to us and working in our interests."
"Monnet hoped to make war between the nations of Europe not just unthinkable but materially impossible."
"Today we can see that the dream is closer than ever to becoming a reality."
"John Hume, the Nobel Laureate and Member of this House, once said: 'Our European Union has become the most successful peace process in Europe's long history'."
"The two men – Monnet and Spinelli – were different in many ways."
"Monnet tended to work quietly behind the scenes, using his legendary international networking skills to build the widest case for a new Europe."
"Monnet laid the foundations for this enterprise."
"Spinelli, on the other hand, was a much more public figure, a vigorous opponent of fascism in the first half of the last century; in his later days an elected Member of this Parliament."
"They shared, however, a vital similarity: they were men of action, determined to harness their vision of a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Europe to the means of advancing it in the real world."
"What was it about these men that has allowed the ideas they promoted many decades ago to create the impetus which, even after their deaths, propels all of us forward to continue their work?"
"Perhaps Monnet's biographer, François Duchêne, described his subject best when he wrote that Monnet's secret 'came from a combination of creative and critical faculties."
"He appealed to the romantic in people through the idealism of his goals, and to the expert in them through the realism of his means.'"
"Making a new, peaceful Europe was Monnet's greatest dream."
"Twenty-five years after his death we continue to build on the foundations he laid."
"Spinelli, like Monnet, believed that, without radical positive change, Europe would be condemned to repeat its past fatal errors and endanger its future existence."
"In 1947 he suggested that 'nothing is sadder than the fact that the ideal Europe, the cradle of law and liberty, constitutes only part of the geographical area of Europe."
"What is more', he added, 'that area is certain to shrink and European civilisation to become a mere historical memory, unless we can at least unite what at present remains of it.'"
"The European Union has risen to this challenge."
"What drove both men was their experience and their abhorrence of war."
"However, as they sought to communicate ideas and goals that would help rescue Europe from itself they could hardly have thought that from the rubble of the Second World War such a strong, united Europe would come about."
"Sixty years ago Europe was struggling with the last phase of the most destructive war in its history."
"Against this background the European Union, in spite of its imperfections, is a heroic endeavour undertaken against great odds."
"It has a record of assisting peace and prosperity among European nations and beyond, when history seemed to insist that such a goal amounted to little more than a flight of fancy."
"Last Saturday we witnessed an extraordinary reversal of history with the formal ending of the artificial divisions of Europe."
"The enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States is a tribute to the potency of a dream."
"It is also a tribute to the endurance and courage of many millions in central and eastern Europe who often suffered for dreaming those dreams aloud."
"The Budapest uprising of 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968 and the Baltic singing revolutions of 1990 have contributed to the construction of a Europe at the outset of the 21st century that few Europeans would have dreamed of throughout the previous 2000 years of our troubled history."
"The French writer Victor Hugo said in 1849 that a day would come when 'all you nations of the continent, without losing your distinct qualities and glorious individuality, will merge into a higher unity and found the European brotherhood'."
"That day is upon us."
"Now is not the time for complacency to find a home in the new Europe."
"We cannot simply stand back and admire our handiwork."
"Now is the time for new ambitions."
"On Saturday the President of Ireland said: 'Our continent is ancient but our Union is young'."
"We still have work to do and ambitions that remain unfulfilled."
"Mr President, as you said, one of those ambitions must be the Constitutional Treaty and its very early completion."
"We must be careful to protect the freedom, justice, human rights, and political pluralism that that are the bedrocks of our Union."
"We must continue to build on the peace that Monnet saw replacing the deadly rivalries of his generation and their ancestors."
"We must also ensure that the new needs and circumstances of the Union are reflected in its basic law."
"On the 20th anniversary of the adoption by Parliament of Spinelli's draft Constitutional Treaty we must work to agree a new Treaty that will improve the basis for democratic discourse in our Union, that will build on the success of our Union, and that will make the Union more readily understood and effective."
"The first major task we face together in the new Union will be to agree the new Constitutional Treaty."
"In March we decided to reach agreement at the latest by the June European Council meeting – just six weeks away."
"Early agreement on a new Treaty that allows the Union to develop and prosper is the best way to commemorate the work of Jean Monnet and to mark the 20th anniversary of this Parliament's draft Constitution which was presented by Spinelli."
"That is the challenge that faces us over the next few weeks – working together we will meet that challenge"
"Even as we meet here today, representatives from the 25 Member States meet in Dublin to hammer out details in relation to the Treaty."
"We wish them well in that work."
"The whole of Europe is looking to them to fulfil the dream of Spinelli and Monnet."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has had the excellent idea of paying tribute to the memory of Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli during the final part-session of its fifth legislature as an assembly elected by universal suffrage."
"Although they are not the only founding fathers of Europe, Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli, perhaps more than any other, represent the incredible development of Europe since the Second World War as a result of their vision and their tangible actions."
"Jean Monnet taught us what we had to do, and thus in the declaration of 9 May 1950 he wrote, ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single, general plan. It will be built through concrete achievements, which first create a de facto solidarity’."
"This simple sentence indicated the direction we had to take and which we have been following since the 1950s: concrete achievements in order to create de facto solidarity."
"The famous step-by-step policy."
"I am convinced that the enlargement of the Union of 1 May, which will not be the last, is an eloquent example of this principle."
"But this simple statement at the same time points to the ultimate destination of this road: Europe, the single, general plan."
"Today, de facto solidarity exists and Europe is preparing to adopt its Constitutional Treaty."
"Jean Monnet established the foundations for the current European Union and proposed the method for achieving it."
"Through his own concrete achievements, in particular as the first President of the High Authority of the ECSC and, above all, as the constant and determined inspiration for the subsequent development of European integration."
"The Action Committee for a United States of Europe, which he promoted over the course of 20 years, inspired many fertile ideas which have subsequently been put into practice."
"I would like today to remind you all of his actions to promote direct elections to the European Parliament, which allowed us to be where we are today, with a Parliament that has real legislative and control powers."
"Jean Monnet died 25 years ago, just before the first elections which brought Altiero Spinelli to the European Parliament."
"Like Monnet, Spinelli offered Europe his vision and his achievements."
"I would point out that he was a European Commissioner before becoming an MEP."
"Today we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the European Parliament’s adoption of the draft Treaty establishing the European Union, usually called, quite rightly, the ‘Spinelli draft’, since Spinelli was not just its rapporteur, but also the inspiration behind it."
"With hindsight, we can say without hesitation that without this draft we would not have the draft European Constitutional Treaty today."
"Hence, with the draft of 1984 the process began within the Union which led to the successive revisions of the Treaty of Rome, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice, and, subsequently, to the constitutional discussions which took place within the framework of the European Convention."
"The Spinelli draft was innovative in several respects, eight years before the Treaty of Maastricht advocated the creation of a genuine European Union, based on the European Community."
"Various fundamental provisions of the Treaty of Maastricht stem directly from the Spinelli draft, such as those relating to citizenship of the Union, respect for fundamental rights or the introduction of the principle of subsidiarity when allocating and exercising the Union’s competences."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam took up the idea of providing for the possibility of imposing sanctions on a State in the event of serious or persistent violation of the democratic principles or fundamental rights upon which we are founded."
"There are other provisions which anticipated, 20 years earlier, the draft Constitutional Treaty produced by the Convention."
"I would like in particular to mention the explicit expression of the primacy of Union law, the introduction of the concept of a Union law, restricted to the fundamental principles of Union action, the duty of the Commission to initiate the programming of the Union's activities and Parliament's final say in the budgetary field."
"Finally, we may have to wait for a new phase of European integration to begin in order to introduce certain supplementary provisions."
"I would point out, in particular, Article 82 of the Spinelli draft which laid down that when the Treaty had been ratified by a majority of States representing two thirds of the total population of the Union, the governments of the States which had ratified it would meet immediately to reach a common agreement on the procedures and the date of entry into force of the new Treaty, as well as relations with the States which had not yet ratified it."
"Something which in a Union of 25 States or more will inevitably have to be considered."
"Whatever form it might take, the Spinelli draft proposed the idea of founding the Union upon a fundamental Treaty which would be a genuine Constitution for Europe and would hence become the single, general plan which Jean Monnet considered to be the inevitable consequence of concrete achievements."
"These two men, who were so different in terms of culture and temperament, worked together throughout the 1950s."
"In this way, the visionary Spinelli proposed concrete solutions to the pragmatic Monnet, who in turn enshrined his vision of Europe in his proposals to the different governments."
"This combination of pragmatism and idealism is what we need most in the current European situation."
"The challenges are different, but the method is still valid."
"We need will and determination, generosity and ambition, in order to create a Europe of peace and prosperity, of values and civilisation, which works for solidarity in the world: our Europe."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for paying tribute to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its chairman for the last five years."
"You see, Mr President, it is important for the history of the creation of this united Europe, begun more than 50 years ago, to become part of the common memory of the peoples represented in Parliament today: we should retrace and go back over this history in terms of the dates and milestones which characterised it and in terms of its protagonists."
"Today we are commemorating two of them who were not members of a government, who did not sign treaties, who did not work in the spotlight reserved for the powerful, but who were great men of vision and exponents of integration, that is, Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli."
"They were both convinced that Europe, divided and bloodstained following two devastating wars in the first half of the twentieth century, would only have a future if it united and overcame nationalism, rivalry and hostility between the States."
"They pointed out the path to take in order to establish a common European interest and to create institutions capable of expressing and pursuing it through the exercise of joint sovereignty."
"While it is true that Monnet and Spinelli had different approaches, different strategies to advance the cause of a united Europe, it is even more true that their ideal was the same and that they both dedicated their lives’ work to it."
"The strategy of Jean Monnet and the great French statesman, Robert Schuman, for whom he was a valuable adviser, was a strategy based on integrating the production, starting with coal and steel, the economies and the markets of the countries participating in the project, a strategy for the gradual development of European integration."
"It was defined as functionalist, aimed to lay tangible foundations for peace in Europe, firstly between France and Germany, and gave rise to the Communities which remained in operation until the Treaty of Maastricht of 1991."
"The strategy for which Altiero Spinelli was the combative standard-bearer was, on the contrary, a constituent strategy, for the political foundation of European unity according to a federalist design, and it was supported by the ideas of a great Italian statesman: Alcide De Gasperi."
"But at critical times, for example in 1955 when, following the failed attempt to create a Europe Defence Community, the integration process seemed to come to a standstill, the efforts of Monnet and Spinelli, although they followed different paths, both headed in the same direction."
"Spinelli wrote that he and Monnet were both stubbornly slaving away: Monnet in the hope of obtaining a fresh initiative from the governments, and he in the hope of obtaining from the movement new momentum, a new bottom-up stimulus."
"He said that despite their shared scepticism and all the obstacles, they would win."
"And that is what happened."
"That prophecy came true: the believers in Europeanism, the tenacious exponents of integration and fighters, Monnet and Spinelli, were victorious."
"We have now met goals, Mr President, which not even they dared to hope for, and finally the dream of European integration can be fulfilled: a dream which already took tangible form 20 years ago when the European Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority the draft drawn up under the guidance of Altiero Spinelli, on 14 February 1984; also that date, which we are commemorating today, is celebrated as the date of birth of the constituent process."
"Twenty years on, the dream has become a fundamental requirement for the great new Europe."
"The constituent process must at last be achieved by approving the draft adopted by the Convention on the Future of Europe."
"We cannot stop now, we cannot turn back."
"The draft Constitution is not perfect, but it constitutes common ground established with difficulty between governments and parliaments."
"It could be improved by drawing on the Spinelli draft of 20 years ago, for example where it laid down – as Mrs de Palacio said – that the Treaty would enter into force as soon as it was ratified by a majority of the Member States and the population of the Community."
"The text of the Convention could be improved but it must not be weakened because, in that case, the newly created Union of 25 would run the risk of grinding to a halt and falling into crisis."
"And so nobody, none of the governments participating in the Intergovernmental Conference should retract their words and withdraw the approval they expressed in the Convention: this is the appeal which once again Parliament is making to everyone; this is the best way to honour in practice, without rhetoric, Altiero Spinelli and Jean Monnet."
"– Mr President, my group believes the initiative to commemorate Monnet and Spinelli today to be a good one."
"Because without Monnet, the great inspiration in the shadows, the declaration of 9 May 1950, which is the founding act of European construction, could not be understood, and without the declaration there would not have been Franco-German reconciliation and it would not have been possible to reconcile the Europeans."
"And without his decisive advocacy of de facto solidarity it would not have been possible to make progress towards a common market, the forerunner to political union."
"And without his institutional vision, and in particular the key role for the European Commission, we would not have been able to overcome the straitjacket of cooperation between governments."
"Also 20 years ago – and this has been pointed out here – this House, which had been democratically elected for the first time, approved the Treaty which we know as the ‘Spinelli Treaty’, whose rapporteur was Spinelli himself."
"The ‘Spinelli Treaty’ has been an essential reference for all successive modifications: the Single Act, the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice and, of course, the Treaty drawn up by the Convention."
"When I had the honour of chairing the European Parliament's delegation to that Convention, I always had the Spinelli draft beside me."
"And I would think to myself, ‘what would Spinelli say about this?’ and I must acknowledge that, although it was produced 20 years ago, the ‘Spinelli Treaty’ was incredibly relevant to today and many of the proposals he made are now in the Constitutional Treaty."
"There is something which unites Monnet and Spinelli, Mr President: both wanted to unite people."
"‘Let us unite men’, said Monnet."
"And the whole of the ‘Spinelli Treaty’ is full of references to citizens, to people."
"I believe – and my friend Dick Roche said this earlier – that they would both feel proud of what we have done over these years, because I believe that the draft Constitutional Treaty is a treaty for people."
"And this starts with the first article, which speaks of a Union of States and citizens, and also where it grants the European Parliament full legislative powers and powers of political control, or where it introduces national parliaments, by means of the early warning system. There is also the popular initiative and the recognition of the role of the regions and municipalities and of NGOs, all of which is in favour of people."
"In our work over 50 years, we have done what both Monnet and Spinelli called for: to unite people."
"And allow me to tell you a little secret: as a child, as I was, between Monnet and Spinelli, when I left my country, which in the words of Gil de Biedma was ‘an old inefficient country’, I was faced with a Europe full of walls, the Berlin Wall, the wall of the Pyrenees, the wall of dictatorships, the wall of egotisms and the wall of nationalisms."
"Today’s Europe, the Europe which my daughter sees, is a Europe without walls, and those which still remain will fall."
"At this moment when a wonderful enlargement has taken place, with which we have sewn together two Europes, with which we have realised that project expounded in the declaration of 9 May, I would like to say to the new countries which make up the European Union that they should enjoy their incorporation into the Union just as we Spaniards enjoyed ours, with the prospect of freedoms, prosperity and above all of sharing a common project."
"Mr President, we politicians often talk about the future and I believe there will be time to fight the battles and overcome the obstacles we face, but I believe that today we have meditated on the past, on Monnet and Spinelli, and I would ask that we take pleasure in the present."
"Because today's present is a wonderful one."
"Monnet and Spinelli would certainly be described as utopian, but Lamartine was right when he said that utopia is nothing more than a truth whose time has not yet come."
"And today the ups and downs of life often make reality much nicer than literature."
"I therefore believe that today we must enjoy this wonderful moment, savour it, take pleasure in it."
"We have created the Greater Europe, and on this marvellous morning, as I walked towards this Strasbourg palace, I remembered that episode of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in Valmy, when he suddenly stood up in front of a group of people and, possessed by an extraordinary strength, said: ‘we are witnessing an historic moment, life will never be the same and you will be able to say: we were there’."
"Mr President, just over 20 years ago I had the immense privilege of working closely with Altiero Spinelli when he was the general rapporteur on the draft Treaty that we are commemorating today and I was a young, enthusiastic member of Parliament's secretariat."
"It was in many ways for me a dream come true: I was fresh from coordinating the 'yes' campaign in Britain in the referendum on our membership of the European Community in 1975."
"I had been the coordinator of the 'yes' campaign at Oxford University."
"I had then led a group of students to Rome to demonstrate outside a European Council meeting in favour of having – novel idea – direct elections to this European Parliament – one of Spinelli's main campaign themes at that time."
"So to then work with Spinelli was an immense honour and privilege."
"I found I was working with a remarkable man, who 40 years before the draft Treaty was already making history when, as a political prisoner of Mussolini – which he was for 17 years – he co-authored the Ventotene Manifesto, which already in 1941 said that: 'If our struggle against fascism is successful and if we win this war, then it will all have been in vain if it simply leads to the re-establishment of the old system of totally sovereign nation states in shifting alliances."
"The main challenge after the war must be to bind the countries of Europe together in a structure that develops their common interests and makes war impossible.'"
"That text circulated throughout the anti-fascist resistance movements during the last years of the war and was one of the main motivations, the main ideals, that helped spread the European message at that time, well ahead of the European movements convention in The Hague."
"Forty years later Spinelli was here helping Parliament to produce its draft Treaty on European Union."
"He was a man with great ambition, but who knew when to compromise."
"He was a man with daring methods but willing to build consensus."
"He also realised that to succeed his project should not be seen just as his own personal project: he was willing to share the credit – the ownership – of the draft Treaty that this Parliament produced."
"He himself never referred to it as the Spinelli draft Treaty."
"He ensured that there were six co-rapporteurs from all the different groups appointed to work with him."
"He knew that this project was a project of Parliament."
"He described himself not as the author but as the midwife who had allowed Parliament to deliver this baby which needed then to be nurtured."
"The baby was important."
"Initially, it only helped produce the Single European Act."
"Many people were not impressed."
"However, if we now look back with a certain sense of perspective, we can see that cumulatively it started a process leading to four successive IGCs, the Single Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice and now the Constitution coming up."
"Incrementally it has transformed the European Community of 1984 into the quite different European Union that we have today, a Union with a wider scope of responsibility, with at least partially more effective institutions and with greater democratic accountability."
"Step by step, Spinelli's achievement can now be seen in perspective."
"However, the lesson for us within Parliament is that Spinelli's method was one of trying to build up consensus."
"He said: 'This Parliament brings together representatives of all of Europe's main political parties."
"We must use that to thrash out a consensus here and the message can then be taken back home to convince our parties and our governments in our countries and create a political momentum that will be irresistible.'"
"He was successful in building up a consensus."
"This was a time, let us not forget, of great euroscepticism – the buzzword in those days was eurosclerosis – and when governments were telling us not to change the Treaties as it would only lead to a step backwards."
"The President of the Council, Leo Tindemans, and the President of the Commission, Gaston Thorn, came to the Committee on Institutional Affairs, as it was then, to ask us not to do it."
"Yet Parliament persevered and built up this consensus which reopened the Treaties – a taboo subject for many years."
"Nobody wanted to change the Treaties: the Tindemans report avoided proposing Treaty changes and the Three Wise Men report in 1979 advised against changing the Treaties."
"Parliament had the courage to say that the Treaties must be reopened and our basic constitutional texts must be re-examined."
"Spinelli patiently built up a compromise that was supported in the end by 88% of Parliament when it was adopted."
"Every single political group at that time had a majority supporting it."
"Even 79% of the British Conservatives supported the Spinelli draft Treaty – they then sat in a different political group."
"Now they have joined the EPP-ED Group."
"I cannot say they have become more European – perhaps Mr Poettering should work on them a little more."
"That is one group that seems to have gone backwards."
"Nonetheless, at that time Spinelli was able to build up a remarkable consensus, and it worked."
"By thrashing out a project here in this House – which represents the full spectrum of public opinion in Europe – a compromise acceptable to such a wide majority, we were able to set in motion a process which has taken us to where we are today and where the draft Constitution will be the crowning glory of Spinelli's efforts."
"We must ensure that Constitution is adopted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 17 years as a Member of this European Parliament, I am standing here today, on behalf of the Liberal Group, to deliver what is probably my last speech in a plenary debate."
"I am proud, and at the same time thankful, to be here today in a historic place at a historic time."
"This is a historic place because the European Parliament is at the heart of democracy in Europe and the only European institution to be elected directly by 450 million European citizens."
"Very soon, on 13 June, the peoples of 25 European countries will collectively choose their MEPs at the same time."
"Today, Europe is one, reunited in a voluntary, peaceful and sustainable manner on a footing of equality, parity and solidarity."
"Eurosceptics say that we are investing in a dream."
"That may be so, but what is wrong with that?"
"At least, and that is important, we are, to a great extent, managing to realise our dreams and unifying Europe."
"Today, we are specifically commemorating Jean Monnet, the first thinker, or can I say the first dreamer, of a unified Europe, the architect of the Schuman plan, and the initial founder of the present European Union."
"With Jean Monnet in mind, we can dream to our heart's content."
"We can cherish dreams, as long as we know how to translate them into action."
"Although our great European dream is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress."
"In addition to Jean Monnet, I should also like to pay tribute to all those thousands of others who have helped pave the way and, not least, to the European citizens themselves."
"The step we are taking on this journey today should also give renewed impetus to the European integration process, because the lack of a truly political European Union will be even more tangible from today."
"If the European Union is to play a real role of any significance in the world, it should stop appearing to be a purely economic alliance and grow into political adulthood."
"Today is about more than just the European Union's enlargement; it is about a mutation, a reunification of Europe and of all Europeans."
"Indeed, today, we are taking a historic step – a step from division to unity, from threatened conflict to guaranteed peace and stability, a step from socio-economic inequality to sustainable growth and prosperity for all our European citizens."
"Congratulations to all in this House, because we have not missed this historic opportunity of a European Union."
"Consequently, it is with confidence that I am passing on the torch to the many new, young, enthusiastic Europeans in the unique assembly that this European Parliament is. I should like to say to these young Members, and to all MEPs: the future of Europe is in your hands."
"Fare well, Europe."
"Remain a beacon of peace and quiet in the stormy sea that our world, alas, has all too often become."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is for me both a great joy and a great honour, here today, to honour the memory of the great European Jean Monnet and to recall that it was the Italian anti-fascist and democratic Communist Altiero Spinelli who was behind the 14 February 1984 draft treaty founding the European Union, and the precursor of the draft constitution drafted by the European Convention, and which, as is well known, the European Parliament of the time approved by a remarkably large majority."
"At that time, Altiero Spinelli made it expressly clear that it was above all the European Parliament that, being legitimised as a European institution by the direct suffrage of the citizens, had the vocation of pressing on with European integration and developing it further."
"This message of Spinelli’s may well sound like a bequest, but I see it as still being valid today, and so, in the future too, it should guide this House’s actions as 25 States join in hammering out the co-existence of 450 million people in the European Union, and do so on a basis of solidarity, democratically and socially."
"I am convinced that it is only thus that the unification of Europe, having been officially consummated on 1 May, can really succeed and have a future."
"Altiero Spinelli was elected to the European Parliament in 1979, having stood as a candidate for the Italian Communist Party."
"He sat as a member of what was at the time the Communist Group, which consisted almost exclusively of representatives of the Italian and French Communist Parties."
"From July 1982, as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, he was in charge of drawing up the draft Treaty."
"Regarding myself as belonging very much to Spinelli’s tradition, I am sure you will not mind if I focus my recollections today on him as a man and as a politician."
"My main reason for doing so is that Altiero Spinelli’s definitive abandonment of Stalinism occurred as early as 1937, and that he later unswervingly championed European unification with idealism, passion, energy and occasional visions in advance of his own time, whether as an advisor to De Gasperi, to Jean Monnet, to the Italian foreign minister Pietro Nenni, as a visiting professor and political scientist, as a member of the Commission or of Parliament."
"His critics and opponents accused him of an occasional tendency to dream dreams and lose touch with reality, which, it has to be said, meant that he made not only friends in the ranks of his own group."
"For me, Altiero Spinelli personifies the most recent aspects of our European heritage."
"He learned from bitter experience that nationalism, fascism and war must be consigned to the past; that was what motivated his so passionate dedication to a united Europe."
"For fighting against fascism, Altiero Spinelli endured many years in Mussolini’s jails."
"That made it only logical that Spinelli should be among the prime movers behind the draft European manifesto at the European resistance conferences in Geneva in 1944."
"Even before the end of the war, Spinelli returned to Northern Italy and participated in the armed resistance."
"After the war, he was alongside such people as Henri Frenay, the leader of the French resistance movement , and Eugen Kogon, a German who survived Buchenwald, as a co-founder of the European movement."
"For Altiero Spinelli, then, it was from the struggle against fascism that he acquired a sense of responsibility for Europe’s development as a peaceful and free democracy, and, right up to his death on 23 May 1986, he treasured his freedom, which had been bought at a great price, and maintained his firm faith in a peaceful and united Europe."
"It is this anti-fascist heritage of which I believe we should always be mindful, and which, above all, should always guide our actions."
"– Mr President, a few months ago, at the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels, it became clear that the Union might fail and that we might revert to the hallowed national egotisms."
"Everyone shrank back from the consequences of such disintegration, got cold feet and set about looking for ways of getting the good ship Europe afloat again."
"Mr President, you really ought to interrupt me and ask why I am talking nonsense."
"This sentence is 20 years old; Spinelli used it in his speech to this House when presenting his draft."
"I confess that I am shocked by how up-to-date this speech is."
"As if he were discussing the Convention, he compares the two methods – the drafting of a constitution by a parliament as against the diplomats and ministers at an Intergovernmental Conference."
"He tells us that we now know the outcomes of these two differing approaches."
"As the negotiations progressed, the national outlook irresistibly gained the upper hand, the European outlook has steadily faded away, and we end up with the proposal that, in effect, action by states should be emphasised to the detriment of action at a supranational level."
"As you can see, I am sharing my speaking time with Spinelli."
"There is no better way of expressing what has happened over the past few months, in Ecofin, in Brussels, in Naples: the old struggle for a European democracy as opposed to the Europe of the State chanceries, bureaucracies, governments and their claims to absolute power."
"Spinelli appeals to this House in these words: ‘In taking this initiative, we derive our legitimacy from our status as the citizens’ and the community’s elected representatives, as those who bear the actual responsibility for the European democracy that is coming into being.’"
"I have found it very exciting to follow the argument in this speech, for he is trying to persuade this House not to send the draft to the Council or to the Intergovernmental Conference, but to be ratified by the national parliaments."
"He, too, was only a matter of months away from an election, and he was speaking in a February, the same month as the decisive moment in the constitution-making process, and I regret the fact that Parliament has not found it in itself to adopt this Convention draft and submit it to the national Parliaments for ratification."
"He goes on to say how ashamed he is of a parliament that will in future be powerless to act decisively in giving Europe a constitution, how he shrinks back from setting foot in it."
"He also has something fundamental to say about unanimity and the constitution: ‘If we were to allow ourselves misgivings about the possibility of starting before everyone has acceded, we would be leaving the decision in the hands, not of those who are most determined, but of those who are the most hesitant, and, indeed, potential opponents, and would thereby be condemning the whole enterprise to virtually certain failure.’"
"Twenty years ago, Altiero Spinelli called on Parliament to tell the people what was at stake, that being European democracy and the development of political unity."
"I will close with some words from Jean Monnet, words that I would urge all governments and ministers to bear constantly in mind, the most up-to-date words that can possibly be said in today’s constitution-making process: ‘We are not coordinating states; we are bringing people together!’"
"Mr President, I believe that both Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli would be very proud of the events of 1 May."
"Jean Monnet, a much respected founding father of the European Union, campaigned for the establishment of the European Economic Community because it would be a means to ensure that the continent of Europe would be at peace with itself, as opposed to engaging in war."
"The artificial divide which has existed in Europe since the end of World War II has now come to an end and the peoples of east and west Europe have now come together freely as a community of 25 countries, working together with the common interests of promoting economic prosperity, democracy and the rule of law."
"The vision of the founding fathers of Europe has been further realised as a direct consequence of the accession of ten new countries into the Union."
"As a Community of 25 members, the Union is now in a much stronger position than ever to promote policies on the international stage with vigour and determination."
"Also it is now 20 years since Altiero Spinelli drafted his report, which recommended that a constitutional Treaty be agreed for the European Union and one of the key elements of his report back in 1984 was to give a stronger role to the European Parliament."
"Many of Altiero Spinelli's recommendations have been included in the Treaties which have been enacted over the last 18 years."
"The European Parliament now has the power of codecision with governments of Europe in over 50 fields of legislative activity."
"But we must be careful and remember that an extensive amount of work remains to be completed before a European Union Constitutional Treaty is agreed."
"Intensive negotiations will continue under the Irish presidency between now and 17 June, with a view to finalising the provisions of this new Treaty."
"It is then incumbent on those of us who support this Treaty, which will streamline how the EU does its business, to get out and positively promote its provisions to the people of Europe."
"If agreement is reached for a new European Treaty then we will have to focus on the campaign to ratify the terms of this new Treaty across the 25 different Member States of the Union."
"We must not underestimate the magnitude of this task."
"We must be determined to win this battle so that we will have a Treaty which will govern the European Union for the next 25 years."
"Mr President, today we are remembering Monnet and Spinelli."
"I have read Monnet’s memoirs with great pleasure, but nowhere found references there in support of the undemocratic, super-centralised EU state heralded by the Constitution."
"Monnet spoke, for example, of a small, practical Commission and not of an uncontrolled democratic monster with fraud and misappropriation amounting to perhaps DKK 60 billion per year."
"I sat beside Spinelli in the Committee on Budgets during my first ten years in Parliament and came to have great respect for his consistent, federalist thinking."
"It was he and the founder of , Emanuelle Gasso, who taught me that federalism is not centralism but the idea of democracy at a level higher than that of the national state."
"Federalism is a sensible form of government in the United States, Canada, Switzerland and Germany."
"It is also a splendid dream for Europe, but it is a dream that could turn into a nightmare if there were no community of people that felt at home in a federal state."
"The turn-out at elections to the European Parliament has fallen from 63% to 49% over five elections and will scarcely be more than 40% in June."
"Eighty-seven per cent of voters took part in the last Danish election."
"I am not an anti-federalist but a realist."
"If we make a comparison with the United States, we now have 450 million native Europeans who would have to be removed before a new, common European people could emerge."
"If there were 87% participation in the elections to the European Parliament and 49% participation in national elections, the federalists would take over from those of us who are working for a Europe of the nations and for a Europe of democracies and diversities."
"Why not make a deal between federalists and realists, whereby you federalists accept a Europe governed from the national parliaments until such time as participation in elections to the European Parliament exceeds participation in national elections?"
"In return, we should accept the federalist model, or retire, on the day that participation in European Parliament elections makes the national elections less representative of the voters."
"Might we also agree to have the EU Constitution put to the vote in all the EU countries on the same day. In that way, we should obtain the first common European debate on our common future, and we should be able to see whether federalism could defeat our mission to bring about a Europe of democracies."
"Let us have a fair fight about the future of Europe."
"Until then, I prefer the Danish to the EU Constitution."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President—in—Office of the Council, the Europe of Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli was not in Europe."
"In Europe the peoples and the institutions were united: nazi Berlin, fascist Rome, Vichy Paris, and Spain and Portugal: they were united."
"That Europe of Nations was not the Europe of the Ventotene Manifesto; it was just the Europe of the Holocaust The people of Europe were united in just one instance during Europe’s history: as the Jewish population of the whole of Europe, as different, homosexual or roma people, as the people of the Holocaust."
"This is what Europe was."
"And the cheerful Europe, the Europe of festivals, executions and of things I do not even want to continue to mention ..."
"Europe then was in prison or had been murdered."
"Our Europe was with Thomas Mann, with Albert Einstein, perhaps with Marlene Dietrich; it was with Don Luigi Sturzo, with Gaetano Salvemini, with Enrico Fermi."
"Europe was outside Europe, and we lay claim to those roots only if we visualise a Europe founded on European reform and not on the counter-reform of Franz von Papen and Cardinal Pacelli; the Europe of the White Rose, the Europe of, precisely, reform, and not of the deception of communism, fascism, nationalism and Roman talibanism."
"We need to say it clearly, Mr President!"
"You are about to celebrate something which has nothing to do with Spinelli’s idea; tomorrow you will approve a Europe of Nations that lies between social democracy and Gaullism."
"Spinelli envisaged Europe in the Council, along the lines of the United States Senate, not in the actual project but in terms of the idea."
"Until we reach that type of United States federalism and federalism of the United States of Europe, I think that we will find ourselves in a situation similar to the Paris of the Popular Front, based on red flags and trenches, which betrayed Spanish legality, making the Pyrenees a place of death for Madrid, while fascists and nazis were arriving in Spain to kill."
"So I prefer to remember Salvador de Madariaga and many others: this is Altiero’s Europe."
"I would like to make an appeal, Mr President: ensure that the Ventotene Manifesto is published together with the draft which we are discussing, not just in all our European languages but also in Arabic and Chinese, because today there is a great need there for that dream, that history and those role models."
"Mr President, I very much regret that this will be my last speech to this Parliament, having been here for the past 25 years."
"I have to retire owing to health reasons, but I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues in this Parliament, and of course to the Commission and the Council, for the outstanding support that they gave to peace in Northern Ireland."
"The special programme for peace and reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland have done outstanding work in giving great hope to our young people."
"I also owe a lot to this Parliament and to Strasbourg in terms of my own thinking."
"I always tell the story of the first time I came here in 1979."
"I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg in France to Kehl in Germany and I stopped and meditated."
"I thought then that if I had stood there 30 years ago at the end of the Second World War – the worst half century in the history of the world in which 50 million human beings were slaughtered – and had said to myself 'don't worry, it's all over, they will all be united very soon', I would have been sent to a psychiatrist."
"But it happened, and it is something that in my opinion the European Union does not devote enough attention to."
"The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution."
"For that reason, the principles at the heart of it should be sent to every area of conflict."
"I know what I am talking about in saying that, because the three principles at the heart of the European Union are exactly the same as the three principles at the heart of our special agreement in Northern Ireland."
"Principle number one is respect for difference."
"All conflict is about difference, whether it is a matter of race, religion or nationality."
"The answer to difference is to respect it, because it is an accident of birth."
"Principle number two is institutions that respect differences."
"All Member States are represented in the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"The third and most important principle is what I call the healing process."
"The countries involved worked together in their common interests – for economic development, for example – spilling their sweat and not their blood."
"As they did that, they eroded the divisions of centuries and as a result the new Europe has evolved and is still evolving."
"Those same three principles are at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland."
"Both identities fully respect principle number one, respect for difference."
"As regards principle number two, institutions, a proportional assembly and a proportional government will involve all sections of society."
"When they are in place, the third principle will come into play: working together in common interests, spilling sweat and not blood."
"The barriers of the past in Ireland will be eroded and a new Ireland will evolve."
"The world is a much smaller place now that we are living through the biggest revolution in the history of the world in terms of technology, telecommunications and transport."
"We are therefore in a stronger position to shape that world, particularly in this very historic week – who could have dreamt that the whole of Europe would be together?"
"Given that it is a smaller world and that we are in a stronger position to shape it, the European Union should decide that our first objective in this new century is a world in which there is no longer any war or conflict."
"In order to ensure that is the case – and I am making this appeal to the Council of Ministers – the European Union should put in place a Commissioner, backed by a Commission department for peace and reconciliation, whose function would be to send to every area of conflict in the world not arms or soldiers, but the philosophy of European Union."
"This Commissioner's role would be to promote the dialogue about that philosophy and to help create a world in which there is no longer any war or any conflict."
"I believe that is now possible."
"Finally, once again I express my deepest gratitude to you all for the great support that you give to peace on my own streets."
"Thank you very much indeed and I regret very much that I am leaving this great Parliament."
"I thank you, Mr Hume, and all the contributors to this commemorative debate."
"That concludes the debate."
"The next item is the general debate on the future of the enlarged European Union."
"The general debate begins with Council and Commission statements – Towards a European Constitution."
". Mr President, I would also like to pay a warm tribute to Mr Hume on what was a remarkable valedictory speech."
"I am very pleased to be invited to speak to you today in this general debate on the future of the enlarged European Union – Towards a European Constitution."
"Today's debate is taking place as representatives of all the Member States and of the Parliament are meeting in Dublin."
"The task that has been set for them is to resolve the outstanding non-institutional issues in the debate on the Constitutional Treaty."
"As a member of the European Convention, I am very conscious of the hard work and the deep commitment of the representatives of the European Parliament to the Convention process."
"While we may not have been entirely in agreement on each and every issue, I valued our shared commitment to producing a Constitutional Treaty that will serve this Union well and that will commend itself to the citizens of Europe."
"While negotiations on the draft Treaty are yet to be concluded, we can take some satisfaction from what has been achieved."
"I should like to underline that at this point in our discussions we have moved much further, in a much more positive way, than anyone would have believed possible in the dark days of December and the early days of January."
"The draft that came out of the Convention provided the Intergovernmental Conference with a truly excellent framework on which to build a Constitutional Treaty that will stand the test of time."
"The draft is presented in language which is more accessible than any previous Treaty."
"The draft makes it clear who does what in the Union."
"It elaborates the doctrine of subsidiarity, it clarifies the scope of the European Union's powers, it enhances democratic accountability and simplifies the range of legal instruments through which the Union acts."
"It seeks to provide the Union of 25 and more Member States with institutions that are workable and capable of meeting the needs of our citizens and of our Union into the future."
"It enshrines for the first time a Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Union's constitutional order."
"It equips our Union to act with greater cohesion internally and to project and promote our shared values on the world stage, the very values of which Mr Hume spoke so movingly a few moments ago."
"This is a formidable document that should commend itself to the people of Europe."
"When I listen to critics and sceptics I am at a loss to understand what they are talking about."
"As I said on the BBC last weekend, I earnestly hope that the critics and sceptics – including those in this House – will take just a little time to consider this draft document and what it contains, and to take on board its very many merits."
"I want to express my thanks to Parliament for its strong support of our efforts to conclude the IGC under the Irish presidency."
"I can reassure you, Mr President, and the Members of this Parliament again today that we are doing everything in our power to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"The very positive reaction to the Taoiseach's report to the Spring Council and the confirmation that the political will existed to reach agreement by the June European Council is a very encouraging sign of the commitment of partners to finding a final agreement."
"While we must not underestimate the challenge that lies ahead, we can say with some confidence that we are closer to agreement than we have ever been."
"We are seeking to make as much progress as possible during May, so as to leave only a very small number of issues for final decision by the Heads of State or Government at the June European Council."
"In this context, the Taoiseach called on partners take a 'positive and focused approach' to the negotiations and to avoid bringing issues not previously identified to the negotiating table."
"In response to President Cox's point earlier, foreign ministers will meet for detailed discussions on 17 and 18 May."
"It is our ambition and intention to resolve as many outstanding issues as possible at that meeting."
"At the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, Minister Cowen made it clear that if, in his view, further work is required, the foreign ministers will meet on 24 May and if necessary again after that."
"We will also continue to meet partners bilaterally, at both political and official level."
"The Taoiseach in particular will be using his pre-European Council tour of capitals, which started this week, to tease out Member States' concerns, to assuage those concerns, to answer any outstanding fears and to bring matters to resolution."
"I do not propose to go into too much detail on the outstanding issues."
"You are all aware of them: the definition and scope of QMV, the composition of the Commission, and a number of other issues of varying degrees of complexity and sensitivity."
"However, irrespective of how complex the issues are or how sensitive they are, if there is a political will, a way will be found to resolve those conflicts and sensitive issues."
"Touching on a number of key issues, we have made clear our view that only a voting system based on a double majority can command a consensus."
"However, while keeping the need for efficiency, we must also pay due regard to the needs for balance among the Member States and to their specific concerns."
"It should be possible to reach an outcome which meets the concerns of all, perhaps through some adjustment of the population and the Member State thresholds."
"As regards the scope of QMV, there is a general desire, shared I know by Parliament, for its extension with a view to promoting efficient decision-making in a larger Union."
"At the same time, there is also a need to take account of the particular concerns of Member States."
"I believe that a satisfactory overall outcome, which will involve a further growth in the number of areas subject to QMV and to codecision, will be found."
"We all agree that the Commission must be effective."
"We also fully appreciate the concerns of Member States regarding the composition of the Commission."
"Mr Hume spoke about the institutional framework and its extraordinarily subtle formula."
"I feel that the two perspectives – the concerns about an efficient Commission and the concerns about the composition of the Commission – could possibly be reconciled through maintaining, for an extended period, a Commission comprising one national from each Member State, moving thereafter to a reduced size on the basis of strict equal rotation."
"I know that a great many of you hope that it will be possible to conclude the Constitutional Treaty before the European Parliament elections, and indeed, privately, that would be my hope and desire too."
"As presidency, we would like to be in a position to do so, but at this stage it is more realistic to suggest that the final negotiations will conclude in the June European Council."
"We should recognise that the vast bulk of the Convention's work has remained unchanged and will not be changed."
"We should remember that we have agreed a clear set of values and principles to which we can all subscribe and which go to the very heart of what the European Union is and what the European Union is hoping to achieve."
"These are not in question in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is worth reiterating what we have achieved: we have made tremendous progress in simplifying decision-making, in making clear who is responsible for taking decisions, in making clear to citizens that these decisions will be taken at the appropriate level."
"We have further enhanced the role of the European Parliament and strengthened, as a result, the democratic scrutiny of the Union."
"These principles are not in question in the IGC."
"We should also remember the very substantial progress on the outstanding non-institutional issues made by the Italian presidency, to which I pay tribute."
"The proposals which we have tabled for discussion at today's focal point meeting owe a great deal to the work of this presidency's predecessors."
"This new Constitution will be good for the European Union, it will be good for the Member States, and, most importantly of all, it will be good for the citizens of Europe."
"Of that I am absolutely convinced."
"As presidency, we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure a successful outcome to the negotiations."
"Following on from the momentous achievement of the enlargement which has just taken place, the successful conclusion of negotiations on the Constitutional Treaty is the next logical step in our Union's advancement."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were all, I am sure, moved and encouraged by the expressions of joy that greeted the arrival of ten new Member States in the European Union on 1 May."
"There is ample justification for such displays of enthusiasm."
"Indeed, enlargement represents the future: the future of Europe’s history, a future of peace and prosperity, solidarity and union, on a continental scale."
"It also represents the future of the European project, within the framework of which we must work together and the benefits of which we must constantly, on a daily basis, explain to our citizens, in order that we can earn their support."
"Enlargement also represents a unique opportunity, which we must take with both hands, to reform our policies and to restructure the European institutions in order to develop the appropriate instruments to enable tomorrow’s EU to focus not only on the requirements – both internal and external – of efficiency, transparency and simplicity, but also on the specific concerns of the citizens and on anything that may make a difference to their daily lives."
"It is worth recalling the reasons why the Laeken European Council opted to establish the Convention on the future of Europe: the growing distance between the public and the European institutions, the need to rethink the European project and the institutions in the context of enlargement and the need to take stock of Europe’s role in an increasingly globalised world."
"Mr President, it is worth recalling the challenges that the Laeken Council issued to the Convention: the challenge of setting out clearly the division of competence between the Union and the Member States, so as to explain more clearly to the public who does what in the European Union; the challenge of simplifying the Union’s texts, instruments and decision-making procedures; the challenge of bringing added value to the European institutions and decision-making processes, in terms of democracy, transparency and efficiency; and even, perhaps, the challenge of fulfilling the dream of adopting a European Constitution."
"Faced with these challenges, the Convention made a clear choice – an extremely clear choice, in fact!"
"We chose the constitutional path."
"We decided to place the public at the heart of the European project, hence the complete incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitutional Treaty."
"Today we are closer than ever before, as Mr Roche has just said, to adopting a genuine European Constitution."
"Our desire to see this ambitious project succeed is an accurate reflection of our evaluation of the Convention’s work."
"The Commission feels that the draft Constitution has met the aims of simplicity, efficiency and democracy."
"This is not, of course, a perfect document."
"A few refinements, confined to the Convention’s draft Constitution, are, in our view, desirable, provided that these do not upset the overall balance of the text."
"We must improve our ability to act, within the framework of decision-making that from now on encompasses the Twenty-Five, by means of a more general extension to qualified majority voting."
"The decision-making process must be made more transparent."
"We are staunch advocates of double majority in Council voting."
"I understand Mr Roche’s argument."
"Ways must be found of ensuring that everyone is part of the double majority system."
"Care must be taken, however, not to introduce any element into the double majority system that may cause confusion, as this would divest it of its major advantages from the public’s point of view, namely, efficiency and clarity."
"Let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater!"
"We must also be in a position to respond to future developments that are already underway, by making the procedure of revising the Treaties more flexible, at least as regards the EU’s policies."
"Part III is, in fact, out of step with the modernisation of all the other elements of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Moreover, it is not sufficiently adaptable to the new aims of the Union as regards the Lisbon Agenda and sustainable development."
"What is needed is a flexible review of Part III."
"It is ultimately crucial that we ensure that all Member States receive equal treatment, by, , establishing a Commission made up of one voting Commissioner per Member State, which requires an internal Commission structure that complies with the principle of collegiality."
"This solution for the Commission must stand until such time as the new Member States are completely integrated."
"Where necessary, alternative solutions must be sought."
"Mr President, I must express my support for the Irish Presidency’s determination to conclude negotiations on the future Constitution, preferably before elections to Parliament or, at least, immediately after that landmark event."
"We – and on this I feel that I am expressing the opinion of the Commission, Parliament and the presidency – are all equally determined to see the European Constitution come to fruition during the first half of this year, thereby giving tangible form to the progress made in the Convention."
"I should also like to thank Parliament on behalf of the Commission for its significant contribution in drawing up the Constitution, and, in particular, the efforts made by all of Parliament’s representatives in the Convention and its Praesidium."
"I should like to single out, if I may, Mr Hänsch, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Duff."
"Similarly instrumental were Parliament’s determination, during negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), that the progress made at the Convention would not be undone, and the regular, comprehensive consultations, conducted under Mr Napolitano’s competent and constructive leadership in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Against this backdrop, the Commission shares Parliament’s determination – and, I feel, that of the vast majority of national delegations – that the consensus that emerged from the Convention on almost every point discussed should not be jeopardised during this final period of negotiations at the IGC."
"To take steps backwards, in areas such as the balance between Parliament and the Council on financial and budgetary issues, would be completely unthinkable from the point of view of the principle of European democracy."
"Nevertheless, I should like to point out that the process of making a constitutional Europe requires effort on the part of both the new Parliament and the next Commission."
"In view of the ratification procedures in all current and new Member States – especially if referendums are to be held, as would appear to be the case – it is crucial that public debate on the European Constitution should take place."
"We must avoid falling into the trap of simply juxtaposing twenty-five national debates; what we need is a real European debate."
"Lastly, Mr President, although Milan Kundera wrote that the only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past, I, personally, want to master the future because I see it as a future of peace, prosperity and solidarity, founded upon a European Constitution that is able, democratically and effectively, to meet the expectations and needs of 450 million citizens."
"What we are doing is mastering the past in order to forge a common future."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hume has just spoken very movingly."
"Having been a Member of this House since 1979, he will be leaving Parliament, as will my Irish friend Mr McCartin."
"At a time like now, when we are thinking about the future, that should prompt us to briefly review the past, as we have just done in commemorating Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli."
"Looking back over the past in this way enables us to have confidence and hope that we really can be optimistic in looking forward to our continent’s future."
"There was one in 1973, when the Europe of the Six was joined by Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom, thus becoming a Europe of Nine; then, in 1981, came Greece; Spain and Portugal joined in 1986, with three more countries –Finland, Sweden and Austria – acceding in 1995."
"Finally, we now have a Community of 25."
"Hand in hand with this, the Community has always gained in depth, with the EEC and Euratom being created in 1957, the Single European Act in 1986, and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, in connection with which we must recall the great achievements of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President François Mitterrand and Commission President Jacques Delors, whose work was successfully continued by Jacques Santer."
"We then had Amsterdam in 1995, followed by Nice, which may well not have been that much of a success, but it was there that we adopted the resolution that we would conclude accession negotiations with the candidate countries in time for the European elections."
"If we were to sum up all the changes that have taken place over these years, we would have to come to the conclusion that this is a great continent, one that has always, even when faced with great difficulties, gone forward in the right direction."
"It is now a matter of our great good fortune that Ireland holds the Presidency – Mr Roche, their Minister for Europe and our President-in-Office of the Council, is with us today – and is conducting its affairs with a combination of vision, pragmatism and goodwill, the latter quite crucial if there is to be any progress."
"Let me thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for the work you have done to date."
"If we deserve a European Constitution, it is because of your efforts and Europe’s."
"I would also like to express gratitude to Commissioner Vitorino, who, jointly with his fellow-Commissioner Mr Barnier presided over the work done by our colleagues in the Convention."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would welcome it if the Irish presidency were yet to succeed in getting a reference made in the preamble to our Judaeo-Christian heritage."
"It is because this embodies our values that we regard it as important, but it is also important that you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, should not agree to any curtailment of Parliament’s budgetary prerogatives."
"Commissioner Vitorino also made reference to that."
"Such a thing must not be permitted."
"It is one of the prerogatives of the European Parliament, and indeed of any other, to be able to determine what is done with the Budget, and we will not be able accept any curtailment of our rights in that respect."
"The European Constitution is a great step forward, in that it strengthens Europe as a Community."
"It represents progress in that it strengthens European democracy and parliamentary government."
"The European Constitution is a step forward in that subsidiarity is reinforced, and in that it makes reference, for the first time, to local governance."
"Municipalities, cities, communities, that is to say the places we call home, are given the right to manage their own affairs."
"The national parliaments are also given the right to appeal in the event of their rights under the subsidiarity principle being infringed."
"Europe is becoming more efficient, Europe is becoming more democratic, and what we want to achieve is unity for this Europe of ours in all its diversity."
"The Constitution is a means to that end."
"When considering the future, we have to answer the question as to who can yet become a member of the European Union."
"With whom do we want to co-exist as good neighbours?"
"We want to co-exist as good neighbours with everyone, especially with our Arab and Muslim neighbours, so that our continent may be a continent of peace, founded upon law and with a constitution of its own."
"We wish the Irish Presidency every success in achieving that for us."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to begin by joining in the deserved tributes to Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli, two visionaries, two anti-fascists and two courageous people."
"I would also like to point out that Jean Monnet very often quoted the Swiss philosopher Amiel, saying the following: ‘Each man’s experience starts again from the beginning."
"Only institutions grow wiser: they accumulate collective experience; and, owing to this experience and this wisdom, men subject to the same rules will not see their own nature changing, but their behaviour gradually transformed’."
"And that is what we are doing here, in Parliament, and what we also want to do with the European Constitution."
"My esteemed friend, Mr Méndez de Vigo, told us that he carried the ‘Spinelli Treaty’ in his briefcase when he was working in the Convention."
"I can tell him that, when we were preparing the Maastricht Treaty, I had the opportunity to speak with Paco Ordóñez, who was Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister, and he told me that he carried the ‘Spinelli Treaty’ in his briefcase and I carried it as well, and I would recommend to Minister Roche that he carries the ‘Spinelli Treaty’ in his briefcase when he has to find some imaginative solution."
"I would also like to add that much is said about solidarity, about the step-by-step policy and so on, but we must remember one thing, and that is that the declaration of 9 May 1950 begins by talking about peace – as our friend John Hume has done today."
"Peace was the issue, not just creating a common market for steel and coal."
"Having said this, Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to express our complete support for the declaration of the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Constitution."
"I believe that this is the time to support this declaration in circumstances such as that mentioned by the minister."
"I would reiterate our support for the draft Constitution, in the form it left the Convention."
"We are aware that there are certain specific points to deal with, not with regard to values – we are very happy with this democratic and secular Europe for everybody – but we do believe there are certain issues still to be dealt with."
"One of them – and I say this coming from the country which, with an entirely mistaken vision, under the previous government, blocked the constitutional debate – is qualified majority voting within the Council."
"We have always been clearly in favour of this system."
"I would like Minister Roche to explain to this House how many times the Ioannina Compromise has been applied in the past, because there may well be proposals which take that route, which would not be the best ones."
"I would also like to add another important element, which appears in the draft approved in Thessaloniki but which then disappears from sight: there must be a legislative Council, because laws must be created in public and transparently, and there must also be a shared legislative power, not only to create laws, but also to approve budgets."
"Finally, Mr President – and I address this to the President of Parliament – there is a specific request from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which is of very great importance, and that is that the President of Parliament, and our representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference, should be able to participate fully in the debates of that conference."
"And also that during this period, given that the European Parliament remains constituted, that this House can be informed by the most appropriate means."
"There is nothing to prevent this and it is important from the point of view of the timetable proposed to us by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I believe that this is an extremely important element and that in Parliament we are naturally going to be campaigning."
"And a noble element of this campaign is that we contribute to making progress on the Constitution."
"A final point which relates to the debate we will hold tomorrow: Mr President-in-office of the Council, we must make progress not just on the composition of the Commission, but also on the simultaneous mandate to that of Parliament."
"We are now in a very complicated situation."
"A new President-in-Office of the Council is going to be proposed."
"There is an excessively long period in a transitional and temporary situation and that is not good either for the Commission or for the European Union."
"Mr President, it has been a great privilege to serve in a Parliament that has made such great progress in delivering for Europe the constitutional settlement that it needs."
"Parliament has become now an assured player in the constitutive process and we have assisted Europe to answer definitively the old question about whether the Union could widen and deepen at the same time."
"The answer is certainly 'yes'."
"We expect the European Council now to show the political will to bring the IGC to a quick and successful conclusion and to draft the durable, efficient and effective system of democratic government that we need to strengthen the Union and its place in world affairs."
"However, it is vital that Parliament, which has played such a crucial part in the IGC so far, does not fade at the final phase."
"President Cox and our representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch, must carry on playing a full part in the negotiations and resist any weakening of Parliament's powers of codecision and assent."
"There are some worrying signs in this respect and Commissioner Vitorino is quite right to warn us."
"Why, for example, is the Irish presidency suddenly seeking in its latest proposals to remove Parliament's power of codecision with respect to the Structural Funds?"
"Perhaps Minister Roche could explain."
"If the Council wishes to encumber itself with unanimity upon financial questions, that is its own problem, but it cannot be permitted to evade parliamentary accountability."
"I wish to support the committee's request that, should there be a crisis at the IGC, the President should call a special meeting of the Conference of Presidents."
"Despite our dispersal across 25 electoral campaigns, we would be able to reassemble quickly to reinforce the President's negotiating position."
"Please remember that a negative assessment by Parliament on the final conclusions of the IGC would certainly scupper referendum campaigns wherever they spring up."
"Mr President, on 3 September last year, in this very House and to the cheers of those present, Mr Giscard d'Estaing presented us with the draft Constitution."
"A large majority of my group, for its part – convinced that, now more than ever, we need a Europe that can offer hope that the world can change, and irrespective of what we might think of one aspect or another of the text – refused to sign up to what was termed the ‘constitutionalisation of the liberal world’."
"Ultimately, we were unanimous in calling for a referendum, to be preceded by a major public and genuinely pluralist debate in each country."
"Eight months on, we are no less convinced of the rightness of our position; in fact we have, I think, been strengthened in it by the way in which the debate on the European Left has unfolded, by the experiences of several EU countries and, lastly, despite its wishes, by the work of the Commission itself."
"Developments in the European left’s debate on this issue have been most interesting."
"Indeed, in the weeks and months following the publication of the text of the Convention, we have found our position increasingly in line with that of the main spokespeople of the European Social Forum and of alter-globalisation movements."
"Furthermore, prominent Members of other groups of this House, or their political family, have taken on some of our arguments, even our wording, for which I am most grateful, albeit juxtaposing certain ideas that I would consider contradictory. This is nothing, however, that a calm public debate could not put right."
"Equally significant is experience during this entire period in different EU countries."
"Fierce social struggles have taken place against liberal reforms that are all rooted in the European policies of our respective governments."
"This is precisely why, the very day after the resounding electoral defeat suffered by the Right in France, the Commission moved to head off any risk of a shift in French politics by issuing an ultimatum that, and I quote, ‘France must pursue its reforms’."
"Lastly, the Commission itself has just drawn up a progress report on the Lisbon Agenda, which, four years ago, expressed the ambition of social improvement through liberalism."
"What exactly does this analysis say?"
"For the first time in ten years, as the document sets out in detail, we have shed two hundred thousand more jobs than we have created in the eurozone, whereas the declared objective had been to achieve full employment by 2010."
"We even learn, from this same document, that more than one 15-year old European in six, to quote the Commission ‘does not have the basic skills in reading writing and arithmetic’. This offers some idea of the depth of the crisis in the liberal model, which had aimed to lead us in less than six years to the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"On all of these points, most Members of my group are not expecting miracles from the European Council, which – by complete chance, of course – comes a few days after the European elections."
"In forcefully reiterating our demands for a referendum, preceded by a genuine debate that would allow the public to be in possession of the facts, we feel that, straightaway, a clear and unequivocal vote this June will be the best signal to give to the architects of the future Treaty."
"Mr President, on a personal note, if I may, I should like to conclude – given that this is to be my last speech of this legislative term – that, if my constituents so wish, I will continue to lead the fight, with my friends, in this very House, for an alternative Europe."
"Otherwise, we will do so elsewhere, come what may."
"See you soon!"
"Mr Roche, there is a fundamental difference between work on the Constitution in the Convention and work during the Intergovernmental Conference which, I am afraid, can only have a clear, negative impact on the result."
"Everything or almost everything regarding the Convention was visible, including its crises and other moments."
"It was the outcome of complicated work which gave us a barely adequate compromise."
"On the contrary, your work remains secret, and we have to rely on moles in order to find out what is happening, given that unfortunately, our representatives too and their officials love playing the diplomat and therefore do not inform us, as they should, of what is really taking place at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I do not like in the slightest what is really going on, and my group likes it even less."
"A show of optimism, which feeds a kind of reassuring syrup to the media and public opinion, in my view in reality hides a further possible victory for those governments, old and new, who cheerily thumb their noses at the European interest."
"It seems that this view is also held by the Commission which, behind much ceremony and diplomacy, has revealed to us here a line which is going in a completely different direction to the one which we are about to agree to in Dublin."
"Today if we read the text which your officials are working on, Mr Roche, it is clear that this is an exercise for which Altiero Spinelli would have retold the story of ‘The Old Man and the Sea’ who, returning to the shore with his large fish, as you will remember, finds it has been devoured by sharks."
"Mr Roche said that he does not want to go into detail."
"That is a shame."
"If he did, everyone would be able to see the price we are about to pay, including to Mr Blair and his referendum: firstly, maintaining unanimity for justice and home affairs, so we can kiss goodbye to the fight against terrorism, where today there will probably be an interesting instalment on the question of assigning European citizens’ rights to the United States with respect to the agreement on passengers; secondly, reinforcing the interpretative clause of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, tabled by the United Kingdom in Thessaloniki, which makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its cogency practically useless; and that is not to mention the removal of the European Parliament’s power of assent for structural funds decisions or the opportunity for parliaments to veto each amendment."
"Today, therefore, we find ourselves in a radically different situation to that of yesterday: yesterday was the day the dream came true; naturally I would not want us today to have to start picking up the pieces of a dream already shattered."
"Our first duty now is to let the citizens know that the terms on which the Presidency has chosen to negotiate are the same terms which Parliament rejected in December; our second duty is to initiate a serious debate about what the consequences of a ‘no’ in a referendum should be, which in my view should be crystal clear: anyone who says ‘no’ in a referendum on the Constitution – as Spinelli said – is putting itself outside Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour today to appear for the first time before this forum of representatives of 450 million citizens of a united Europe speaking my mother tongue, Slovak."
"For years and years, I have hoped and believed that Slovakia would, as a sovereign State, one day become a full member of the European Union."
"An essential prerequisite for the continued effective operation of the EU following its historic enlargement involves adapting its institutional framework to meet the new circumstances."
"The first test awaiting us, therefore, and what a test it is, is the approval of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Adopting the Constitutional Treaty is, however, impossible unless citizens of the Member States can identify with such an important document."
"Let us not divide Europe into old and new, let us not categorise States as small and large, rich and poor."
"If we want Europe to be really unified, we must listen to every nation, every citizen."
"Let us give an opportunity to these citizens and Member States to create their own attitudes to Europe in line with their own traditions, respecting the principle of sovereignty in cultural and ethical matters."
"I am deeply convinced that the purpose of EU reform is to create not a superstate but a supranational body, whose legitimacy is derived from the primary legitimacy of the Member States."
"The Constitutional Treaty must guarantee a model of effective coexistence, the fundamental pillars for which are tolerance and mutual trust."
"May I remind you of the rights of the small States."
"For them, the question of financial mechanisms, together with an effective regional policy, is particularly vital."
"As regards the future shape of the European Commission, I am of the opinion that every Member State must have its own full Commissioner with precisely defined powers."
"Europe must be built on the principle of equality among the Member States of the Union."
"The accession of ten new States to the EU does not mean that the process of integration is finished."
"Nor will adopting the Constitutional Treaty bring reform of the Union to an end and, therefore, it is not possible at this stage to resolve all the questions relating to the operation of the European Union."
"It is important that this process should aim to meet our common objectives."
"Mr President, allow me sincerely to wish our Irish friends and indeed all of us a successful resolution of these matters, matters which have been discussed with such passion, and to hope that fundamental progress is made at the summit in June, culminating perhaps in the adoption of the Treaty by consensus among all the national delegations."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the voters in twenty-five countries, some 300 million in number, will go to the polls, between 10 and 13 June depending on the country, without knowing the answers to the two key questions facing us: ‘What kind of Constitution is Europe to have?’ and ‘What are Europe’s borders to be?’"
"What characterises the European Union, to my mind, is its contempt for the sovereign voice of nations and citizens: a federal Constitution, which is hidden, only to be unveiled three days later; three days after the elections!"
"Are you trying to have us believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that, after almost two years of the Convention, and the Intergovernmental Conference, you were not ready to present this Constitution to the citizens before they voted?"
"In all honesty, as you said just now, we can see right through this ..."
"As for Turkey’s accession, which would give the European Union – let us be clear about this – a border with Iraq, the decision, which is already known, will also be taken, in a few months’ time behind the citizens’ backs."
"Mr President, many people had high hopes for your Presidency, the Irish Presidency."
"In truth, you will have put another brick in an ever-thicker wall, which is no longer dividing Europe in two, but is separating the Europe above – that of the institutions – from the Europe below, that is to say, the people."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to make the same suggestion to you as I did last time – I think it was the Prime Minister who was there: why not bring the June Summit forward by a week, just one week?"
"That way, you will show the public that the European Union is not afraid of its own shadow."
"Mr President, it is a great joy for us today to meet one of the key objectives of the original Community, as we welcome into our Union the Eastern European countries freed from the Communist yoke."
"Europe is turning a new page in its history, a page full of promise, and yet it will have to revolutionise the way in which it thinks and operates."
"We have yet to make all the necessary changes in this respect."
"On the day in which Europe is enlarged to 25, we are still living with institutions that were built on a unitary model retaining something of the old bloc-based Europe, in the way that it seeks power by supranational hierarchy and seeks to abolish national sovereignties."
"The draft European Constitution under negotiation is a perfect example of this thinking, and is, consequently, ill-suited to the management of a Europe enlarged to include twenty-five, thirty, or more Members."
"What we must do – and I hope that the EU will discover this soon, perhaps, indeed, with the help of the new Member States – is to revive the legitimacy of national democracies, and arrange for their experience to be shared and their example to be followed, in the grand European tradition of pluralism, within flexible institutions built on the foundations of free nations."
"Mr President, from 1 May we can celebrate one of the greatest achievements of the post-war era."
"Few imagined 20 years ago that the borders of the European Union would extend to the Baltic States and Poland."
"Then we faced a hostile Soviet Union that held Central and Eastern Europe in its iron grip."
"The Cold War was evident, the nuclear stand-off only too real and many European peoples were under the yoke of one-party socialist dictatorships."
"This is a time for thanksgiving that we are able to sit alongside democratically elected representatives of those previously suppressed peoples."
"Liberal democracy has triumphed."
"We also rejoice that these nations are members of the NATO alliance, the most successful defence organisation the world has ever seen."
"Warfare between the nations of Europe is unthinkable."
"We have secured a great prize and we must build on it."
"This week my party marks the 25th anniversary of the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, whose government I was privileged to join."
"We should recall today the major contribution she has made to the cause of freedom on this continent."
"She did perhaps more than any western political statesman of our age in confronting the Communists and bringing about the collapse of the Iron Curtain."
"As one who served on the Convention, I know there will be many debates on the future of this continent in the coming years, including through future treaties."
"My party has a clear vision of a Europe of nation states."
"The new Member States now join these debates."
"The peoples of Europe want peace, freedom and security."
"We must secure these goals and we do so in a spirit of openness and mutual respect."
"However, Europe should meet the aspirations of its people in partnership with the United States."
"With enlargement the Atlanticist cause will be strengthened."
"In the economic sphere, the new Member States bring vitality and experience of the need for economic reform."
"We must all become more competitive and abandon the economic ways of the past."
"Whatever our views on the kind of Europe we want to see, this week we can celebrate the reuniting of the nations of Europe."
"It is a cause that my party has long championed and we say unreservedly to those who join us here today: you are most welcome."
"– Mr President, today, again, almost everything has been said about the timetable for consideration of the Constitution and of its contents."
"We welcome the Irish Presidency’s adroitness and its determination to bring about a resolution on the Constitution by the end of June."
"I agree entirely with Commissioner Vitorino in the demands he has made and the warnings he has given, and can testify that he played an outstanding part in the Convention’s Praesidium, for which he has earned Parliament’s gratitude."
"What do we need the Constitution for?"
"Only with the Constitution will Europe be equal to its global responsibilities."
"Without a Constitution, the states of Europe will remain pawns in other powers’ games; only with it will they themselves become players."
"The Constitution alone will make the European Union stronger, more effective and more democratic, rather than merely larger."
"Without the Constitution, the EU will progressively degenerate into a customs union."
"The Constitution alone will enable the EU to become, again, attractive to the public, for Europe will become more comprehensible and more responsible."
"Without the Constitution, people will lose what is left of their confidence in the future viability of European integration."
"If it were to fail, it would mean more than just the end of a great hope."
"Its failure would mean reversion to a Europe of plots and rancour; it would be the beginning of the end for European unity."
"Centres of gravity, avant-gardes, and multiple speeds – none of these are alternatives; none of them can be a substitute for a constitution."
"A Union of axes and alliances, of so-called strategic partnerships is not what we need."
"We must not turn this Europe of ours into a patchwork Union, confusing the citizens at home and discrediting Europe in the eyes of those around us."
"One of the key words in the Constitution is ‘balance’."
"That was, and remains, a key to peace and stability in Europe."
"The states of the old Europe spent centuries in repeated attempts to establish this balance."
"On the field of diplomacy, they used axes and alliances, and, on the field of battle, blood and iron."
"The Constitution for the new Europe of the twenty-first century establishes balance by means of the equal participation of all states and the weighting of each of them within shared institutions in a way they can regard as fair."
"The Constitution for the new Europe replaces the old Europe’s balance of powers by the balance of institutions and by balancing the legitimacy of states and citizens."
"A new world order is coming into being, not in ten years’ time, but today."
"If we Europeans do not prepare ourselves now, we will be opting out of world history – first in political terms, and then, inevitably, economically as well."
"The union of Europeans on the basis of this Constitution is our response to globalisation."
"History affords no precedent for what we will be doing."
"It will demand political courage and a firm faith in the future of our old continent."
"Legally speaking, the Constitution is a Treaty, and replaces the treaties on European Union currently in force, but it does – like every democratic constitution in the world – govern the ways in which power is legitimated and the ways in which it is limited."
"Politically speaking, the Constitution makes the enlarged European Union more solid, more effective, more responsible, more manageable and more comprehensible, enabling its people to become more familiar with it and to trust it more."
"Historically speaking, though, the Constitution amounts to nothing less than the re-founding of the European Union, of a Union that is an example to those within it and those outside it, a Union of peace, freedom, and justice."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are no doubt all still going around in a state of euphoria following the historic weekend celebration of European unification."
"It feels like a real privilege to be able to stand here in the House together with fellow MEPs from 24 other countries."
"The EU will never be the same again."
"An ordinary day will, however, dawn following this celebration, an ordinary day in the life of the European Union, characterised by negotiations, discussions and compromises."
"This method is in every respect superior to all others when it comes to making progress in European cooperation, but it also has shortcomings, and it will not always be easy to unite when there are so many different countries, desires, cultures, backgrounds and expectations."
"People are also making a lot of demands of us and subjecting us to pressure, and there are expectations that the EU will operate properly and deliver."
"We therefore need a book of rules. We need a Constitution."
"We have today honoured the memory of Altiero Spinelli who, more than anyone else, fought for a Constitution."
"There is no better way of honouring his memory than by ensuring that the citizens of Europe are given a European Constitution."
"The new countries that have now become our colleagues have made huge efforts on their journey here."
"Unfortunately, the old EU has not to anything like the same extent displayed a willingness to change."
"We face huge challenges."
"We have the environmental threats, including the greenhouse effect, as well as the fight against organised crime, including terrorism, and the horrific trafficking in women and children."
"We must create a continent characterised by growth and economic development."
"We must create a common European foreign policy, and we must become more active in global work for peace, democracy and free trade."
"These issues cannot be resolved in an effective and satisfactory way by using the Treaty of Nice."
"Here in Parliament, we have done our homework."
"We put our weight behind setting up a Convention."
"We actively contributed our views."
"Now it is time for the Council to show that it too has done its homework."
"We must show the people of 25 countries – 450 million people – that the new EU has risen to its new status."
"We must show that we are able and willing to change in order to tackle the problems we face and fully realise the potential of our united Europe."
"I therefore wish to thank the Irish Presidency for the huge amount of work it is doing and wish it every good fortune so that we might all get to see a European Constitution brought about at the forthcoming June summit."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to what Mr Roche told us earlier, namely that the Irish Presidency of the Council is drawing, in its proposals, on those made by its Italian predecessor."
"Basically, Mr Roche, the only thing is that the public has no idea whatever about what negotiations are currently going on and what the present position is with regard to the draft Constitution."
"At the same time, the text produced by the Convention is still under massive attack, even though it is due to be adopted at the end of the Irish Presidency, which is only a matter of a few weeks away."
"I therefore, as a former member of the Convention, have this appeal to make to the Council and to the Irish who preside over it."
"For a start, no concession must be made, under any circumstances whatever, to the renewed pressure from the European Central Bank for the objective in Part I to be revised. The Convention has stated that the ECB should, in future, promote a balance between sustainable growth, employment and price stability, and that should be the end of the matter."
"Secondly, Part III of the draft Constitution must – as this House has emphatically demanded – be adapted, in a politically and legally binding way, to the fundamental provisions of Part I, in order to secure the social dimension of the European Union."
"To put it another way, the expression ‘open market economy’ must be replaced by ‘social market economy’ if we are to avoid opening the door wide to unbridled capitalism."
"Thirdly, let me contradict Mr Poettering by saying that the preamble to the Constitution is no place for mention of God."
"The people who live in the EU must not be divided into believers and unbelievers."
"Reference to God is not, moreover, a suitable bargaining counter for getting the Poles, for example, to agree to dual majority in the Council of Ministers, nor must it be used in an attempt to nullify the idea of Turkey’s accession to the EU."
"We do indeed need a referendum on the Constitution, and, in the Convention, I have already argued the case for one."
"It is the EU’s citizens who must have the last word, for it is their future that is at stake."
"I urge that there should be an EU-wide referendum on the Constitution on the same day in all the Member States; the date I would suggest is 8 May 2005."
"Being the 60th anniversary of liberation from Fascism and the eve of the Day of Europe, it would be a suitable day on which to vote."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a moment ago, our President reminded us of Jean Monnet and his words:‘We are not united states, we are united people’."
"Yesterday, we welcomed ten new countries, and ten new flags of ten new Member States are now outside."
"Today, I should like to call your attention to the flags of the regions and nations that were not fortunate enough to become a state."
"The course of history has decided that at present, some big countries are being accompanied ..."
"Mrs Maes, please take the flags down, you have made your point."
"The Rules are very clear on this, so please respect them."
"Mr President, we will take down the flags, pending their recognition by the European Union."
"It is a fact that six Member States are smaller than the regions whose flags are on display today."
"What we mean by this is that we welcome the new Member States, but at the same time, we want to call on the Council and Commission to recognise that the reality of languages and cultures, the diversity of peoples in Europe, cannot simply be reduced to states."
"We know, and realise all too well, that we are one big family, but in our new Constitution, we must share sovereignty at supranational level, so that with Europe, we can play a role in the world that is worthy of these 450 million citizens."
"At the same time, we must urge our Member States to recognise that within some Member States there are differences that are not sufficiently recognised."
"In principle, this is already the case in the new Constitution."
"The principles are laid down, but the rest is down to our Member States."
"We would like our Member States to realise that they have to recognise the diversity of peoples within themselves, so that these constitutional regions are not required to become states – which over the course of history, they have missed the opportunity of doing."
"Although we collectively want to share sovereignty at supranational level, we also want the principle of subsidiarity to be applied from the top down, and languages and cultures to be protected."
"Catalan, for example, is a language that is spoken by 10 million inhabitants."
"We are reluctant to accept that such a language can be recognised at European level only if Spain wishes it to be so."
"Is it not sufficient that that is what ten million citizens aspire to?"
"Thank you for your attention and I hope that in the new Constitution, due consideration will be given to this deeper reality, which is older than our Member States."
"– The gallery does not participate in the sitting. Therefore, quiet please."
"Mr President, yesterday, when the flags of the new Member States of the European Union were raised here in Strasbourg, Poland was celebrating the anniversary of the adoption of the first written constitution in Europe, and the second in the world, namely the 1791 Polish constitution."
"Its purpose was to make Poland a fair and efficient country."
"The Constitutional Treaty of the European Union is supposed to be the crowning achievement of the great project of European integration, for which we in Poland waited almost 50 years."
"However, the draft submitted by the European Convention does not bode well either for the future of the European Union as a whole, or for Poland and other Member States of the European Union."
"Our Community needs a different constitution, a constitution that does not lead to excessive centralisation and regulation."
"If we want to develop quickly, if we want to compete successfully in the globalising economy, the Union must not regulate every area of the economy."
"All regulation has a negative impact on competitiveness and hinders development."
"Also, the new constitution must not take precedence over the constitutions of the Member States of the European Union."
"This would amount to surrendering national sovereignty."
"The Union, as it is to be defined by the Constitutional Treaty, must be based on the principle of solidarity, a principle underpinning our Community and upon which, over many years, a new post-war order was built in Western Europe."
"The concept of solidarity has a special significance in my country, Poland."
"It was in the name of solidarity that we Poles, fought for freedom."
"Europe cannot cut itself off from its Christian roots."
"If it does so, it will be in danger of dying a lingering death."
"This would mean the death of our civilisation, which would have proved incapable of coping with a number of threats that have recently appeared in the world."
"I have referred to a constitution enabling Europe to become a strong, competitive partner in international relationships based on fundamental principles."
"The European Constitution should unite the peoples and nations of the European Union."
"The European Union should remain a strong association of nation States bound together by solidarity."
"The strength and legitimacy of the Union is derived from the mandate and will to cooperate of sovereign countries."
"Mr President, as a dedicated opponent of the whole EU process, I have to admit that on the face of it you are having a good week."
"It has been a triumph for euronationalism and that is exactly what it is: a form of nationalism that never takes 'no' for an answer."
"I find the language that is used fascinating."
"I keep hearing people talking about the 're-unification' of Europe and I wonder to which particular model they are referring."
"I wonder, do these ten new members really know what they have let themselves in for?"
"I can fully understand their reasons for joining NATO, where governments cooperate together, but the EU that they joined last weekend is about to become a different EU in just six weeks' time, because with the Constitution comes a new legal order."
"I very much hope that the governments of those ten Member States give their citizens a chance to vote again in referenda, because they will be voting on something quite different from what they have been sold at the moment."
"Certainly the Czechs and the Hungarians will well remember Brezhnev's doctrine of limited sovereignty."
"What they are doing is now entering a similar system – they just call it pooled sovereignty."
"Frankly, this Constitution must be unacceptable to any democrat, because the terms of Article 59, the terms of withdrawal, are totally unacceptable."
"People are very soon going to learn that in this place nothing is what it seems."
"Cooperation means coercion."
"Competence means power, and the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is paving the way for an appalling form of centrist EU control."
"I can only say that, in my view, the gap that exists between the political classes of Europe and the ordinary men and women of Europe has never been wider. More is the pity."
"Mr President, I would like Poland’s voice to be heard in this parliamentary debate on the subject of the Treaty creating a constitution for Europe."
"After all, on 3 May 1791 Poland became the first country in Europe to adopt a democratic constitution."
"Yesterday we celebrated the 213th anniversary of this great event."
"The May Constitution expressed the democratic and sovereign aspirations of the people."
"It is, however, firmly based on Christian values, which united the States and peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, and which became enshrined in the May Constitution."
"Unfortunately, the wording of the current draft of the Constitution of the European Union does not refer at all to the Christian roots that are an essential value of the foundations of Europe."
"Further it raises concerns about the preservation of the sovereignty of Member States."
"Within the framework of the European Union, the road to integration and unity through such a constitution would be even longer and more difficult."
"Integration and unity cannot be achieved through the creation of a new centralised state."
"The countries of the former Communist bloc have only recently freed themselves from the fetters of a centralised State with a Communist ideology."
"They would not like to find themselves in some sort of new centralised organisation all over again."
"Within the framework of the current configuration of Europe, Member States and nations must have a guarantee for the preservation of their sovereignty."
"They also need a sense of their cultural identity, community of faith and tradition."
"Polish Solidarity would not have existed without a Polish Pope whose own faith and example shows how to build a new Europe through a civilisation based on love."
"This new order would make it possible to overcome the difficulties, conflicts, and confusion of languages that led to dissent amongst the builders of the biblical Tower of Babel and their eventual dispersal."
"The key principles of the civilisation based on love have been proclaimed by Christianity from time immemorial."
"They have been advocated in a particularly charismatic manner by Pope John Paul II."
"It was thanks to these principles that it proved possible first to break the fetters of Communist totalitarianism, starting in Poland."
"Thanks to them too, it was subsequently possible to establish a new democratic system in Europe."
"They will also make it possible now to overcome fear, prejudice, and hatred."
"They will make it possible for people to understand each other and build an economic and political democracy in a Europe that will be safe from the dangers of world economic globalism."
"Europe and the peoples that make it up have their own democratic tradition."
"They will find the strength to reinforce and disseminate it, as well as to defend it, should the need arise."
"May God help the European Parliament in the building of such unity."
"In Old Polish, I wish it Godspeed."
"I must apologise for making such a long speech, but this is my last appearance in this House, as I will not be a candidate in the European elections."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the inaugural address, today work begins for those of us who are new Members in the European Parliament."
"We Hungarians have been living at the heart of Europe for thousands of years, and over the centuries we have often had to fight to protect Europe’s freedom and faith."
"If our fight for freedom in 1956 had not been crushed by the Soviet tanks and the Hungarian servants of the dictatorship, then representatives of our country would have been sitting there in Rome, amongst the founders of today’s Union."
"Then we Hungarians too would have taken part in the construction work based on security, freedom and wellbeing that we want to strengthen and renew now with the Constitutional Agreement."
"Today’s great enterprise of the reunited Europe, the Constitution, can only be successful and long-lasting if it is based on firm foundations."
"What are these foundations?"
"Firstly: the equal rights of the States that form the Union."
"We Hungarians have often enough been in a subordinate position, deprived of our rights, and that is why we are particularly sensitive to any violation of equality of rights."
"What is needed today is not a two-speed Europe, but the rapid and complete removal of the remaining discriminations."
"Secondly: lasting union can only be based on strong self-identity."
"Reference to Christian roots would be the acknowledgement of the spiritual source of our freedom and pluralism today."
"Without Christianity, Europe would only have a brain, but its heart would be missing."
"The Christian humanist tradition will keep us together and it will not segregate us."
"The culture of love born from Christianity is manifested in Beethoven’s Ode to Joy as well."
"During the years of the twentieth century when Europe was torn apart, behind the Iron Curtain, faith and the church represented for us the institutional bond to the idea of Europe."
"Thirdly: Europe must be a union of unions, a system whereby the unions strengthen and build on each other."
"For us Hungarians, because of Trianon, the injustice of the Treaty of Trianon, it is increasingly important to have the rights of minorities represented in the principles of the Constitution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not forget; we have a responsibility to our forefathers and our children alike to fight against the bloody dictatorships of the twentieth century."
"When we are preparing the reunited, revitalised European Constitution, please bear in mind the words of the Hungarian poet, Attila József: ‘Our job is to finally sort out our mutual business, and it is not a small job.’"
"Mr President, every country and every international organisation needs a constitution."
"A constitution defines the structure of the organisation or country and the rights of its citizens."
"When the European Union was smaller it was able to operate on the basis of successively amended treaties."
"By contrast, a Union made up of 25 States, and in the future of 27 or more, must have a clear institutional system and a distinct division of powers."
"It must function efficiently, and, above all, it must be closer to the citizen."
"For this reason the decision taken at Laeken to convene a European Convention to draft a constitution was right and necessary."
"I took part in the proceedings of the Convention and can vouch for the high quality of the work it accomplished."
"I appreciate the excellent quality of the work undertaken by the European Parliament and successive presidencies, and must thank them for it."
"The draft constitution proposed by the European Council has certainly proved an excellent basis for further discussion."
"In certain places, however, it gives rise to doubts, emotions and debate."
"In order to answer the question as to how good the constitution has to be, we must reflect on the kind of constitution Europe wants."
"First: Europe and its people want a constitution ensuring security and freedom from the use of force and terrorism."
"This is the type of Europe that is wanted."
"It is therefore important to consider whether a paragraph regarding the sources of terrorism should be introduced into the constitution."
"Should the anti-terrorism coordinator not be linked to the Commission and his powers clearly defined?"
"We want a just Europe that cares for the individual."
"This is why we should develop the third part of the constitution further."
"As it stands, it pays far too little attention to social policy."
"We want a well-managed Europe."
"Consequently, there has to be a balance between the powers of the Member States and those of the Union."
"An institutional balance is required. This is why the powers of the European Parliament in the area of the Union’s finances and budget must not be restricted."
"After all, Parliament is the only democratically elected body in the Union."
"We want a Europe that does not discriminate against anyone, a Europe capable of building an open society."
"How then could it have been possible not to provide for a ban on discrimination on the grounds of disability, when drafting the anti-discrimination clause?"
"It should be recalled that there the European Union has 50 million citizens with disabilities."
"Above all, however, we are aiming at a democratic and united Union, a Union in which all states and citizens are equal."
"Consequently, the decision-making process in the Council of the European Union should be based on a spirit of compromise that takes into account the interests of all States, large and small."
"An accommodation is called for."
"All the Union’s power must not be vested in just a small number of its Member States."
"The willingness to accept this compromise will be a measure and determinant of European democracy."
"The constitution is almost ready and will have to serve future generations."
"Taking into account also that the people have endorsed it by means of a referendum or in parliament, it will be only right that, in the spirit of compromise, we adopt it quickly."
"This will make for deeper integration."
"Mr President, I have one minute so I will not refer to the Green position on the Constitution, but will make the point that the final text of the Constitution must also address the question of Euratom."
"I wish to tell the presidency that we cannot enter the 21st century with a Treaty that dates from the end of the 1950s."
"That Treaty completely ignores the views of this House and also creates a large distortion in the internal energy market, which we created recently, because it provides billions of euros for research and cheap loans and ensures dependence on the nuclear industry."
"If you are not persuaded by my arguments, think of the power of the voters and citizens in Austria, Germany and Spain, in all the countries which no longer consider nuclear energy as a centrepiece of the solutions for tomorrow."
"– Mr President, a constitution is something like an organisation plan for a society, and we urgently need one."
"I regret to say, though, that the text we have is not worthy of the name."
"There is no separation of powers, no direct involvement by the citizens, and, as Mr Turmes quite rightly said, there are important elements that we have not dealt with."
"We do, however, need a constitution, and we need it as a matter of urgency, as it has to be clear that the West must make itself ready for the East, which has now moved into this House."
"The situation we are in – a very difficult one – is to some degree comparable to that of someone who has a very fine plan with which to build a house."
"We have Europe the peace project, social and liberal, but not the foundations that will provide a truly stable basis on which it can work."
"As a European who is responsible to the taxpayer, I cannot but be very worried about the future of this project."
"We are now obliged to rebuild the European Union from the ground up, with a proper constitution, which must then, in order to enjoy the necessary acceptance, be submitted to the popular vote in every single country."
"Transparency will also be needed, for there is no democracy without it."
"The way in which this constitution has been brought into being, and the secretive way in which further negotiations on it are being conducted, does not augur well for the future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are on the subject of freedom of speech, let me say just one thing, which is that this has been an open process, one in which every detail of the Convention was public, for everyone to read, examine, discuss and add their own contributions."
"The process involved everyone who was entitled to participate, ranging from the national parliaments to the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"That is something that Mr Martin should not denigrate, even if it does not fit into his present programme and that of the !"
"I would like, with your permission, to make a few comments."
"The first is that we have completed the project of the century, the reunification of the whole of Europe."
"Over the past few days, we have heard a lot of fine speeches about that."
"I hope that these will prove to be more than lofty sentiments, and that we will instead put them into practice."
"What that means is that we have to enable the enlarged Europe to function and confer legitimacy upon it, and that is why the Constitution is so important."
"If you are in favour of reunification, then you have to be in favour of this Constitution, for it is democratic and is founded upon values to be found in the preamble and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights – values that I regard as being, to a large extent, of Christian origin."
"The European Union has to be able to function."
"A larger Union is of no use if its decision-making structures do not make it effective."
"Having listened to all the lofty sentiments that have been expressed, we have to acknowledge that no longer can any of us, in the present world, defend our interests on our own – that, after all, is why Europe is united."
"No longer can anyone defend interests that are exclusively national."
"The fact is that it is better that we should put our national interests on the back burner when we have a common denominator, for it is this common denominator that will enable us to develop the strength to defend our national interests as well."
"Now it is only through Europe that national interests can be defended, and if this is made apparent in practical action and in the way this constitution develops, then we really will make progress."
"I would just like to express my gratitude to the Irish Presidency of the Council for its astute leadership, even though we will have to discuss those details in the final document where we in this House cannot agree to what is proposed."
"I do hope, though, that we will nevertheless be able to achieve a good result."
"Mr President, the details of the European Constitution are extremely important."
"For that reason it is important that the IGC does not take any step backwards."
"Our citizens want more Europe."
"They cannot understand why Europe is not more present in the United Nations."
"They cannot understand why we impose on ourselves international impotence in the face of the conflicts that surround us in the world at large."
"They want a Europe that is based on human values, based firmly on universal rights."
"If I might just address those who are calling for Christianity in the Constitution, could I suggest that if God existed she might ask the men who run the churches and the synagogues and the mosques to respect all human rights, and in particular respect the rights of the women they exclude from their ceremonies and from their theologies!"
"Could I suggest that it is important that we do not reduce the Constitution to its detail, that we do not damn it with faint praise by suggesting that it is just a tidying up exercise, because the spirit of the Constitution is greater than the sum of its parts."
"We must appeal to the better instincts of our peoples, to bear in mind that what we are trying to create is a Europe based on human values."
"We are trying to demonstrate that it is possible at a global level to achieve the dream of democratic global governance."
"Many people have quoted Irish poets over the past few days in the big speeches that have been made, Seamus Heaney in particular, and his line that hope chimes with history."
"Could I remind the IGC of another Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, who warned the founders of the Irish state to tread softly as they tread on our dreams."
"The Constitution is a dream that we need to have put into practice."
"I urge the IGC not to step back from it."
"The Polish socialist, Mrs Grabowska, who spoke earlier, said something very interesting, to the effect that every State needed a constitution."
"The trouble is, however, that the European Union is not, strictly speaking, a State."
"The European Union does not, therefore, need a constitution because, contrary to what Mrs Grabowska says, an international organisation does not need a constitution."
"This is precisely why the League of Nations referred to its founding treaty as ‘the pact’, why the United Nations calls its treaty ‘the Charter’ and why every international organisation has a founding treaty."
"Whilst the Constitution that you are proposing is being presented, in essence, as a codification of the Treaties, the very fact that it is referred to as the Constitution is ample proof of the direction in which you want to go: you want to move towards establishing a super-State, which will dominate the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural life of all Europeans, down to the last detail, regardless of the decisions taken by freely elected governments."
"What you are creating is a new Soviet Union, and that is exactly what we do not want."
"Mr President, it is a great honour and privilege for me to be one of the first Polish Members to address the House after the Union’s enlargement."
"This is an historic occasion, and I am particularly pleased to be speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the largest group in the European Parliament, and a group that has made a major contribution to the enlargement of Europe."
"The enlarged European Union is generating great hopes, not only among the old Member States, but also among the new countries joining the European Union."
"This is particularly true in the case of my own country, Poland."
"The Polish people have painful experience of the dark era of communism and nationalism."
"They know how much hard work had to be done in order to join the European Union."
"We had to make up for the several decades during which we had fallen behind because we were on the other side."
"Today we are discussing the future of Europe."
"We hope to endorse and adopt the European Constitution."
"This is needed in order for us to be able to manage Europe efficiently and for us to take decisions efficiently."
"For this step to have real significance, it must be adopted through compromise, with the consent of all the nations making up the European Union."
"It is also essential to remember our roots, the basis on which European civilisation was built."
"A Europe that forgets its roots cannot have a future."
"Some of the views expressed in the course of this debate have caused concern."
"There seems to be an attempt to create a two-speed Europe and to forge deeper alliances within the framework of the European Union."
"We cannot go along with this."
"There has been an attempt to establish false standards of what being European means."
"These are not good omens."
"They reinforce the political strength of the Euro-sceptics which is most certainly not our intention."
"The European venture is not yet complete."
"New states are waiting at our doors."
"Soon Bulgaria and Romania will join."
"It is also important to keep in mind Ukraine and our neighbours in the Balkans."
"Much remains to be done."
"I hope wise decisions will be taken to strengthen Europe as a whole and each nation individually."
"I am sure we all aspire to a Europe of peace, in which the differences between societies and economies are minimal."
"We long for a Europe in which richer countries will help poorer countries."
"We hope that Europe will stand up to threats such as terrorism."
"We would like Europe to be a strong and efficiently managed international organisation."
"Finally, we want Europe to continue to honour Christian values, human dignity, tradition, and morality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member from a newly acceding country, I urge you to accept the Constitutional Agreement before the European elections. Primarily because this constitutional agreement would establish a model that is equally attractive to the existing and the new Member States alike."
"In fact, by recognising this, a number of countries wanted to hold the European election jointly with the national elections in respect of the constitutional agreement."
"The values and objectives stated in the Constitution will extend and strengthen the foundations of the European social model."
"Equal rights, as a core value, had been placed, for the first time, in this document, alongside freedom, democracy and the principles of a constitutional state."
"The aim to achieve a high level of employment is replaced by the plan to achieve full employment."
"The establishment of peace and security is coupled with the fight against poverty and the protection of human rights."
"On that basis, a vision is outlined of a new Europe with greater welfare and solidarity."
"The inclusion of the charter of fundamental rights will further enrich the European catalogue of human rights."
"We Hungarians are delighted that as a result of our efforts the rights of minorities will be included in the Constitution."
"On the basis of the Constitutional Agreement, the European Union will operate on a more democratic basis and its activities will be more transparent."
"The importance of the European Parliament and the role of national parliaments will further increase."
"Ongoing dialogue with civil organisations, churches and religious institutions will be opened."
"The Constitution will provide an opportunity for direct civil initiatives too."
"The legal foundations and forms of cooperation for the struggle against international organised crime and terrorism will be expanded and strengthened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, people everywhere expect the European Union to make their life easier and better."
"Discussions on institutional reforms often seem quite complex for the citizens."
"These issues cannot make the democratic constitutionalisation process fail."
"I greatly appreciate the effective work of the Irish Presidency, and I trust that with the support of European public opinion and as a result of the efforts of the European Parliament, we shall successfully complete the second phase of the constitutionalisation process."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this speech marks the end of my fifteen years of service in this House, which, I would like to point out, is the legitimate representative of the European citizens and of which I have had the honour of being President."
"I would not be worthy of wearing the Jean Monnet medal or the Schuman medal if I restricted myself simply to taking pleasure in seeing the 25 flags and receiving our fellow Members from the new Member States, nor if I confined myself to expressing my satisfaction with the direction taken."
"We must talk about the future of Europe, and that is what this debate is about."
"I believe that the future of Europe, Mr President, will involve overcoming five challenges: completing enlargement, creating more efficient and democratic European institutions, effectively combating terrorism inside and outside Europe, providing the Union with the financial resources it needs to implement financial policies and, finally, to turn the Union into a factor for peace and development at global level."
"I have talked about completing enlargement, because we have the immense pleasure of having the ten new States and their representatives in this Parliament, but this must not lead us to forget that we have to fulfil our commitments to Bulgaria and Rumania and that we have the moral duty to complete the work of establishing peace that we have carried out in the rest of the Balkans and incorporate those States into our European family."
"Until we have done so we will not be able to say realistically that the iron curtain has been entirely removed and that we have successfully included everybody in the European family."
"Overcoming the second challenge, of providing the Union with efficient institutions, means approving and ratifying the Constitution."
"I expressed my thoughts about that Constitution in the report which this House approved and which I produced together with Professor Tsatsos."
"Today I would just like to add one thing, particularly for those people who allow themselves to be led by internal bickering: it is very important that we can have simple and comprehensible decision making by majorities, but it is essential that this system of majorities, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – and I address this to you in particular – is sufficient to allow balanced decisions to be taken within the Union, without allowing for leaders or groups who wish to lead other groups of States."
"And this is a difficult task which, unquestionably, the Irish Presidency must complete and on which ratification not achieved beforehand will largely depend."
"I have also referred to financial sufficiency."
"This is a principle that Jean Monnet stressed, without which we have a larger Europe but a much emptier one."
"A Europe which will not be able to implement the Community policies that have existed until now."
"That is something the Constitution does not resolve and I very much fear, Mr President, that it will lead to a crisis over the coming years within our Europe, a crisis which I trust will be overcome."
"It will be overcome simply by adhering to a basic principle, the principle of solidarity."
"Solidarity, not fruitless rivalries or ridiculous aspirations to hegemony: that is the message I wanted to leave you with on my departure."
"I will end, Mr President, by thanking all those people who have been in this House during my three terms of office: Members of Parliament, officials and colleagues from the groups and other Members, representatives of the Council and the Commission, and all the authorities with which I have had the opportunity to work."
"Mr President, the future does not belong to those who allow themselves to disappear into the shadows of doubt and danger."
"The future belongs to those who, despite the uncertainties of the present, can see the coming of tomorrow’s dawn."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to acknowledge the work carried out in this House by our fellow Member and fellow-countryman José María Gil-Robles, and his contribution as President of this House during the previous stage, which has made it possible for us to open up the stage we are opening up today: the stage of enlargement and political deepening."
"I would like to express my gratitude to him, particularly because he was the author, together with Mr Tsatsos, of the report by means of which this House supported the draft European Constitution produced by the Convention in which I had the honour of participating."
"That draft European Constitution is intended to enable the Union genuinely to confront not just enlargement, but also the great future challenges that we currently face. To intervene in globalisation in order to enhance it democratically and socially, to contribute to creating a new international order which is fair, democratic and respectful of international law, and, naturally, one which responds to the demands of the citizens."
"We need a stronger, more democratic and more efficient Union which guarantees the consolidation and development of the European social model."
"A secular Europe which respects the values which have defined the co-existence of our citizens, respect for human rights and the multi-party system."
"In other words, the rule of law which is today in place throughout this great Europe."
"Mr President, despite what Mr Rumsfeld suggested, we do not have a new Europe and an old Europe, there is a greater Europe, one which is sitting here today in this Parliament, the Europe of the citizens, the Europe which has broken down its borders, the Europe which has reunified the continent."
"We must ensure that the European Constitution becomes a reality, and in this regard we must demand once again that the Convention’s draft be approved as soon as possible, during the Irish Presidency at least."
"As a Spaniard, I am pleased to see that the arrival of a new government in my country is going to make it possible to break the deadlock in the Intergovernmental Conference and the approval of that Constitution, so that all the Community bodies function properly, also ..."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be here with you speaking Slovene and, with the voting card of a Member of the European Parliament, to be enjoying a time when history is smiling on us."
"It smiled when the Berlin Wall fell, when human dignity was returned to the people of the new democracies, and when we were building an independent and democratic Slovenian State."
"Remembering the victims of totalitarianism in Europe, I am grateful to all those who have contributed to the European democratic movement."
"I am particularly grateful to you, ladies and gentlemen, for all your support and solidarity."
"The success and stability of the European Union will depend on what we do and how we work together."
"I would like us to work together in the spirit of the founders of Europe."
"This session is not our first experience together."
"We already have behind us experiences that will enable us to work together in the future, namely our work in the European Convention, which has led to a good draft of the Constitutional Treaty and has deepened our sense of mutual trust."
"The enlargement of the European Union must also mean a deeper union."
"An enlarged Europe means a larger political Europe, a more transparent and effective institutional order, a greater role for the European Parliament, greater decision-making with a qualified majority, a single Foreign Minister and greater influence on the part of all its citizens, both men and women."
"An enlarged Europe also means increased cooperation, open under the same conditions to all members, and not just open to a club operating at different speeds without a constitutional foundation."
"The European project is not only a matter for professional Europeans."
"We will succeed if the citizens of the European Union experience it as their own."
"The key terms of the Convention have been the values, democracy and equality of the Member States, and not any quantitative talk about large and small."
"We new members do not want to be just additions, we want to be an additional value, the equal co-creators of a united Europe."
"Let us bring together the experiences of the older Member States and the democratic dynamic of the new ones."
"The plan of a truly united Europe will succeed if the European countries, or ‘Euroland’, become the foundation of a country of values, or ‘Valueland’ and if, at the same time, the Union becomes a community."
"The term ‘more Europe’ must mean above all an enhanced Europe in Europe itself."
"The European project must also be completed in a south-easterly direction."
"The sources of conflict there must be replaced with a vision for the future, with reconciliation, the respect of all identities, cooperation and a well thought out economic plan."
"Mr President, like my fellow Member Mr Peterle before me, I would like to express my pleasure that I am able to speak as a representative of the Republic of Slovenia, as a new Member State, in my Slovenian mother tongue."
"On the basis of my experiences of taking part in the Convention and my experiences during my one year stint as an observer in the European Parliament, I am absolutely convinced that it is crucially important that the European Constitution be adopted and implemented as soon as possible."
"The fundamental legitimacy of this exceptional document, which is without equal anywhere in the world, lies in the fact that it was accepted by a consensus in the Convention after lengthy preparations and discussions with the broadest possible participation of the national and European parliaments, governments, the European Commission, the civil service, social partners and others."
"Furthermore, I am firmly convinced that the early adoption and implementation of the European Constitution is a prerequisite for the effective, democratic and transparent functioning of the enlarged European Union."
"It is a prerequisite for the achievement of values and goals and also for the rapid and socially just development of a united Europe."
"The Constitution is vital if everyone's high expectations are to be fulfilled."
"This is particularly true in the new Member States."
"It is also important if the European Union is to play a greater role and if its social market model is to develop sustainably in the global world."
"Finally, with its assurance of balance in the functioning of the institutions of the European Union and particularly the enhanced role of the European Parliament and national parliaments, the European Constitution is an important condition for actually bringing the European Union and its citizens closer together."
"I therefore call upon the governments to demonstrate both courage and responsibility by adopting the final treaty as soon as possible at the Intergovernmental Conference, and, if possible, during the Irish Presidency, which has shown exceptional sensitivity and commitment."
"Mr President, the Europe which is being born at the moment brings to a definitive close the unhappy season of great dictatorships which bloodied our continent during the last century."
"The new Europe is not an enlarged Europe though; instead it is a reunited Europe."
"At last, countries and peoples who have had to endure a communist dictatorship are joining a broad area of peace and freedom."
"I would like to welcome my fellow Members from Eastern European countries."
"But we cannot conceive of a federation of nation-states which lacks a fundamental law governing the relationship between the institutions and the citizens: this is why it is important for us to sign as soon as possible a Constitution based on the principles of freedom, subsidiarity, centrality of people and which promotes a social market economy."
"Nevertheless, Europe cannot renounce its Judaeo-Christian roots: they are the bridge which unites East and West, they are the true element which unites half a billion people; they guarantee the secular nature of the institutions, and at this point we should remember the evangelical precept: ‘render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's'."
"We are calling for a reference to these roots to be included in the preamble to our Constitution, as it is on the flag: indeed, you know that the 12 stars represent the 12 tribes of Israel, crowning Mary’s head."
"Why not follow the example of the text of the Polish Constitution – as often urged by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats during the Convention debate – where there is an explicit reference to the word ‘God’?"
"This is an example which our friends, who from now on will sit in Parliament, can give us, an example which we are sure that the whole of Europe should follow."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish to express my joy at having today been given the right for the first time to speak to this Parliament, the European Parliament, and to refer to an issue on which I have been engaged, the European Constitution."
"I was a member of the drafting Convention and I know that this Constitution is the fruit of agreement between the representatives of states, parliaments and civil society."
"It is not an editorial miracle, as many want and wanted what the Convention produced to be."
"However, it is a text which promotes the cohesion and unity of Europe."
"It promotes the principles and the values of Europe and it also promotes the vision of Jean Monnet and of the person we honoured today, Altiero Spinelli."
"Those who oppose approval of the Constitution are, I think, doing the European question a disservice because, in seeking something better, they are undermining something good."
"This Constitution, as I said, is the product of agreement; it is precisely what the European Union cultivates, a culture of cohesion and compromise."
"Consequently, extremes and approaches based on ethnic criteria are mistaken."
"I call for this Constitution to be adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, so that 2004 can be christened the year of the European Constitution."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have a two-fold historic responsibility; firstly, to give the Union a Constitution, a text that will enable it to function."
"I should like to highlight, if I may, the inherent paradox in reaching agreement on a text after the elections, even though it will have been the main subject of debate."
"If governments had wanted to assert their authority, to put it mildly, they could not have done so any better."
"As we await the summit of 17 and 18 June, all we have, as things stand today, is a virtual Constitution."
"We hope it will not turn out to be a minimalist one, but we will judge it when the time comes."
"Your second historic responsibility is more important: that of setting in train the ratification process."
"If we do not want this Constitution to be stillborn, it must be adopted."
"Accordingly, Mr President, I should like to inform you of a proposal that came out of discussions in the , which I have had the honour of chairing since May 2003."
"Governments must reach an agreement, both on a joint text, and on when it is to be ratified, or, in other words, the day – or rather the period of days, as with the European elections taking place from 10 to 13 June – when the Constitution is to be submitted for ratification in the twenty-five countries, following a joint transnational debate."
"On this subject, I was very taken by the way Commissioner Vitorino put it: we must not simply juxtapose twenty-five national debates."
"I suggest therefore that you set the date for 5 to 8 May 2005."
"We will thus replace the 60th anniversary of the end of World War Two, which affected all of us, with the anniversary of something that we are adopting together."
"On that day, which we could celebrate together as Constitution Day, and which could subsequently become a public holiday in the twenty-five countries of the EU, each country will ratify its constitutional treaty according to its own tradition and legal system, by means of a referendum or through parliamentary channels."
"In France, I would, of course, advocate a referendum."
"Answering the same question together on the same day, and adopting the same fundamental text, will truly make the European people sovereign in matters of common concern."
"Mr President, humbled and honoured at the privilege granted to me as the first MEP from Malta to address this Assembly so soon after enlargement, I believe that the European Constitution should emphasise a union of citizens just as much as a union of sovereign states – a Union based on the value of 'personalism' and not of individualism."
"There is no viable alternative to a Union of nation states, intertwined with a clear recognition of an unmistakable historical fact: Europe's Christian roots, values and heritage."
"Without such heritage we would not have had the works of Dante, Petrarch, Raphael, Michelangelo and others all inspired by a Christian leitmotif, or the labour of love and Christian faith involved in building the cathedrals and churches of our European cities, including Strasbourg."
"'Yes' to European laicism, but 'no' to secularisation."
"I shall continue in Maltese."
"Mr President, I believe in a Europe where it is essential for its legitimacy and credibility to speak categorically with one voice in the international arena."
"We must have a European Constitution where the rule of law is the same for all, a Europe of the power of the law and not of the law of power or one which favours the strongest."
"A Constitution that confirms that every State is equal, even by acknowledging Malta’s right to have six seats in this Parliament."
"Malta must be represented effectively in the same manner as all other States."
"Mr President, we created and moulded Europe."
"Now it is important that everyone feels equally European."
"This must be the crux of the European Constitution and Malta will be working to achieve all this."
"– The debate is closed."
"The general debate on the subject of the future of enlarged Europe will continue at 3.00 p.m. this afternoon."
". – It is appalling that a majority of Members of this House is determined to adopt the so-called European Constitution."
"As we have stated on many occasions, this Constitution is an attempt to extend capitalist integration in the European Union still further, which clearly consolidates the federal nature of the Community’s institutions and the dominant position of the major powers in the decision-making process, including unacceptable primacy over national constitutions."
"The Constitution will also launch the institutional bases of militarisation, by establishing a European Armaments Agency, which is intended ultimately to create a political-military bloc, in conjunction with NATO."
"It is a project to which we are opposed and which we criticise in the strongest terms, also because of the way in which it restricts the ways forward for Europe, by imposing neo-liberalism as the sole solution and by establishing the primacy of competition as the guiding principle."
"We are thus forced to fight to defend derogations relating to public services, whilst they ought to be an absolute priority, a key instrument towards ensuring that human rights are respected and that we establish a Europe based on economic and social cohesion and solidarity."
"We will continue to fight for an alternative Europe that respects the inalienable rights of the people of each Member State to shape their own future, one that respects national constitutions and one that is in keeping with the principle that States are sovereign and have equal rights. We will campaign for a referendum in Portugal before the draft Constitution is ratified."
"On behalf of Parliament, I should like to extend a warm welcome to Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, who has taken her seat in the official gallery here this afternoon."
"I know that Her Royal Highness has an extensive programme of meetings here in Parliament this week; indeed, I have already met with her."
"I hope her visit proves to be an interesting and informative experience.(1)"
"In response to the questions raised yesterday, I am advised by our legal service in very clear terms that all 788 Members of the House are entitled to vote."
". Mr President, the request for urgent procedure cannot be accepted by Parliament as the Council has not forwarded to Parliament a text to which the international agreement makes reference, namely the Commission's draft decision on adequacy, declaring that passengers' data are adequately protected by the US; nor has it received the so-called undertakings by the US administration."
"In other words, we still have no guarantee that European passenger data transferred to the US will not be passed on to third countries."
"This is the first vote of the new enlarged Parliament, the only democratically elected institution that represents 450 million citizens."
"The Council is asking us to vote with closed eyes on a question that relates to our fundamental rights."
"If we accept this request, Parliament cannot be taken seriously."
"In addition, there is a procedural defect in that translation into the new languages is not available."
"I ask you to withdraw this item and also to respect our referral of the matter to the Court of Justice."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the opposite view."
"As you will be aware, the current practice is for airline passengers’ details to be forwarded in order to prevent and combat terrorism, but it all happens without a legal basis, and so it is illegal."
"It is for that reason that we must aim to bring this illegal and unregulated situation to as speedy an end as possible and to combat terrorism effectively."
"You will be aware that it was not least at the insistence of this House that the Commission entered into negotiations, and these have produced a creditable result."
"Much of what we called for has been incorporated in this draft agreement."
"There is room for further work on it, but it does, as a basis for an agreement, enable us in future to transmit, on a legal basis, data needed in the fight against terrorism from the European Union to the USA."
"That is what we should be aiming to do; we can then carry on working on an agreement."
"We will continue to monitor its progress and can always appeal to the ECJ in the event of any agreement being breached, but our aim must be to establish, now and as quickly as possible, a contractual status, a legal basis, that will enable us to take proper action in the interests of our citizens’ safety and in combating terrorism."
"That is why I am in favour of this being put on the agenda as a matter of topical and urgent importance."
"From the Chair, it seems that I am now being presented with a mountain of advice which I do not require!"
"This is the vote, not a debate."
"There are some misunderstandings here."
"Last part-session we voted to refer this matter to the European Court of Justice."
"That has been done."
"No vote today can alter the fact that the matter has been referred to the Court."
"I shall take no more speakers on this."
"You heard a speaker for and a speaker against."
"We shall now vote on whether we accept the request for urgency."
"Permit me to point out that Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, as rapporteur, correctly observed that not all language versions were available, particularly as regards the languages of several of the new Member States."
"As a parliament, We anticipated that we may from time to time find ourselves with such a problem."
"Mr Dell'Alba's report on the Rules of Procedure established a Rule 117a which allows for a transitional arrangement in this regard."
"I should like to underline a point for the future: if you start to set a precedent of playing the language game in order to block votes, you are going to be faced with the worst imaginable gridlock and headache."
"That concludes the vote."
"– Mr President, perhaps you – and those who say that European politics are obscure – would like to take note of the fact that the first vote in the enlarged Europe pitted the Left against the Right, and that the Left won it."
"That has been duly noted, Mr Duhamel!"
"– Mr President, I rise to speak in response to what my old schoolfriend Mr Duhamel has just said."
"As is so often the case, what he said is nonsense; although he spoke in terms of a Left versus Right vote, I voted the same way as he did."
"I still believe that I am on the Right and that he is on the Left!"
". It is disgraceful that the parliamentary Left continues to delay the conclusion of the EU/USA Agreement on the handling and transfer of data contained in Passenger Name Records (PNR), based on what was negotiated by the Commission and suitably explained and clarified several times, both in committee and in plenary, particularly in the previous sitting."
"Missing the point entirely, those on the left continue to create conflict between security and freedom, suggesting that they prefer freedom to security."
"They ignore the fact that there is no freedom without security."
"They show contempt for the rule of law in force, both in the European Union and in the USA."
"Most tellingly, they forget that, faced with the terrible threat of modern-day terrorism on a world scale, it is essential that we safeguard both the security and the freedom of our citizens and cooperate closely with countries that are our friends and allies."
"In the forthcoming European elections, the citizens will, hopefully, rally to the defence of their freedom and security, and mete out electoral punishment to a left wing that has no idea what it is doing."
"Mr President, maladministration is not confined to Brussels: all political structures are imperfect."
"Man is fallen and some people will sometimes give in to temptation."
"What is peculiar to Brussels is the way in which allegations of malpractice are dealt with."
"The usual response of the EU authorities, faced with evidence of corruption, is not to address the issues raised but to impugn the motives of the critic."
"Thus we have seen the disgraceful way in which Paul van Buitenen and Martha Andreasen were treated and the extraordinary arrest of Hans-Martin Tillack."
"In the looking glass world of Brussels, it is not those engaging in fraud who are harassed and bullied, but those exposing it."
"This inability to handle even the most narrow and qualified criticism can be seen in the reaction to the censure motion on which we have just voted."
"Rather than accepting a mild rebuke, the EU establishment went into overdrive, cajoling and threatening the various signatories in an attempt to prevent the motion from seeing the light of day."
"Any lingering doubts about whether the motion was justified have surely been removed by the attempts to smother it."
"I hope that people beyond this House will extrapolate from what has just happened."
"If this is how the EU administers itself, are we wise to invite it to assume control over huge new swathes of our national affairs?"
"If this is how Brussels exercises the powers it currently has, what are we thinking of that we should be proposing to give it new ones?"
"My masters, are we mad?"
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion of censure because I believe that this Commission has failed to deliver the reforms it was asked to get on with five years ago."
"We have had fine words, a lot of wind and bluster from the Commissioner in charge of reforms, Mr Kinnock, but it seems that although the Commissioner can talk the talk he has failed to walk the walk."
"I was elected on a manifesto commitment to fight fraud and maladminstration and it is very difficult to explain to my voters, the good people of Louth and Horncastle or of Derbyshire, why for ten years the accounts have not been signed off by the European Court of Auditors."
"These problems are significant and typified by Eurostat and have failed to be addressed."
"This motion of censure is not just about Eurostat but about the management culture that this exhibits, which goes unchecked."
"Mr Solbes might well have gone, but the lack of political responsibility within the Commission remains."
"This Commission deserves to be censured and future Commissioners need to know that they will be made politically responsible for the actions of those they direct."
"Mr President, I felt obliged to vote for the motion of censure because of the Commission's incompetence and lack of financial control as manifested in the whole Eurostat affair."
"It is indeed bizarre that the only person detained in connection with this sorry episode is the journalist who exposed it."
"I also took the opportunity to register my disapproval of the way the Commission has deliberately ignored the will of this House with regard to aid for hospitals in Belarus, which are woefully ill-equipped to treat the cancers – particularly in children – which have occurred as a direct result of the Chernobyl disaster."
"Two years running we voted to allocate resources from underspent budget lines to buy this much-needed equipment."
"So far not one penny has arrived."
"My constituents in Scarborough and Whitby and I are appalled that money languishes in accounts in Brussels when children are dying of diseases that could be treated."
"Mr President, as I hope everyone in this House knows, EUR 5 million went missing at Eurostat."
"I believe this is an unacceptable waste of taxpayers' money."
"Taxpayers whom I represent across the United Kingdom's capital – in Barnet, Enfield, Croydon – are concerned that the tax they are paying, which is channelled to the European Commission, is not being properly accounted for."
"This is a situation that has gone on for far too long."
"Just a little over five years ago it was said of the Santer Commission that it was difficult to find anyone with the slightest sense of responsibility."
"It saddens me that the situation has not changed and it saddens me that so many people in this House voted for business as usual."
"For these reasons I voted to support this motion of censure because it is unacceptable that the Commission should continue to evade responsibility for its actions and vital that it should continue properly to police the funds which the taxpayer entrusts to it."
"Mr President, in 1999 Commissioner Kinnock was given the task of cleaning up the Commission's accounting and eliminating fraud."
"He has failed spectacularly."
"His main achievement has been to persecute the successive whistleblowers who have revealed the appalling debts of the Commission's failure."
"So far the only person arrested in the Eurostat scandal has been the journalist who broke the story."
"We get nothing but excuses and cover-ups."
"How am I supposed to justify to my constituents in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire the fact that the admitted level of waste and fraud in the EU institutions at EUR 5 billion is as much as the UK's annual net budget contribution. I was elected on a Conservative Party manifesto to oppose fraud and maladministration."
"I therefore had no alternative but to support this motion of censure and I am proud to have done so."
"Mr President, I voted for the motion of censure because it was fully in accordance with the manifesto on which I was elected to this House."
"The European Commission has taken no effective action on fraud and maladministration beyond persecuting the journalist who exposed the whole affair and the whistleblowers."
"Unfortunately, many Members have succumbed to the bullying of the Commission and therefore did not back the motion, which is to their shame."
"Nevertheless, I hope the Commission will take note of the sentiment and clean up its act."
"My constituents in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Durham and Cleveland demand that the Commission put an end to the culture of casual misappropriation of taxpayers' money that exists in so many of our European institutions."
"– Mr President, the Members belonging to the and the may have voted for this motion of censure, but they are not fooled."
"The Eurostat scandal has been known about ever since mid-2003, and it is astonishing that it is only now, with the European elections a month away, that Members of this House are waking up to it."
"We have been barred from signing the motion of censure, even though certain signatories had no problem with it being signed by sympathisers with Communism and Trotskyism; we therefore suspect that this is an electoral subterfuge on their part."
"If the motion of censure had been adopted, improbable though that is, the Commission’s term of office would in any case have ended in October, while it would still have been dealing with day-to-day business."
"Why did it not attack Commissioner Monti for his handling of competition policy in the Schneider and Alstom cases? Why did it not draw attention to the other cases of fraud committed against the Community Budget, the diversion of funds and peddling of influence in the Blue Dragon case?"
"By intervening now, those Members who signed the motion have attempted to carry out a minor internal political operation, which is, alas, far from being commensurate with the gravity of the situation."
".– The Commission has stalled for time and Parliament has let it get away with it."
"If the Commission refuses, both individually and collectively, to accept responsibility of its own free will and accord, then it is for our House to oblige it to do so."
"No response to the plenary debate on the motion of censure, held on Wednesday 21 April, has been forthcoming, any more than to yet another resolution on 22 April 2004."
"The fact of the situation is that the Commission is neither listening to Parliament’s demands nor responding to them."
"The reason why there is opposition to this motion is that its opponents are happy that the Commission should be irresponsible."
"It follows that the failure of this motion sends a very poor message to the citizens of the twenty-five Member States."
"Although the European Parliament is authorised to exercise the power of democratic control, a majority of its Members has explicitly declined to do so."
".– On this great day, on which Europe is reunited, we are better than ever enabled to judge the gulf between the noble objectives of the European Union and the way it is actually managed from one day to another."
"In fact, at the same time as welcoming ten new Members States, eight of which the Soviet Union had kept shut off from the rest of the world, we have been obliged to vote on a motion of censure aimed at penalising the Commission for one of the many troubled episodes that have occurred throughout its history."
"This is a day for harmony, which ought not to have been disturbed by such a punishment, but it is the Commission itself that is responsible for this, having allowed the affair to drag on for years."
"This affair has not, however, turned up at completely the wrong time."
"We have just heard the new Members from the countries of the East calling for a Europe with more regard for national sovereignty."
"Affairs like Eurostat, with its labyrinthine byways, and also the issue of GMOs, which has also been raised today in the context of the approval of the new Commission, are what happens when European institutions believe themselves to be superior to nations and end up being out of control."
"There is one conclusion to be drawn from all these affairs, and that is that we must work to achieve a Europe that is better controlled by its nation-states."
". The is in favour of the motion of censure against the Commission, on the understanding that it is demonstrated that the Commission has failed to take responsibility in the Eurostat case."
"The responses to Parliament’s questions were not all conclusive, nor were individual responsibilities assigned."
"According to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, past affairs, such as the Cresson case, as a result of which the Commission stood down, are well and truly behind us, or, if they occur, will at least be dealt with more correctly."
"However, the Eurostat case has demonstrated that there is still no culture of accountability."
"The Commission ought to consider this rather than levelling criticism at MEPs who wish to clarify what happened in the Eurostat scandal."
"When voters in various Member States opt out and no longer wish to take part in the European Parliament elections, then that is mainly attributable to the attitude taken by the Commission in matters such as the Eurostat case."
"What the electorate demands of the European institutions, and rightly so, is more transparency, more accountability and more democratic legitimacy."
".– It is too late or too early to pass judgment on the Eurostat affair, to which, let it be added, there is much more than has been mentioned in the motion."
"It is comical to suggest that a Parliament that is about to stand down should censure a Commission that is going to do likewise."
"As the President deemed the motion admissible, however, and put it to the vote, I did vote, and did so in favour of censure."
"The fact is that no man of the Left can express confidence in a Commission capable of proposing the Bolkestein directive on public services, a directive that threatens to sound their death knell."
". British Conservative MEPs have been actively engaged in raising concerns relating to Eurostat, and have played a major role in highlighting the issue to the wider public."
"We do not believe that the Commission has accepted political responsibility for the failures that have become clear from this affair."
"We believe the Commission has been given a clear message by the motion for a resolution on Eurostat adopted on 22 April 2004 which:"
"- stated that the Commission had failed to draw the appropriate conclusions from the Eurostat affair, and that it had failed to accept its political responsibility either collectively or individually;"
"- made clear Parliament's intention to continue to monitor and scrutinise future developments in the ongoing Eurostat investigations and potential legal actions, with a view to proposing further reforms."
"Since the motion of censure was originally devised, the responsible Commissioner Pedro Solbes has resigned and returned to Spanish politics."
"In these circumstances, we do not believe that it would be appropriate for the whole Commission to be dismissed at this time, but we urge the Commission to take note of the serious concerns expressed and urgently address the issues as laid out in the resolution adopted by Parliament."
". In July 2003, the Commission laid off Eurostat’s management in response to the persistence of the fraud cases that had been known about for a long time."
"I immediately demanded that the facts be published."
"It is pointless to ask institutions dependent on the Commission to institute an inquiry if they subsequently have to keep their findings secret."
"Only when public opinion is well informed and can help pass judgment can fraud, self-enrichment and nepotism be prevented in future."
"Investigation by Parliament makes that possible."
"Even though a secret report was submitted to the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control at the end of September 2003, the Commission can still act as if it does not carry any responsibility."
"The person primarily responsible, Commissioner Solbes, has meanwhile become minister in the new Spanish Government."
"There is no evidence to show that the problems that forced the previous Commission to step down before the elections five years ago have well and truly ended."
"To illustrate the seriousness of the situation and to ensure that the next Commission will be required to address the problems, I am voting in favour of the motion of censure today."
"The fact that the Greens, previously in opposition, turned against this in the previous meeting, with the aim to prove their administrative reliability, makes it no less necessary to continue the fight against fraud."
". My vote against the motion of censure does not mean that I support the Commission, or that I am unaware of the seriousness of the situation."
"My group, the Union for Europe of the Nations, has on many occasions sought to clarify the Eurostat affair and we continue to do so."
"It is also true that I have voiced my criticism of Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, particularly since November 2003, for openly interfering in internal Italian politics and in European party politics, thereby relinquishing the independence he should always maintain."
"For this reason alone, the President and his Commission deserves Parliament’s political censure."
"It is, nevertheless, entirely wrong to vote on a motion of censure at this time, at the very end of a legislative term and with the Commission’s mandate also coming to an end, and many commissioners arriving and leaving."
"The process of the motion has also been adversely affected by these circumstances."
"I therefore feel that the vote on the motion would not have any genuine political impact."
"It would appear totally out of step and inconsistent, and would be virtually meaningless to the public."
". I would like to make it clear that in supporting the motion of censure on the Commission I fully recognise that there are very worthy Commissioners who have worked to the best of their ability with honesty and accountability throughout their terms of office."
"However, it is also clear that there have been unaccountable and unacceptable actions within the Commission that have jeopardised the reputation and the good name of the institution."
"As there is no means other than censuring the entire Commission, in order to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding use of public funds, I had no other option but to vote in favour."
".– Contrary to what has been claimed by Mrs Grossetête and those who have spoken after her, Parliament is fully entitled to exercise its right to censure the Commission, which has proved itself incapable either of keeping tabs on fraud within its bodies or of finding those responsible for the Eurostat scandal – itself no small matter in view of the three accounts used in respect of contracts awarded to Eurocost, a body incorporated under Luxembourg law, concealment of funds; false invitations to tender to the benefit of one company, Eurogramme, which was also incorporated in Luxembourg; the falsification of turnover, and fictitious staff."
"Refusing to censure it amounts to covering up such errors and gives the impression that the rules of financial transparency must not apply to European institutions."
"This latest scandal reveals the Commission’s fundamental inability to combat the corruption that affects its services."
"After the Commission under Jacques Santer was censured, a zero tolerance approach was announced, along with the establishment of OLAF – (the European Anti-Fraud Office)."
"After the Commission under Romano Prodi was censured, we were told that there would be radical reforms to OLAF, as if fraud were caused by the means used to measure it."
"In reality, it is the way the Commission works that must be reformed."
". Our group has, with conviction, supported the motion that was rejected a moment ago."
"It is now immediately obvious to the electorate which Members wish to expose the mismanagement and deception on the part of the present Commission and which Members wish to cover it up or are not interested in it."
"The mealy-mouthed and abortive reform, the accounting system’s obsolescence and vulnerability to fraud and the Eurostat affair are just three examples that speak volumes."
"They illustrate that what the Committee of Wise Men concluded back in 1999 also applies to this Commission, namely that there is hardly anyone within the Commission who is willing to accept any responsibility."
"It makes a mockery of democracy in Europe and is a denial of Parliament's rights when members of the Commission do not act, but do not step down either."
"If the Commission rebuffs Parliament when it performs its primary task of budgetary control, we have no choice but to send it packing."
"If we failed to do so, we would not be taking ourselves seriously, or the citizens who have voted for us."
"It is becoming increasingly apparent that the so-called European Constitution is merely window-dressing, to conceal to the citizens what is going on in the EU and how their interests are being trifled with."
"The motion of no-confidence was a means of bringing the curtain down on the Prodi Commission’s faltering performance and marks the beginning of an open culture in which everyone takes their responsibility seriously."
". Along with my British Conservative colleagues I have actively engaged in raising concerns relating to fraud, waste and mismanagement in the European Union institutions and we have played a major role in highlighting the issues to the wider public."
"Since the motion of censure was originally devised, Commissioner Solbes has resigned and returned to Spanish politics."
"In these circumstances it was no longer credible to support a motion against the whole Commission and our delegation policy was therefore to abstain."
"Nevertheless, it is essential that the Commission take serious note of the concerns expressed in the resolution on Eurostat adopted by the European Parliament on 22 April 2004;"
"- that the Commission had failed to draw the appropriate conclusions from the Eurostat affair, and that it had failed to accept its political responsibility either collectively or individually"
"- making clear Parliament’s intention to continue to monitor and scrutinise future developments in the ongoing Eurostat investigations and potential legal actions, with a view to further possible action"
"The pursuit of greater accountability and control of the EU budget and dramatically improved management by the Commission; the need for the European Parliament to have the power to dismiss individual Commissioners;"
"That concludes the explanations of vote in writing."
"(1)"
"– Mr President, while we are now rejoicing and welcoming new Member States to the European Union, we cannot, unfortunately, put the international situation out of our minds."
"A few days ago, we were profoundly disturbed by revelations in the Press of appalling tortures inflicted on Iraqi prisoners by the American and British occupying forces."
"Practices such as these can do nothing other than widen the gulf between North and South, between the West and the Muslim world."
"Nevertheless, they represent a tendency that must be resisted."
"If this is to be done, the international community must unequivocally condemn such practices; it must demonstrate the firm determination to bring to light, in so far as is possible, the extent to which they take place and to ensure that those responsible will be brought to justice."
"In particular, we can have no confidence in any enquiry carried out by the governments of the States concerned."
"I therefore hope that a United Nations commission of enquiry may be set up as quickly as possible and I ask the President of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that a request to this effect is forwarded to the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"I did not give you the floor for a point of order, Mrs Duthu, but simply because yesterday when we opened the proceedings, given the solemnity of the meeting, the MEPs who intended to speak, as usual, for one minute on matters of interest to them, did not have the chance to do so."
"I am taking the floor in order to ask you, Mr President, to use your position to send, on behalf of us all, I think, a message of solidarity to Mr Anastasiades, a victim of an attack yesterday in Cyprus during which bombs were thrown at his house."
"As we know, Mr Anastasiades is the leader of the ‘yes’ movement for the referendum."
"I feel that it is important for this to be referred to today, during this sitting, simply in terms of expressing this institution’s solidarity in this respect."
"I can tell you, Mrs Frassoni, that the President has already contacted the person who – unfortunately – was directly concerned, expressing all our solidarity on his and on Parliament’s behalf."
"Mr President, I just want to clarify that the bomb attack against Mr Anastasiadis was not carried out for political motives but because of comments he made after a football game."
"The minutes of this House on Monday 3rd May 2004 exposed Mr Martin for the deceitful person that he is."
"He also falsely accused hundreds of MEPs, including 11 Irish MEPs, of ‘milking no show loopholes’ in our daily expenses."
"This relates to the facility that MEPs have to sign on a register on a Friday so that they are enabled to claim their allowances for accommodation on a Thursday night when they participate in votes on a Thursday afternoon and are unable to fly home."
"On the Irish radio programme ‘Live Line’ he disingenuously claimed, that as these votes closed at 5.14 pm, I could have easily caught the Frankfurt to Dublin flight."
"This flight closes at 7.05 pm, so therefore Mr Martin was claiming that in 1 Hour and fifty minutes I would have plenty of time to collect my belongings and drive approximately 250 kilometres to Frankfurt airport."
"Such a statement is blatantly dishonest and he knows that well."
"He also claimed that I leave Strasbourg early."
"MEPs are prisoners of flight schedules."
"Up until November 2003 when my flight schedule changed my regular routine was leaving Strasbourg in the afternoon to catch flights which departed for the airport in my constituency at times varying from 16:00 to 18:00."
"Furthermore this routine also required me coming regularly to Strasbourg on a Sunday for which I received no daily allowance."
"Mr Martin also accused me of some 32 problem cases of claiming the daily allowance."
"Despite the viciousness of his accusations he has never once provided with this list – strange justice indeed."
"However in relation to the 6 dates he mentioned on RTEs liveline programmes, he was inaccurate in at least half of them."
"On a date when he alleged I signed in late I actually was present early that morning voting in my committee."
"With regard to 2 other dates I did not receive any daily allowance for the Parliament and these facts have been confirmed in writing to me by the EP services."
"I want therefore to read this into the record to once again expose the type of behaviour that Mr Martin engages."
"Thank you, Mr Matsakis, for being so meticulous."
"The general debate will continue with the Council and Commission declarations on enlarged Europe and its neighbours."
". Mr President, one of the tasks of the enlarged European Union will be the continuation of the enlargement process."
"Our common target is to carry through the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007."
"This of course depends on whether both countries complete negotiations and all necessary internal reforms."
"2004 will also be decisive for Turkey and the report and recommendation to be brought forward by the Commission in the autumn will be one of the last big decisions of our mandate."
"Turkey's chances depends on its fulfilment of the political criteria, as was the case for all the other candidate countries."
"The sequence is clear."
"First the political criteria and then the negotiations."
"As regards the Western Balkan states, as you are aware, the Thessaloniki European Council last year fully supported the European perspective of the Western Balkan states becoming an integral part of the European Union once they meet the conditions for accession and the so-called political and economic criteria and they can demonstrate that they are ready to assume the obligations of membership."
"Two weeks ago my colleagues, Commissioners Patten and Verheugen, presented to you the Commission's opinion on Croatia's accession and the Commission concluded that Croatia fulfils the political criteria for membership and has recommended the opening of negotiations."
"This is now likely to be taken up by the European Council in June."
"This House has always shown its full support for and engagement in the enlargement process."
"My colleague Commissioner Verheugen would have liked to have been here today."
"In March he debated with this House the last steps in the accession of the ten new Member States which joined us last week and on the accession prospects for Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the current state of play for Turkey."
"Less than two weeks ago, he reported to this plenary on the final preparations for the accession of Cyprus, recalling once again the clear preference of the EU for a united Cyprus to join the Union."
"As we have all seen in the meantime, this desire on the part of the Union was not fulfilled and, as a result of democratic referenda held on the island on 24 April, the Annan plan for the reunification of the island was rejected."
"The Commission deeply regretted that the Greek Cypriot community did not approve the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, but we have to respect the democratic decision of the people."
"The Commission warmly congratulated the Turkish Cypriots for their 'yes' vote."
"This signals a clear desire by the community to resolve the island's problem."
"Last week Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy engaged in a lively debate in the wake of the referenda result and on that occasion Commissioner Verheugen stressed the commitment of the EU to come forward with comprehensive proposals to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community."
"The Commission was invited to do so by the Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 26 April, and financial support totalling EUR 259 million will be earmarked for this purpose."
"The Commission has already initiated the necessary planning to that end and intends to bring forward comprehensive proposals on trade and aid measures within the coming weeks."
"A new spirit of cooperation between the two communities will be necessary for the implementation of the announced measures."
"At this stage, I can only recall the position of the Commission that the Turkish Cypriots must not be punished by this situation and that we will help them to overcome their economic isolation, as well as continue to bring them closer to the Union."
"Let me turn now to our neighbours outside the enlarged EU."
"Last autumn this House had an opportunity to debate the European neighbourhood policy."
"This policy has been developed as a response to the new opportunities and challenges created by enlargement."
"Together the Union offers an ambitious policy to our neighbours in the east and the south, based on shared values and common interests, and aiming at preventing the creation of new dividing lines in and around our continent, and at expanding the area of peace, stability and prosperity."
"The European neighbourhood policy is distinct from the issue of possible accession to the EU."
"Though we are not closing doors, the European neighbourhood policy is not about future enlargements since it is addressed to neighbours who do not currently have the prospect of accession."
"At this stage, we will build on the existing institutional framework of our relations, the association or partnership and cooperation agreements."
"Differentiation is a key notion to the European neighbourhood policy. It results from the different situations of each partner, as well as of its relationship with the Union."
"The European neighbourhood policy is based on the principle of joint ownership in line with the European Union's approach that political and economic reform cannot be imposed and that successful cooperation can only build on mutual interests and the principle of equality of partners."
"In the course of the last months, we have been working out the various aspects of this new policy and we are preparing, in close consultation with partners, a first package of action plans to be jointly adopted with them."
"These actions plans will set out the agreed priorities of our relationships in key areas, as well as mechanisms to ensure their timely implementation."
"Next week the Commission will present a strategy document on the European neighbourhood policy, together with country reports on this first group of countries."
"The action plans will provide new political momentum to the Union's relations with partner countries."
"The action plans will focus on political dialogue and reform, trade, market and regulatory reform, cooperation in the fields of energy, transport, the information society, the environment and people-to-people contacts."
"The content and priorities agreed with each partner country will differ and depend on its particular circumstances."
"The plans will identify key actions in a limited number of priority fields and include a clear time horizon."
"The action plans are expected to be adopted later this summer."
". Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Cyprus on behalf of the Council."
"Three days ago, on 1 May, a new chapter was written in the history of Europe."
"It is no exaggeration to say that the accession of ten Member States marks a truly historic moment."
"In effect, it brings an end to the tragic post-war divisions in Europe."
"It does not, however, bring a complete end to divisions within our continent."
"The Republic of Cyprus has taken its place as a full Member State of the European Union."
"It is no secret that the clear preference of the European Union was for the accession of a united Cyprus on 1 May."
"We greatly regret that following the outcome of the referenda in Cyprus on 24 April, it was not possible to achieve this objective."
"I would like today to echo the strong words from the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg on 26 April."
"The Council indicated its determination to ensure that the people of Cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union."
"We accept, however, that the people of Cyprus have made a democratic choice."
"On 24 April, the people of both parts of Cyprus voted in separate referenda on the settlement plan presented by the United Nations Secretary-General."
"The referenda were the culmination of a long and detailed negotiating process led by the United Nations."
"It is important today, therefore, that I again emphasise in the European Parliament the deep gratitude that the European Union has for the determined and sustained efforts in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem by Secretary-General Annan, by his Special Adviser, Mr Alvaro de Soto, and by their colleagues."
"They worked closely, and tirelessly, with the parties for a long period."
"We also recognise the very positive contributions made by the governments of Greece and Turkey."
"All in this House know and have reflected on the results of the referenda and there is little point in going further into the analysis at this point."
"The Turkish Cypriot community has now expressed its clear desire for a future within the European Union."
"The Council is determined to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and to facilitate the reunification of the island by encouraging economic development."
"Last week, the Council took an important step with the adoption on 29 April of the regulation on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 of the Act of Accession."
"The regulation was necessary for a smooth accession process."
"It provided the terms under which the relevant provisions of European Union law are applied to the line between the northern part of Cyprus, in which the application of the is suspended, and the areas in which the government of Cyprus is in control."
"The terms of the regulation will facilitate trade and other links across the line while ensuring that the appropriate standards of protection are maintained."
"I believe that the agreement reached on this regulation reflects clearly the desire of the Council to send a signal of encouragement to the members of the Turkish Cypriot community that its future lies within a united Cyprus and within the European Union."
"The next step will be the presentation by the Commission of the comprehensive proposal requested by the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"That will have a particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities within the European Union."
"The Council has recommended that the EUR 259 million that had been earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement should now be used for this purpose."
"I welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward its comprehensive proposals within the coming weeks."
"There is a strong sympathy and a sense of respect in this Parliament for the people of Cyprus, of both communities, as they seek to overcome the legacy of a divided history."
"I have said here on more than one occasion that coming as I do from a divided island we understand very fully how difficult it is to heal the rifts."
"I regret that the accession celebrations in Ireland on 1 May could not have included a celebration of a united Cyprus in the European Union, in fact I do so on a particularly personal note, because the celebrations for Cyprus were held in my own home town and it would have been marvellous if we could have welcomed all of the people of Cyprus there on that occasion."
"However, those who did come were very welcome."
"The statements and actions by the Council since the referenda clearly confirm that the European Union remains strongly committed to providing tangible assurance to the Turkish Cypriot community that its future will be in a united Cyprus within the European Union."
"On a personal note, I shall unfortunately have to leave before this debate ends."
"This is likely to be the last occasion on which I address this Parliament."
"I want to thank very sincerely all the Members of this Parliament for the extraordinary courtesy and for the forbearance they have shown me during many debates in this Chamber."
"I have seldom enjoyed an experience more than I have enjoyed addressing this Parliament."
"I am not sure whether that enjoyment was reciprocated, but nonetheless, from my point of view my duties here were very pleasant and they were made all the more pleasant by the fact that I was able to make new friends and renew old acquaintances."
"In recent days this Parliament has come in for some of the most uncalled for and scurrilous criticism, criticism which it does not deserve."
"This Parliament serves the people of Europe well."
"It is a model of parliamentary performance."
"It gets through its work in an efficient and effective way."
"Undoubtedly it is not entirely made up of saints, but then very few human institutions are absolutely perfect."
"However, insofar as a parliamentary assembly is concerned, this comes as close to perfection as any assembly that I have ever addressed."
"It has been my pleasure to work with the Members of this Parliament."
"I wish those who are going into retirement all the very best for their retirement."
"I hope that they enjoy the years ahead of them."
"For those who are going into the election campaigns, I wish them well too, for safe campaigning and a very happy result."
"Mr Roche, usually the President should not applaud, but this time I joined my fellow Members in their applause for your words, which were very kind and thoughtful in respect of this House which has admired the work carried out by the Irish Presidency at a very difficult time."
"We of course hope that following these days of celebration, there will be another joyful conclusion for at least a good number of the MEPs in this Chamber, when the European Council is held in June."
"Allow me to say to you, however, that your thanks and courtesy have been reciprocated."
"The parliamentary groups and the House as a whole have truly appreciated, both during individual meetings and thanks to your presence here, the great ability of a small country to help ensure that these wonderful days of celebration would proceed in the best possible way and that we could realise this ‘first’ in the history of the union of peoples, States, nations and citizens."
"Thank you very much, Mr Roche, and through you I would like to thank all the Irish Presidency."
"Mr President, I would like to join with you in thanking the Irish presidency for everything it has done so far, in particular in ensuring the success of this enormously historic occasion of the welcoming of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which, as other speakers have said, will go down in the annals of history."
"I would like to contribute a few thoughts at this stage."
"This morning speakers have been talking about the past, of Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli."
"I would like to give a few ideas of how one might see the future."
"I am not sure that I share the Commission's idea that we should be looking at enlargement as the sole focus of our energies."
"It is true that within the European Parliament we now have a fantastic variety of representation of traditions and cultures, but this is not what Europe is going to be about over the next five to ten years."
"In the last 20 years we have seen this question of enlargement go together with the deepening of the Union."
"We are now at a point where we see the limits to competence and to the geographical expansion of the Union being reached."
"Therefore, I have three remarks to make."
"Firstly, when a new Commission is appointed, we need some vision and strategy of how to handle the internal problems of the Union."
"The question arises in our own Parliament of how we are to handle the vast array of different political parties, 25 nationalities and 20 different languages."
"But, perhaps more importantly for our electorate, we must determine how to remain competitive in the global economy and how to ensure the internal security of our citizens."
"These are debates that will come later this afternoon."
"However, for ourselves today, we face the question of how to ensure that the European Union will be a player on the world stage, how to handle the questions of AIDS in Africa, how to contribute towards peacekeeping, and how to ensure that the Union has a presence in the world."
"A few weeks ago, we adopted Mr Brok's resolution on how we would like to work with our transatlantic friends, the United States, as we move from a Community of values to a Community of action, so that together we can see how a global system will work."
"In the next few years we will need to think of how the European Union can really make an impact on the global stage, as a partner rather than a rival of the United States."
"Therefore, on the question of how we are to handle enlargement, the majority of my Group would be in favour of consolidation of the Union rather than continuing enlargement simply because countries feel that they meet the criteria."
"The essential clause in the Copenhagen criteria is that we should take account of the absorptive capacity of the European Union in order to welcome countries as they would like to be welcomed and as we have welcomed the ten Central and Eastern European countries today."
"I would urge in the coming months that we look at the provisions on privileged partnerships under the Constitutional Treaty."
"Not everybody has to join the Union in order to meet the requirements of their foreign policies satisfactorily."
"We in the Union have to be sure to coordinate everything that is available to us in a financial, political and economic way – as the President-in-Office of the Council has said for the Turkish side of Cyprus, which is not yet able to join the European Union."
"We must find the legal basis, the means by which we control the funds, and deal with a whole array of different things to enable us to create a stable, prosperous and secure environment for citizens of the European Union to live in."
"In conclusion, when we look to the future, at enlargement and our neighbours, we in the European Union must be more prepared to look strategically at our own interests."
"What do we want, where do we want to go and what do we want to say to our citizens so that we can live in peace within our frontiers and contribute to global peace outside them?"
"For the majority of my Group, this means that we need to think in terms of consolidation over the coming period, rather than enlargement."
"In time we can enlarge, yet under no account should we enlarge so quickly that we undermine the European Union, which we have built so strongly in the last 40 years."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency on the way it has conducted business."
"It has been a delight to work with Minister Roche in particular."
"The Irish presidency has set a model of transparency and cooperation within the Parliament."
"Today – which has been very much a day of celebration – it is important to remember just how far we have come in the European Union in a very short period of time."
"I remember visiting Lithuania a few weeks after independence."
"It was then a country with huge energy shortages, tremendous dislocation, Soviet troops still on its soil and tremendous insecurity."
"It is hard to imagine that, in the short period of 15 years, Lithuania has managed to join the EU."
"This is a sign of what the EU can achieve when we are determined to set off down a particular road and not let obstacles hinder us."
"It is often said that this is a historic enlargement – it is indeed."
"If I can return again to Lithuania, one of the most spectacular events in my life was a visit to the KGB Museum in Vilnius where my blood ran cold."
"This enlargement shows that the Cold War is finally at an end and we should remember that in those revolutions of 1989 and 1990, a number of people died to have the freedom to join organisations like the EU."
"We should remember their sacrifice."
"When we finish celebrating, we ought to realise that all we have done is reach the end of the beginning of the EU."
"We now finally have a European Union which is Europe-wide."
"It is not complete – and I disagree with Mr Elles, we be moving forward in relation to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey – but it is a Europe-wide EU."
"We must now make this EU work for the benefit of its citizens."
"The hard part really begins today."
"In order to do that, we must start by getting away from endless discussions about processes and start talking about outcomes and policies."
"That is why it is important to agree on a Constitution and then move on and look at how we benefit EU citizens."
"Our priorities in this enlarged Europe must be to have more and better jobs: not to talk, but to ."
"It is worth noting that the ten new countries have all had to go through a process of being investigated on a yearly basis by the Commission on their progress towards fulfilling the requirements for membership."
"Perhaps we should apply that same process to the existing 15 Member States, so that instead of promising to do things, people actually do them."
"That must be our priority."
"We also have to look at how we develop legislation which can be properly implemented."
"We need to move our focus away from simply developing legislation to looking at how it is implemented and where it is achieving the objectives that we set out."
"We must also have more and better security."
"Enlargement has to deliver a safer Europe for our citizens, a Europe safe from criminals, drug runners, terrorists and people traffickers."
"That is what the citizens are going to look for in our enlarged Europe."
"Part of that security agenda must be that we do not become Eurocentric."
"This enlarged Europe must be for the benefit of the world as a whole."
"That is why I hope – and I am glad Commissioner Nielson is here – that we see no slackening of our commitments to development policy, no slackening of our commitments to meet the millennium development goals and that we redouble our efforts to develop better relationships with our neighbours."
"We should bear in mind that in Kaliningrad in particular, we have a perfect example of how we need to proceed."
"How we succeed in working with Kaliningrad will dictate how we succeed in working with the rest of the world."
"We should celebrate today, but we should also remember that we must start working hard from now on to make this enlarged Europe work for the benefit of our citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this House has perhaps done most to promote enlargement."
"We have put the pressure on and committed ourselves to a date."
"We have worked closely with the candidate countries, our sister parties and others."
"We have invited them to Parliament during the part-sessions."
"We have been active in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and we were the only political group to vote unanimously in favour of every country in the vote on membership here in the House."
"We have, of course, been incredibly happy over the last few days, when what we have fought for has at last become a reality."
"At last, we have unified the European continent which, for so long, has been divided by war, misery, enmity and walls."
"Now, it is no longer a case of ‘us’ and ‘them’."
"Now, we are all ‘us’: 25 countries and 450 million citizens who have come together to solve common problems, defend common values and build a common future."
"That is not, however, the end."
"The EU will continue to grow."
"We look forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania in a few years’ time."
"We look forward to the start of the negotiations with Croatia, and the ELDR Group also supports the Turkish candidacy."
"Major reforms and changes have taken place in Turkey during Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s leadership."
"The country has been modernised and democratised."
"Certainly, there remains a great deal to be done."
"The role of the military in politics is unacceptable; there are political prisoners; the Kurds are still treated in an abusive and discriminatory way; and the court case against Leyla Zana leaves a very great deal to be desired."
"We grant no exemptions, for criteria exist, but Turkey will in time have an obvious place."
"A democratic Turkey would make an important contribution and be a link between Europe and the Muslim world."
"The ELDR Group can never accept the argument that the EU is exclusively a Christian union."
"The EU will be undergoing enlargement for many years."
"The day that Serbs and Albanians sit in Parliament together with ourselves, or with yourselves in the Council, and, side by side, debate, for example, emission rights, then the European project will clearly have become a peace project again."
"The ELDR Group believes that we should not now be setting any limit on how large the EU is to become."
"We proceed on the principle that all countries situated wholly or partly in Europe are welcome as long as they fulfil the criteria."
"The world is, however, larger than the EU, even an enlarged EU."
"The great task in the next term of office will therefore be to implement, and give practical shape to, the neighbourhood strategy and formulate how, in practical terms, we are to increase cooperation with our eastern and southern neighbours, using the Mediterranean process, and with those countries that may one day be able to become Members and with those that do not perhaps want to become Members."
"We must find both common and bilateral solutions."
"The people of Moldavia, Albania, Georgia and Ukraine, together with the oppressed people of Belarus all have high hopes of the EU."
"They want us to be able to give them an answer concerning a better future."
"We must therefore formulate strategies as to how we are to cooperate with these countries."
"This will be a priority task."
"Mr President, you can be sure that the ELDR Group will put its weight behind this work."
"Finally, I wish, on my own behalf but also on behalf of the ELDR Group, to say a big thank you to Mr Brok for the work he has done in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"He is not in the House, but I wish my thanks to be minuted."
"The work that has been done in the committee and the fact that we are standing where we are today owe a very great deal to him."
"– Mr President, these days' debates have perhaps a celebratory character. I should like, however, to point out that, for us, the enlargement of united Europe, over and above its historic, political and economic importance, is also a huge challenge for a Europe without partitions and without exclusions."
"Unfortunately, the current economic and social choices of the European Union widen the social gap, instead of bridging it."
"If, therefore, we look realistically at the omissions and problems, I would say that the European Union as a whole needs to look specifically at how the new Member States are being supported, so that cohesion, at both economic and social level, and the safeguarding of citizens' rights can progress."
"Enlargement, however, is continuing."
"The prospect of the integration, in coming years, of Bulgaria and Romania into the Union is positive, insofar as it is based not simply on satisfying certain indicators, but on real improvements to the life of the citizens in these countries."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, enlargement and the consolidation of relations between the European Union and this country are, I believe, positive both for the country and its democratisation and for peace and stability in the area."
"It is within these frameworks that we see the contribution of Cyprus to the European Union."
"We believe that Cyprus can and must be used as a bridge between the European Union and the Eastern Mediterranean, especially the Middle East."
"We could, of course, play this part much more efficiently if the Cyprus question had been resolved when we joined the European Union on 1 May."
"Unfortunately, the referenda, the expression of the will of the people, did not bring about the result which we all hoped for."
"We need to interpret the result of the referenda correctly."
"In our perception at least, the no vote by the Greek Cypriot community in the referendum neither rejects the solution for the reunification of Cyprus nor, if you like, the plan of the Secretary General of the United Nations itself."
"It is an expression of insecurity, it is an expression of anxieties about the workability of the solution and we would like the European Parliament to turn its attention in this direction and make a positive contribution towards putting those preconditions in place that will result in the support of the overwhelming majority, of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, for the reunification of the island, within the framework of a federation."
"Mr President, I also want to thank the presidency, and Mr Roche in particular, for the way in which he has handled our dealings together."
"I also enjoyed it very much."
"I must say that sometimes I find it difficult to attack him because he is so nice and so it is difficult to say how much I disagree with the Irish presidency."
"I thank him very much and it was a pleasure for my Group too to work with the Irish presidency."
"I have very little time so I just want to concentrate on the question of Cyprus."
"We all share the sadness at the disappointing result of the referendum."
"I understand and I respect the response of the Greek Cypriots."
"I want to believe that they want a solution and that they are not happy with the status quo."
"But now it is time for them and for us to act."
"We have to act quickly and positively to ensure that agreement can still be reached this year."
"The Greek Cypriots should tell us their ideas to ensure that enlargement is completed and the rest of the European Union must assist and remind them that this business cannot remain unfinished."
"I have two small suggestions."
"The first is for the Commission and the Council."
"To say that EUR 289 million have been earmarked is quite good, but how much time elapses between earmarking and spending?"
"I became very worried when I heard Commissioner Nielson talking about legal problems and complications."
"Could the Commission and the Council give us a timetable for committing this money and solving the European Union's formal problems with northern Cyprus?"
"The Government of the Republic of Cyprus has a problem with the implementation of the law governing the European elections in Cyprus."
"In order to be able to vote, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Latin Maronites and Armenians have to be registered on the electoral roll for the European elections."
"Unfortunately, the Cypriot Parliament took a decision requiring all Cypriots to register themselves on the electoral roll."
"As a result of this procedure, only 503 out of an estimated 80 000 Turkish Cypriots are eligible to vote."
"This is too few."
"If the Cypriot Parliament decided to include on the electoral roll all persons who have either an ID card or a passport issued by the Republic of Cyprus, 40 000 Turkish Cypriots could vote."
"I have two requests to the Government of Cyprus."
"Firstly, people from both communities who are in possession of an ID card or a passport from the Republic of Cyprus should automatically be entitled to vote."
"Secondly, the Government of Cyprus should re-open the electoral roll over the next three weeks and make a public announcement in both communities and in both languages to ensure that those able to vote in the European elections do so."
"Mr President, joining the European Union still fires the public and political imagination of eastern Europe, even after, or perhaps, in fact, because of, the large enlargement round that has just been completed."
"I would like to bring you the following story by way of illustration."
"The president and economic affairs minister of one of the so-called new neighbouring countries in the east are paying a joint visit to the Delphic Oracle."
"To one of the minister’s pressing questions about the trends in macro-economic figures, he receives surprisingly positive responses."
"Disappointingly enough for him, the oracle adds, 'but not during your term in office'."
"Encouraged by these promises, the president wants to know whether his country might also join the European Union."
"'It will', says the famous Oracle in reply, 'but not during my term in office'."
"Commissioner Verheugen recently made a statement that was not dissimilar to this wise saying."
"He stated in no uncertain terms that the former Soviet Union's border to the west, with the exception of the Baltic States, would coincide with the European Union's eastern border for some time to come."
"His plain speaking, moreover, prompted the offended Ukrainians to comment that it is apparently easier for a Turkish-Moroccan camel to negotiate the eye of the European Commission's needle than an Orthodox civilisation such as their own, which is regarded as alien."
"We have been told."
"Meanwhile, Commissioner Verheugen's chosen position bears witness to a sense of realism, at least in the near future."
"Speculation about, for example, Ukraine's long-term chances of accession to the EU depends on various factors."
"Suffice to think of the possible fulfilment of Turkey's European aspirations."
"In that light, is it at all possible to keep the door firmly shut to Kiev while preserving any sense of propriety?"
"However, very recent statements by the Ukrainian Head of State, Mr Leonid Kuchma, that Kiev is currently giving priority to membership of the WTO and NATO rather than to accession to the European Union, should serve to put Mr Elles' mind at rest."
"Whichever way you look at it, and quite apart from the issue of EU membership, the European Union will need a new neighbourliness policy after this enlargement round."
"This is causing a great deal of worry at the new eastern border, because the domestic situation in Belarus, the Ukraine and Moldova is worrying, to say the least."
"How can we promote the forming of democratic constitutional states in that region?"
"Practical neighbourly help is the most obvious way of doing this."
"An asymmetric liberalisation of internal trade springs to mind, a helping hand to which the EU should, however, attach political conditions."
"In addition, the new Member States will also have a contribution of major importance to make to the forming of the Union's relations with its neighbours to the east."
"They, after all, are most closely involved."
"We are relying on them today, just as the reform-minded forces in Belarussian, Ukrainian and Moldovan, society should be able to continue to rely on the European Union in the near future."
"Mr President, the debate on an enlarged Europe and its neighbourliness policy is inextricably linked to the existential issue of European Union borders."
"The enlargement that we have spent the past few days celebrating is a good thing, but it will require effort, certainly in the first years, and not least in the financial field."
"It is therefore important that we should take a break now before we contemplate future enlargements."
"Romania and Bulgaria have 2007 as their target date for accession."
"This should remain as such, and we should not decide in favour of enlargement if it turns out that those countries are not ready for accession at that time."
"The same applies to Croatia."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, it should be made clear that it is not a European country and that, even it were, it does not meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Turkey does, however, have a major role to play in the EU’s neighbourliness policy."
"That is the only realistic option, and probably means that more will need to be invested in neighbourliness policy than originally planned."
"Following the referendum in Cyprus, I can only regret that the Commission and Council have decided in favour of a recognition of the Turkish military occupation of the north of the island."
"Moreover, it would be interesting to know on what legal basis this recognition is founded."
"The funds which were intended for North Cyprus in the event of the referendum resulting in the island's reunification will be paid out all the same, despite the fact that the voters have decided differently."
"This is a new illustration of the democratic deficit in the European Union, despite all pledges to bring Europe closer to the citizen."
"–Mr President, ladies and gentlementoday it is my great privilege to share with you my thoughts in the context of the European Union’s enlargement."
"Despite the festive atmosphere of recent days, those thoughts are concerned more with problems than ovations."
"First of all, coming from a country that has only just acceded, I do not feel morally entitled to say where the future borders of the European Union should lie, or when further enlargement should stop."
"At the same time, it would be equally morally unjustified to make insubstantial promises to our neighbours concerning their possible accession, in a situation where neither party is ready for it."
"The experience of relations with Turkey over the past 40 years would be a poor model to use for the development of relations with Ukraine today."
"Secondly, my background in academic circles has given me a clear understanding of what is accomplishable and what is not."
"A prerequisite for the enlargement of the European Union is an in-depth approach to integration."
"The Constitutional Treaty enables the involvement of ten new Member States in collective processes without compromising the fundamental principles and decision making of that union."
"If the Member States fail to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, we may have to accept that future enlargement may also come to a halt."
"Thirdly, I believe that all rounds of enlargement must be based on certain objective criteria."
"Once a round of enlargement has taken place, however, Member States should be treated equally."
"The restrictions on the free movement of workers imposed by some Member States is just as unwarranted as the imposition of stricter internal market regulations on new Member States."
"If the European Union accepts the splitting up of Cyprus, why then should it agree to the raising of Russian minority issues in Estonia and Latvia?"
"That is just not logical."
"Fourthly, I welcome the European Union’s neighbourhood policy, which is a guarantee for stability and democratisation beyond its borders."
"I believe that the setting up of the ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the setting up of peace-keeping operations elsewhere in the world are signs of the European Union’s growing foreign policy agenda and of the attempts of Member States to speak with a single voice in the international arena."
"At the same time, I do not comprehend how countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Haiti have achieved a higher placing in the list of priorities than our close neighbours Moldova and Georgia.Yet this was the neighbourhood policy that was supposed to prepare the European Union for further enlargements."
"As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, there are a great number of problems to be solved."
"I sincerely hope that the enlarged European Union will not prove to be a disappointment for anyone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europeans, the long-awaited hour is here."
"Poland has become a Member State of the European Union, along with another nine countries and peoples ."
"Integration into Europe has been the hope and ambition of many nations, including Poland."
"The Polish people played a significant role in this endeavour."
"After all, Poland initiated the process of structural transformation in our part of Europe, and it was the Polish Government that was the first to propose enlarging the European Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"We therefore have good reasons for pride and satisfaction."
"The date of 1 May 2004 will become a symbol of the end of the Yalta order in Europe."
"This order artificially divided our continent, placing some in a privileged position, while sentencing others to a sluggish pace of economic development."
"Let us hope it is gone forever."
"Today, with the sense of a job well done, we should look forward in hope to the future of Europe."
"Thanks are due to all those who strove towards integration, both in the countries of The Fifteen and in the candidate countries."
"They are to be commended on their unshakeable determination and on helping to bring about integration through concrete facts and actions."
"The next step on this road will be the adoption of the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is our expectation and hope that this will occur during the current Irish Presidency."
"In this period of globalisation and terrorism, it is necessary to reinforce our European solidarity, cooperation, unity, and security."
"In order for work on this important document to be completed successfully, it is vital for all the Member States to be willing to compromise."
"I agree with Commissioner Verheugen."
"He is a great friend of Poland and of its people."
"The Commissioner stated that European integration called for courage, courage of thought and the courage to compromise."
"Courage is also required when considering the future of the European Union, because the process of enlargement will not stop at this stage."
"It will continue until the time our common neighbours in the east and south of Europe join our great strong family in their turn."
"We should maintain the best possible relations with them, endeavouring to ensure they are properly prepared for the process of integration at the appropriate time."
"I cannot predict whether the Polish electorate will decide if I should continue to sit in this House."
"Allow me, therefore, to finish by thanking President Pat Cox and the European Parliament for enabling me to represent Poland in the European arena over the last year."
"I am sure I speak for the other observers too."
"It has been a great privilege to witness events that will go down in history and an honour to have been actively involved in shaping them."
"I am conscious of the significance of this moment for the history of Europe."
"Confident of our shared courage and determination to build a better world I face the future with confidence and hope."
"Naturally I hope, Mr Gawlowski, that you will come and take the floor on many other occasions in this Chamber, but the next time the President – who will be someone else – will certainly be a bit stricter than me and will cut you off earlier."
"Mr President, as a representative from Cyprus, I will attempt to dispel a few myths."
"Firstly, the Greek Cypriots vote against peace and the reunification of the island in the recent referendum."
"They voted against a particular plan which would not have brought peace or reunification to the island."
"The plan legalises the Turkish invasion of Cyprus."
"The plan also stipulates that Turkish troops of occupation will remain in Cyprus forever and that Turkey – an invader of Cyprus – will be a guarantor of the independence of Cyprus."
"This means that a Member State of the European Union will be under the guardianship of Turkey."
"This is the main reason why Greek Cypriots did not vote for this plan."
"There is only one way that Cyprus can be reunified and peace restored: the Turkish troops of occupation must be withdrawn from Cyprus."
"– Mr President, beyond any doubt, the enlargement of the EU by the accession of ten states is an event of historic magnitude."
"It is difficult to predict how history will eventually rate the first day of May in 2004."
"If one is to believe the politicians, the accession of the former Socialist Republics of Eastern Europe has not enlarged Europe, but completed it."
"Whatever our understandable and justifiable rejoicing at the fall of borders, we should not overlook the fact that many citizens of both the old and new Member States take a sceptical view of the future."
"Those who live in Prague or Budapest, where unemployment stands at only between 3% and 4% will take a different view of things from someone from Ostrawa in Northern Moravia, where some 30% are out of work."
"I have experienced celebrations that soon gave way to sober reality and disappointment, the after-effects of which are being felt in Germany to this day."
"In the course of negotiations, much was said about the implementation of the Copenhagen criteria, but there was no debate about the changes that bring with them grave social disparities, with poverty for the many and immense wealth for the few."
"Far be it from me to pour cold water on this solemn moment, but I know that there is in the long term nothing worse than self-deception, and that nothing does more political damage than the unwillingness to accept history with all its contradictions, bitterness and difficulties."
"This being my last speech to this House, I have a request to make. There must be no room in the European democracy for xenophobia, anti-Semitism or hatred of Communists, of whatever kind."
"Europe is more than the EU, and the European Union will have new neighbours."
"What the present time demands of us is that we be good neighbours."
"A week ago, I was in Riga and saw for myself just how much is required if trust in our neighbours is to grow."
"If we want to have a good future to look forward to in peace, then what is required of us will be peaceful communities, the bringing together of people, and coexistence in a spirit of solidarity."
"– Ladies and gentlemen. I am from Latvia and it is a great honour for me to appear here today before the European Parliament, as a fully fledged representative of my country."
"We are very pleased that Europe is becoming ever more united, that borders and regulations that hinder our cooperation and the full participation of Eastern Europe in the European Union are disappearing."
"I represent the Russian-speaking minority of Latvia, which makes up about 40% of the country's population."
"It is a great pleasure for me to announce to you today that Russians too are now part of a united Europe and I want to emphasise that this is a direct result of enlargement."
"On 1 May, tens of thousands of the Russian-speaking residents of Latvia – participants in a rally – entrusted me to greet you and expressed a real hope that the European Union will develop not only as a union of States and economies, but will also become a real union of the peoples who live in the European Union and that the European Union will devote more attention not only to the economic aspects but also to such spheres as human rights."
"In conclusion I would like to wish for effective cooperation for us all, for the good of our common Europe."
"Mr President, yesterday, 3 May, when the European Union was celebrating its enlargement, the people of Poland were honouring the Most Blessed Virgin Mary as Queen of Poland."
"She is also Queen of Europe and of the whole world."
"We are bound to respond appropriately to this special protection granted to us."
"Please accept this gift from the people of Poland."
"It is our most precious treasure, the Cross of Christ."
"May this Cross be a source of strength for us."
"Only by seeking inspiration in the Cross can Europe rise above chaos and moral degradation."
"Mr President, I shall now speak to you as Pat Cox, the father of a Catholic family."
"Like the Holy Father, you have been awarded the Charlemagne Prize."
"I am sure you are familiar with the teachings of John Paul II and aware of his concern for the spiritual unity of a Christian Europe."
"We are today seeking a way to find peace and a way to combat terrorism."
"We long for justice and progress."
"The Holy Father himself, Europe’s first citizen, the champion of the true union of Europe, is constantly reminding us that Europe needs God."
"It needs God’s laws and God’s constitution."
"Only then shall we overcome all manner of afflictions, injustices, and terrorism."
"We cannot hope to overcome terrorism as long as we condone those dreadful acts of terrorism committed secretly every day."
"I refer to the killing of the most innocent of victims, namely children conceived in their mothers’ wombs."
"If Europe rejects God’s laws, it will also reject the rights of nations and the rights of families."
"It will reject human rights, including the most important of them all, the right to life."
"Mr President, I am confident you will make arrangements for this cross to be hung in a place of honour in this Parliament."
"The cross stands for love triumphant."
"A cross must be hung in Strasbourg, and another in Brussels."
"Do not allow yourself to be deterred, Mr President! You must have the courage of your convictions!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate shows the diversity of this Europe of ours, which is one of its strengths."
"It will certainly take us several years to take the diversity in our enlarged European and develop from it the common political approach we once had."
"I want to make it clear that we must take the time to do so."
"If we are to be able to ensure Europe’s long-term effectiveness, it is certain that all our institutions will have to undergo a period of consolidation."
"There is a whole range of issues to be discussed."
"Where Europe was already effective, it must of course remain so, in order that we may be successful in facing the challenge of globalisation and actively work on economic cooperation and in establishing a common framework."
"We must, though, ensure that Europe becomes effective where it has not been before."
"This is true also of foreign and security policy, where Europe still has much to do over the coming years."
"I hope that we will, together, succeed in this."
"We will then have to give very serious attention to the question of what, in this European Union of ours, holds us together."
"Is it no more than a free trade area?"
"Is it only the common currency and common market?"
"For me, that would be too little."
"Europe is founded upon a shared history and culture, upon values that bind us, and the Member States – now numbering 25 – together."
"It follows that, rather than just talking about cooperation with our neighbours, we must come up with new approaches in order to actually do so where such close cooperation is desirable."
"Where the European Union is concerned, there are only two options: being a full member or not being a member at all."
"That is true when it comes to our new neighbours in the East, it also – of course – applies to Turkey, and it is the case with regard to other areas in our neighbourhood, like – if I may make this clear for once – the whole of the Mediterranean."
"That is the challenge we have to set ourselves."
"Where there are new challenges, let us find new responses to them, and let us consolidate what we have achieved in such a way that we may start the twenty-first century well."
"– Madam President, I wonder how one of our Members managed to get up on the Presidential rostrum, an act that strikes me as utterly out of place in the course of our work, and done with the purpose of attaching a religious emblem that is incompatible with the EU’s motto of ‘unity in diversity’."
"Such a Christian cross has, obviously, no place as a symbol of our European Parliament, and I hope, Madam President, that no such incident will occur again."
"Thank you, Mrs Berés, your view, together with Mr Tomczak’s, will be forwarded to Parliament’s President."
"Madam President, allow me also to pay my regards and express my thanks to the Irish Presidency."
"The new Europe of 25 has an important future ahead of it: dealing with what is happening around it."
"The scenario is very demanding: in fact, the outer borders will adjoin highly problematic countries, such as Ukraine and Belarus, the latter controlled by a government so authoritarian that it warranted the suspension of all official relations with it; and then there is Russia, a major military power which is having trouble adopting a more democratic institutional shape and above all pacifying Chechnya, agreeing without delay to work on the peace plan proposed by Mr Maskhadov, to which Parliament gave its full backing; and then in the south we have Turkey, now on the eve of negotiations which could see it accede; and there is the Middle East, the Gulf and Maghreb and Mashreq countries."
"In order to address this aspect, Europe must assume credible political characteristics and a coherent strategy: at institutional level, only the Constitution can guarantee progress in this direction; at political level, in the report on the future of enlarged Europe adopted last November, Parliament stressed the need for political dialogue with all its neighbours, warning us against fragmentary, economic actions based exclusively on liberalising markets."
"Political dialogue, establishing common rules, sharing the same values and rights, vision and respect for the point of view of other countries when tackling complex issues, such as immigration: this is the right way forward to avoid the risk of a rift between the Union and its neighbours."
"We must prevent the walls which we have demolished within the Union now being constructed at our new borders."
"Madam President, I should like to express my strong support for the policy of the Commission and the Council on Cyprus."
"It is clear now that the Union must move swiftly to replace the United Nations as the principal force for peace and reconciliation upon that sad, divided island."
"To assist that process, the European Parliament should, as soon as we reassemble, set up a special relationship with the North Cypriot Parliamentary Assembly."
"I should like to request that the Commission and the Council consider supporting appropriate court cases brought by Turkish Cypriots aggrieved that they have been deprived of the franchise for the European Parliamentary elections."
"– Madam President, that the ten new Member States belong to Europe is so manifest that their accession to the European Union ought to have been a formality, as should the accession of all those countries, constituting much of Europe, which are not at present Member States."
"I regard opposition to Turkish accession on religious grounds as unjust, whilst there are others in this House acting as spokesmen for traditionalist Catholicism by opposing women’s rights."
"My rejoicing at the relaxation of the EU’s internal borders would know no bounds were it not for the countervailing reinforcement of the external borders, by which peoples are cut in half."
"The European Union must enforce respect for the rights of all minorities."
"I would rejoice in the enlargement of the European Union were it not for the fact that it bears the marks of a project guided, not by the interests of the peoples, but by the desire to ensure the movement of capital and goods."
"The new Member States have been incorporated as subject countries rather than as equals."
"Their economies are already under the thumb of major industrial and financial conglomerates from Western Europe."
"Having been incorporated into the EU, they are regarded as second-class members, and the debate on a future European Constitution largely revolves around the idea of putting this arrangement on a constitutional footing."
"What is particularly shocking today is that restrictions are imposed upon the rights of people from the ten new Member States – their right to travel, settle and work anywhere within the European Union."
"The aspect of the European project that gives me most hope is that it unites in one body some 200 million European workers, both those in jobs and those currently unemployed."
"I hope that, in the course of time, and above all as a result of social struggles, these workers may come to be aware that their fundamental interests are the same on whatever side of whatever border."
"They will then be able to bring about the social Europe that we are merely talking about today, whereas the Europe of big business is all too real."
"Madam President, I should briefly like to return to a point made, so powerfully and yet with such charm, by my group Chairman, Mrs Frassoni, which was that Turkish Cypriots need to be given the opportunity to take part in the European elections."
"On the assumption that it is listening, I should like the Council’s comments as I take this one step further and ask whether, if the Turkish-Cypriots are unable to vote, you do not think that consideration should be given to leaving unoccupied two of the six Cypriot seats that are specifically intended for defending the interests of the Turkish-Cypriots."
"Secondly, in the discussion about the present enlargement, the question is often asked: 'where do we stop?'"
"Where does Europe end?"
"That is a point for Commissioner Nielson."
"So far, the European Commission has taken a very pragmatic line on this."
"In addition to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, the Balkans have, in principle, been given a 'yes', without a timeframe."
"The Ukraine and Belarus have not received any answer, whether ‘yes’ or ‘no’."
"According to the newspapers, though, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, stated in Dublin last weekend that the book is closed for the Ukraine and Belarus."
"They can never become members of the European Union."
"Is this a change in the Commission's position?"
"Did the Commission establish the European Union's ultimate borders in its spare time this weekend, or is this a misunderstanding?"
"The third point relates to an old discussion, namely whether it is possible both to enlarge and to deepen."
"In other words, how does enlargement affect the chances of establishing a common foreign policy?"
"Some, including some of us, are of the opinion that this is less likely after enlargement, because there are now 25 countries, which reduces the chance of unanimity."
"Others, on the other hand, are pleased, because they want anything but foreign policy."
"As I see it – and I am prepared to uphold this view here – the lesson we learnt in Iraq is that we never want Europe to be so divided again."
"I think that the chances of adopting a European foreign policy have increased, and, contrary to popular belief, I do not expect the new Member States to be Trojan horses."
"In my opinion, it is possible to enlarge and deepen, which means common foreign policy is a possibility, even after enlargement."
"Madam President, on the first of May a new stage in the unification of Old Europe was completed."
"Euro-enthusiasts cried ‘Europe, here we are!’"
"Surely this cannot mean Poland was not previously part of Europe?"
"After all, even when through no will of its own, Poland was part of the system of totalitarian coercion, it was able to generate certain forces within itself."
"These forces triggered the unification of a divided Germany, and went on to build bridges across the entire continent."
"Thus was political unification achieved."
"The only pity is that the economic burden of this process is again being borne by the countries that were once behind the Iron Curtain."
"For Europe to be cohesive, strong, and acceptable to all its citizens, it must accept new values along with new Member States."
"I refer to those values Europe is tending to move away from."
"The equality of citizens, the equality of nations, and a balanced economic development cannot remain mere slogans in the context of a world market that is very rapidly becoming globalised."
"United, we are stronger and wiser."
"Let us rather build ourselves a single one-speed Europe and ensure balanced and stable development."
"Internally, Europe must be modern, but above all it must be competitive in external markets."
"Let us build a Europe that will generate economic growth and reduce the areas affected by poverty."
"Contemporary Europe amounts to a collection of rules, restrictions and regulations."
"These are often harmful to weaker countries that have just made it into the organisation."
"There have also been numerous damaging corruption scandals."
"What is even more regrettable is that Europe seems to lack the determination to resolve them."
"This is a kind of disease."
"If it is not treated in time, it will result in far more serious diseases."
"Now everything depends on us."
"It is up to us to determine whether the enlarged Europe will remain paralysed."
"Alternatively, we could work together to take advantage of our inherent attributes for rapid, joint development."
"It would then be possible to offer even more hope of greatness to the citizens of Europe."
"Madam President, the remark was made on quite a few occasions yesterday that it is only now that the Second World War has properly come to an end."
"As one person put it: it is only now that Hitler and Stalin have finally been conquered by Walesa and Havel."
"Freedom, respect and tolerance have conquered the forces of totalitarianism."
"That is what makes the step taken today so significant, not mainly for ourselves who are active now, but for those who will follow us."
"In contrast, rather, to Commissioner Verheugen, whose efforts we all have every reason to be grateful for today, I should like to state that it was precisely this state of affairs that the fathers of the EU wanted to achieve: the Europe without borders, in which we no longer talk about East and West as a political dividing line."
"On a day such as today, it is important that we should not construct new borders, but be open not only to the possibility of others too joining, but also to the old Member States’ taking on board some of the new things that enlargement can provide."
"Politicians of a new breed have, as from now, taken their place in this Parliament."
"They are people who, irrespective of their position, have helped to give their peoples freedom and have now led them into a still larger community."
"On the morning after 1 May, I found myself attending mass at a little Catholic church in Tallinn in Estonia where the priest was talking about the hot topic of the day."
"‘We have always asked how we shall benefit if we become Members of the EU and what we should get out of it,’ he said."
"‘A Christian’s first question, however, is not, of course, how do I stand to benefit, but what can I give?’"
"We have a very great deal to learn from what these people have to give who have now taken their places among us and whose values and ideas not even the very worst weapons of Soviet power could overcome."
"I can only hope that the rest of us will listen, learn and be receptive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo what other speakers have already said, that Europe is indeed experiencing a historic moment."
"For the first time in the history of our continent, twenty-five countries and nationalities are sitting together round the table and are beginning to work together."
"I would like to thank all those, in the Commission, in the Council and here in Parliament, who have contributed to this success."
"This enlargement does not, however, signify the end of the enlargement process in Europe."
"I understand how important it is for the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to have a clear vision, how important it is to have foresight and how important it is to have a plan that these countries and nations can follow."
"It is for this reason that I welcome the year 2007 regarding Romania and Bulgaria, which is a realistic date for these countries."
"I also welcome what we have heard about Croatia, which in the course of recent months and years has made substantial progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, especially the criteria that we have discussed here, such as human and civil rights, political democracy and a functioning market economy."
"It is very important these nations and countries have programmes for the future that they are able to follow and that will contribute to the further success of the unified European continent."
"We should not, however, forget other Balkan countries during this process, namely Serbia, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Whilst it may take these nations and countries longer than the Romanians, Bulgarians and Croats, I think the doors to the European Union should be open for them."
"In conclusion, I should like to give an answer, if I may, to my fellow Member regarding the conduct of new Members in the process of establishing the Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I am convinced that these countries will conduct themselves responsibly and that they will contribute to implementing policies that will enable Europe to play its role in the world."
"–Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words about the enlargement of the European Union and about the relations with our new neighbours."
"This, the fifth enlargement of the European Union is, historically speaking, certainly one of the greatest challenges faced by the whole of Europe."
"Since 1 May we can say that there is no longer any reason to speak of a divided Europe, but of one united large European family, which must act according to common perceptions and rules."
"For this we also need the European Union’s Constitutional Treaty."
"Hopefully the drafting of the treaty will already be completed in June, since only then can we continue as the world’s most dynamic economic and political union."
"Enlargement has also given the European Union many new neighbours."
"Estonia, having spent many long years in the Soviet Union against its will, as a member of the European Union now has Russia as its direct neighbour, followed by Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova further to the south."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for having been given the opportunity to spend a year as an observer in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, one of whose priorities is relations with the European Union’s neighbouring countries, and I would like to continue working in this committee."
"As a liberal, I wish to continue to support the European Union’s commitment to promote the development of democracy and press freedom in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and particularly in Russia."
"Estonia is a good example to them of the transition to a European country."
"Our experiences are necessary for the creation of a new and democratic Europe."
"Our investment in the development of our new neighbours is essential, since the existence of democratic neighbours is a complimentary security guarantee for the European Union itself, and fruitful mutual cooperation is a foundation for the future."
"I therefore await with interest the new development strategy for the European Union’s neighbourhood policy due to be drafted shortly."
"– Madam President, I believe that enlargement should mainly be a procedure of resetting and renewing the objective of a Europe of democracy, solidarity and peace."
"The question of Cyprus, a new Member State of the Union but with the political problem unresolved, is a typical example of the achievement of this objective."
"The European Union, while respecting the results of the referendum and implementing the Act of Accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, needs to step up its efforts in order for there to be a solution in the form of reunification of the island and reconciliation of the two communities, a solution in the form of a twin-community, twin-zone federation, without foreign troops and permanent referees."
"First, such a solution will prove that the dynamism of the European Union is not restricted solely to personifying the expectations of the European nations for a better future, but that it also constitutes a framework for the resolution of differences, which can guarantee the application of international law and, at the same time, respect for the human and democratic rights of its people."
"Secondly, let us not forget that the resolution of the Cyprus question will contribute to the security and stability of and peace in the wider area of the Middle East, which is suffering acutely following the military invasion by the United States of Iraq and the continuing policy of Sharon, who refuses to respect the rights of the Palestinian people."
"Madam President, the Polish Parliament stipulated that the Republic of Poland’s entry into the European Union should be subject to the fulfilment of four conditions."
"It is important to recall this today, because in politics there is nothing worse than delusion and ignorance."
"The conditions were as follows."
"First, that the Christian values that fashioned Poland and Europe, be recognised by the Union and included in the preamble to the treaty being drafted."
"Second, that voting in the Council of the Union be according to the Nice system, and not on the basis of a double majority."
"Third, that Poland shall not recognise any decisions of the tribunals and courts of the Union with respect to possible German claims."
"Those who are advancing such claims should remember that war reparations owing to Poland have not yet been paid off, and that Poland may not be prepared to overlook the fact."
"An executioner should not be seen as a victim or vice-versa."
"Fourth, that Polish companies, like German companies from the former eastern zone, should be able to benefit from State aid."
"A further basic condition must be added."
"Poland will never give precedence to Union law over our constitution."
"We shall not surrender the sovereignty of our national law."
"Poland overcame occupation by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia."
"Through its fight for independence, Poland paved the way to freedom for the peoples of Europe."
"Thanks to its faith in God and thanks …"
"… values of the alliance we shall never surrender, in the meantime, the Union to …"
"Madam President, Commissioner, in this House, time flies by irretrievably."
"We must prepare our European home for the accession of so many new countries."
"After all, not everything is ready, not even in our own backyards."
"Having focused too much on what they have to do, we must now deepen Europe, while, at the same time, we must formulate a clear answer for the other countries."
"We know that by 2007, another two countries will join us, but Turkey is a candidate as well."
"Today, however, we cannot claim that Turkey is ready to open negotiations."
"It is clear that the Copenhagen criteria are not being met, whether in the practice of the law courts or that of care for minorities."
"The Kurds, in particular, are complaining that, despite changes in legislation, they cannot discern any real improvements to the day-to-day situation, and, following a trial that was a mockery of justice, Leyla Zana is once again locked up together with her elected parliamentarian colleagues."
"This is a clear illustration that Turkey is not ready. We would therefore like to urge Turkey to conform to the Copenhagen criteria and inform us of its own accord when it is ready."
"In anticipation of this, we want to put our own House in order with, as I hope, the new countries by our side."
"I should like to express my thanks and gratitude to you that Hungary has been able to become an integral part of the European Union."
"I express my thanks and gratitude to my own region too, to Ajka, in the County of Veszprém, that here today, in Parliament, I can talk to you in the language of my native country."
"This morning, during the Constitutional discussions, one Member of this House said that constitutional cooperation meant force."
"We know another type of expression for libertinism, which, for us, represented 45 years of isolation and the Iron Curtain."
"That is why we believe in cooperation."
"We must not just limit ourselves to cooperation relating to the environmental and health effects of cross-border sustainable development, but I can assure you that even in such cases we will be quite decisive."
"As a result of the Trianon Treaty, Hungary lost two-thirds of its land and one-third of its population and its minorities now live beyond its borders."
"That is why it is very important for Hungary that Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia should join and that the capabilities of the Ukraine and Serbia should be increased."
"It is very important for Hungary that the demographic deficit itself is eliminated in every region as soon as possible."
"The examples are too fresh of situations where minorities are in the majority at regional level, yet are still unable to exercise their autonomous rights."
"The examples of cases where minorities are deprived of their rights to vote and to be elected on the basis of various legally fabricated reasons are too fresh."
"The soon to be introduced Constitution will provide a further guarantee that the ruling powers will never have the chance, even in theory, to repeat this dreadful period of the twentieth century."
"Madam President, cooperation between the Europe of 25 with the neighbouring countries to the east, such as the Ukraine, and to the south, such as North Africa, should not in the first place be about EU membership, but about stability and security pacts, whereby the control of borders and border regions should be central."
"At the same time, it is necessary for the enlarged Europe to put its own house in order."
"In this Europe, there is too much neo-liberalism and too little in the way of social dialogue, social security and employment."
"In this Europe, there is too much backroom politics and too little public-political debate."
"In this Europe, there is too much red tape and too little discretion shown in working practices."
"A more social, more democratic and more selective Europe means a strong Europe with a Constitution."
"Consequently, that Europe, with the self-assurance of the citizens behind it, could give its backing to stability and security pacts with the new neighbours."
"If we focus only on further cooperation with our new neighbours without completing the work we have to do on ourselves, we will disrupt society and democracy within the Europe of 25 and make of it a project lacking electoral support."
"Only if the citizens of the 25 feel stronger and more secure in themselves, will we, the Europe of 25, be able to be good neighbours."
"Stability and security pacts entail not only fair trade zones, human rights programmes and knowledge exchange programmes, but also cooperation agreements in order to closely monitor our external borders and regions with regard to terrorism, the trafficking in women and crime."
"Such stability and security pacts should not, however, be at the expense of Europe's worldwide contribution to the fight against poverty and to ending conflicts."
"Quite the reverse: we, including the new Members, should contribute more."
"That is also in keeping with Europe's social model – both internal and external."
"Incidentally, I take the view that Europe should withdraw from Iraq until such time as the UN has actually taken over the mandate."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by welcoming our 162 new MEPs to the European Parliament."
"I am convinced that there will be many exciting debates in this new Parliament, even though I myself shall not be participating because I am now, after two terms of office, leaving the European Parliament."
"Many have said that this is an historic enlargement, as of course it is."
"It must, however, be followed by further historic enlargements."
"We must not stop here."
"We must be open to a cooperation that does not set any geographical limits."
"It must also be possible for every country that wishes to do so and that fulfils the stated requirements to become a Member of the EU."
"I also welcome the negotiations with Turkey, even though I am aware that Turkey still has a huge amount of work to do in the matter of, for example, democracy."
"The new, enlarged EU must take upon itself the arduous task of genuinely becoming a functioning Union for all citizens."
"The objectives must be a secure future, human dignity, work, health and a sound environment to hand on to the next generation."
"We must be tolerant, and we must be good neighbours."
"I am therefore very proud that the Swedish Parliament voted against a proposal for transitional rules governing the labour force from the new EU countries."
"I am proud that, from the beginning, my party – the party of the environment – absolutely rejected transitional rules in any form."
"Such rules only cause offence and put a damper on the joy of having good neighbours."
"That is something that also emerged extremely clearly from Lech Walesa’s speech yesterday."
"To obtain respect, there must also be a readiness to respect others."
"Madam President, it was a privilege for me over the past three legislative periods, from the liberation of eastern Europe to the accession of the new Member States, to take part in the accession process as policy coordinator for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and, initially, also as strategy rapporteur."
"It involved letting the Union be what the peoples who were once so oppressed hoped it was: a federation of democratic constitutional states contributing to international peace."
"The acceding states expected to come home to a community of values, one that also fulfils their deepest desires."
"We are not primarily a market: ‘It's not the economy, stupid!’"
"The Council is possibly less bothered by it, but we, as representatives of the European citizens, insist that not the bureaucratic or power-political arguments carry the weight, but the political-moral arguments."
"I would echo the Commissioner's words about Turkey and the need to give political criteria priority over the more technical policy problems."
"I noticed recently that this Turkish Government increasingly understands and appreciates this."
"In the same way, political values should also be given priority where Romania is concerned."
"I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will not disregard Parliament's warning and carry on business as usual."
"The accession of the ten is a very festive event, marred only by the off-key note of the Cypriot referendum, on the basis of which, quite remarkably, the no-voters are being rewarded with two seats taken from the yes-voters."
"In fact, I wonder whether that is indeed the intention and whether something will yet be done about this."
"This shows how much we need to continue to insist on the sustainability of the political changes before a candidate becomes a member."
"A crucial factor in this context is the way in which the Members of this Parliament view their term in office."
"We are European representatives of the people, elected in different countries."
"That means that we stand up for general European well-being, in accordance with the old biblical duty that we should not only look after our own interests, but also that of others."
"In that light, I hope that Europe is becoming increasingly Christian."
"The mood of solidarity creates the confidence that is essential to us, and on which the EU's future will depend."
"– Madam President, first I should like to thank everyone who contributed towards the integration of the Republic of Cyprus into the European Union and to say that Cyprus, which has battled and fought hard for freedom, justice and, above all, solidarity between peoples, is becoming a member of the European Union, which has these as its principles and objective."
"Cyprus has a great deal to gain from the European Union but, at the same time, vice versa, it can also give quite a lot to the European Union, with its contribution and the role which it has to play with its civilisation, culture and geopolitical position, which can be the bridge between the European Union and the Middle East."
"Our integration into the European Union is the achievement of one of the major objectives which we set, but this does not mean for us that we shall rest."
"Our next objective is to resolve the Cyprus question, an objective which, unfortunately, we were unable to achieve prior to integration."
"We shall make every effort, as quickly as possible, to achieve it."
"Our desire is to reunite our country."
"The democratic decision by the Greek Cypriots does not express a wish not to resolve our problem."
"The result of the referendum was a reaction to a specific plan."
"As regards the so-called embargo mentioned earlier for the Turkish Cypriots, and which never existed on the Greek Cypriot side, we believe that our Turkish Cypriot fellow countrymen, who for us are equally European Citizens, with all the rights which derive from the integration of Cyprus into the European Union, certainly need to be strengthened economically."
"This has also been proven by the Turkish Government, with support measures which it itself announced a year ago and again recently at the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Luxembourg."
"Naturally, this will need to be done without there being the slightest risk of recognition of another state within the European Union itself."
"Our objective is to resolve the Cyprus question as quickly as possible, so that the entire Cypriot people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, can again celebrate together the integration of a united Cyprus into the European Union and the reunification of our homeland."
"– Madam President, I had the wonderful opportunity to share in celebrating the historic event of enlargement and our neighbours’ joy on Frankfurt’s ."
"It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, above all because the event had been preceded by a long process involving a great deal of work on both sides."
"The winners can celebrate, but there are losers too, and they have already been mentioned."
"One important group who have lost out are the Turkish Cypriots, who voted in favour of Europe."
"Another is made up of the people on both sides of the new external border, regions with which I am familiar in my capacity as Vice-Chairman for relations with Ukraine, Moldavia and Belarus."
"I am disappointed that the Commission is again rolling back its neighbourhood concept, and that it is not addressing the problems of people on the borders where they are."
"To the practical problems of border regions, it has geopolitical solutions, and that is the wrong way to deal with them."
"What bothers people, what they are afraid of, is the new Schengen border, the new frontier and the prospect of again being out in the cold."
"If you were to travel to these regions, that would be your experience too."
"For real change to happen in our neighbourhood concept, I am relying very much on the cooperation of our fellow-Members from Poland and Slovakia and our counterparts in Ukraine and the other neighbouring countries."
"In working with our neighbours, we need to open borders and bring regions together, facilitating retail trade and economic development, or else the interior will also die."
"For years, that has been our experience in Germany’s border regions, and so I urge the Commission to rethink its concept and ensure that the idea of Europe as a project for peace is communicated to the new border regions too, and the door is not shut on them, but rather that we take further what Parliament has proposed, which is an open-door policy, involving practical action to deal with people’s problems where they actually are."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to convey the grateful thanks of the entire political world, as a representative of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus, and of its entire people for your positive contribution, so that my country could become part of enlarged Europe."
"We assure you today that we shall repay it with the positive role of our contribution and our consistency towards what we call a Europe of all the peoples, a strong, powerful Europe, a Europe of prosperity, security and stability."
"Cyprus today forms the south-easternmost edge of the European Union and the crossroads of the three continents."
"Cyprus has and can play a role for the European Union and can act as the gateway to these three continents and, at the same time, the point of peace, stability and prosperity in the entire area."
"Our people believed in European values and the European vision, they believed in everything that today governs the European Union, and one important reason why they took this particular decision, which was not a decision not to resolve the Cyprus question, was because principles and values which have to do with the guarantee and the security of the island could not create this feeling in the people themselves."
"They could not create this feeling, if you think – and you must understand us – that our people, in their course through history, were only without an occupying army, without foreign troops, without suffering invasion and abuse of their human rights, from 1960 to 1974."
"I believe today that Cyprus can constitute a major positive challenge for Europe, a positive challenge in which it will be able to prove and gainsay all those who think that it is only a commercial and financial union, proving that it is also a political union."
"Today I convey to you the historic will of our people to achieve a solution to our problem, in a place where equal rights for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are already being applied, and I assure you of this."
"– Madam President, yesterday, when we welcomed Members from the ten new Member States, many speakers spoke in terms of the dream of the unification of the continent of Europe coming true."
"For one of the Member States, Cyprus, it has not done so."
"Even today, Cyprus is divided by a wall, by barbed wire, and by minefields."
"I have had the pleasure of joining our Cypriot friends in celebrating their accession, and I have come back from Cyprus with more optimism than I had before I went."
"Even though part of the island has rejected the Annan plan, I am still convinced that the Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, can live together and want to do so."
"They are a single, sovereign and indivisible people, and where there is a will there is a way."
"That way goes via renewed dialogue between the communities under the auspices of the European Union."
"One possible reason why the referendum in the Republic of Cyprus failed may be that the voters felt themselves rushed and that too little time was allowed for explanations; that being so, it was monopolised by nationalist slogans."
"What matters now is that the Cypriots should move on to an in-depth debate on their future together."
"This, Madam President, Commissioner, is my last speech in the European Parliament, and so I issue an urgent appeal to the Commission and the Council, that they should put behind them the legitimate disappointment aroused by the rejection of the Annan plan, but, Commissioner, we must not sit around idly."
"As from today, the reunification of Cyprus is a European problem, and so we must again seize the initiative."
"– Madam President, today, having celebrated the completion of enlargement, it is right that this House should also sketch, for the benefit of those who are to be elected here, some of the outlines that will have to determine the EU’s foreign policy commitments and underpin our own commitment during the campaign for the coming European elections."
"You will be aware how perturbed some of our neighbours and friends on the other side of the Mediterranean are today at the prospect of our Union devoting excessive energy and resources to the realisation of its new internal unity, to the detriment of the interest it should have in their own future."
"I am sure that Jean Monnet, whose memory we honoured this morning, and whose humanism was leavened by pragmatism, would not have failed to notice that a continued contribution to the development of our Southern neighbours was not only Europe’s duty, but also in its interest and in the interests of generations yet to come, on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"Along with Mr Cohn-Bendit, I had the privilege of presenting, two years ago, an own-initiative report on the privileged partnership that the European Union and the Arab Maghreb Union had agreed to establish."
"A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join with a large number of Members of this House in the inaugural session of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Athens."
"It is my hope that, when Parliament reassembles, many of those of us in whom their electors put their trust will continue to work with determination to extend to North Africa, to the Middle East and to the whole of the continent of Africa, the area of peace and stability that our forebears were able to establish on both banks of the Rhine 60 years ago."
"To do so is not only Europe’s vocation, but also in its interests."
"On 1 May, when celebrations marking EU expansion were taking place throughout the whole of Europe, Lithuania also celebrated the Day of Workers’ Solidarity."
"To the people of the new member countries EU membership means more social justice, more civilized working conditions, and better salaries."
"We must not create a new Iron Curtain, fencing ourselves off from our new neighbours, the Ukraine, Moldova and, of course, Russia, countries which are actually old neighbours as far as the new Member States are concerned."
"Let us not take away those countries’ hopes that one day they will themselves become members of the European Union."
"Belarus must not be left beyond the neighbourhood’s boundaries."
"Lithuania, which has a five hundred and fifty kilometre external border with this State, is very concerned that economic reforms and democratic change should take place in this country."
"If nothing is done in this State, however, then everything will carry on as before for many years to come."
"Some of the new member countries have already lived with their neighbours in one union."
"We understand the mentality and customs of our neighbours and are ready to help export the values of the European Union to our new neighbours."
"– Ladies and gentlemen."
"Thank you for your congratulations, but the celebrations are over and we in Latvia are used to working in a businesslike way, without illusions."
"There is much talk here of how the Second World War has come to an end."
"I would like only to remind you here that it is not over for everyone and especially not for our neighbours."
"Between the Baltic and the Black Sea we have, first of all, the Belarussians, Ukrainians, Moldovans and Georgians as our neighbours."
"We congratulate the Romanians, who will be in the European Union in a couple of years, but why not the Moldovans?"
"Only because the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact allowed Soviet forces to occupy part of Romania and because these forces remained in Moldova and refused to withdraw."
"We are forced to watch, we are doing something and we in the Baltic States will not be content to watch television in comfort as mothers in Moldova are forced to trade in their own kidneys to feed their starving children."
"Will the Black Sea be a black hole where the drug and arms traders' crossroads meet, or will we be able to change this situation?"
"Belarus is completely terrorised by the communists."
"In Georgia Russian forces are refusing to withdraw and are supporting separatists."
"What is the situation in our neighbouring country, Russia?"
"It has been best described by the former member of the Duma and noted businessman, Konstantin Borovoy."
"He says that KGB men are currently in charge in Russia, which is almost the same as if Gestapo men were in power in Germany and were saying that everything is much improved and changed."
"Friendship with the West is a sham and the provocations in the Baltic countries will continue, to be used as a bargaining chip in a deal with the West on the issue of Chechnya."
"Madam President, that is a precise description of what our neighbours in a neighbouring State have been given by a member of the State Duma."
"As long as we are aware that some countries are continuing to profit from the results of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, we will, of course, be able to do something."
"In conclusion, before we dream about the European Union's borders with Iraq, let us put our closer neighbours in order."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many people tend to refer to certain events, in which they participate as they are happening, as historic or unique, because that is how they appraise the period in question."
"As time goes by, however, developments themselves, history itself, finalises things, and events are placed in their real proportion when developments themselves confirm them or cancel them."
"I believe, however, that history will not gainsay us and will confirm the political and historic values of this promising step of recent enlargement by Europe."
"Often we debate the future in terms of ideologies which have either collapsed or are outdated, resulting in our engaging in useless nostalgia."
"United Europe, however, must be constructed on the basis of a forward-looking perception, with positive prospects, supported on principles of humanitarianism, freedom, diversity, pluralism and peace."
"A few years ago, our current partners were our neighbours, with all the peculiarities and the historic and political burden of a different era."
"Today we are acquiring new neighbours, with a positive perception, with an expectation of hope towards the European Union on the part of citizens and politicians alike."
"The integration of the ten countries into the Union does not mean that all the individual problems have automatically been resolved."
"There are mild problems, cross-border problems, minority problems and so on, but they have all launched their solutions within the favourable environment."
"These ten countries bring great potential."
"The Baltic States and the former central and eastern European countries to the other Europe, Malta to Africa and the Mediterranean and Cyprus to the eastern Mediterranean and beyond."
"In a few years' time we expect Bulgaria, Romania and, later, Croatia."
"The same applies to Turkey which, I hope, will quickly adapt to what are European values."
"As for our beloved, long-suffering Cyprus, the green and golden leaf tossed into the sea, the island of Aphrodite, we all welcome it, as I do, as a Greek."
"I hope, as does everyone else who supported the Annan plan, as does the European Parliament, that it will help to bring about positive developments for the reunification of the island."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for Lithuania, welcome!"
"The same to Malta, for which I acted as shadow rapporteur."
"Welcome to you all, all ten of you."
"Once again, as a Greek, welcome dear Cyprus."
"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my joy at the current enlargement."
"I wish our Community peace, stability, prosperity and a good quality of life."
"God bless our joint work."
"I would now like to return to the subject of our debate."
"The EU changed its neighbours and its external borders overnight."
"This transformation also represents a challenge to produce a new, well thought out integration project, which will be an extension of the current project, at the end of which Europe will be reunited within its geographical and cultural borders."
"For our new neighbours the prospect of integration represents the same dream as we had ourselves."
"Our joint task is to help these countries to fulfil their dream."
"I know from the experience of my own country how the prospect of the European Union membership can be a driving force for carrying out necessary reforms that would otherwise require fierce political determination."
"The European Union is already showing an interest in extending the enlargement process, and new emphasis in the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy should reflect this."
"Not only are there new neighbours, but the character of the neighbourhood is also changing."
"Information technology, rapid transport systems and trade have given the neighbourhood a new dimension."
"In this respect, our common interest also concerns the countries of the developing world."
"We can use the extra energy that was released following the latest enlargement for a new spirit of cooperation with those countries."
"In order for this cooperation to be successful, we must overcome the divergence of policy tools in the area of external relations and ensure that they are simplified and harmonised."
"This will make the new neighbourhood complete."
"– Madam President, I believe that we must, even today, begin to deal actively with the issues that came to the fore on 1 May."
"For Europe, new members mean new borders and new neighbours."
"Among these new countries bordering on Europe for the first time, we find again, after a break of 15 years, a totalitarian country, Belarus, and also Ukraine, where democratic and economic reforms have unfortunately stalled."
"Next come Moldova and the Transcaucasian republics – all of them are countries with latent conflicts but which have temporarily managed to halt their civil wars."
"Russia, whose problems we already know, I shall pass over here, since Russia has already been the European Union’s neighbour for nine years."
"However, as Gary Titley has remarked, she is now in our midst."
"These countries are all possible conduits of migration; and nobody monitors the people entering their territories."
"Some of these countries are on the verge of ecological disaster."
"We can predict that the yawning economic, social, legal and political gulf between the European Union and our new neighbours will continue to widen."
"The gap is already clearly visible, but in a few years it will have grown significantly."
"We know what this means, and, believe me, it will become a significantly more important issue than that of the transition period for the free movement of workers."
"Some here have spoken of the historical and cultural borders of Europe."
"I warn against it."
"Eight years ago, in his book, Samuel Huntington drew the border of Europe; this border almost exactly matches the border of today’s enlarged European Union – a thought provoking circumstance."
"We must not allow such a theoretical geopolitical conception to become a material and political reality."
"If we do nothing, Huntington’s Europe will, however, come true."
"We have a choice to make:"
"either we direct significantly more political attention and financial resources to these countries, which is of course very expensive,"
"or,"
"we build a new effective, but un-European and inhumane wall, a great wall of Europe between itself and its new neighbours."
"In this case Europe’s eastern border will soon resemble the US–Mexico border, together with all the similar problems."
"Paradoxically this wall will be located in the same countries that 15 years ago suffered due to the wall on their western border."
"A secure Europe must deal with the issues of its neighbours."
"It is up to us to decide whether we do so via segregation or assistance."
"– Madam President, the European Union is beginning a new stage in its history."
"The greatest enlargement in 47 years has been completed."
"The EU’s population is rising to half a billion people, and one of the biggest single markets in the world is coming into being."
"This is a source of hope, above all to young people, who have no first-hand experience or knowledge of the Second World War or of the Cold War that followed it."
"They are so used to peace that they do not see the peace policy dimension of this enlargement as the most important thing about it."
"Nevertheless, this is probably the most important thing associated with what happened on 1 May – the enlargement, or, as one might say, the reunification of Europe."
"What we now have to do is to work towards partnership with our immediate and more distant neighbours and make the best possible use of it in the interests of all parties."
"It is important that a Europe that is still grappling with its own constitution should work together to further the common interest and think in regional terms."
"Only together will we be able to cope with the challenges that the enlarged Union will face."
"Only together will we be able to resolve the problem of illegal immigration and win the war on organised crime."
"In this, investment in securing the EU’s new external borders is every bit as important as the use of resources for scrapping dangerous nuclear power stations."
"The European Union now needs time to let enlargement become a success."
"It is logical that the next stage should involve Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia – the last of which would be very desirable as a new Member State."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, it is time that we appealed to the Council to ask the Commission to add to its report on the political criteria – which has not yet been produced – a study of the potential impact on the Structural and Agricultural Policies and on the EU’s institutions."
"Madam President, in an interview in in 1992, the then President of the European Commission, Mr Delors, said that we should not forget that in the year 2000 we shall be more than 12, maybe a little more than 20."
"There is a country that one forgets but it is very important as a symbol: Malta."
"We must not displace Europe too much towards the north whilst forgetting the south."
"That would risk losing our sensitivity to the Mediterranean world, which is our world."
"And we should contemplate the dangers in the future for all of us."
"Mr Delors' statement made 12 years ago is still pertinent today insofar as the Mediterranean confronts dangers that face us all."
"It is about this Mediterranean world, in particular its southern and eastern perimeter, that I would like to share my thoughts with this assembly today."
"I believe it is an accepted fact that a major cause of strife in the Middle East is that so far no solution has been found to the Israeli-Palestinian issue."
"For the Arab world Palestine is not just another issue affecting some Arabs."
"It is an issue affecting an Arab people."
"Through the centuries we have witnessed, and sometimes caused, the sufferings of the people of Israel."
"It would be a major political mistake on our part were we to ignore this reality, but it would be equally tragic if we were not also to bear in mind the plight of the Palestinian people living as refugees in their own country, walled up in their own territory."
"The European Union has a shared responsibility to bringing about in the region the change from an economy of strife to an economy of peace."
"It is here that strong political and diplomatic presence in the Middle East on the part of the European Union can give positive results to our neighbourhood policy."
"By promoting peace, prosperity and stability in the region, the European Union will not only be contributing to the welfare and security of the region but also to its own security."
"Insofar as North Africa is concerned, things are moving ahead."
"The Libya which is now emerging can be a very positive element for the central Mediterranean."
"Relations between the EU and the Maghreb are also slowly but surely moving ahead positively."
"The Agadir Agreement can be a fundamental link, bringing us closer to our joint objective of a Euro-Med free-trade area by the year 2010."
"However, in the Mediterranean we are facing an important choice and the necessity of taking certain decisions."
"There are some who look at the future and see the region as an area where a clash of civilisations is bound to take place."
"Indeed, some may be moving towards self-fulfilling prophecies."
"The choice, if it can be called choice, is between a policy leading to a clash of civilisations and one promoting a dialogue of civilisations."
"We cannot afford to have in the Mediterranean a great divide between the north and south."
"It would be geographically unnatural; it would economically harmful; it would be politically disastrous."
"If we are to realise peace in the Mediterranean we need to start thinking Mediterranean."
"For if this Mediterranean of ours is to overcome its present divisive element, we have to build on our commonalities: common interests, common concerns, a common heritage."
"It is the new Mediterranean where the EU can contribute towards removing those dangers for the future of us all."
". Madam President, my first remark is to Mrs Frassoni, who asked about the decision taken by the Council on 26 April to earmark money for Northern Cyprus."
"This was a political decision made by the Council."
"The Commission will work out how to clarify it."
"In terms of the kind of decision-making involved here, this is how outstanding commitments come about."
"We have had enormous problems with outstanding commitments that have accumulated in our general external aid."
"A lot of that has historically reflected these kinds of manifestation-driven decisions that have not been based on more specific and better prepared work."
"Please bear in mind that the fastest possible tender for anything – and we have to put everything out to tender – takes at least six months."
"And that is when we have reached a point where we actually have something concrete to put out to tender!"
"There is a lot of work to be done before we reach that stage."
"Parliament must understand that there is some way to go, and that the decision was more of a political signal than something that immediately translates into specific actions."
"It is not fair that this Commission, or our successors in the next Commission, should continue to be under the same kind of pressure that we have felt thus far."
"The Council decision will be respected."
"Many Members addressed the broader global perspective of an enlarged Europe."
"It is not Europe that has been enlarged, but the European Union: that is an important distinction."
"I am confident that what we do in the global perspective will not in any way be weakened by enlargement."
"It will in fact be strengthened."
"Mr Lagendijk asked whether, in the light of the lessons we learned last year regarding Iraq, we should have a common foreign and security policy."
"He said that we must hope that the new Member States will not act as a Trojan horse."
"I have strong views on this."
"With regard to deepening or expanding the Union, please keep in mind that the Luxembourg Agreement reinstating the veto in the Community was decided in 1966, many years before the first wave of enlargement took place."
"It would be nice if the 'old' Member States could show some humility now and then."
"It is also interesting to note that CFSP will not really mean 'common foreign and security policy' as long as it is totally off-limits to discuss, within the framework of our foreign policy cooperation, what two of the Member States of this Union are doing in the UN Security Council."
"In many ways, the 'C' in CFSP still only means 'convenient'."
"This is where we are."
"I do not approve of using this moment of celebration as an opportunity to forget these fundamental realities."
"The challenge is still there."
"Some Members referred to the Treaty being negotiated and discussed as a way forward on these issues."
"I would warn against unrealistic expectations."
"There is in what is now being discussed that creates a new situation in relation to what we are addressing here."
"Europe cannot have a High Representative based on the lowest common denominator, and the whole architecture of our foreign policy is still defined by the lowest common denominator."
"In relation to ensuring that the European public understands what cooperation is all about, one of my biggest worries is that we often create confusion by characterising what we have in an unrealistic manner."
"That said, the debate today has been positive."
"Mr Lagendijk also mentioned Mr Prodi's recent remarks on Russia and Ukraine."
"There are no new messages for me to give you on this."
"The notion of the European neighbourhood policy is exactly what we need."
"If I disagreed with a Member while listening to the debate, it was for the most part because those concerned were jumping to conclusions."
"This is not what we should do."
"This new neighbourhood policy is simply borne out of a need to create a strategic, positively-defined neighbourhood, keeping our options open and organising everything over the long term."
"Continual enlargement will never be a sustainable answer to the question of how to live with Europe's neighbours."
"It is thus wise to have created and launched this concept; it serves Europe and our new neighbours well."
"The debate is closed."
". Madam President, to paraphrase words first uttered 500 years ago now spirits have awakened, and life has again become a pleasure."
"I recall these words today, first, to infuse optimism into those who are reluctant to rejoice in enlargement, and second, in order to draw attention to the need to create a new social order."
"Like a table, this order must have at least three legs."
"It needs an economic leg and a political leg."
"It also needs a cultural leg which must be equally strong."
"Without it, no table will stand, not even a round table like the one we sat round in Poland in the past."
"This is the conclusion I bring to integration based on Poland’s latest experiences."
"When I refer to culture, I have in mind all areas of human self-realisation."
"I am thinking of the theatre, school, office; stadiums, an honest market, along with Parliament, and the Polish parliament in particular."
"The Renaissance, Baroque, Enlightenment, Romanticism, and now Postmodernism are all bidding to be involved in the creation of the order I mentioned."
"Many artists, writers, and intellectuals also wish to be involved."
"They want to bring their creativity to bear on the political creation of a European identity."
"This will take years to accomplish."
"It is an exceedingly difficult task, particularly as regards ensuring the security of the culture of a multilingual Europe."
"Today we are debating difficulties related to partnership with our neighbours."
"I can identify a range of aspects of the relationship with our eastern neighbours."
"There is warm friendship and cold acquisitive greed."
"There is also mutual fascination and ethnic animosity, which poisons the intelligentsia."
"I have personal experience of all these, and so do many millions of the citizens of Central Europe."
"We know all about destruction and establishing new borders that are an affront to logic, morality, and dignity."
". – The next item is the Commission statement on the European economic and social model."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to express my joy that enlargement is now a reality."
"I am happy that, at this unique historic moment for the European Union, I am being given an opportunity to debate with you, the representatives of 450 million people and of a union of markets, economies, peoples and societies, the two basic foundations on which the European Union is based: the economic and the social model."
"The European economic model concerns the unification of markets and economies and the coordination of economic policies."
"The European social model is designed to secure a high level of social protection, education and social dialogue, based on good economic performance."
"These two models are two sides of the same coin."
"They represent the two characteristics which distinguish the European Union from other areas in the world."
"In addition, they have helped not only to secure entire decades of increased prosperity for all citizens, but also to consolidate peace and friendship between the peoples of Europe."
"As far as the European economic model is concerned, the Treaty makes provision for the application of an economic policy based on close coordination of the economic policies of the Member States."
"Economies with a great degree of unification and interdependence which share a common market and have a common currency need efficient coordination of economic policy if they are to benefit from them."
"That is why the European Union has drawn up a detailed framework for economic policy."
"Within this framework, the expression 'coordination of economic policy' is used as a general term, which covers an entire spectrum of interactions between policy-making factors, at both national level and European Union level."
"The methods used include exchanging information, discussing best practices, engaging in policy-making dialogue, drafting jointly agreed rules and policy objectives and taking jointly decided action."
"The uniqueness of the coordinating framework in Economic and Monetary Union lies in the fact that an independent, supranational European Central Bank has undertaken to exercise a single monetary policy, while responsibility for economic, financial and structural policies remains decentralised in the hands of the national authorities, but subject to joint rules."
"The European Central Bank decides monetary policy on the basis of developments noted in the eurozone as a whole and therefore has the facility to deal in the best possible way with any important crises which may affect the common currency zone."
"By contrast, the national governments each have the facility to apply their own economic policy based on the specific problems and crises which each individual country faces within, of course, the limits of joint rules."
"Many of the constituent components of the economic coordinating framework are closely linked to the general Lisbon strategy, a strategy of structural reforms with economic, social and environmental dimensions."
"The framework of economic policy gives the national policy of each country a noteworthy degree of autonomy in important sectors and reflects the application of the principle of subsidiarity, which is based on strong economic and political logic."
"In certain specific sectors, such as the single market, competition policy and financial deficits, the application of joint rules and provision for reliable measures to ensure they are adhered to are required."
"In other sectors, such as the size and composition of government spending, structural policies and social welfare benefits, there are no strong arguments for requiring that competence for exercising policy be transferred to supranational level."
"The decentralisation of policy-making procedures gives the national authorities the necessary room for manoeuvre, allowing them both to apply policies in keeping with national economic structures and preferences and to adapt to the economic developments noted in each individual country."
"It also provides the facility to safeguard the beneficial results of competition policy."
"Macroeconomic coordination in the eurozone is generally based on dialogue and agreement."
"It aims to maintain a healthy and stable macroeconomic framework and to optimise the policy mix at short-term level to address cyclical developments."
"Its main objective is to ensure that economic growth comes up to its real potential."
"The results of structural policies in the partner countries and the joint benefits provided by Economic and Monetary Union may not be perceived quite as easily as the consequences of macroeconomic policies."
"Nonetheless, it is clear that the existence of efficient and flexible markets is of decisive importance to increasing the potential for growth and to safeguarding the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union."
"In order to avoid distortions and safeguard the smooth functioning of the internal market, structural policies which have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market and competition are subject to stronger forms of coordination."
"Now, what constitutes the European social model?"
"The conclusions of the European Council in Barcelona describe it as a model based on good economic performance, a high level of social protection and education and social dialogue."
"Thus, the European social model supports the parallel development of economic and social prosperity and is based on the interdependence between economic efficiency and social progress."
"Despite the differences which exist between our individual national systems, this particular European social model, which European social policies strengthen in a bid to consolidate the economic power of Europe, really does exist."
"The European social model, in the various forms in which it appears in the Union, has played a vital role, contributing to the constant increase in productivity and uninterrupted improvement in the social level in the whole of the Union, while at the same time ensuring that the benefits are as widespread as possible."
"Nonetheless, in order to improve its efficiency, this model needs to be updated."
"The social partners play a very important role from this point of view."
"The reform is also facilitated by cooperation at European level, which is happening today with issues such as employment, social integration and the reform of pension systems."
"The Social Policy Agenda plays a most important role in the updating of the European social model."
"It has as its reference point the strategic objective of Lisbon, according to which Europe needs to seek to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"This clearly reflects the perception that the Lisbon objective was a single strategic objective and not three juxtaposed aims."
"Thus, it is clear that securing more and better jobs or promoting social cohesion are elements which can support competitiveness and improve economic performance."
"The inclusion of competitiveness at the World Economic Forum, at which European countries such as Finland, Sweden and Denmark clearly have leading positions, clearly emphasises the vital importance of this interaction."
"The success of the Social Policy Agenda depends on numerous factors and this constitutes an important advantage, because it broadens the range of agencies involved in implementing the Agenda and, in this way, strengthens the commitment to update the European social model."
"The social partners play a crucial role from this point of view."
"Social policies are not therefore simply the only result of good economic performance; they are, at the same time, a factor which makes an essential contribution to economic growth."
"Updating the social model means developing and adapting it, so that account is taken of the fast changes taking place in the social economy."
"Finally, I should like to point out that economic prosperity depends on efficient competition between businesses and social progress depends on solidarity between citizens."
"Both these factors have contributed to the success of Europe."
"Competition without solidarity would result in the law of the jungle."
"Solidarity without competition would lead to stagnation."
"That is why the European model is based on the market economy, which recognises the rights of workers and social dialogue."
"In conjunction, therefore, with highly developed social systems, it provides the possibility to carry out the necessary structural changes in the economies of our societies in such a way as to avoid conflict and safeguard social stability."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has been a turning-point in Europe’s history, and we have experienced it at first hand."
"Enlargement took place against a backdrop of uncertainties about the international situation, security problems, and problems with the preservation of social and environmental models common to us all."
"All of these are urgent issues that we must address."
"Although enlargement has a political vocation, it must also be a source of impetus and growth."
"We all want the EU to prosper for the sake of its 450 million consumers; we all want a dynamic EU, one founded upon solidarity."
"If we are to have one, we must do everything possible to encourage sustainable growth through performance and competitiveness, which presupposes action on several different fronts."
"It presupposes that we sustain and promote our successful businesses, our centres of excellence and develop our high-tech industries."
"It presupposes that we step up our investment effort, for when the European Union has a euro in hand, that euro must not merely be spent; it must be invested in order to encourage innovation, develop research, maintain our SMEs, and encourage businesses to be handed on."
"It presupposes that the euro should be accompanied by better coordination of economic and social policies, for there is a real need in Europe for economic governance in permanent dialogue with the Central Bank, and also that we review the Stability and Growth Pact, which must be tougher than 3% in periods of growth, but also slightly more flexible when the economy slows down."
"The Europe that we want must not be guided by economic interests alone, but also by values of social progress and full employment."
"If we are to restore Europe’s credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens, we have to make it a social Europe with more of a dimension of solidarity."
"The European model that we want to build is founded upon values of humanism, liberty and solidarity, which solidarity is the result of economic growth, ensuring a satisfactory level of pensions, the protection of the weakest, promotion of the rights of workers and of the family."
"If asked to sum up in one word my view of the social Europe, I would say it was the Europe of employment."
"– Madam President, there is no single European social model."
"The social security systems of our twenty-five states were forged at different stages of history, and resulted from very different social struggles involving trade unionists and politicians."
"There is, however, a sort of European social exception: the general awareness among our peoples that the economy must serve the well-being of society and of the environment."
"The market, although indispensable, deals only with supply and demand at one given time."
"It cannot predict the future or prepare strategic choices for balanced development."
"That is still the noblest task of politics."
"It was on our continent that social policy and the Welfare State were invented."
"Having shaped our respective lifestyles, social policy will determine our future."
"This Europe of ours must be social or it will perish."
"The citizens of our twenty-five countries will identify themselves with Europe only when, and in so far as, the EU manages to demonstrate in practical ways its ability to improve living conditions for every citizen."
"Future enlargements will be possible only if Europe makes every individual more prosperous."
"At present, the public have doubts about the future; let me quote what Jacques Delors had to say on the subject: ‘When times are hard (...) there is a tangible decline in confidence in the European project’."
"Europe’s ambitions cannot be bounded by the great market or by free trade alone."
"The siren song of the liberals promises us more freedom and more material comfort by way of deregulation or liberalisation in which no holds are barred."
"Yes, it is sometimes necessary to break companies’ shackles, to break up monopolies and secure incomes, but the end-product of deregulation – if it does not give way to better rules – is the law of the jungle."
"New freedoms must go hand in hand with equal opportunities, and be rounded off by unfailing solidarity with the weakest members of our societies."
"European and economic policy cannot be limited to prudent monetary policy and the monitoring of Budget deficits."
"Let me forcibly reiterate that we Socialists regard stability as a public good, one that must be defended in the interests of the poorest in society."
"Without growth, however, stability leads to a social desert."
"Europe must back up its ambitions with Budget resources, giving priority to future expenditure."
"Investment in human capital, in research, and in infrastructure, will create the conditions for the public’s aspirations to be met, with the right to work, to health, to housing, to be comfortably off and to enjoy a decent retirement."
"Let me remind you of Jacques Delors’ celebrated three-pronged approach: ‘Competition to stimulate, cooperation to strengthen, and solidarity to unite’!"
"‘’ was the keyword that at last demolished the Iron Curtain and made the political unification of Europe possible."
"Solidarity should still be the guiding principle for this our Europe; solidarity at home in order to promote a social Europe, but also solidarity with those beyond our borders."
"Europe must be in the front line fighting for true globalisation, which is socially, environmentally and economically inclusive, in that it does not leave by the wayside billions of people living across two-thirds of the planet."
"Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, how do we turn enlargement into an economic and social success?"
"We shall do so by equipping the new Europe for international competition in the way you talked about, Mr Dimas."
"We shall do so by releasing initiative and energy, by continuing the work on creating an internal market involving free competition, by guaranteeing an internal market for financial services so that businesses have adequate and cheap capital to work with and by guaranteeing that, through free competition, consumers and taxpayers are supplied with a diverse range of products and services of high quality at reasonable prices."
"The lesson to be learned from the bitter experience of Communism’s command economy was, of course, that economic and political freedom belong together."
"Those of us in the new Europe must not, therefore, be afraid of economic freedom."
"We must not be afraid of private enterprise and free competition."
"These concepts are not a threat, but the key to economic prosperity."
"My experience is that those in our new Member States have felt rather offended at the unwillingness to give the labour force from the new countries freedom of movement from the beginning."
"Indeed, even those countries that, like my own, are, from day one, opening the borders to workers from the new Member States have introduced monitoring of the labour market and restrictions on access to social benefits."
"My Baltic and Polish friends wonder what kind of opinion we have of them."
"I have to admit, moreover, that delight at the fall of the Berlin Wall and EU enlargement has turned too quickly into anxiety about the changes that may follow in their wake."
"We have forgotten too quickly that many people from the new Member States did in fact leave behind rich and secure lives in the West in order to travel back to economic uncertainty and develop their countries."
"Too often, we forget our experience of previous enlargements involving poorer countries, which have of course produced good results."
"Moreover, we attach too little importance to the many advantages we may derive from sharing the workload among us."
"Rapid economic growth and the dynamic in the new Member States will act as a breath of fresh air for the economies of the old Member States."
"We must help to create that growth, partly through grants from the regional funds for developing the countries’ internal structures."
"EU aid of up to four per cent of gross domestic product per year is a large amount for the new Member States, but a modest amount for the existing ones."
"There is some justification for putting a question mark over whether it will be at all possible to use the large transfers at the rate we should like to do."
"These are matters we shall work on: simpler administration and greater opportunities for having the money used as intended."
"We must be ambitious and pin more of our hopes on training and research so that we develop the new Europe in accordance with the guidelines and objectives laid down in the Lisbon process. As the Commissioner pointed out, we must also do a lot of work on developing the social dialogue."
"It will be a difficult task, but I believe that, if we support, for example, the work being done through the agencies in Bilbao, Thessaloniki and Dublin, we shall have a good opportunity to take this process forward."
"– Madam President, we all rejoice in welcoming the peoples of the ten new Member States of the European Union."
"Enlargement brings the hope of peace, cooperation and valuable exchanges between peoples."
"Nevertheless, we must not deceive ourselves about the problems that confront us."
"In the countries that have just joined us, average gross domestic product per capita is equal to only 45% of the average in the Fifteen."
"In order to be considered, these countries have had to drastically restructure their economies."
"They were required to implement the liberal model, introducing market mechanisms with competition as their sole model, which was to the detriment of a social policy founded on solidarity and economic cooperation."
"At no time was the Commission willing to take into account the grave economic and social consequences of this headlong rush."
"The Europe that these countries have joined is, however, beset by crises."
"The Lisbon strategy, launched in 2000 with the aim of securing full employment and a very high level of competitiveness, has failed to achieve that."
"For the first time in ten years, the Commission has admitted that employment is falling and, like the Council, is worrying about how serious the movement towards de-industrialisation is."
"It has enacted one directive after another, opening up postal services, energy and air and rail transport to competition, while refusing to carry out any sort of serious review of how this might affect jobs, the environment and prices."
"At the Barcelona European Council, the Heads of State or Government decided by common agreement to defer the retirement age, but there is, all the same, an unsustainable contradiction between trumpeting the priority to be given to jobs and speeding up the introduction of more flexible working practices, cutting wage costs while allowing gigantic industrial mergers and restructuring to go ahead."
"Imprisoned by the thinking of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability Pact, the Council and the Commission are refusing to face up to their consequences."
"This adds up to a heavy burden for the peoples."
"We are a long way from the objectives of the Treaty of Rome and its avowed intention to promote improved living and working conditions for the workforce, enabling them to have equal access to progress."
"The struggle for jobs and against social exclusion, for better purchasing power and working conditions, to maintain and extend the rights of businesses’ workers, must become the European Union’s first practical priority, although defence and the improvement of public services must not be forgotten."
"This will require a profound change in the EU’s economic and monetary policies, which are guided solely by the demands of the financial markets and rules of competition that stifle any industrial strategy."
"The objectives of the European Central Bank must be redrafted to include job-creating investments and industrial projects."
"Giving the European project a new direction will mean abandoning dogmatism and accepting the need to reflect on other options and discuss them."
"No employment strategy can be crowned with success unless workers really are given the power to intervene to suspend planned redundancies, and to halt the mergers in progress."
"Any merger agreement must include social clauses."
"There must be penalties for failure to abide by directives on the consultation of workers."
"Finally, Madam President, Europe, as a source of hope, calls out for that which is best in each people to be shared and pooled."
"The intervention of workers and citizens will be indispensable in building tomorrow’s Europe."
"That is the Europe we are to build."
"What my group has done over the past five years has been a demanding labour, and many of the fields are still open."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the euphoria that has erupted in this House, which I also detect among the leading European politicians, is understandable, but I do, of course, ask myself if the people feel such enthusiasm too."
"Without a doubt, Europe is an unprecedented success story, and I will just mention the key words ‘peacekeeping’ and a ‘place of trade’."
"Europe evolved as an economic area and, above all, in the hope of creating peaceful cooperation in Europe after 50 years of war."
"Today we face what may be our next major challenge, in that we are in a position where we are too small as individual nations to be able to position ourselves in a globalised world, but we become strong enough when we come together."
"All that will, however, only count if we are capable of creating an awareness of Europe in the minds of 450 million Europeans, and this Parliament, too, is called upon to do so."
"I doubt that it is there at the moment and we will see how big the turnout is in the European elections."
"We need a constitution, we need a common foreign policy, but the Europe of the regions too must not be lost as a value."
"As a Community of shared values we must, of course, export values as well as goods."
"Only when we, in Europe, are capable of winning back the leading role in the fields in which we were strong, above all, in the area of knowledge, will we have the credibility to also export values such as overall quality of life, peacekeeping and sustainability as a basis for responsible policies."
"During recent decades, though, we have encouraged people to be aware of what they are entitled to, and this will not help Europe grow; at best, it will increase unemployment, poverty and corruption."
"This is why I believe that we as individuals, the regions, the Member States and the EU as a whole, must have higher expectations of ourselves; not of the Community, the State or the EU, but rather each part should have higher expectations of itself."
"This is because what matters is not just stressing what we have achieved, but instead focusing, above all, on what we intend to do, which is a good deal more."
"That alone that will make us strong."
"Looking at the half emptybenches one can conclude that many of us are still under the influence of the exciting events of enlargement, but work must continue."
"The greatest round of enlargement to have taken place in the European Union’s history has provoked extensive debates about the need to reform the European Union, with the most significant manifestation of these efforts being the preparation and discussion of the draft European Union Constitution."
"There is less thought and talk as to how the socio-economic effects of European Union enlargement can be turned into a success for the fifteen-member European Union, as well as the New States."
"The European Union has been joined by countries with fundamentally different levels of economic, and consequently also social, development."
"This means that enlargement demands a new understanding of ways to ensure the socio-economic growth of the European Union."
"I will remind you that the common market of the European Union was created with the aim of promoting the competitiveness of its members and is based on four fundamental freedoms."
"Almost all the 15 Member States of the European Union, excepting the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, the latter with an admirable parliamentary vote against what the government was offering, have introduced a transitional period for the free movement of workers from the new Member States."
"Shortly before the time when the basis for the remaining three came into force, there were ever more forceful voices talking about tax dumping, unfair tax competition, speaking about the need for tax harmonisation, even though the European Convention had recently rejected this idea."
"There are fears about the possible movement of capital towards the new Member States, to be followed by a possible transfer of jobs in an eastward direction."
"Economists will never cease debating the right level of taxation."
"As far as I know, up to now only Austria has reacted appropriately to the possible flight of jobs, by planning to lower its corporate tax level."
"Ireland's taxation policy has made it especially attractive to investment from multinational companies (as an example)."
"In my opinion the decisions by Sweden, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Austria show a healthy approach to the challenges presented by European Union enlargement."
"Only in this way will the expansion of the European Union unleash unique opportunities for the unification of Europe and more quickly resolve the stresses of domestic policy in the Member States."
"We must look at things realistically – the support for the New States from the European Union's common funds, which I value very highly, no matter how well targeted and endowed with no matter how much of a multiplying effect, is insufficient to rapidly overcome the existing socio-economic differences between the existing Member States."
"The enlargement of the European Union ..."
"Madam President, when, between 10 and 13 June, European Parliament elections are held in the 25 Member States, a dream will come true."
"According to the opinion-formers, these elections will pass judgment on the policies of governments in office, rather than on those of the European Parliament."
"It is evident that no direct connection is made between the situation in the Member States and the policies we adopt here."
"In the run-up to the elections, there is a website in the Netherlands entitled ‘geenwoorden.nl’."
"Rather than words, after all, the voter wants to see action and find out whether the parties and MEPs have delivered on their election promises."
"The citizen is entitled to a government which honours its promises and which translates good intentions into proper policy."
"If I extend this parallel to the Commission, it appears that today's declaration is once again full of good intentions and wishes, and once again I cannot shake off the impression that these will not be taken any further."
"Over the past months, I have, at various times during debates on economic policy, drawn attention to the stranded Lisbon process."
"This process is well and truly stuck because the Member States are waiting for each other to implement the measures."
"The Member States are themselves responsible for implementation, and you will appreciate that with 25 Member States, a few countries should take the lead."
"We in this House do not need to sit back and watch passively; we can define the Lisbon objectives in our resolutions more effectively."
"We will then attain achievable objectives, and you will see that achievable objectives can be implemented."
"It is high time we focused on European socio-economic policy."
"The Member States should implement that policy and we must monitor the implementation of the agreements reached."
"In that way, the elections may not be about settling scores, but instead about giving a mandate."
"Madam President, Members of this House have been entrusted with a great responsibility."
"We are responsible for the citizens of the European Union, for their prosperity and their welfare."
"Entry into the European Union on equal terms is an expression of historical justice."
"These were the words of the Holy Father John Paul II, the supreme authority in this world."
"Robert Schuman, a great statesman and patriot, shared these views."
"They inspired the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and the EEC."
"The aim was to create peace in Europe and in the world, as well as prosperity for the people."
"What, though, is the reality?"
"There exists a bipolar Europe: a Europe of the rich, and a Europe of the poor."
"A different outlook on the economy is required."
"We must immediately move away from the worst versions of neoliberal policy and globalisation."
"The solution is not a free-market economy, but a social market economy in keeping with the social teachings of various religious groupings."
"It is wrong for a country’s population to be divided into a small group of rich citizens and a large group of poor ones."
"We are opposed to wealth creation at the expense of the poor."
"We advocate involving the rich in assisting the poor."
"We must commit to the economic development of all of Europe through the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and job creation."
"Only then shall we effectively eradicate poverty and unemployment, the plagues of the twentieth century."
"Only then shall we take the economic lead over the USA and Asian countries such as China and Japan."
"We should have no reservations about working jointly with Russia and Ukraine."
"Poland entered the Union on demeaning, unequal terms."
"The Polish negotiators are to blame for this."
"They proclaimed a great success, while the truth is different."
"Production is decreasing."
"Production quotas and production limits are putting us back by 24 years in the production of tobacco, for example."
"The figure for sheep farming is 35 years."
"For milk production it is 52 years, and for steel production 34."
"We shall call those responsible to account in the future and make them take responsibility for their actions."
"From a country exporting foodstuffs and steel, Poland has become an importer."
"Self-Defence is calling for renegotiation of the Association Agreement."
"The only way to eradicate poverty and unemployment is to exploit the productive capacity of our industry and agriculture to the full."
"The European Union must return to the highest values."
"It must put the individual, the family, work, and a dignified life first"
"in order not to lead to social revolution."
"The alter anti-globalists are right."
"Having first dealt with extremism, we must work together to find a way out of this situation."
"The European Union and Poland both need Self-Defence."
"– Mr Lepper, I have to cut off your microphone."
"I very much regret that."
"Let me remind you that speakers who do not have the speaking time that they would wish may submit in writing the speech they would have liked to give."
"This document will be made available to them to publicise as a speech made in the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Europeans, a little more than 20 years ago, the European Parliament passed a declaration that condemned the occupation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union and demanded our freedom."
"Today, we are at last all together in this room as free nations and free European citizens, to decide jointly the future of our continent."
"I am deeply moved that, in this historic session of the European Parliament, the first plenary session since enlargement, I have the opportunity to speak to you in my mother tongue."
"Enforced divisions are thus at an end; Europe is one again."
"Presumably it is this historical perspective that enables new Member States to see the European Union, not just as a common market, but as something more: a common home based on common values and perceptions."
"Today there is no longer an old Europe and a new Europe; just one Europe – our common home."
"It is for this reason that here and today we must ask, not, ‘What can Europe do for us?’ but, ‘What can we do for Europe?’"
"This is even more important in the light of the fact that Europe’s economic and social situation cannot be considered to be rosy. We must face up to facts."
"Europe’s development has slowed significantly during the last decade. Although the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are in every way correct, we have to admit that, following its adoption, the gap in competitiveness between Europe and the United States has widened rather than narrowed."
"With this in mind, some have mockingly alluded to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s promise to overtake America in ten years, which ended in his country falling even further behind."
"I do not want the same fate to befall the Lisbon Strategy."
"To ensure this, the new European Commission, together with the Parliament, must act decisively to find the means to force the governments of the Member States that have reacted coolly to the reforms to implement them."
"I very much hope that the European Union’s enlargement will also add impetus to this process."
"Yes, the GDP of the new Member States is lower than that of the older ones."
"Nevertheless, contrary to the view of the earlier speaker, I do not believe that we have joined the European Union in order to live comfortably for the next century from the support coming from wealthier Member States."
"Such an attitude would be immoral and ruinous for both Europe and ourselves."
"Estonia cannot look only to financial gain in Europe."
"Our aim must be clear: to achieve as rapidly as possible – in the case of my homeland, Estonia, I believe that time to be at least 15 years – a standard of living such that we no longer need assistance from wealthier European countries."
"In order to achieve that goal, we have to maintain our high growth rate and liberal economy and not take the route of tax harmonisation, which would be disastrous for Europe."
"I also hope that the accusations levelled at new Member States will not be repeated, since only by growing rapidly and by developing tax competition throughout Europe can we make the whole of Europe more competitive."
"Mr President, I am delighted to have the honour of taking the floor for the first time during a plenary session of the European Parliament now that Poland is a member of the European Union."
"Being among the best is ennobling."
"At the present, Poland has an economic growth rate of 6%."
"Membership of the European Community gives us the chance to consolidate this growth and to accelerate development."
"Pursuant to the Lisbon Strategy, the European Union, is aiming to become the strongest and most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"I believe the Union will achieve this aim."
"Nonetheless, economic competitiveness and the laws of the free market are not sufficient to ensure social progress."
"What is necessary is sustainable development combining economic effectiveness with the principles of social justice and environmental protection."
"The individual should be the subject of all economic processes, and the markets must serve the people, not vice-versa."
"This approach will ensure all citizens benefit from the results of European integration."
"It will lead to the creation of a society without barriers or divisions."
"Sustainable development of the countries of the European Union also involves the development of its regions and the consolidation of local government."
"Priority must be given to the allocation of funds from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to investments creating new jobs, and to investment in education, science and new technologies."
"I believe that promoting economic competitiveness while respecting the principles of sustainable development will help to improve quality of life for all Europeans."
"This is, after all, the goal of our common endeavour."
"We can achieve far more if we work together."
"– Mr President, the fact that we are able to talk today in terms of a European economic and social model is something we owe above all to the self-employed and to microfirms."
"Six years ago, in 1997, Eurostat’s figures told us that the Europe of the Fifteen was home to 18 802 423 businesses, 18 million of which were microfirms."
"Of these 18 million, half consisted of one person working alone, whilst the other half – some 8.5-9 million – consisted of businesses employing between one and nine persons."
"It follows that the importance of these microfirms must be borne in mind by those who will be legislating for the Europe of the future, and all the more so on a day when we are celebrating enlargement by the accession of new Member States."
"Legislation must be adapted to them, must take account of their specific characteristics, of the small size of such microfirms and we must, each and every one of us, consider these self-employed workers, these members of the liberal professions, these traders, these artisans, artists, and farmers as all being brave people, who maintain Europe’s human face through the personal services that they provide, and that is important in an increasingly globalised and ever more high-tech Europe."
"I also invite all those who will be sharing in the drafting of future European legislation to adapt it to the specific needs of small enterprises whose energies must be devoted to productivity."
"Let every one of them bear in mind that no business started out big and that today’s start-ups are destined to be the medium-sized and big businesses of tomorrow."
"It is economic wealth that makes it possible for this Europe that is so dear to us to provide a high standard of social protection."
"It is thus that we will have successful businesses and also be able to guarantee the social Europe."
"Mr President, those of us in Parliament, and in European society, who want a political Europe and who welcome the new Member States, those who want a Constitution that will take the EU forward as a political entity that is united in its diversity are in the vast majority."
"Let us learn from this historic experience, which is unique in the world today, on a continent that, as recently as last century, suffered unspeakably tragic events."
"Stateless nations, such as mine, Galicia, are still not recognised as such in the draft Constitution."
"Given that what we want is a political Europe, a Europe of the peoples and the citizens, we shall continue to struggle for such recognition and for self-determination within the EU."
"Whilst we want a political Europe, Mr President, it must be said that this will not exist without a social Europe, which must be made a reality as a matter of urgency, by integrating our fellow peoples that have a per capita income of less than 40% of that in the Union of the Fifteen."
"Against this backdrop, it is paradoxical and irresponsible that the richest States, which claim that they want a political Europe, are attempting to impose a reduced European Union budget as low as 1% of Gross National Income. This is despite the fact that, with enlargement, the number of inhabitants of regions eligible for Objective 1 (whose income is less than 75% of the average per capita) is set to double; to put it more clearly, this figure is set to jump from 63 million people at present to 153 million in the coming years."
"Similarly, nothing will be resolved if the budget is limited to the 1.14% proposed by the Commission."
"If we continue this way, we will not be moving towards a social Europe."
"Funding per capita for Objective 1 regions will be halved, thereby blocking a cohesion policy that has benefited and defined the entire Union."
"This will have a negative effect on both the Union of the Fifteen and on the enlarged Union of Twenty-Seven."
"Mr President, enlargement of the European Union finally took place a few days ago."
"Enlargement poses new challenges with respect to how the Union should operate and how joint decisions on its future should be taken."
"Speaking as a representative of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and also as a Pole, I would like to make it quite clear that I am a strong advocate of the concept of a Europe of the nations."
"Such a Europe would draw strength from the diversity and richness of all its regions."
"It would be a Europe of solidarity."
"There is no doubt that one of the most urgent challenges facing the Community is work on eradication of the economic differences that arose within our continent as a result of the settlements at the Yalta conference."
"These settlements were imposed on Poland by force."
"We therefore now have every moral right to demand substantial support for development."
"Currently, the standard of living in all the Polish voivodships falls below 75% of the European Union average."
"Some of them barely reach 35% of the Union average."
"The Swietokrzyskie voivodship is one such example."
"This means the Union’s policy of aid for poorer regions must be one of the most important issues in the coming years."
"In the course of the debate on the European Union’s budget it should become clear whether the old Member States are prepared to give priority to the principle of solidarity over and above their immediate local economic interests."
"I have the honour to address the European Parliament today on behalf of the Malopolskie and Swietokrzyskie District."
"I am delighted to be instrumental in ensuring that its voice can be heard in this House, where all the nations of Europe are represented."
"The south of Poland is famous for being thrifty and hard-working. I am therefore convinced that the people of our region will cope and succeed in the new European Union."
"Our success, however, the success of these two areas, will require solidarity from you, the representatives of the richer part of Europe."
"We need help to develop our infrastructure."
"The south of Poland must have better communication links with the rest of Europe."
"We need support for the sound and painless restructuring of our agriculture."
"Finally, we need programmes enabling the young people of the Malopolskie and Swietokrzyskie voivodships to take full advantage of educational opportunities in the enlarged European Union."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite you to Krakow, one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and the capital of our region."
"Its glorious history, architecture, and the remarkable character of its people create a unique atmosphere. Millions of foreign visitors come and enjoy it every year."
"Mr President, it is a joy and an honour for me to appear in the European Parliament as one of the representatives of the Slovak Republic and also to thank all of you who have been instrumental in enlarging the European Union."
"From an economic point of view, however, the new Member States became part of the European Union long before 1 May 2004."
"In 1990, shortly after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of the Cold War, the countries of the ‘Eastern bloc’ had a balance of trade surplus with the advanced Western countries of some USD 10 billion."
"Over the subsequent years, this indicator was turned totally upside down and, in 2002, the countries of the former Eastern bloc had a balance of trade deficit with the advanced Western countries of around USD 40 billion."
"This occurred because the advanced Western countries took advantage of their superior competitive position to break into the markets opening up in the eastern countries with an annual increase in their economic potential of about USD 50 billion."
"This factor was one of the sources for economic growth in the advanced Western countries in the 1990s."
"Today, we are witnessing the enlargement of the European Union."
"The existing Member States are on the one hand putting on a friendly face towards the new Member States, but on the other hand several Member States have imposed restrictions on the free movement of workers with respect to the new Member States."
"I also consider, given these circumstances, discussion on reducing Member States’ contributions to the European Union budget to be not altogether appropriate."
"If there are doubts about the destination of these resources or the way in which they are expended and used, it is time to look for a more effective model for the operation of the entire mechanism for the distribution of EU resources and not to weaken financially the system of regional and structural solidarity, which could be one of the sources for future economic growth in the EU."
"And so, ladies and gentlemen, I should like quietly but insistently to urge you to make sensible decisions which will not disappoint the fragile expectations of the citizens of the new Member States following accession to the EU."
"Mr President, we must safeguard the European economic and social model."
"We hear this from all quarters more than ever, certainly now that Europe is reunified and many people still feel somewhat ill at ease in our big House."
"The public appreciates the socio-ecologically corrected free-market economy."
"They know that competitiveness and solidarity are key concepts in this connection, and realise that the Lisbon process must be perpetuated and strengthened."
"I should like to make a plea for the little ones not to be overlooked in our future socio-economic policy."
"We must continue to work on a better entrepreneurial climate, in which more people feel inclined to set up a business and also have the opportunities to do so."
"We should in any case pay more attention to SMEs, because two-thirds of employment and added value are created by them."
"Why not, Commissioner, include a specific SME Commissioner in the next Commission with a horizontal competence and who, on that basis, would work with the different Commissioners in a matrix model in each of the vertical fields of competence?"
"Finally, I think we should closely examine the proposal for the internal market directive and fine-tune it where necessary, to avoid having to throw away the baby with the bath water in the social sphere."
"I should like to say the following by way of conclusion. We are now reunited; there are 25 of us and together we will keep going."
"The ten new countries that have joined us have demonstrated to us that it is possible to make structural changes and that it is necessary to dare stick to one's guns in order to achieve the long-term goals of peace, prosperity and a good social climate."
"Let the journey they have travelled serve as an example to us and let us continue focusing on keeping the balance in Europe between the needs of a smoothly-running market and the wishes of the public."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is the right time to look at our economic policy from a broader viewpoint, to look squarely at the past of the Europe of the fifteen and at the future of the Europe of the twenty-five."
"The first basic point which needs to be made is that the European Union does not have a legal basis for a common – truly common – economic policy, because the Union does not have the competence to make, it only has the competence to coordinate the economic policy of the Member States."
"This fragmentation of economic policy is not something which can yield results under the conditions of globalisation in which we live today."
"The second point is that we need a bigger strategic initiative, capable of activating the powers of the European economy."
"The third point is that, apart from a bigger strategic initiative, the European economy also needs a bigger strategic objective."
"The accession of the ten new Member States gives us the opportunity for a bigger initiative, capable of inspiring our efforts."
"The economies of eastern Europe can become the dynamo of the new European economy; all it needs is for us, old Europe, to find the courage and the inspiration to imitate the United States of America and mark the end of the cold war with a sort of Marshall plan for eastern Europe, as the USA did at the end of the Second World War."
"As regards the big objective, it was given to us in the draft of the new European Constitution, which, for the first time in the history of the Treaties, included full employment in the basic Article 3 as one of the objective aims of the Union, at the same time rejecting the call by the European Central Bank for equal treatment of the objective of price stability."
"This latter point is important and we must keep to it, but it is not more important, it is never more important than the objective of full employment, which was an essential element in the old European model and, unfortunately Commissioner, I did not, despite listening to you carefully, hear you mention full employment in your review of the European model. We must restore this model if we are to bring Europe back to the path of its reconstruction."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this enlargement of the European Union is made historic by the attempt to get countries at very different levels of economic development to work together smoothly and effectively."
"Successful completion of that task requires the creation of a sustainable globalisation model that would stop the growth of tensions, disagreements and conflicts that has accompanied the dismantling of former boundaries."
"Within the next five years, all of the European Union institutions, including Parliament, will have to face historic economic policy challenges."
"First, a balanced solution must be found concerning the problem of harmonising competitive conditions for enterprises in countries at different levels of economic development."
"It is evident that countries with lower income levels will not be able to invest as much in social insurance, healthcare, environmental protection and other societal activities as the wealthier countries."
"Lower social taxation, however, gives enterprises a competitive advantage in the short term, and this leads to discontentment among enterprises in countries with higher taxation levels."
"The movement of enterprises to regions with a lower tax burden destabilises developed societies."
"Finding a balance that takes the interests of all the parties equally into account will, even with an in-depth grasp of economic policy and fine political sense, require great efforts in the coming years on the part of the Members of the European Parliament."
"As a second challenge, I would highlight the integration of countries with different levels of development of public infrastructure with the conditions of the European economic and monetary union."
"The new Members who have shrugged off the former planned economy now need to make enormous investments to modernise the infrastructure of education, science, health care, environmental protection, internal security and legal protection."
"The funding of these investments would be possible at the expense of raising the level of taxes without contravening the basic conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, but this would endanger the already low competitive ability of enterprises that are still in the build-up phase."
"Infrastructure investments could be funded by loans, increasing the country’s budget deficit and the national debt, but this would be at odds with the main conditions for the adoption of the single currency."
"This means that if the single currency membership conditions as well as the need for retaining the competitiveness of enterprises are both strictly observed, the necessary development investments cannot be made."
"This in turn would jeopardise the sustainability of development and would equate to living at the expense of the nation's future."
"Strengthening the unity of the European Union …"
"– Mr President, there are many important rooms in our collective European home."
"There are political, economic, cultural, spiritual rooms and also social rooms."
"I am convinced that both the European social and economic model are extremely important, if not crucial, for the cohesion of the European Union."
"The essence of this model could be boiled down to the simple statement that you have brought together both competition and solidarity."
"According to data from research carried out by Pew Global Survey, the views held by both Eastern and Western Europeans, with regard to the market and the social system that should be guaranteed by the state, have a large number of points in common."
"This is why today the citizens of ten new countries, including my country, Slovenia, tend to ask two main questions."
"Are the days of the previous European social and economic model numbered, and will the European social market model survive in the EU of 25 States?"
"My reply is that it will. It must survive."
"Of course it will have to respond to numerous changes, for example negative demographic trends, rising healthcare and pension costs and also a more balanced representation of both sexes in the labour market."
"I would like to mention the contents of a report prepared for the European Commission by a group of experts led by Jacques Sapir, which clearly calls for European Cohesion Funds to be redirected to the accession States."
"In this way they will be available to the people that need them most."
"I am convinced that the EU must offer the accession States the same conditions that were offered to the new members in each previous round of enlargement."
"Up to now, to be frank, the founder members of the European Union have had priority in the distribution of funds."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European workforce is expensive."
"Sometimes this is referred to as a negative aspect, as a factor that hinders competitiveness, yet this is a good thing."
"This provides a decent standard of living for the workforce, for those who are no longer or not yet employed, and for those also who have to be absent from work temporarily."
"Price is, of course, an important factor in competitiveness, but it is only one of the factors, the other one being quality."
"This is why we were happy to see the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 state that the future of the European economic and social system will stand or fall on success or failure in making Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"The key to this, however, is education, training, life-long learning and furthermore, research and development."
"We are now in the year 2004."
"In the research and development race the gap in favour of the United States has opened even wider."
"The harmonisation of the education and training policies of the European states is at a very low level, and the life-long learning concept is not spreading at the speed it should."
"As a result of all this it looks as if the US is coming out of recession, in the Far East the dynamic growth of the economy based on cheap labour is continuing, whilst Europe continues to stagnate."
"The European social system is, therefore, a value that we must maintain, yet the European economy is less and less able to produce the financial resources for this."
"It would not be good for us to remain helpless in the face of this situation, without knowing what to do, but it would be even worse if, despite being able to see the way out, we did very little of what was needed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian nation had a poet with fire in his heart, Sándor Petőfi, who roused the nation to action during the days of the 1848 revolution with these words: ‘Today is the right time, but tomorrow may be too late’."
"In the next five years it will certainly not be the right time for Europe, but perhaps it will not be too late either."
"Let us leave this as a legacy to our successors convening on 19 July: it will depend on their wisdom, determination and ability to cooperate whether the unfavourable processes can be reversed or the European social system will remain just a congenial experiment that is doomed to end in failure because of lack of economic support."
"Mr President, I have the honour of speaking in the European Parliament as one of the first Polish Members and as the first Member representing the Wielkopolska voivodship."
"My fellow Members and I are setting fundamental goals for ourselves in the European Union."
"Our first goal is a sovereign Poland."
"We believe Poland’s sovereignty will be better secured within the European Union than outside it."
"We want a strong and sovereign Poland in a strong Europe."
"Our second goal concerns the economy."
"We are convinced that membership of the European Union gives us an opportunity for economic development that was not available to us outside the Community."
"This is why it is important for the European Union’s economic policy to promote free competition."
"Further, economic policy must be based on solidarity, which is a key principle of the European Union."
"This will give the poorer new Member States an opportunity to develop."
"It is also the reason why we are insisting that the Union’s budget be maintained at the existing level and not be reduced, and it is why we are calling for structural investment in the new Member States."
"I am addressing you as a Pole and as a resident of the Wielkopolska voivodship."
"It was in this area, in Gniezno, that Emperor Otto III and Cardinal Robert, representing Pope Sylvester II, met with the ruler of Poland, Boleslaw the Brave, in the year 1000."
"At the turn of the tenth century they discussed the affairs of Europe in this very area near the grave of St Wojciech."
"Inspired by them we believe that today a happy and peaceful Europe can also only be built in the name of God and Christian tradition."
"The people of Wielkopolska, where I live, have always been renowned for their great enterprise and thrift."
"The citizens of Poznan, Kalisz, Leszno, Pila, Konin, Gniezno, Wrzesnia, Gostyn, Koscian, Rawicz, Ostrow, Kolo, and many other Wielkopolska cities, towns, and villages will do everything in their power to ensure that Poland achieves success."
"We aspire to success for ourselves as well as for the extremely large number of young people in Poland."
"My country has recently recorded the greatest increase in student numbers in Europe."
"Their number has grown six-fold in the last few years."
"It is for the sake of these young Poles that we are striving for a strong Poland in a strong Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers is one of the most important fundamental European rights."
"The possibility for workers to move freely is important for both the employees and businesses alike."
"The free movement of workers ensures competitiveness and the constant growth of the Union at the same time, yet it cannot be detached from the question of social security."
"In terms of the social security network the does not permit discrimination between employees on the basis of their nationality."
"One of the most important objectives of the Union that has now been enlarged to 25 Members is to significantly increase its competitiveness, and by doing so, to keep abreast with its most important challengers, the US and Japan."
"The Lisbon Strategy that was created in 2000 covers this, and this objective must play a key role in the near future in national legislation and also in the European Parliament."
"However, we can only implement the Lisbon Strategy successfully if we significantly increase both the rate of employment and the mobility of the workforce."
"Unfortunately, during the last few months, this quite promising process has run aground, and the voices of those who, on the basis of some irrational fear, want to delay the free movement of workers have become louder."
"We have all seen the labour market surveys that deal with the expected movement of workers from the ten new Member States."
"These data show that barely one per cent of those in active employment expect to find employment in other Member States during the next few years."
"The panic is, therefore, completely unfounded, the new member countries, including Hungary, will of course comply with the provisions of the accession agreement, but rightfully expect that the limitations of the labour market will not be born out of crass prejudice and fear."
"Provisions made in respect of the stability of individual countries must always be based on specific surveys, and the question of the expected migration of workers from the new Member States must be addressed on an individual basis."
"We object on principle to the approach that does not differentiate between the new Member States."
"It is in Europe’s mutual interest to make optimum use of the trained workforce and the strategic advantages offered by the flexibility of the labour market, and on this basis to become the fastest growing region in the world."
"– And now, Mr President, for the social Europe!"
"It is my belief that, if we want this enlargement to still be a real cause for celebration in the years to come, we have to meet our fellow-citizens’ expectations."
"What they ask of us is a social Europe, an economic and social model to be the continuing backbone of our European Union, and jobs for all."
"For that, then, there are three great guiding principles."
"The first is this: where are we going, tomorrow, to create added value in the European Union?"
"The EU will have to reflect on this and on what tomorrow’s jobs will be."
"They will be local jobs."
"They will be jobs that do not exist today, connected with the quality of life, associated with personal services."
"We will also need to be able to gain control of our sources of finance and investment."
"In those Member States that were until very recently called ‘old Europe’ and are now part of the new Europe of twenty-five, there are great fears about relocations."
"As we now know, there is similar fear among the ten countries that have just joined us about the prospect of a brain drain to the West, and even more so, of businesses taking flight, whether westwards or to India or China."
"So this issue of relocations is one that we have to discuss together, as we gain control of our research efforts and denounce national policies aimed at reducing it."
"We also have to put in place real strategies for industrial policy."
"In the 1990s, we were able to do it in the car industry – and it is thus that the European Union still has today six car manufacturers – at a time when everyone thought the industry was doomed by Japanese expansion."
"We have to regain our capacity for strength through unity, or for strength in the Union."
"The second great guiding principle is that of rights."
"There will be no cohesion in Europe, nor will there be a consolidated social and economic model, if goods simply circulate without there being, as we have defined in the Charter, rights for all, which are a matter for the social responsibility of businesses or of an occupational social security scheme."
"Finally, we will need real solidarity around a Budget that it will not be possible to confine, as some would have us do, within the meagre envelope of 1% of GNP."
"There can, however, be no Budget solidarity without fiscal solidarity."
"Mr President, enlargement of the European Union from 15 to 25 Member States is resulting in inevitable changes to its economic, administrative, and social structure."
"The average gross national product per capita is lower."
"Unemployment has risen, and society is becoming more divided."
"The number of poorer persons has increased significantly."
"There is a greater number of less developed regions, and these regions require support from the Union’s budget."
"At the same time, however, there have been some very positive developments."
"Our common market has grown."
"Internal competitiveness has increased, which will strengthen our external competitiveness."
"Structural and economic changes in the ten new Member States are opening up great opportunities for development."
"A so-called baby-boom generation is starting productive adult life in Poland."
"For the most part, these young people are, well educated citizens, prepared for the challenges of a modern economy."
"A younger generation of Europeans, open to innovation and progress, is our greatest asset."
"Social Europe imposes restrictions on economic Europe."
"It reduces the competitiveness of the economy."
"This does not mean, however, that we must dispense with Europe’s social heritage, which is so important for our citizens."
"It need not hamper the search for new tools for development."
"Recently I was asked what associations the European Union has for me, what buildings, monuments, historical events, achievements, it brought to mind."
"I answered that Europe does indeed have great buildings, magnificent monuments, and beautiful chapters of history."
"I said that Europe has wonderful traditions and achievements, but that for me Europe is associated with the values it developed and offers to the world."
"These values are democracy, human rights, and security for the individual, including economic and social security."
"They have to be the fundamental prerequisites and guidelines for the philosophy and development of the European Union."
"As a former trade unionistI would like to sayhow happy we are that the Social Charter has been incorporated into the draft European Constitution, given that this was something that I fought for when I was a member of the European Trade Union Confederation executive."
"I think the fifteen countries should not worry that the ten new countries will prove a financial drain."
"The majority of accession countries know they will have to look after themselves, as the Czech Republic has done."
"If we take the Eastern part of Germany, into which billions of German marks have been poured, and compare it with the Czech Republic, we cannot see a great deal of difference."
"Mr President, I can speak in Spanish."
"As a former union leader, I would like to say that we are pleased that the Social Charter appears in the draft Constitution."
"I believe that the fifteen countries must not be afraid of a lot of money going to the countries that have now become Members, because the majority of the countries will have to help themselves, just as the Czech Republic did."
"If we compare the situation in the eastern part of Germany, which received huge cash injections involving billions of marks, with the situation in our Republic, we will see that they are not so different."
"What should make the fifteen States nervous is the possibility of a social and fiscal dumping zone being created in that area."
"According to many of our liberal policies, our countries will flourish if we turn them into areas of this nature."
"They say that we must maintain the comparative advantages for as long as possible."
"We do not agree."
"We are against dismantling the social State in Europe, because that is what most attracts us to it."
"I would like our fellow Members from the fifteen existing Member States to monitor closely the attacks on unions in recent times, the attacks in Slovakia, where they want to repeal the law on tri-partyism."
"I also believe it will be necessary to ensure that what so often happens does not happen in our countries: the law is included in the Statutes, but is not applied."
"Mr President, I welcomed the urgency today with which, as this parliamentary term draws to a close, the Commissioner returned to the need, which the last speaker mentioned, for defence of the European way of life to be among our prime objectives."
"A liberalist wind, a single school of thought appeared to be attempting to destroy the idea of justice which brings dignity to politics in Europe and in our countries."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner reaffirmed this point."
"In Italy there is a booklet, ‘The Dream and the Choices’, a fine discussion by President Prodi available in bookshops."
"It points out, with regard to this way of life, what the major social democracies, the Christian school of thought in the social doctrine of the Church, have built in our countries, with different political experiences, since the early twentieth century; and indeed today we are different."
"In my opinion, this has to be a prime objective, and in 20 years’ time we will be remembered not just for our history, our Christian roots and the beauty of our cities but also for having created a model of relations between people which is among the most advanced in our history."
"I will end, today in particular, at the end of this parliamentary term, by expressing a concern: the diffusion, precisely with regard to this issue, of a lack of rules, of the insecurity of young peoples’ jobs."
"Of course, we must defend change, but we must be careful not to destroy young peoples’ security."
"I would like to extend my best wishes to the incoming MEPs for their work."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in your speech you mentioned Finland, Sweden and Denmark as examples of this European economic and social model."
"The excellent levels of social welfare in these countries are due very largely to high taxation, and that includes business tax, taxation on capital and income tax."
"This is the way to create viable public services."
"Our common task now is to prevent tax competition, which would mean among other things the erosion of the foundation of these European welfare states."
"This kind of European prosperity is also based on tripartite agreements – we heard here how there are problems with this in some countries – as well as good labour relations and the fact that issues are discussed and lasting agreements are reached, with balanced growth achieved as a result."
"We also have to ensure that this forthcoming services directive, which, after the elections in June, the elected Parliament will be debating, does nothing to promote dumping, something that was spoken of here, but adopts the laws and decrees of the country in which the services are being produced."
"Environmental protection also creates growth and stability."
"We really have to ensure that we achieve sustainable growth which also allows us to look to the future."
"We will not build a European Union with short-term profits."
"We have to have sustainable growth, with the environment playing an absolutely key role."
"Mr President, after spending the past year as an observer in the European Parliament it is indeed an honour that I can, for the first time, address this assembly following the formal accession of my country, Malta."
"Over the past year I have participated in a number of committees, primarily the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I have followed many debates and also contributed to various topics, including tabling an amendment that was formally introduced by a fellow MEP."
"This amendment to the third cohesion report was adopted in committee and then in plenary."
"It is a vibrant example of the opportunity that was given to the accession countries to participate in and influence decisions even prior to membership."
"This is also a clear instance of the welcoming attitude of Members of this House towards an observer."
"I mentioned earlier the cohesion report."
"What better way is there to highlight the economic and social model of Europe, the subject of this debate?"
"The concept of providing a helping hand to regions and countries that are lagging behind other areas of the Union is an excellent example of solidarity in practice, which forms such an essential part of the European Union."
"If one were to ask what the essential characteristics of the European economic and social model are, one would definitely have to include this aspect of support for cohesion and sustainable development, with due consideration given to the quality of life of EU citizens."
"It is important to stimulate the economic growth of the EU so as to provide better jobs and a higher standard of living."
"However, it also important to focus on a distribution of income that is just and equitable."
"This is the first and probably last speech I will make in this Parliament, as I have been nominated to the European Court of Auditors."
"I will not vote on this item tomorrow as I believe that one should not participate in decisions when one is directly involved in that same decision."
"I will end with a few words in Maltese."
"Today we can really say that we have taken our place in Europe."
"Maltese citizens are now also part of this much wider project that will increase benefits for all of Europe."
"Mr President, the current European economic and social model has unfortunately not brought about the desired results."
"The added impact of enlargement may also put further strain on the system and create new imbalances and unexpected changes in employment patterns and social cohesion."
"The scourge of unemployment and job instability within the European Union still defies the many action plans and initiatives for economic and social reforms launched in the past."
"Poverty is still with us and the traditional social security systems are threatened."
"Add to this certain negative aspects of the impact of globalisation and the picture gets bleaker."
"There is no social stability and no real prosperity where there is unemployment, where there are imminent threats to existing jobs and competitiveness is gradually eroded due to macro-economic policies, fiscal measures and constraints that are not adapted to the existing situation on the ground."
"It must be said a priori that any corrective measures that have to be taken should in no way have any negative impact on existing levels of social protection."
"Ideally in the future the European economic and social model needs to be more flexible in its application."
"The same applies to the European monetary and fiscal policies."
"Ways have to be found of establishing how flexibility and fair competition can co-exist and how the social market economy will have less of the free market component and more of the social component."
"The enlarged European Union presents a whole range of regional and subregional social economic scenarios."
"Each has its own specificities and each is in need of its own tailor-made action plan to help attract investment, create jobs, maintain its competitive edge and attract new growth sectors, while ensuring social stability and sustainable growth levels."
"Coming as I do from the smallest Member State, which is an island state, I am very conscious that EU-wide economic and social policies applied indiscriminately on a 'one-size-fits-all' basis do not invariably bring about the desired results either in job creation or in a better quality of life for our citizens."
"This is why I strongly believe that, to be successful, the future EU economic and social model should have ingrained within it the possibility to be flexible and be applied in a tailor-made fashion to specific sites and situations, as well as being endowed with the necessary flexibility in its application to be effective under different socio-economic scenarios."
"Only in this way can we really hope to see further job creation, better quality of life, more prosperity, better social cohesion and more stability within the future enlarged European Union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my joy at being able to address you now as a full Member of this House from Hungary."
"Even 20 years ago, the representatives of the Hungarian National Party regarded the achievement of close union with the countries of the western half of Europe as their main objective."
"During the last fifteen years, however, we have been able to learn quite a lot."
"The not yet completely finalised political, economic and social changes are quite interesting."
"We must work towards the objective that more and more people in Hungary – and in the accession countries – think that joining the European Union is not just a necessary solution, but something that really helps to ensure that people have a secure future."
"We have to create an economy where no elements can surface that would distort competition, but which at the same time allows the accession countries, including Hungary, to catch up."
"It is imperative that smaller villages, even the most disadvantaged rural areas, should be able to retain their population."
"Not only the difficulties associated with the closure of industrial production but also the disadvantages associated with changes in agricultural production, and even in tourism, must be taken into consideration."
"In Hungary, for example, Lake Balaton and its surrounding area require development, financial support is needed, because in addition to the main European roads the remainder of the road network should also be further developed, by establishing a north-south axis route in the western and central parts of Hungary."
"We can say that we are ready to join the European Union, but further major economic and social changes are required."
"The other political party in Hungary talks about modernisation."
"I do not think it is fashionable any more to advertise modern socialism, here in the institutions of the European Union, fortunately, nobody talks about it any more."
"We agree on the development of a knowledge-based economy and IT access possibilities."
"Emphasis must be placed, however, on managing the disadvantages of globalisation, increasing the number of jobs, and enabling the accession countries to catch up, with retention of the main elements of the social model."
"Accession will only be successful if the countries catch up with the existing members."
"Our wish is to be part of this."
"Mr President, the EU’s economic and social policy is important, and the European model is based upon a balance between growth, union rights, good conditions in the labour market and sustainable development."
"We must give impetus to this policy."
"Where growth is concerned, we must pin our hopes on, for example, research and development, the training of the labour force and investment."
"It is at least as important that trade unions exert influence upon developments in individual workplaces and so achieve better working environments."
"It is just as important that we make development sustainable in a long-term perspective."
"I am optimistic."
"I believe that enlargement can be a positive thing, not only for the new countries but also for the whole of the EU, including those of us who have been MEPs and EU Members for some time."
"I believe that it can be a success and a win-win situation."
"I myself come from the Baltic area and live in Sweden."
"I believe that growth can increase through an increase in trade across the Baltic."
"It is therefore important that we not compete with one other through social dumping, poorer working conditions or tax dumping that undermines our welfare systems, but that we maintain a high level of rights in the labour market and where our welfare systems are concerned."
"When we invest, we must do so in new, clean technology that also creates sustainable development and makes for long-term, rather than just short-term, growth."
"I am optimistic, but such optimism depends upon maintaining the balance in the social model."
"Latvia is proud to be a full member of the European Union's family of nations and that we can work together in a unified way for the good of all of Europe."
"We have been working toward this goal for fifteen years."
"Our achievements are significant, creating and developing an economy and a social policy."
"We have also encountered various problems, however, which are becoming especially relevant in the context of the common European economy and social policy."
"One of these problems is the demographic crisis, which affects all of Europe."
"Statistics show clearly that all over Europe a so called demographic winter has set in and the question naturally follows: for whom, then, are we creating and building this beautiful, unified and prosperous Europe?"
"There is no simple solution to this issue and it is not merely bound up with economic and social policy, because it is also a question of values."
"Even the best conceived and most balanced employment policy, thorough social protection and a system of pensions, sexual equality and social benefits will not be perfect unless it is grounded in the basic values of society – on ethical and moral norms."
"Only a harmonious and sound family is able to ensure that these social values are inculcated in every resident, in every child."
"Therefore the interests of the family must be taken into account, and they must be the driving force of all economic and social policy initiatives."
"Latvia is aware of the threats posed by the demographic crisis and therefore the issues of family and child welfare have now been put forward as the Latvian Government's priorities."
"We call on Europe to take similar action, because only then will we be able to tackle the social problems that threaten all of Europe, which are related to the demographic crisis and the inevitable ageing of the population and the growth in the economic burden on the working population."
"Economic and social welfare is not conceivable without the welfare of families all over Europe, because the welfare of the child is dependent on the welfare of the family and that is the basis of a strong, secure and prosperous Europe."
"Therefore today I want to call on you, in debating every issue of economic and social policy, to devote particular attention to the basic value and the foundation of society – the family."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today is the first time that Members of Parliament from the new EU Member States have been able to put their opinions forward."
"It is a pity that these opinions are being delivered in such a private environment."
"Nevertheless, it is of course an honour for me to appear before the European Parliament."
"I come from Slovakia, which, just like the other new EU Member States, has undergone huge changes in the last 15 years, changes which often took decades in the advanced democracies."
"These changes have been very painful and have brought with them great inequalities and social injustice."
"We are the living proof that, if the social aspects of the market economy are ignored, along with the effects of experimental reforms on the population, and if the invisible hand of the market is continually overemphasised, it is one hundred per cent certain that the result will be enormous differences in standards of living and enormous differences between regions."
"I believe that we have had enough fireworks and receptions celebrating the enlargement of the European Union."
"It must be borne in mind that the Union now includes countries where average income is about EUR 160 and average earnings are about EUR 360 a month."
"Full compliance with the European economic and social model may act as an emergency brake for some Member States."
"We may, of course, have great reservations about this model, but socially fairer and more forward-looking models are very difficult, if not impossible, to devise."
"We wish to use our experiences from the last 15 years to make as constructive a contribution as possible to the implementation of this model."
"We do not wish to be the part of Europe which is only attractive because of its low labour costs and weak social protection."
"The introduction of restrictions on the free movement of workers has not been the best of contributions to the European economic and social model."
"It is essential to express the conviction that further such ‘contributions’ will not occur and that equality and solidarity will not be restricted to glossy brochures about the European Union, but will be real European values."
"Mr President, while we are all making statements and giving evidence, I should like to use the minutes of my final speech of this legislative term to try to offer some observations of my own on this issue."
"Time is at a premium, but this is a worthwhile exercise."
"An even more worthwhile exercise would be to stop the so-called economic and social model from becoming an empty phrase, a hollow shell that has become demagogy, and a mere husk from which we have been extracting the living organisms."
"These living organisms are principles and values that must be enforced on a practical basis."
"They are achievements and not gifts, achievements that must be fought for and not gifts that are gratefully received, principles that we want to keep and to ensure that they do not suffer a slow and complete demise."
"In order to place this in a historical context, I shall cite the example of Portugal."
"For decades we were outside the framework of what is referred to as the ‘European model’; thirty years ago, with the ‘April 25th Revolution’, we won social security, reforms, unemployment benefit and a minimum wage; we won the right to health and education and this became enshrined in the Constitution; work – on land, at sea, in manufacturing and in the tertiary sector – was accorded the value that it merits; public services were created; we sought to link the public, cooperative and private sectors; priority was given to the collective interest, with the economy controlled by democratic politics and not vice-versa."
"Politics was no longer in a position to allow major private financial concerns to be established, with various forms of protection."
"Thereafter, particularly after 1986, priority was given to nominal convergence, albeit accompanied by actual divergence and an uneven approach at social and regional level."
"This occurred because the objective of economic and social cohesion did not turn out as it ought to have done."
"We did not want ridiculous budgetary criteria to be imposed, or accounts of benefactors’ sacrifices and beneficiaries’ gains; what we wanted from the policy was for it to promote cooperation and the transfer of means, with mutual respect and benefits for all."
"A profoundly significant enlargement is upon us, which we welcome, with European peoples and cultures coming together."
"It will not, however, work this way whilst we fail to take account of the experiences – both positive and negative – of the new Member States."
"These experiences must help us to ensure the continued existence of the values and principles that form part of the ‘European model’."
"Indeed, because it was not only the Beveridge plan, but also a degree of competition that led to the principles and values that humanised the use of the workforce being enshrined."
"It was significant that mention was made yesterday of Reagan and Thatcher, characters who symbolised neo-liberalism, which is governed solely by the rules of the market, and which will stop at nothing to destroy those principles and values."
"From this side of the House, I welcome the enlarged Europe and the concept of neighbourhood – as a European model for living and not a symbol of window-dressing rhetoric – which will be the path to follow, provided that we maximise the wealth of various situations institutionally, economically, socially, culturally, and not the ideological straitjacket of an omnipotent paradigm, of an omnipotent neo-liberal, federal and militarised Constitution, on the pretext of the spectre of a threat to security."
"I shall finish as I began, Mr President, given that three minutes do not last long."
"The principles and values of a new way forward are, from now on, those of genuine solidarity, of peace, of mutual respect of a democracy, which is not confined to the act of voting, but which extends to the citizens, the workers and the people actually participating."
"Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compared to many areas of the earth, the European economic and social model is as successful as it is, because, in the past, we have developed an economically viable and environmentally friendly transport policy, with sensible general conditions for employees."
"By way of example, I would just like to mention the driving and rest periods for road traffic and working periods in the transport sector."
"On the one hand, this European transport policy is based on us having already dealt with the different national rules in the transport sector or on us being in the process of dealing with them, and thus creating an integrated market in the transport sector too."
"As an example from recent years I would mention the opening of the national rail networks to non-discriminatory use for all railway companies in the Union for freight services from 2006or 2007."
"I could, alternatively, give another example of the creation of the Single European Sky from 31 December 2004."
"On the other hand, the European transport policy is based on having come to terms with the thinking and action behind national infrastructure networks and having created and expanded a trans-European transport network within the Union."
"In this vein, we adopted the largest revision of the trans-European transport network two weeks ago and thereby getting to grips with the Union of Fifteen’s transport infrastructure and adopting 30 priority projects for the Union of Twenty-Five."
"I am assuming that the new Member States will quickly implement the European regulations in the transport sector, if they have not already done so, in order that the internal market in transport may become a reality in all areas of the European Union."
"I hope that together we will be able to press ahead with and further develop the European transport policy in the next Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Mr President, until recently I was an observer in this House."
"Today I am a fully-fledged Member of the European Parliament."
"I have noticed that words like solidarity, assistance, and cooperation are often bandied about in the Chamber."
"These words do have real meaning."
"It sometimes happens, however, that a wonderful idea loses out against ruthless interests."
"Work on reform of the common agricultural policy is an example of this."
"The Fifteen old Member States used Article 23 of the Treaty of Accession concluded between Poland and the European Union to further their own interests."
"The conditions applicable to Polish agriculture established in Copenhagen in December 2002 were changed to our disadvantage."
"Poland is a country of great opportunities."
"With some support, it could develop impressively and benefit the whole European Union."
"In over a thousand years of its history, my nation has demonstrated that it is not afraid of difficult challenges."
"It has shown itself capable of great deeds for the common good."
"It is no exaggeration to state that a Poland with a vibrant economy and enriched by the spirit of its citizens will be an asset to the European Union."
"I am convinced we shall not be a burden on Europe."
"We shall prove a tower of strength for it."
"Poland has never let Europe down, and it never will."
"I trust Europe will not let Poland down either."
"– Mr PresidentCommissioner, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago Czechoslovakia split."
"The Czechs and the Slovaks were unable to agree on a joint constitution."
"Fortunately, we parted on good terms, as friends and in peace."
"I am happy we are meeting as friends and in peace again in the European Union and in Parliament."
"Czechoslovakia’s story can serve as a lesson, particularly for those who are set to negotiate the European Constitution."
"If no agreement is reached on the European Constitution within an enlarged Europe, this major entity could also break up."
"Let us hope that they take heed of this warning."
"Talking about the future of our economic and social model, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we will not be the ones who decide the future."
"The future will be decided by those who will live in this future, by our children and their children’s children."
"What we can do for them is to create conditions that will enable them to decide freely on their own model, and it is by adopting the European Constitution that we will enable them to make their decisions freely."
"I mention this, because my ancestors decided to surrender their freedom and democracy on the promise of social security."
"My generation was, therefore, not free to decide which social and economic system it would like to live under."
"I believe that the future social system will be based on solidarity and love for one’s fellow man."
"Let us not forget this is also a Christian value, which is not mentioned in the preamble of the draft Constitution."
"I believe that they will be able to decide to go into business."
"Conditions must be right, however, for small businesses to flourish, given that out of small acorns large oaks trees grow."
"I believe that everything will come right."
"I believe that the future for our descendants will be as happy as things were for my generation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is in the habit of producing declarations that may be visionary or even grandiose, but are certainly useful. One of these was produced at Lisbon in 2000, where the Heads of State or Government presented us with a strategy extending over ten years, in which time it aimed to make the European Union the most competitive and most dynamic economy in the world."
"According to this strategy, a strong economy will stimulate the creation of jobs and will encourage social and environmental policies ensuring sustainable development and social cohesion, which boils down to something that is not the work of a genius and is almost a truism, and, for students of economics and all the acolytes of the social market economy, a post-war concept."
"Now that this legislative period is coming to an end, we, the former members, and the new ones whom we have welcomed this week, are quite rightly concerned about the opportunities for implementing the Lisbon strategy."
"Within this framework, though, the question at issue is whether we can maintain the European social model in the Europe of twenty-five, which will tomorrow be twenty-seven or even more, is the one that bothers me most of all."
"Can we agree that, if the European social model is to be saved, we must not abandon a certain amount of regulation of the market economy compatible with an adequate standard of social security?"
