"Text"
"The Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky was one of the first to urge Israeli politicians to start direct talks with Arafat."
"What was then a Utopian ideal is now political reality."
"But where are today' s European Kreiskys?"
"Where are the visions, the ideas, the creativity and the courage to go beyond standard, purely bureaucratic duties?"
"Europe has endeavoured over recent years, besides financial and political activities in the Middle East, to leave political brokering to the USA and to focus on purely economic issues in this region."
"Perhaps this was a reaction to Europe' s chaotic, uncoordinated political stance in relation to the warring factions."
"One of the biggest obstacles preventing EU representatives from assuming an active role in the peace process is what are, at times, incomprehensible and intolerable unilateral accusations and intrepid judgements."
"For example, why on earth did the Swedish foreign minister issue such an aggressive, unilateral judgment of Israel' s show of power after visiting Israel and the settlements during the Swedish Presidency, thereby scuppering any chance of brokering by the EU during the Swedish Presidency."
"No one can seriously ignore Israel' s desire for peace."
"No Israeli politician has ever ventured as far as the last prime minister, Ehud Barak, did in his proposals."
"The present catastrophic situation is the result."
"Blaming new Sharon government for it, as has been done here, merely hampers the efforts of the EU representatives to broker an agreement."
"Europe should understand, once and for all, that none of us looks on the Middle East merely in terms of friends or foes."
"If Europe is to have any chance of being taken seriously as a broker, we need a consistent language in our foreign policy, a neutral attitude towards the warring factions and to work out and broker feasible peace proposals."
"Simply stating ones support for the claims of one side or the other is several principles short of a peace policy."
"Issues such as the Palestinians' right to return, the division of Jerusalem and the Holy Mount, the problem of the settlement policy and Palestinian statehood and the Israeli people' s justifiable demand for security must be discussed directly by the parties to the conflict."
"Our opinions must take second place if we want to be taken seriously as peace brokers."
"To do all this, we need high-profile, persuasive people to represent Europe, who will be taken seriously by all parties in the Middle East."
"I arrived back in Strasbourg last night directly from visiting Israel."
"My statements are perhaps coloured somewhat by my private connections."
"But you can rest assured that this nation wants peace on both sides."
"It is part of our job to engage in talks with both sides."
"It does not always have to be the politicians currently in office."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolution."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Madam President, as the Council and the Commission have recognised, we are witnessing an escalation of blind violence and indiscriminate hatred in the Middle East. It has reached its climax in the stoning of human beings and in the killing and murdering of children and innocent victims."
"The international community' s appeals for dialogue and peace have been ignored or sidelined."
"It is therefore urgent to press ahead with the initiatives currently under way. I have in mind the joint Jordano-Egyptian plan and the Mitchell Committee' s conclusions calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the resumption of dialogue aimed at a peaceful solution to this conflict."
"If there is no response to these appeals, the international community must not remain unmoved by this display of violence, deep-rooted hatred and the 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' culture. Nor can we remain blind deaf and dumb to it."
"In my view, Madam President, if the two initiatives now on the table fail to bear fruit, we shall have to come up with a formula to allow us to break the current deadlock."
"The President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers - I refer to the Defence Ministers, who met informally on Monday prior to meeting with the Foreign Ministers - has stated that by the end of the year the European Union will be in a position to become involved in crisis management situations on a case by case basis. It should be borne in mind, however, that a large proportion of our resources is currently committed in the Balkans."
"I believe we cannot afford to wait until the end of the year. If the initiatives now under way fail to bear fruit, we should consider other alternatives, such as a United Nations' buffer force."
"Alternatively, as Mr Patten rightly suggested, we could use the instruments available to the European Union, namely the association agreements."
"We should not overlook other possibilities such as the International Court in The Hague, or the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It would be best not to have to resort to them, however, because the parties do really wish to return to the negotiating table and seek a peace which must be based on justice."
"Madam President, a great deal has already been said, and so I will attempt to make good use of the three minutes assigned to me and concentrate a little more on what needs to be done rather than going over the details of the situation. In any case, the President-in-Office, Mrs Lindh, and many other Members have stressed the severity and scale of the situation in the occupied territories and throughout the Middle East in their speeches."
"There has been quite enough description."
"I feel that Parliament's role is coming into its own in this case as well."
"There have been many debates but few resolutions, and Parliament is realising that resolutions and declarations have to have value and meaning."
"As you pointed out, in this case we have a resolution which, I hope, will be adopted by a very wide majority, in which practically all the political groups undertake initiatives in respect of the Commission and the Council."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for the clarity and determination with which he has re-established international law and responsibilities in economic relations with Israel as well."
"If we do not get back to international law, it will be very difficult to get away from the maze of violence and retaliation which have erupted in that situation."
"However, I would like to stress to the Council that it may not be sufficient for Mr Solana to bring the matter up in Gothenburg."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam has provided us with tools which have not yet been used in this field."
"It is rather strange that the European Union should not have equipped itself with a common strategy on the Middle East, and it is rather strange that the 15 should have gone to the United Nations Security Council and the meetings of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva with different positions."
"This makes no sense. It is appalling."
"In my opinion, it is the duty of the European Union to strengthen the role of the High Representative and of Mr Moratinos through a common strategy laying down the direction to be followed."
"We call for this to be done in Gothenburg."
"What Mr Salafranca said makes sense."
"The Mitchell Commission has made recommendations."
"The first step could be to send observers, but this could be lead to the sending of a peacekeeping force."
"If the violence does not cease, we will have to do something to assist the process from outside."
"I feel that this debate has been useful and, above all, I call upon the Council to take the resolution into due consideration."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest wave of violence and terror in the Middle East must be roundly condemned."
"It is high time that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escaped from the impasse in which it is currently stuck."
"I believe that both parties will have to make great efforts to achieve this."
"To begin with both sides must immediately refrain from any unilateral act that may cause the conflict to escalate further."
"In addition, we must insist on mutual respect and good will."
"In this connection, I should like to point to the, in my view, very important statement made by the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Shimon Peres, on Sunday 13 May that there will be no more new settlements."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, it is our duty to strengthen our position in the peace talks, in view of all our humanitarian and geostrategic interests in this region as well as our important trading relations."
"The Commission and the Member States must also be encouraged to support projects that can help in the building of understanding and partnership."
"Of course, many unsolved problems and unanswered questions will remain."
"Everyone knows that the peace process will be long and arduous, but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance we can achieve our common goal, of a peaceful and prosperous Middle East."
"Madam President, the most surprising thing about our debate is our surprise, for Israel's expansionist policy is the inevitable and predictable result of the growing imbalance in the region, the stability for which we bear much of the responsibility."
"Firstly that is because since 1967 most of our states, with the notable exception of France, have continued to give the State of Israel - a state that is growing increasingly self-assured and domineering - the impression that it can violate international law and UN resolutions with impunity."
"In reality, here as elsewhere we have followed Washington and persist in closing our eyes to the theocratic excesses of this religious state whose governments are under the thumb of fanatical parties and minorities that are just as bad as the other groups of religious fanatics in the region."
"That is why we should envisage imposing sanctions on Israel."
"There is, however, another serious imbalance for which we are in part responsible, namely the imbalance of forces."
"I have no hesitation in saying that we must consider giving the Arab side a large enough force, including a large enough nuclear force, to persuade Israel that it cannot simply do whatever it wants."
"That is the policy my country pursued in the 1970s when it gave Iraq a nuclear force."
"We have now destroyed it."
"So we will carry on with our policy of imbalance and what is happening today is merely the annoying but inevitable result of our collective blindness and cowardice."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked or would like to see many Members, as also the Commission and the Council, show the same determination in relation to Chechnya, where 100 000 people have been killed in less than two years, or to occupied Tibet, where there have been 1.2 million deaths in forty years."
"Unfortunately, some people, both in the Council and the Commission and in our Parliament, seem to have short memories when it comes to these issues."
"In reaction to this morning's debate let me begin by observing that Mrs Lindh is taking rather a selective approach when she speaks of Israel's retreat from Lebanon, while forgetting that Lebanon is still occupied by Syria."
"I am surprised at such forgetfulness."
"The policy proposed by Mrs Lindh, MEPs and the Commission is a formulaic policy."
"It forgets that Mr Barak made proposals that no Israeli before him had ever made and that the Palestinians rejected his proposals."
"I doubt whether putting the Israelis' backs against the wall will persuade them to subscribe to a peace plan that even Mr Arafat does not seem prepared to accept."
"We should take a more objective view."
"We should also remember our own history of the past hundred years, perhaps show a little more generosity towards Israel and perhaps also begin to seriously consider the possibility of Israel joining the European Union."
"That would respond to the Israeli people's deep-seated anxieties, while certainly not denying the frustrations and extremely harsh living conditions of the Palestinians, and would also respond to the fundamental issue of the profound anxiety of the Palestinian people."
"I think Europe should give proof of its generosity by offering Israel membership of the European Union."
"That is a prospect that would allow the European Union to make greater concessions, even in territorial terms, and allow Palestine to develop and Israel to live in security in this part of the world."
"This proposal has already been signed by thirty Members of the European Parliament and a number of members of the Knesset."
"I invite Members to sign it as soon as possible so that we can hold a major debate on this proposal."
"Madam President, the European Union is expected to do something in the Middle East."
"It is already present there, far more so than in the past, thanks to the commitment of its High Representative."
"Now it must play an even more active part."
"The time has passed when it could confine itself to watching the drama unfold from its Mediterranean balcony seat."
"It must play an active part because as history has demonstrated, in politics and in war, merely to play a passive role is ignominious."
"If we are to have any prospect of being useful, we must act with absolute impartiality."
"That is the first difficulty in this exercise, since each of the camps expects first of all that we side with it against its enemy, following the old adage that my enemy's enemy is my friend, but my enemy's friend is my enemy."
"If we are to help break this vicious circle of bloodshed and revenge, here as elsewhere we do not have the right to be anyone's enemy."
"So what can we do?"
"I sincerely believe that nobody will make peace in the Middle East unless the two parties are resolved to do so and unless the various proposals put forward in this Chamber just now, by Members as also by the Council and by the Commission, are taken into consideration."
"If, as we must continue to hope, the wish for peace exists, and only if it exists, then we must also support the idea of deploying an international observers' force, in which Europe could and should take part."
"Like my friend Mr Salafranca Sánchez Neyra and like Mrs Napoletano, I want to stress that point to our counterparts from the Knesset who are here today, because I know that at present Israel is profoundly opposed to the idea."
"The way to cool down a conflict as acute and heated as the one that continues to bathe the Holy Land in blood is to have impartial observers on the ground. Through their actions and their testimony they could prevent a new general conflagration from being sparked off by the growing number of incidents that are bound to occur when a real armistice is signed."
"Like my fellow Members, I continue to hope that we will finally see such an armistice one day."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, friend of Israel, today I am preparing to vote for a resolution that in fact takes Israel severely to task."
"Indeed, while I regret the fact that the Europeans all too often underestimate the tragedy of the repeated terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in the Israeli villages, while I reproach Yasser Arafat with not having had the courage to take the hand Mr Ehud Barak courageously extended to him within a few days of the elections - it would have been enough to say 'yes, but ...' or 'yes, if ...' . but he chose to say 'no' - nonetheless Israel is a democratic, powerful, well-armed and well-equipped state."
"That is why it is up to Israel not only to stop the pressure mounting, but also to take peace initiatives that are acceptable to the Palestinian people."
"Let me add that although I understand the Israeli people' s concern for their security, I cannot accept statements or acts by Mr Ariel Sharon that I personally would condemn on the part of anyone else."
"Precisely in the name of my friendship towards Israel, let me say to the Israelis that they will not achieve the security they deserve by the use of force and that the settlements are a serious mistake."
"Let me also say that the Palestinians have the right to a state."
"Lastly, let me say that the Israelis and the Palestinians need us to make serious proposals for a solution. We know that a peaceful settlement will require sacrifices on both sides."
"Europe can and must make its contribution and set out a balanced and active position to that end."
"I have found such a position set out in the statements by the Council and the Commission."
"I also hope that our resolution will be a contribution and I am sure the Mitchell Commission' s report could form the basis for new negotiations."
"Madam President, Israel and Palestine are two independent nations but they are not yet two independent states."
"They are two peoples who must coexist as neighbours or offer their grandchildren the prospect of eternal feuding."
"Sadly, there is provocation by people who should be showing leadership."
"Provocation leads to violence, which is met by violence, which leads to revenge and a slippery slope away from a just and peaceful modus vivendi."
"Much of the solution is in Israel's hands, but Palestine and the neighbouring states must respond."
"Of course I understand Israel's nervousness about taking the first steps."
"Lebanon, for example, has been in an impossible situation for years: it has been shelled by Israel and infiltrated by Syria, and both must help it now to provide stability in its own lands."
"Israeli withdrawal was met responsibly by the Lebanese."
"However, Israel still holds pockets of Lebanese territory in the south and has not yet provided maps of where the landmines are so that they can be cleared and, as a result, nine shepherds have been killed since the withdrawal."
"Prisoners on both sides still have to be returned and the Shebaa farms on the Golan border belonging to Lebanon are still held, controlled and occupied by Israel."
"The key area of provocation has been covered by the minister and by the Commissioner, including the issue of the sale in the EU of goods labelled as Israeli but coming from the settlements."
"There are 145 settlements in the West Bank, 16 in Gaza, 9 in East Jerusalem; 400,000 people live in them."
"Only 42% of West Bank territory is controlled by the Palestinians, 58% is either in military camps or settlements and too often the military camps lead to the settlements."
"Peace will not come from resolutions adopted here - although we can help."
"Peace will come if, and only when, Israel, Palestine and the neighbouring states realise they want peace so much that they are prepared to live it."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you all for an excellent debate."
"It has consistently been shown here that it is important that the European Union has influence and plays an active role."
"If we are to have any influence, there must also be unanimity within the European Union on the way in which we wish to influence the current process."
"It is good to see that the Council is considerably more unanimous today than we ever have been before."
"I also think this unanimity can be seen in this context too."
"Although different resolutions have been proposed and although there are many different opinions, there are still fewer differences between us than previously."
"I also think this is one reason why we have never before been able to see the EU being as greatly involved in the Middle East conflict."
"However, unfortunately this is not sufficient, and on the contrary, as Mr Poos said initially, it is also about the willingness of the parties to negotiate and not least about the Israeli government currently bearing the main responsibility."
"I can agree with very much of what Mr Poos said regarding the description of the current situation: the catastrophic economic situation, and the illegal occupation."
"The problem is that this leads to Mr Galeote Quecedo' s view that there is a risk of extremists setting the agenda."
"The risk is that hate propaganda on both sides and Palestinian poverty will lead to violence increasing further."
"Mr Lagendijk said that it is unacceptable for resistance fighters on the Palestinian side to be executed by Israelis."
"I can only agree;"
"I brought this up in my initial speech."
"This is completely in breach of both international law and international standards and of what most of us consider to be basic human rights."
"We have brought this up several times with the Israeli government."
"We have also received guarantees that this is to cease, but unfortunately this has not hitherto been the case."
"Regarding the meeting of 21 May, addressed by several of the speakers, the Council is providing every support to the Commission for the course of action which Commissioner Patten has described and which means that we must now follow the rules and clearly show that the EU cannot accept Israel continuing to break them."
"Several speakers have addressed the allocation of the burden of guilt, where we lay the blame and how much of an intermediary the EU can be."
"I would like to say to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, and many others who have brought up this issue, that even if the EU clearly is to make requirements of both parties, today it is natural for us to make more stringent demands of the Israeli government and Ariel Sharon."
"Ariel Sharon actually bears the main responsibility today for reversing the trend."
"As many of you have pointed out, the current policy increases the risk of benefiting extremist groups."
"Mr Sharon must acknowledge his political responsibility."
"For its part, the Council will naturally also make demands of the Palestinian side: that the Palestinians are to have a more open budget, that they should work more on the basis of democratic, open principles, that they should do everything in their power to stop terrorism."
"So what can the EU do further?"
"Just as Mr Napolitano said, it is important that we also act."
"So I can guarantee that we will not passively sit waiting for the report from Javier Solana to the European Council meeting in Gothenburg."
"We will address the Israeli government and demand that it stop the violence, cease to close off Palestinian areas and immediately halt its settlement policy which is illegal and constitutes illegal occupation."
"As I said, we have also demanded that the Palestinian side do all it can to prevent terrorism and to reduce violence."
"We support the proposals of the Mitchell Report and it was good to see support for the report here in Parliament too."
"We also support the Jordanian-Egyptian initiative."
"In particular, and the Commission has also played a part in developing this, we assume a major financial responsibility today for the Palestinian areas and for ensuring that the situation does not become even worse in these areas."
"Precisely as General Morillon said, the EU is currently more active than ever before."
"However, I believe that we all feel the need not only to take on more responsibility than we have done hitherto - the major financial responsibility which has been taken so far - but also the need to take even greater political responsibility which also actually corresponds to the financial responsibility we are taking on the region."
"By commissioning Javier Solana to draw up a roadmap for the Gothenburg Summit, we anticipate that the EU will be able to provide a further substantial contribution to the peace process and achieve a better, more long-term strategy for the EU' s involvement in the Middle East."
"Finally, it is still the parties themselves who must come to their senses, who must break the spiral of violence, who have to refrain from the ever increasing conflicts and return to the only possible road to peace; cease-fire, a freeze on settlements, a return to the negotiating table."
"I would like to say both to the Israeli side and the Palestinian side that this is not a question which concerns only you. It is of major international interest."
"It is crucial to the future of us all and therefore we demand that the parties also take their responsibility."
"As Mr Caudron said, in this situation it is not about being a friend to Israel or a friend to Palestine. Instead it is about all of us in the EU having to do all we can to contribute to the peace process."
"I just want to try to answer three questions that were put during the debate by honourable Members and I hope I can do so in a way which is moderately satisfactory."
"First of all, Mrs van der Laan asked about the rules of origin, and if there are points which I do not cover in what I am going to say, I will take them up in correspondence with the honourable Member."
"What I would like to do is rehearse exactly what has happened so far."
"The issue of rules of origin was raised in the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament to which I referred earlier."
"The General Affairs Council at the end of June 1998 took note of our communication and asked the Commission to resolve these issues on a technical level."
"A great deal has happened since then."
"Technical contacts at different levels with Israel took place immediately after the communication."
"On 16 December 1999 the Commission informed COREPER on the outcome of these meetings."
"In early 2000 concrete information on specific imports from Israeli settlements was supplied to the Commission."
"On the basis of this information, at the Customs Code Committee meeting on 6 April last year, the Commission reminded Member States of their obligation in this respect, namely to apply the provisions of Article 32 of the Protocol on Customs of the Association Agreement to consignments for which information had been received that they originated in the settlements."
"After this meeting Member States returned around 2000 EUR1 certificates to Israel for verification."
"In some cases, goods were only released for free circulation in the European Union subject to the payment of a guarantee against liability for customs duties."
"Replies to the letters of verification are coming in as the ten month deadline for Israel's reply is expiring."
"All along there has been a notice to importers which was first published in the Community Official Journal of 8 November 1997 warning exporters of doubts regarding EUR1 certificates from Israel."
"The notice is still in force, although of course references to the orange juice case, which honourable Members will recall, no longer apply."
"That is all the information that I have at hand on the history of rules of origin."
"I am determined, as I said earlier, to conduct this issue by the Agreement and entirely according to the law."
"Mr Lagendijk asked what we would be saying to the Israeli side next week at our meeting on 21 May and he said that what we sought, or should seek, in the Middle East was a balanced approach."
"I do not think, and I do not think he thinks either, that means we should search for some point on the political agenda where neither side will disagree with us."
"That is not what is meant by a balanced approach."
"I happen to think that the Mitchell Commission report was an extremely balanced and sensible document."
"The Mitchell Commission - and I hope we will do much the same - in my judgment supports those who are still committed to working for peace on both sides of the argument."
"That is a sensible, balanced approach."
"As for what we will say on 21 May, we can discuss human rights under the essential elements clause of our Agreement, we will certainly discuss for the first time this summer rules of origin - that is already on the agenda - but I want to be scrupulous in sticking to the letter and the spirit of our Agreement."
"To go beyond that would risk putting us on a very slippery slope indeed. So as far as I am concerned we stick to the letter of the Agreement and do not go beyond it with any other political gestures."
"Mr Belder asked about the remarks of our colleague and friend the Dutch Foreign Minister about the Palestinian Authority in particular and the importance of ensuring that it operates in a more transparent and democratic way."
"I have to say that what our colleague Mr van Aartsen said during his visit to the Middle East was not just wholly in line with our views on the development of democracy in the Palestinian territories, but an extremely eloquent and effective exposition of our view, as one would expect from him."
"Even in these less than perfect circumstances we need to press the Palestinian Authority to be more open, to be more transparent, to be more pluralistic, to protect people's civil liberties and human rights and to become increasingly democratic."
"That is, I think, what the Minister was saying and he has our total support."
"I thank Mr Patten for his replies to Members."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"State of the transatlantic dialogue"
"The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on the state of the Transatlantic dialogue."
"Mr President, relations between the EU and the US are of vital importance both for Europe and the US and for the rest of the world."
"Transatlantic relations are good."
"Today, we are working closely together within a number of areas, and our dialogue by and large comprises all the important issues."
"We have a shared responsibility to meet global challenges and contribute to a more peaceful and more democratic world as well as to work for a dynamic multilateral trade system."
"We also have differences of opinion in various areas but conduct a close dialogue on these."
"Since our dialogue was formalised in 1990 with the adoption of the Transatlantic Declaration, it has been constantly deepened and broadened."
"In 1995, we also adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda."
"At its meeting on Monday, the General Affairs Council welcomed the Commission' s report on how we can further strengthen the transatlantic dialogue and charged the Presidency and the Commission to ensure, together with the US, that the dialogue becomes more efficient and action oriented."
"The Council would like to see the dialogue, which comprises regular summits, focusing on a number of strategic themes and prioritising the issues which are important for promoting continuity."
"The Council has particularly demanded that ""the environment"" and ""climate"" constitute one of these strategic themes."
"At the Gothenburg Summit on 14 June, the EU and the US will jointly stake out a clear structure and focus for continued cooperation."
"At the Summit, all the issues which have been prioritised during the Swedish Presidency will be raised in one way or another."
"The EU and the US have coordinated the initiatives designed to help Russia implement disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, particularly regarding the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme and the destruction of chemical weapons."
"We have also worked together within the framework of the EU' s Northern Dimension initiative."
"In close consultation with the forthcoming Belgian and Spanish Presidencies, we have begun multiannual cooperation on justice and home affairs, focusing on combating drugs, combating child pornography on the Internet and supporting Russia' s fight against organised crime and its consolidation of a society based on the rule of law."
"We have worked together on issues related to the new economy."
"We have worked together on the fight against HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases in Africa."
"In the field of trade policy, the Swedish Presidency has given high priority to seeking unanimity between the EU and the US on a platform which will make it possible to launch new WTO negotiations in the autumn."
"In addition, we have emphasised the importance of concrete progress being made to solve the bilateral trade disputes which constitute a serious cause of irritation in our relationship."
"The theoretical solution to the banana dispute that was recently achieved is one example of this."
"However, as I said, there are also differences of opinion."
"The new administration' s stated opposition to the Kyoto Protocol is a source of great disappointment to us."
"It is highly worrying that the US, which is responsible for 25% of the world' s carbon dioxide emissions, is choosing to stand aside from an international agreement negotiated over a decade."
"The new administration has justified its opposition to the Kyoto Protocol by the fact that it does not require the same undertakings of developing countries and is also damaging to the American economy."
"We do not accept these reasons, and above all we do not accept the US thereby distancing itself from the agreement."
"The EU' s reaction to the actions of the US has been swift and powerful."
"Prime Minister Persson and Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, have criticised the decision in a letter."
"At the informal meeting of the environment ministers in Sweden, the Swedish chairman, Mr Larsson, stated that no individual country has the right officially to declare a multilateral agreement dead, and he expressed his hopes that the US would return and take part in the ongoing Kyoto Process."
"The EU Troika, headed by the Swedish Minister for the Environment Mr Larsson, travelled to Washington in April to continue nevertheless to attempt to maintain the dialogue with the US on the global problem of climate change."
"In these talks, it emerged that the US does not question the problem of climate change."
"The US admits the importance of finding global solutions to the problem."
"The EU considers that the solution is to be found within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, while the US insists on the need to find alternative solutions."
"The EU' s goal is to make the Protocol ratifiable within the next year with or without the US."
"However, without the participation of the US, the Protocol will be considerably weaker."
"We therefore welcome the US attending the environment meeting in Bonn in July and hope to see a constructive dialogue with a fruitful exchange of views."
"I would like to emphasise that both the EU and the US bear a heavy responsibility for global problems and challenges such as the threat posed by climate change."
"We will never get the countries of the Third World and developing countries to take action if no joint responsibility is taken by the EU and the US."
"To conclude, a few words on the areas in which the EU and the US are taking, and have succeeded in taking, joint responsibility."
"In this context, I would particularly like to highlight our joint efforts to promote peace and stability in the Balkans, as well as our consultations on the situation in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East peace process."
"Links between the EU and the US are vitally important in today' s world."
"It is only through cooperation and dialogue that we can meet global challenges and create the preconditions for a world of peace, democracy and economic development."
"I therefore see with great satisfaction that the European Parliament is taking action to develop and strengthen the dialogue with the American Congress."
"I would also like to point out that a meaningful dialogue must also address issues on which the EU and the US disagree."
"Constructive dialogue is based on sincerity, and sincerity means not hesitating to voice criticism."
"This means that, in the future too, the EU will direct criticism at, for example, the US' s use of the death penalty."
"Mr President, I now look forward to hearing the opinions of the Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss transatlantic relations with the European Parliament."
"There is a lot of talk about EU-US cooperation."
"There are quite a few critical voices in that chorus and we read frequently about this or that cloud casting a shadow across the relationship."
"But in all this, I would argue, we fail to recognise the unique nature and the unique strength of the transatlantic bond, so this is an excellent opportunity to put the record straight."
"This debate also gives me an opportunity to set out in a few words why the Commission recently presented a communication on reinforcing the transatlantic relationship and how we would hope to see that initiative followed up in Parliament and the Council."
"The 1995 new transatlantic agenda shifted the focus of our relationship from one of consultation to joint action."
"Since then EU-US cooperation has broadened enormously and now embraces virtually every area of EU activity, and rightly so."
"We share so much with the US in terms of vision, history and values."
"With no one else do we have such a wide range of common interests and such a strong economic base to build on."
"We do not, as I shall go on to say, agree about everything, but the fact that we agree about so much means that there is always a distorting focus on the minority of issues where we do not see eye to eye."
"I do not want to launch here into an inventory of EU-US cooperation."
"My point here is different. It is that we have an interest in virtually every area of activity of the Union to establish close and cooperative relations with the United States."
"I have no sympathy for anti-Americanism or anti-anyone-else-ism for that matter."
"I feel under no compunction to define my Europeanness in terms of my attitude to the United States of America."
"That sort of attitude betrays a terrible lack of self-confidence in what it means to be a European."
"In my specific area of responsibility, the added value and positive results are obvious in our close partnership with the Balkans."
"The Minister also spoke, quite rightly, of the Middle East and Korea, and we could have continued like that and mentioned many other parts of the world."
"The European Union and the US are also principal partners in addressing the new cross-cutting issues on the international agenda."
"Communicable diseases, organised crime, drug and people trafficking, money laundering: all these manifestations of the dark side of globalisation require our concerted action and they get our joint attention."
"Access to medicines, for example, has been lifted to the top of the agenda in EU-US relations as well as in multilateral fora."
"That brings me to another important point about the transatlantic partnership."
"It would be sad, serious and a terrible irony if the emergence of Europe as a global actor in a multilateral world coincided with the turning of some American minds towards unilateralism."
"I hope that will not happen."
"It would be the reversal of the trends of the last 50 years."
"I had been greatly encouraged by the new Administration's commitment to maintaining America's vital role in world affairs."
"President Bush chose to emphasise the point in his inaugural speech, when he said, and I quote ""America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice""."
"Obviously these hopes were somewhat deflated, as the Minister said, by the subsequent statement indicating that the Administration has no interest in implementing the Kyoto Protocol."
"This rightly met with dismay in Europe and elsewhere, including in parts of the United States, but clearly we must not let disappointment turn into fruitless confrontation."
"It is vital that we persuade the United States to embrace and maintain its multilateral commitments and we in the European Union can best help to do this, not by finger wagging and moralising, but by facing up to our own responsibilities and following through our own commitments with our financial assistance and other policy instruments."
"When the United States and the European Union work together, we set the international agenda."
"If we are divided, the opportunity for international progress is often lost."
"I will be brief because I know there are some time constraints, but one could, of course, speak at length about security and defence cooperation as an important element of our partnership."
"The time has come for Europe to shoulder its fair share of the security burden."
"That is all we are seeking to do, to respond to American concerns that we have not been pulling our weight."
"As the Secretary-General of NATO, Lord Robertson, put it very succinctly last year, this is not about Europe going it alone, but about Europe doing more."
"A properly resourced and effective ESDP will allow the European Union to make a much larger contribution to transatlantic security."
"My main concern in this area is that we might fail to deliver, not that European success in delivering would antagonise the United States."
"Let me go back for a moment to the communication on reinforcing the transatlantic relationship, which we tabled before Easter."
"In many ways the method of working together which we devised in 1995 was ahead of its time, but we are not resting on our laurels and would certainly be discouraged from doing so by those who have added such an important parliamentary dimension to our relationship."
"It would be fair to say that over the years the machinery of cooperation has grown rather more complex than we intended."
"So we need to look over the structures and processes of cooperation, the architecture if you like, and the plumbing of our relations, in order to ensure that the whole machinery is geared as much as possible to action and the delivery of results."
"The architecture is described in terms of strategic themes forming the core of the transatlantic agenda."
"It is a big core, because the relationship is so very wide-ranging."
"We identified eight such strategic themes, ranging from the emerging international security challenges, globalisation and the multilateral trading system, through energy issues and consumer protection, to the digital economy and the fight against crime."
"These strategic themes should not be seen as a selection of priorities, but rather as overarching principles which will remain valid over several years and provide a framework for specific issues and priorities to be tackled over a shorter time period."
"The plumbing part of the communication looks at the so-called NTA structures and the multitude of meetings which take place within them at political and official level."
"Our message is simple: fewer meetings, more substance and more political leadership."
"The first two are related to the latter, but we want political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to set the priorities and challenges their respective administrations should meet and to set deadlines for meeting those challenges as well."
"This will only happen if there is real business to be done and that will only be the case if we make the meetings more focussed."
"It is an ambitious goal."
"The new transatlantic agenda process is like a supertanker, or maybe it is better to call it a mixed-bulk carrier."
"It can carry a large and varied cargo all at once."
"We need to ensure its design is streamlined, simple and robust to ensure smooth passage and minimum maintenance."
"As the honourable Members can tell, I have been thinking much about the Korean shipbuilding industry recently and its impact on global trade."
"At the helm you should not spin the wheel widely from side-to-side, but adjust the course with small, but well-measured turns."
"Let me end where I started."
"The transatlantic link in my view is our most important relationship."
"It is important for the European Union and for the United States and indeed for the world."
"Of course, we will not always agree on everything."
"I am not thinking just of trade issues, which should always be put in the wider perspective of the colossal trade flows, more than a USD 1 billion a day, which benefit both our regions, but also of more fundamental issues like environmental protection, on which the minister spoke, and capital punishment."
"There are no easy answers, no magic wands to make our differences disappear."
"However, on the larger range of issues, where the United States and the European Union work together, we do set between us the international agenda."
"By working together across the Atlantic we can advance our interests, those of our countries and their citizens, and contribute to global security more generally."
"Mr President, this is an important debate to hold at this juncture, after the first few months of the US administration, with the visit of President George Bush to Göteburg in June and the Commission's initial thoughts on the common foreign and security policy."
"So where are we today?"
"We have a timely communication before us, which points to the breadth and growth of the transatlantic relationship from the declaration in 1990 to the new transatlantic agenda in 1995."
"The number of subjects it covers will continue to grow and we will probably see a consolidation of ideas on the monetary dialogue and other aspects."
"Secondly, the communication contains ideas on how to make the process more effective."
"Thirdly, it underlines the importance of engaging civil society and building parliamentary links."
"But I think it is wise for us to ask whether these perspectives are really sufficient for the next five years."
"Common economic interests and concerns are increasingly global and not bilateral, while regionalisation is increasingly seen as an alternative to the WTO and multilateralism."
"US security interests are shifting towards the Pacific, even if NATO and EU enlargements will demand transatlantic political management in the months ahead. It is difficult to focus together on defining common strategic interests like, for example, the Ukraine."
"In view of these aspects, my group considers this communication a disappointing one."
"It is more a stocktaking exercise than one that will encourage a broader transatlantic partnership."
"In other words, it does not match up to the requirements of the developing transatlantic partnership in the future."
"Why, for example, have fewer summits if there are going to be more rather than fewer issues to discuss?"
"How do you prioritise the agenda if you have already set eight strategic themes?"
"How do you include the US Congress and the European Parliament in the framework without setting out any ideas for its inclusion?"
"The communication refers to an Interparliamentary Assembly."
"That is not what it is."
"It is a delegation which has converted itself into the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue."
"So we need broader thinking to develop the transatlantic partnership before 2004."
"It is time to get away from the humdrum bulk-carrier idea; something rather more visionary, I suspect, would be required at this stage."
"First, we should stake out the ground for a broader transatlantic partnership."
"Why not make sure we can re-energise the transatlantic business dialogue?"
"It is in some difficulty."
"Why not think of an annual Atlantic Summit, which would bring together the EU, the US and NATO, because politics, economics and security policy are increasingly interlinked."
"Secondly, we should follow the ideas of the Houston Declaration of the US Congress and the European Parliament and involve the parliamentary community more in the summit process."
"Last and not least, we should use the summit with George W. Bush to draw up an agenda for the period until 2004, to establish a deeper transatlantic partnership and to fulfil the aims that both the Council and the Commission have said they want to achieve."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ever since the end of the Second World War the transatlantic relationship has been of crucial importance."
"It has proved essential for peace and stability in Europe and the wider world."
"I understand President Bush will be attending the Gothenburg Summit. Together with my group I hope Mr Bush will be made aware that obviously, we believe our relationship should be one of equals."
"Our dialogue must be frank and sincere. We need not be brutal, but we do have to make our concerns clear, as they have been outlined in both speeches."
"In a world where globalisation in constantly increasing, it is worrying that the Bush Administration is glorying in unilateralism."
"The first sign of this was the United States' decision not to ratify the Kyoto Agreement on climate change."
"There have been other more recent moves such as the threat made by the United States to withdraw from the OECDs common actions regarding tax havens."
"In our view, this type of policy runs counter to the quest for a stable and secure international order."
"Secondly, I also believe that we must convey our disquiet at the level of unilateralism currently demonstrated with regard to certain issues which concern us both. These include the peace process in the Middle East, and also the way in which America has put the brakes on the process of detente between North and South Korea."
"I would like to comment on the missile defence shield plan, a product of the Star Wars programme. This is extremely worrying as it could affect our security."
"I think that we must tell our American colleagues quite clearly that the way to increase global security is to combat poverty and combat instability in poor countries. We must not build new barriers between the rich and the poor."
"The creation of a missile defence shield will only lead to an increase in the number of missiles. This would go against all the efforts made since the ABM Treaty to reduce the number of missiles in the world."
"We believe we should act together in relation to the UN, not adopt unilateral measures. In the specific case of the Human Rights Commission, we should start from the premise that all countries stand for election."
"Sometimes one is chosen, sometimes another. There is no scope for the introduction of retaliatory measures such as the suspension of a debt which has already expired and been unilaterally reduced."
"Lastly, I would like to say that a fortnight ago I had the opportunity of leading a visit by my group to Congress in Washington."
"We feel we need to make direct contact, regardless of what we are told."
"It was a very positive visit; we were able to address the House of Representatives' Sub-Committee on European Affairs."
"The dialogue was as it should be: frank, direct and sometimes tough."
"I would therefore like to conclude saying that my group regrets that at the eleventh hour the authorities in the United States have been unable to confirm a meeting that is important both for establishing and for maintaining mutual trust. This affects you, Mr President, as rapporteur for the Echelon Committee."
"Mr President, I listened with great interest to the long and sustained shipping metaphor of the Commissioner, who can now lay claim to be a master mariner of sorts."
"Whether it is his bulk carrier or the speedboat version that is commended by Mr Elles, I certainly think that the Commissioner's focus on deepening the relationship and on being more strategic - even if there is argument on detail - is, in broad terms very welcome."
"My group subscribes to the broad detail of the resolution, so I will not rehearse the issues."
"I agree with the observations of colleagues about fears of a drift in certain cases towards unilateralism, some of the points about bilateral versus multilateral trade and issues about Kyoto, the Echelon Committee, the death penalty, and so on."
"I want to speak a little about what our role as parliamentarians should be."
"We have developed both informally and formally a considerable dialogue with aspects of the legislative process in the US, but as a parliamentary process it remains sub-optimal."
"We need to do a lot more work on that. Our unique contribution as parliamentarians to the quality of this dialogue will be in establishing a better quality of relationship, in particular with our counterparts in the US Congress."
"It seems to me that our mission in this regard is, both in Washington DC and in Strasbourg and Brussels, to create the playing field in which the Lamys and Zellecks - or others, depending on whether we are dealing with security and defence, or whatever - can actually play."
"Because it is clear, certainly in the case of Congress, that they are a major influence on the role of the US executive, and we here are a growing influence on the executive, although we still regret the pillar system that marginalises us in areas of foreign policy or in fighting crime, and so on."
"But there is a role here, and we need to do more work on that as a unique parliamentary contribution to the playing field in which executives can deliver the goods."
"In that sense, I would like to pledge my group and my time to working on that."
"The second point I would like to mention concerns globalisation: we have noted the sclerotic effect of either Congress or ourselves legislating first and discovering that the ends do not match."
"We need in the global context to insist on appropriate regulation, but to try to discover as parliamentarians what it is."
"Is it soft law or hard law?"
"Self-regulation or co-regulation?"
"We need now to look for some degree of legislative creativity, so that there is no sclerotic dysfunction: wanting to do the right thing, but by chance arriving at another dispute."
"Finally, we should put disputes in perspective, as the Commissioner has sought to do."
"Even bananas, Boeing, beef, etc. represent no more than 2% of the flow of transatlantic trade."
"Of course, they have a high priority, but they are not the whole story and we must focus on the whole story."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, transatlantic relations seem to have drifted into quite a difficult situation."
"In my opinion, we could even speak of a sort of crisis."
"I welcomed Mrs Lindh' s suggestion that we can also express criticism when there is cause to do so."
"We can undoubtedly learn from the United States some other time, when there is occasion to do so, so this is not a question of anti-Americanism, but one of factual discussion."
"It would seem to me that what unites the European Union and the United States above all is the fact that together we are responsible, to a considerable extent, for global development, as together we make up the world' s largest trading blocs."
"I believe that in future, transatlantic relations should ensure that solutions to problems that are caused by the social inequality in the world are evolved and that together we seek the right tools to promote sustainable development."
"In this regard the Council and the Commission are also to be praised for the fact that during the Stockholm Summit Prime Minister Persson and President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, sent a letter to the President of the United States that emphasised the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and stated in particular that its policy on climate is an essential ingredient in our understanding of transatlantic relations, and no minor issue."
"This is my free interpretation of the matter at least."
"The Commissioner' s excellent comparison with a super-tanker is something I would like to take up on more or less the same lines."
"I might imagine that this tanker of ours ought to have the world' s best environmentally friendly technology, and, as Mr Cox said, it should at least have a double bottom, its engine should be very powerful and its fuel as clean as possible - preferably solar energy, if possible, Commissioner."
"I would also like to say that if the United States wishes to become the world' s last open-air museum of old technology - and I stress the word 'old' - as it is refusing to start developing climate-friendly solutions, something we cannot do anything about, the European Union must, despite that, become the world' s leading region in this regard, and we can nevertheless invite the United States to join us in implementing this climate policy, which is one that also makes for good business."
"I would finally like to say a few words about security policy."
"My group is very concerned that in the United States there is an intention to use global resources for a missile defence system."
"We think that is likely to increase the threat to peace worldwide and that the European Union should have no part in it. Instead, try and convince the USA that security in the world is to be furthered by means of solutions based on the worldwide promotion of socially and ecologically sustainable development."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we seem to have reached a turning point in transatlantic relations."
"First there is the legacy of the Clinton era."
"Even if we leave aside the serious trade differences, the emblematic banana dispute, the beef hormone dispute, the GMO dispute and a dozen others that are being or have already been examined by the WTO, we can see that in recent years, Washington had already shown growing signs of unilateralism, one of the stigmata of the superpower complex."
"Opposition to the Treaty banning anti-personnel mines, opposition to the Charter on the Rights of the Child, opposition to the establishment of an International Criminal Court that might, one day, have to judge an American citizen, a casual approach to politics and financial blackmail of the United Nations, an economic blockade, in fact a military operation that violates international law, the Echelon affair, the Colombia plan - the list is endless."
"Moreover, we have hardly had a chance to hold a dialogue with our transatlantic interlocutors about certain decisions that Europeans regard as shocking in a civilised society, such as the death penalty and the refusal to grant universal access to medicines to combat AIDS."
"Yet we have to admit that the Bush Administration' s first decisions have a more serious impact than anything we have ever seen so far."
"We were concerned enough when we heard the new President' s advisor on security, Mrs Condoleezza Rice, describe her vision of the new distribution of labour between Americans and Europeans for the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, when she pointed out with as much perspicacity as elegance that it was not the GIs' job to take children to nursery school."
"Frankly, we can only describe the refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol and the promotion of the missile defence shield as irresponsible, not only towards Europe but towards mankind as a whole."
"In view of this escalation, are we condemned to pro forma protests before settling for realism?"
"I think not."
"A Europe that is open to dialogue but adheres firmly to the principles of a civilised and responsible international community will find allies among the public opinion of the five continents and even in the US Congress and among a number of states."
"Commissioner, of course we are not trying to promote a sense of anti-Americanism or indulge in aggressive rhetoric towards a partner who is indispensable in today's world."
"We simply want to set out the clear political resolve of the Fifteen and their united front towards objectives that could meet the expectations not only of Europeans but of all those, in whatever part of the world, who wish to free themselves from the unipolar system in which they are increasingly being confined."
"We must approach the issue of transatlantic relations between the European Union and the United States in the context of the U.S. administration having redefined its strategy."
"This is to be expected, since elections there have put a new president and a new administration into office and our obligation is to closely observe the signs reaching us from across the Atlantic."
"The basic feature that, I think, distinguishes the present administration from the previous one, in terms of foreign policy, centres on a return to the priority of consolidating and developing systems of alliances with those countries that show a desire to act in harmony with the Americans. This replaces the previous model, which consisted of acting on the basis of a multilateral approach sustained through a process of ongoing negotiations, intended to establish and define multilateral and universal rules, standards and values, taking the lead, of course, from the American institutions."
"This is not the right time to analyse the practical military, diplomatic and economic consequences that this return to more traditional geopolitical concepts by the United States may involve."
"We should, however, bear in mind that the concept of democratic administration led to a proactive type of action, one consequence of which was the U.S. administration taking greater responsibility for and greater involvement in the details of almost daily crisis management in some part of the world."
"This is a concept which we feel is being abandoned. Now that this interventionist approach is being reviewed, we are beginning to agree with the Commission and the strategic direction of its document ""New impulse for EU-US Relations"" ."
"What the European Union must now do is take advantage of the arrival in office of a new US administration to review the way in which transatlantic relations are conducted and to set strict priorities to ensure that the new transatlantic agenda is more productive and constructive in terms of achieving practical results."
"Just like the Commission, we also feel that the Union' s leaders must reach agreement on a limited number of strategic themes."
"They must also ensure a high level of political engagement, in order to prevent the relationship' s processes becoming too bureaucratic and cumbersome."
"It is amazing how often holding frequent meetings and summits with heavily laden agendas has achieved nothing but the dilution of interests and a lack of vision and clear objectives."
"Let us commit ourselves, then, to a renewed transatlantic cooperation, in which the European Union and the United States are able to work effectively, together and to their mutual benefit, on the various global challenges that we inevitably have to face."
"Mr President, dark clouds are gathering over the Atlantic and they are storm clouds."
"I am not thinking only of the spiral of violence that American society feeds on and of which the string of capital punishments is only one symptom among others."
"In fact this society, which is based on genocide and whose values constantly give way to the law of the jungle that has been christened 'liberalism' , can only survive by violence; that, in the end, is something that does not concern us."
"What does concern us, however, is the custom of American policy to do what it wants where it wants in the world and to disregard all the international rules, including those it imposes on others."
"I am thinking here of the Kyoto agreements."
"Nor should we forget Washington's refusal to sign the agreement on nuclear testing, which the United States regards as applying to all states except itself, and a whole range of other agreements that show that Washington wants to tie down every state in the world without being bound in any way itself."
"Let us also remember the scandalous Echelon affair, which shows that Big Brother intends to keep watch over the entire planet while not accepting any right of inspection itself, as proved also by the insolent and scandalous reception recently given to our committee of inquiry into the network that brought his imperial highness to power."
"Worst of all, we are behaving like a rabbit fascinated by the boa constrictor or snake about to bite it and we are obeying this imperial policy; my last hope is that France will resist this general tendency of the world to grovel."
"Mr President, I think that today we are making history, and that the European Union and the United States are the two leading characters in the play unfolding before our eyes."
"Both the Commission and the Council recognise this. The purpose of the Transatlantic Dialogue is precisely to provide an opportunity to tackle these."
"We must also consider the subject of globalisation, as the Commissioner has mentioned. I think it is incumbent upon the United States and Europe to ensure that the outcome of these discussions proves positive rather than negative."
"We must welcome the initiative taken by the US at the Quebec Summit with a view to creating a free trade area for the Americas. We should be delighted that they reached the conclusion that this trade initiative should have a democratic basis."
"We have enshrined this in our cooperation agreements with third countries. As was made clear yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Mr Patten' s presence, these agreements include a democratic clause and have already been in existence for ten years."
"Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to pose one single question, and that is whether the Bush Administration is going to continue the Clinton Administration' s practice of exempting European companies from the application of Article III of the Helms-Burton law. I should like to know if this matter is to be discussed at the Transatlantic Summit."
"The Bonn Declaration was most welcome in that it committed the European Union and the United States of America to a full and equal partnership, and of course the EU and the US are both partners and competitors, particularly in trade matters."
"It is important to stress the scale of the economic relationship currently worth USD 2 billion a day, but where there is competition there will inevitably be some areas of conflict and friction, and part of the nature of the relationship is to try and contain that friction."
"I would like to quote from a Commission document about how to avoid or minimise new trade disputes."
"It says that we should consult before legislating, negotiate before litigating, compensate before retaliating and comply at any rate."
"That might be a lofty target but one worth aiming for."
"I want to comment too on Commissioner Patten's very welcome statement that he did not see any connection between being European and anti-Americanism."
"He is absolutely right."
"To be European is also to encompass a generous inclusivity about people's notions very different from our own."
"There are of course important outstanding trade disputes, the foreign sales tax one in particular, and it was worrying, to say the least, that President Clinton's last speech before he left office contained some barely veiled threats about the future of the Airbus deal and a possible dispute."
"Finally I want to commend the part of the resolution that welcomes the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue on which this Parliament has set such great store, and I very much hope we want that to continue and be strengthened as part of a constructive and good-tempered dialogue."
"Mr President, the starting point for this debate was the US rejection of the Kyoto Protocol."
"So I welcome the strong language in our compromise resolution on this."
"But we need more than words."
"We want the Commission to look at possible EU actions in response to a continued US refusal to respond to climate change, including action at the WTO, on the grounds that by not internalising its external energy costs, US goods are receiving an unfair government subsidy, which is against the rules of world trade."
"But it is not just Kyoto."
"Let us look as well at this intent to tear up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty."
"This ""Son of Star Wars"" system threatens a massive new arms race."
"Asking the US to consult before proceeding is not enough."
"We need to state very clearly that the EU calls on the US to give up this initiative and pledges itself and its Member States not to take part in this project on any level."
"If the US spent just a fraction of the resources it currently spends on missile defence on defending itself against climate change instead, the world would be a much safer place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the American trade representative Bob Zoelleck made this House an unequivocal but positive offer in the competent committees via the Kangaroo Group, namely that we jointly devise an open trade policy for increasing prosperity throughout the world, including in developing countries."
"I think that we should take up this offer and start looking at trade policy as a way of broadening transatlantic relations as a whole."
"We all know that NATO will still need to play a major role in the collective defence of Europe for a long time to come."
"We seem, understandably, to have lost all awareness of common security since 1990, which is why we need to ensure that relations between the United States of America and Europe are strengthened in every other political field."
"We should take up this offer by the US Administration."
"In doing so, we should also further the opportunity for relations between our House and the American Congress, provided that we can make our contribution here."
"You only need look at the difficulties we have experienced with data protection over recent years, because we have no jointly agreed legislation for global economic areas, to see just how far the transatlantic legislators' dialogue needs to go."
"I should like, if I may, to address one last point: the United States are now the only superpower in the world and they approach foreign policy problems as such."
"Their relations with Russia are predicated on this global position, while Europe defines its position from a regional standpoint and sees it in the context of the enlargement process."
"But that should not mean that we pass up the opportunity to pursue a joint strategic approach in this region."
"I have a feeling that we have not pursued a joint policy in connection with Ukraine over recent weeks."
"Now that the westward looking government has been ousted and Chernomyrdin has taken over as governor with the title ambassador to Kiev, it is obvious that we have made strategic blunders which we must not underestimate and which - to my chagrin - we have not discussed even once in the General Council this week."
"Madam President, in addition to what the leader of our group, Barón Crespo, said, I should like to make some observations in the context of the equal transatlantic dialogue on matters of international security."
"Firstly, our Socialist group is concerned about, and opposed to, the unilateral plans of President Bush to invest trillions in the high-tech weapons industry via a missile defence system, hence both jeopardising the ABM Treaty and possibly provoking a new arms race."
"It is of fundamental importance that we should oppose the arms race."
"We want multilateral cooperation and agreements, and support for a reformed UN."
"We want Europe and America to work together to that end."
"Unilateral action by either Europe or the US is an anachronism in an age when we are jointly responsible in our global village."
"It is precisely that joint responsibility which will lead us in Europe to share and take responsibility within NATO, via the rapid intervention force, via the payment of some 80% of the costs of reconstruction in the Balkans."
"Conversely we therefore ask the US to cooperate in conflict prevention and development aid, and to pay its contributions to the UN, because as Social-Democrats we see that some 100 conflicts in our global village are being caused by poverty, underdevelopment and ethnicity."
"The best security shield is the battle against poverty."
"That battle is the best guarantee of security against fundamentalist terror of an ethnic or religious nature, warlords and rogue states."
"We need a new, wide-ranging attitude to security and we hope that at the forthcoming meeting in Gothenburg, the Commission and the Council will make that attitude a central item on the agenda, in the open, frank, free and confident dialogue with President Bush."
"That is the route we should like to take."
"Mr President, the EU-US partnership is of crucial importance."
"We are each other' s largest trading partners and by cooperating the EU and the US can play a decisive role in tackling international trade issues."
"Now that Europe is on its way towards greater unanimity in the foreign and security field too, the necessity of working together will grow even greater."
"In fields like environmental protection and limiting CO2 emissions cooperation will be decisive."
"In the Dutch press, there was an appeal to President Bush in letter form from what the author himself called ""the profitable part of American industry"" asking the president not to listen only to inefficient companies when environmental decisions were involved."
"Robust environmental legislation makes companies more innovative, more technology-oriented and more efficient."
"At yesterday' s Kangaroo Group lunch, Mr Zoellic said that in his view and that of his government not every problem in the private sector needs to be solved by the government."
"If I combine both things, it may be possible to reach new agreements with the US."
"Whether an agreement is called Kyoto or New York is a matter of supreme indifference to us. But we must get down to work together."
"My final point concerns parliamentary relations."
"For some years, we have been enjoying better relations."
"The Legislators Dialogue has gained momentum and has begun to bear fruit."
"However, since a new Congress has taken office with all the changes in personnel that that involves, it seems difficult to make real contacts."
"The collective memory on the US side appears to have been erased."
"We are starting completely from scratch."
"That is all the more regrettable since our trade disputes could have been effectively prevented by the ""early warning"" system within the TABD and the Legislators Dialogue."
"It is still too early to express real concern."
"See my observation as part of a European ""early warning"" system."
"A light is on, but it is not yet red."
"But what will happen in a world where the word of a superpower is no longer worth the paper it is written on?"
"Mr President, I will focus on the single area of environmental issues."
"There is cause for concern over the EU-US partnership in this particular area."
"I appreciate the clarity with which the Swedish Presidency addressed these issues in the introduction."
"Experts are increasingly unanimous on the problems of global warming and its consequences."
"In addition, it is clearly the responsibility of the richer countries to reach an international agreement by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol."
"The US has particular responsibility, as the country has by far the largest emissions."
"The question is how we react."
"Should our reaction lead to a strong anti-American position?"
"No, of course not."
"However, we should continue adopting a clear and frank stance in our dialogue with the US on these issues."
"The fact that the US has not undertaken ratification must not prevent us in the EU from making progress."
"We have to take the lead in the world with regard to ratification and continue the dialogue with the US in order to bring the country on board in the future."
"That must be our position."
"The Summit in Gothenburg is an excellent opportunity to bring up the issues - in addition to the visit by President Bush, the Gothenburg Summit also has sustainable development as its main theme."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the transatlantic dialogue must be extended to encompass global transport policy because both the USA and we Europeans bear a special responsibility for greater safety in the air and at sea, better environmental protection and fair competition and fair trade practices."
"Our primary objective must be to adopt reasonable harmonised provisions in order to develop a transatlantic transport market - be it in air or sea transport - and to work towards global regulations based on harmonised regulations between the USA and Europe, for example in the area of air traffic noise."
"We do not want to end up at loggerheads with the Americans again over hushkitted aeroplanes; on the contrary, we must endeavour to regulate environmental protection and safety standards in advance, jointly and proactively."
"This is not just a task for the Commission and the US Administration. We must try, as part of the transatlantic parliamentary dialogue, to organise specialist debates between transport experts in the American congress and the European Parliament so as to avoid political pressure between the administrations or, as the result of pressure from lobbyists, by the administrations."
"We must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety."
"This will greatly benefit our people, avoid conflicts between the USA and Europe and could form the basis for an overall joint solution."
"Mr President, I think that our debate on the transatlantic dialogue has come at a very good moment."
"I need not remind Members how crucial this dialogue is with a view to achieving cooperation between equal partners, between the United States of America and the European Union."
"The dialogue allows us to deal with our differences and to settle some of our old trade disputes; here I am thinking in particular of bananas, an issue we finally resolved a few weeks ago."
"I want to emphasise the importance of the question of European defence, an issue I regard as extremely important, in particular now that we are dealing with a new American Administration that has already openly advertised its defence projects."
"It is quite clear that President Bush's Administration is far more distrustful of the ESDP than President Clinton's was, but that does not surprise me."
"It took the Union several years to explain its objectives, define its means and convince its American ally that a European defence system could be developed alongside NATO."
"Today we must at all costs protect this achievement of the transatlantic dialogue."
"The concept of an ally must not be a one-way road."
"I believe that the Union has shown itself to be entirely transparent in the way it has presented the CESP, followed by the ESDP, to the United States and I think it should make it just as clear that the United States must consult its allies on all major projects, of which the anti-missile shield project is one."
"Regarding European defence policy as such, we must continue to state firmly what we want, as we always have done, and not systematically look at every European defence question in terms of NATO's reaction."
"The Union has always emphasised the importance of complementarity between European action and Alliance action, especially in relation to the Petersberg tasks."
"The issue here is neither competition nor disengagement, but simply a united approach."
"Mr President, I will be extremely brief as I am aware that Parliament has other business to attend to."
"I agree with Mr Barón Crespo that the EU and the US have a joint global responsibility to combat poverty, reduce tensions and promote disarmament."
"Discussions on US missile defence should continue."
"The Gothenburg Summit will be an ideal occasion to demonstrate the points on which we agree, e.g. regarding the Balkans and the Middle East, and those on which there is no agreement, be it unilateral action within the UN, contributions to the UN, the Kyoto Protocol or environmental issues."
"However, if we are to influence the US on those areas in which there is no agreement, making contact with the new administration is not enough."
"Instead, we also need contact with the US congress."
"I wish Parliament success in this area."
"I should like to inform you that I have received six motions for resolutions under Rule 37 paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"VOTE"
"There are two amendments that we are concerned about regarding port state control."
"We can partly accept both Amendments Nos 1 and 2 with the qualifications which were set out in the plenary session."
"Mr Watts has requested the floor."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for indicating the support of the Commission, in principle, for both amendments being tabled in plenary today."
"But I seek clarification on Amendment No 1."
"Whilst in principle the Commission is saying it supports our demand for ""black box"" voyage data recorders to be fitted to all ships, can it confirm that relates not just to new ships, but also to existing and old ships? It is an important clarification."
"I would appreciate a statement from the Commissioner on that particular point."
"The next item is the vote on the Conference of Presidents' proposals on the European Parliament's calendar of plenary part-sessions in 2002."
"Madam President, I appreciate the tactics, but would it not be more democratic if you waited until everybody came in, sat down and took part in this vote?"
"It is the last one on our schedule today and it is not a coincidence that it has been taken out of turn."
"No, Mrs Doyle, it is not the last vote this morning."
"And I am indeed sorry that Members did not all feel it necessary to listen to Mr Schuster's excellent speech."
"But that does not matter now and they are welcome to join us again."
"Before the vote on block 1 by Mr Posselt and others:"
"Madam President, this vote is extremely important because, now that we have done away with Fridays, mini part-sessions are illegal."
"If we do not need Fridays, then we do not need extra part-sessions, which is why we really must hold these votes separately and reject each mini part-session separately."
"Before the vote on block 2 by the Technical Group of Independent Members:"
"Madam President, whenever amendments are tabled, the name of the author is given."
"With regard to the Technical Group of Independent Members, I would like to make it quite clear to the House that these two blocks of amendments were tabled by the seven radical members of the group."
"Thank you for that clarification."
"After the vote:"
"Madam President, since it has now been established for two years in succession that a majority of Parliament does not want Friday to be included on the calendar of part-sessions for Strasbourg, I would ask you next year to submit a calendar on which Fridays are not included."
"I think that that would be consistent with the democracy we practise in this Chamber."
"Thank you, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt."
"The Conference of Presidents will act as it sees fit."
"I now have to join the President of Slovakia."
"The voting, however, will continue."
". (FR) The only reason we voted for this proposal for a regulation was because if we had voted against it that might have suggested agreement with those who are opposed even to this minimum aid to poor countries."
"Having said that, these proposals are inadequate, cynical and hypocritical."
"For anyone to pretend, for example, that this aid can 'contribute to world food security' and 'respond to emergency food situations and other food needs' when several hundred of millions of people in the world find themselves in emergency situations, if not in extreme distress, mainly because the European powers represented here in Parliament plundered them in the past, is a cheap attempt to salve their conscience."
"Ludford recommendation (B5­340/2001)"
"Although this proposal is merely a statement of position and does not set out the means of imposing its recommendations, we voted for it because racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are some of the worst forms of barbarism still alive in society today."
"Our vote is also the expression of our solidarity with all those who are fighting this scourge, as also with its victims, in particular on the territory of the European Union, which has the sad privilege of having produced its most despicable forms and is still affected by it today."
"Area of freedom, security and justice (B5-339/2001)"
"The proposal for a recommendation on the position of the European Union at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance contains a number of positive points."
"But there is, indeed, 'no room for complacency' in Europe."
"In fact, 50 years after the Holocaust, certain member countries played an active part in the genocide in Rwanda and many European minorities, such as gypsies, are still being persecuted today."
"The centuries of slavery and colonisation weigh heavy in the history of the member countries."
"However, many countries continue to be pressurised and remain dependent and immigration policies give cause for concern."
"We have expressed our views on this before."
"The criminalisation of immigrants is a real scandal against people who are fleeing from political or economic oppression."
"If we are actively to combat racism and xenophobia, we must respect the right of asylum, formulate a policy for regularising the status of all those without the necessary papers in Europe and grant nationals of third countries the right to vote and stand at all elections."
"Those are a few of the measures with which we can fight racism and xenophobia effectively."
"If it wants to satisfy the citizens' needs, the European Union must finally decide to cancel the debt and impose the Tobin tax."
"The World Conference against Racism, Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism and Intolerance can and must be seen as a unique opportunity to undertake an in-depth examination of these disturbing phenomena and to adopt measures that could put an end to them."
"It is nevertheless crucial that we do not conceal the fact that many of the intolerant attitudes seen in our societies are caused by feelings of insecurity resulting from situations created by the collective redundancies of thousands of workers, by the increasing lack of job security and by the loss of rights."
"Nevertheless, given the reduction in funds that the European Union and the Member States give to the LDCs and the general lack of support for their development, we might easily conclude that the only chance of survival for many men and women from these countries is to emigrate to the 'rich' countries."
"Furthermore, given that barriers to the movement of immigrant workers in the European Union are being continually erected, and this is a situation that could now be changed to some extent in order to attract the technical specialists that we are lacking, and that problems are systematically created for the family reunification of these citizens, it is hard to believe that we are contributing to their integration."
"We shall be voting in favour of this resolution, but we feel that, in addition to declaring politically correct intentions, we must take action."
"This is why the European Union must set an example."
"I abstained on the vote because no mention or condemnation was made of the recent attempt of the French Parliament to brand and outlaw certain Bible Protestants in France as sectarian."
"The intolerance of the State and the courts of France against these Protestants should have been mentioned and condemned."
"The EU Parliament too often closes its eyes to the persecution of such Protestants within its bounds."
"In the resolution it has just adopted on questions relating to the police, justice and the free movement of persons, the European Parliament is once again calling for the complete 'communitarisation' of immigration policy and all related policies, such as asylum and temporary protection."
"Meanwhile we must once again repeat the point that although European coordination is obviously essential, the people of each country must have the sovereign power to make the final decision determining who may remain on its territory."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam had already transferred these matters to a Community framework by taking them away from the national parliaments, but with two vital derogations from the usual procedures: the Commission must share its power of initiative to propose texts with the Member States during a transitional period fixed at not more than five years after the entry into force of Amsterdam (i.e. until 1 May 2004); the Council will take its decisions not by a qualified majority but unanimously for at least five years, which means that for the time being each country retains its sovereign decision-making power."
"These are the two derogations to which the European Parliament's resolution for which we voted today is most strongly opposed: it disputes that the Member States have any right to propose texts, on the pretext that they would exercise this power in an uncoordinated manner; it wishes the qualified majority system to apply more widely (or perhaps totally; this is not made quite clear), a wish that would largely be granted by the Treaty of Nice if it is ratified."
"We take the opposite position: if it came to the point that immigration questions were decided by a majority, that would take the power away from the countries and put it in the hands of uncontrollable lobbies, or perhaps even to one member country that was better placed than the others in the decision-making procedures."
"For the good of Europe these powers, the power of proposal and of decision, should remain among the sovereign competences of each nation."
"In particular, direct decision-making power should be returned to the national parliaments."
"The motion for a resolution itself recognises that 'the Member States and the Council are not succeeding in implementing a common policy in the areas of asylum and immigration' ."
"As for national policies, instead of becoming more flexible they are more and more restrictive."
"Within the European Union, capital has been able to move freely for a long time now, as have goods."
"But not people."
"That is tantamount to admitting that this European Union was not made for people but for capital and those who possess it."
"Obviously, we voted against this motion for a resolution."
"We repeat our demand for the total freedom of establishment and movement for all those who live and work in one of the European Union countries and their entitlement to the same political, legal and social rights as citizens of the Community."
"- (SV) I have voted against the motion for a resolution."
"This initiative and its classification are, in my view, the wrong way for the European Parliament to handle such a fundamental constitutional issue as the entire EU decision mechanism, including the proposal to abolish the pillar structure in the area of justice in favour of the Community method with full co-determination for the European Parliament."
"The Posselt report has not been before the Standing Committee on the Constitution, which is a clear omission."
"In point 33, for example, the wording is very unclear and also poorly supported on such an important issue as whether the European Union should establish its own force for European border protection."
"González Álvarez report (A5-0133/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I would like to address Mr González Álvarez, if I may, for, last night, the great Italian fashion designer Valentino phoned me. ""Hello."
"Is Mr Fatuzzo there?"""
"""Speaking,"" I replied."
"""Mr Fatuzzo,"" said Valentino, ""we Italian, French and European fashion designers are extremely concerned."
"""What about?"" I asked him."
"""We are concerned about Mrs Laura González Álvarez' report on product safety because, you see, our products, our clothes are dangerous."
"We consider them dangerous because they are sexy, provocative and fascinating."""
"""That is true,"" I said, ""but why are you phoning me? I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party."""
"""Because,"" Mr Valentino replied, ""as you know, pensioners sometimes suffer from heart problems and so your votes are even more dangerous for them."
"Please help us!"""
"I therefore voted for the motion in order to prevent safety criteria being applied to clothes."
"The removal of borders and the achievement of the single market on 1 January 1993 highlighted the existence of a market of more than 370 million consumers, for which accompanying rules had to be drawn up to guarantee them a number of rights."
"Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety (DGPS) was drawn up to that end."
"Although the general approach of the directive adopted in 1992 proved satisfactory, the objectives set out in it were not all achieved because of the lack of clarity or gaps in some of its provisions."
"The proposal is interesting overall, but several highly important amendments that Parliament had adopted at first reading, in particular the amendments on the safety of services, the precautionary principle, product monitoring and the European product safety network were not incorporated."
"The responsible parliamentary committee therefore decided, justifiably, to table them again."
"Conversely, the common position does include Parliament's amendments on charity shops in a recital that stipulates that, in relation to charitable activities, it may prove impossible to provide information on the origin of a product and the risks it might contain."
"The Council has also introduced certain innovations in relation to the Commission's initial proposal, in particular:"
"Modification of the definitions of 'product' and 'safe product' to clarify the scope of the directive, especially in regard to services;"
"Introduction, again for the sake of clarification, of additional definitions relating to 'serious risk' and 'withdrawal' ;"
"Introduction of a three-stage procedure, with the right of appeal to the regulatory committee, in order to define European standards;"
"Additional provisions to encourage producers and distributors to become more involved in the voluntary sector."
"These proposals go in the right direction."
"Product safety must be taken into consideration when the rules governing the single market are adopted."
"That is a vital condition for restoring consumer confidence, which has been somewhat shaken by the scandals of all kinds that have blown up recently. It is vital to the sound operation of the single market."
"Amending this directive is, therefore, a step in the right direction."
"The Council common position, adopted on 12 February 2001, accepted 21 of the 30 amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"Nevertheless, it left out important issues which the rapporteur has referred back to the European Parliament for second reading, and for which we have voted."
"First and foremost, the introduction of the precautionary principle in the marketing of products and in measures to be taken in risk management."
"This is a general principle, used by public authorities and must be referred to explicitly with regard to the powers and obligations of Member States."
"Furthermore, the Council common position abandons the idea of a total ban on exporting products that present serious risks, despite clarifying the concept of partial bans or no bans whatsoever, without presenting any criteria for choosing which ban to apply."
"We should, therefore, reinstate the European Commission' s original proposal."
"Lastly, another important issue is safety in the field of services."
"As the rapporteur says, the Commission must present rapid proposals for the safety of services."
"The Commission must identify the needs and priorities for Community action in this field, and the responsibilities of service providers, taking account of the clarifications of the common position on the scope of application of the present directive."
"On this topic the interests of industry continue to clash with those of the consumer and the environment."
"Most companies no longer oppose the idea that protecting consumers against unsafe products is desirable."
"In the single European market they are prepared to withdraw products that damage their good reputation."
"On the other hand, when it is a matter of concrete measures by government, they are quick to complain that these restrict their freedom excessively, and exert pressure on Parliament to reject them."
"Initially the Commission quite rightly claimed the right to decree a complete export ban on dangerous products."
"It is madness that companies based in our countries should try to earn money from products that we consider unsafe for European consumers."
"The Council seriously curbed those powers, probably under pressure from protesting companies who lobby their own national governments to protect the country' s exports."
"I support the rapporteur in her aim of maintaining those powers and in addition of taking more safety measures before 2003."
"It is reprehensible that good decisions by Parliament require 314 at second reading and as a result can often not be maintained in the face of opposition by the Council."
"As a British member I was very concerned when the proposed directive was first discussed in the Environment Committee that it would inflict severe financial and bureaucratic damage on the flourishing British and Irish charity shop industry - largely unknown elsewhere in the EU - which raises so much money for good causes, and is also extremely sound environmentally by recycling and reusing large quantities of second-hand goods, which it then makes available cheaply to the consumer in its retail outlets."
"I was therefore delighted that the common position of the Council returned to this House for a second reading incorporates the exemptions required for charity shops, inspired by my original amendment, from the need to keep records of the identity of purchasers of, in particular, second-hand electrical and electronic goods which constitute only a small part of their overall business."
"This was a victory for common sense and has pleased the industry and my London constituents, and I thank the rapporteur and Commission for this derogation."
". I welcome this report on general product safety which offers yet further proof of Europe working for our citizens."
"People across Europe are becoming increasingly worried about the safety of consumer products, such as children's toys."
"We in the European Parliament are addressing this concern in a sensible, common-sense manner."
"There were fears that the British tradition of charity shops would be threatened by these proposals."
"I am pleased that Labour MEPs worked to prevent these from being affected by this directive."
"It is ludicrous to think that the average charity shop, flea market or car boot sale can provide the authorities with information about product risks and product origin for second-hand goods acquired from the general public."
"Overall, this directive is an enormous step forward in ensuring a consistent and high level of consumer protection."
"It also creates the efficient functioning of the single market to benefit people, not just business."
"We must not allow hidden dangers to consumers to creep in unseen through the back door."
"I urge this House to move ahead from these proposals to look at the safety of services and the liability of service providers and to adopt the precautionary principle."
"Public confidence in the safety of products has taken a real knock in recent years following a number of scares, especially in children's toys."
"Only by taking a safety first attitude - and being seen to take a safety first attitude - can public confidence be restored."
"Watts report (A5-0140/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, with regard to Mr Watts' report on shipboard living and working conditions, I received a 'phone call from an old friend, the purser, Mr Augusto Fazio, who used to sail with me - and still sails - between New York and the Bahamas."
"He complained: ""Working conditions on board ships are hard and tiresome."
"We have to work during the day and at night and we are poorly paid."
"I would like Europe genuinely to concern itself more - it is already taking an interest but not enough - in our pay and also in our pensions, for I am approaching retirement age""."
"I therefore welcomed Mr Watts' report and was happy to vote for the motion."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of improved European rules governing safety at sea."
"We have voted in favour of increasing the number of inspections, of refusing all ships sailing with blacklisted flags access to EU ports and of requiring all new ships to be fitted with black boxes, as they are called."
"Many accidents involving pollution could have been avoided by means of better safety."
"We have seen all too many accidents in the last couple of years."
"There was the loss of the tanker, Erika, off the Brittany coast in December 1999, resulting in considerable oil pollution, and the loss of the Italian chemical tanker, Ievoli Sun."
"Most recently, we have seen an extensive oil spill in the Baltic."
"The oil spill in the Baltic could have been avoided."
"Better European rules were needed."
"The ship owners do not think that a black box has anything to do with safety."
"However, that is not the case."
"A black box is very useful in the investigation after two ships have collided, as happened, for example, in the Baltic."
"If we become better at discovering the causes of accidents, we also become better at preventing them."
"We cannot wait for international rules in the IMO."
"The EU must take the lead in the IMO by adopting better rules."
"We cannot compromise on safety."
"We must have safety so that fish, birds and people can use the sea without being covered in oil and chemicals."
"Even though the Commission's proposals aim to strengthen port state control by increasing the number of inspections and adopting more rigorous procedures, we wonder what has become of the governments' political resolve to prevent further oil slicks, 16 months after the shipwreck of the Erika."
"The legislation must be applied by all the Member States, including Belgium, Portugal, France, Ireland and the Netherlands."
"Moreover, adequate resources must be earmarked for these controls, which in concrete terms means hiring more inspectors, widening their powers and areas of control, especially in regard to respect for social security rules and the living and working conditions of the crews."
"The proposal to equip as many vessels as possible, from oil tankers to bulk carriers and passenger ships, with VDRs or 'black boxes' is a positive one, but this must not exempt the states from carrying out the necessary inspections."
"It will also be necessary to create as soon as possible a team of European inspectors and coast-guards and allocate them adequate financial, human and material resources."
"Furthermore, the Council's proposals on 'black-list' flags are still too timid."
"It must take a much firmer stance against flags of convenience, especially those from Member States and from the islands of Kerguelen and Wallis and Futuna Islands."
"We must require their suppression and ban all vessels that do not respect these rules from sailing in Community waters."
"Eighteen months after the shipwreck of the Erika, need we remind anyone of the distress, the suffering, the anger of the people living along our Atlantic Coast, whose maritime and tourist activities have been so hard hit?"
"Need we remind anyone how long it took to pay out compensation, which in many cases has still not been received, and how inadequate that compensation was?"
"The day after this tragic accident, speaking in this Chamber, I proposed adopting the following broad policy guidelines:"
"The 'polluter cleans up' principle: will we leave it to the communities, to the citizens who are the victims, to clean up our coast?"
"The 'polluter pays' principle: we must underline the liability of the ship-owners and operators in this type of disaster."
"Rapid and complete compensation of the victims."
"Maintenance of the Community fleet and shipyards at an acceptable level, rather than allowing fleets to develop in our seas and our ports over which we have no control, which fly flags of convenience that are quite untraceable."
"Strengthening the Community legislation providing for the inspection and classification of ships operating in Community waters and a ban on dangerous ships."
"Eighteen months later, what has become of the measures we called for?"
"We welcome the proposals on which Parliament voted today and which go in the right direction."
"The Watts report is concerned with strengthening port state control and with rigorous inspections and procedures."
"We support the rapporteur's calls for the use of voyage data recorders."
"In the Ortuondo report, we welcome the more stringent legislation on ship-classification societies."
"We also note with interest the progress of the 'Erika II package' , which we await impatiently."
"Yet we are still far from taking the necessary measures in regard to compensating the victims, applying the principle of the 'polluter cleans up' , restoring the balance of sea transport between the various Community ports and encouraging the maintenance and development of our merchant fleets."
"The overcrowding of European ports, especially in the Channel and the North Sea, makes these measures all the more urgent."
"Ortuondo Larrea report (A5-0144/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, with regard to the Ortuondo Larrea report on the safety inspection of ships, I have to say that, although I voted for the motion, I would have preferred the classification societies appointed by the governments to inspect ships and to give the ships that sail our seas and the seas outside the Mediterranean free reign, to be assisted in carrying out these inspections by pensioner sailors, pensioner quartermasters, pensioner engine room officials and pensioner chief stewards, who have a wealth of experience and are highly qualified to assess whether ships are truly safe."
"President."
"At last, I understand what is going on!"
"In fact, I was wondering whether there was a plant in the audience that was not really a plant!"
"Now I understand!"
"Today we are voting, at second reading, on the Ortuondo Larrea report on classification societies."
"Some of the amendments are heading in the right direction by proposing a strict ban on the Administration employing recognised organisations if they have economic interests in the management or properties of ships, or by reaffirming the need for coherence between the European standards and the IMO."
"We cannot accept some others, which seek to reduce the financial liabilities."
"They only aim to ensure that for the rules of competition between states, regardless of the scale of the consequences due to errors or negligence of the recognised organisation."
"Liability must be full and complete and the court or tribunal must judge and decide freely, on the basis of the real nature of each disaster."
"As often happens, the report proposes improvements in transparency or harmonisation, but limits their actual scope by not making provision for adequate financial sanctions."
"This package to increase safety at sea is a reaction to the accident with the Erika on 12 December 1999."
"Despite the fact that a plethora of Parliament's proposed amendments have been adopted, such as the exclusion of classification societies with some form of business, personal or family links to the shipowner or operator, greater transparency by requiring classification societies to ensure that all relevant information is made available to all interested parties on their websites, scrutiny of classification societies where the accident rate recorded by the ships classed is excessively high, the Council and Parliament still disagree on two very important points, which is why a conciliation procedure would appear to be in order if the recommendations before us, which we support, are accepted."
"Firstly: the European Parliament proposed that ceilings should be placed on the financial liability of classification societies in the event of an accident caused by wilful act, omission or gross negligence in their survey work."
"The Council was in favour of a regulation which allowed the Member States to set the maximum amounts payable, with the amounts set by Parliament here as minimum, not maximum amounts."
"Secondly: the Council has not accepted that there should be regular, mutual consultations between recognised organisations with a view to guaranteeing that their technical standards are equivalent to the provisions of IMO Resolution A.837 (29) and that the Commission should be provided with regular reports on fundamental progress made on these standards and their willingness to cooperate with port state control administrations."
"As my group is positive that a common standpoint can be found for both outstanding problems, we feel that a conciliation procedure would be in order."
"van Dam report (A5-0151/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, as you can see, sometimes the Pensioners' Party gains fresh support from people as important as the Members of the European Parliament, even if only for explanations of vote on individual measures."
"I hope that Mr van Dam's report will receive just as much support."
"I voted for this report, which establishes a regulation on the safety of the carriage of goods by road and the safety of drivers who drive international heavy goods vehicles in Europe."
"The report also says that it is essential for the salaries and working conditions of drivers in Europe to be standardised, so as not to distort competition."
"However, that means that, in order to prevent distortion of competition, the rules governing pension contributions should also be standardised, and drivers' pensions should be standardised too."
"Therefore, what is stopping us from giving the European Union the competence to regulate the salaries and pensions of all Europeans?"
"The report on which this proposal is based 'shows that a number of EU transport firms use a variety of underhand means for using cheap vehicles and staff from third countries."
"The costs of both equipment and staff are significantly lower than in the EU.'"
"That means that a number of road transport firms employ underpaid drivers, working in precarious conditions, for transport outside the country in which they are based."
"What worries the rapporteur most, however, is not the situation of the drivers, their excessively low wages or unacceptable working conditions, but the resulting 'distortions of competition' ."
"The proposed solution is the compulsory introduction of a 'uniform driver attestation' in all the EU Member States."
"It would have been preferable to make the hauliers pay the same wages, whether or not the driver is an EU national."
"The best way to combat 'social dumping' would have been to impose a minimum wage aligned with that of the country where it is highest."
"Yet the European authorities prefer to impose a uniform administrative document throughout the European Union, rather than making the hauliers pay decent wages and provide decent working conditions for all their drivers, whatever their country of origin."
"This shows that the envisaged reform is not concerned with the workers, which is why we abstained."
"The Van Dam report on the eventual introduction of a uniform attestation for all drivers engaged in road transport within the territory of the Community is a positive step."
"However, we do not take the same stance as the rapporteur, who is in favour of 'fair competition' in this sector."
"The single market liberalised the carriage of goods by road."
"The companies then used a variety of underhand means for using cheap equipment and staff from third countries."
"A certain complacency has arisen in this field, similar to that found in transport by sea."
"The road hauliers' search for profit at any price leads to the over-exploitation of labour, which seriously increases the risk factor of this mode of transport."
"We emphasise the need to harmonise labour law for drivers travelling within the Community territory at the most favourable levels achieved, beginning with their training, working hours and working conditions, pay and pensions."
"Moreover, it is imperative for the Member States to recruit enough monitors and inspectors to ensure respect for existing legislation."
"It is mainly for these reasons that we are voting for this report."
"Calendar of part-sessions"
"Since we have no special preferences regarding the duration of part-sessions, we abstained from the vote on the proposed calendar."
"Yet we do believe that whatever the majority that emerges from Members' votes, the employees of the European Parliament, officials and others, must not be made to suffer in any way from this decision, and in particular must not have their salaries reduced."
"There is no reason to penalise the staff simply because of the way the Members choose to work, i.e. their own convenience."
". (NL) On behalf of the Netherlands delegation I wish to report that we have voted in favour of abolition of Friday sittings, on the assumption that a thorough reform of our parliamentary work is necessary, to allow more time for legislative work."
"We hope that our decision will be seen as a pragmatic and not a moral one."
"Stihler report (A5- 150/2001)"
"Madam President, this was an extremely important report."
"Right across Europe, the abuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is a growing problem."
"In Ireland the level of alcohol abuse by young people has grown dramatically over the years."
"One of the things we need to look at is the whole advertising campaign by the alcohol industry."
"The alcohol industry portrays alcohol as something that is necessary to enjoy life."
"It portrays the abuse of alcohol as something that is acceptable in society."
"Yet when you look at what happens in society - not just to young people but also to older people - one of the major problems we have is the abuse of alcohol, which contributes to violence in the home, violence on the streets and to serious crime."
"We have to address this issue."
"One of the best ways of addressing this is by looking at the advertising industry."
"For example, there is a restriction on cigarette advertising on television, yet there is no restriction on alcohol advertising on television."
"There is something seriously wrong here."
"Yes, smoking damages health and causes major problems for the smoker and for passive smokers."
"But alcohol causes major problems throughout society, from health problems, to violence, to abuse against other people and the persons themselves."
"We need to consider whether it is acceptable that the alcohol industry can advertise in such a carte blanche fashion."
"It is completely unacceptable."
"We need to address this."
"We need proper restrictions on the advertising of alcohol."
"It is a drug and should be accepted and recognised as such."
"It should not be promoted as something that is necessary to enjoy life, because it is not."
"Mr President, I fully support the report on the recommendation on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents."
"Who would not do so?"
"What is important is that recommendations are not issued for reducing the alcohol consumption of elderly people for, it is well-known, when taken in moderation, alcohol is beneficial to health."
"The report proves conclusively and extensively in its introduction - inter alia - that: a) the probability of adults' developing an addiction (alcoholism) increases significantly if they start drinking as children or adolescents, b) the use/abuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is increasing continuously in all the countries of the ÅU, c) many countries in the ÅU produce ""alcopops"", i.e. refreshments containing alcohol, which are freely sold to children and adolescents, d) there is a direct and worrying link between violence and antisocial behaviour and between road traffic accidents (deaths, disabilities) and the use of alcohol by children and adolescents."
"The rapporteur is therefore quite right to raise these major issues."
"However, just when you would expect fundamental proposals to combat this very serious problem, all you find is a series of amendments urging awareness-raising and recommending and encouraging producers to stop producing alcopops and bar waiters and owners to avoid selling alcoholic beverages to children and adolescents and include cheap, non-alcoholic drinks on their menus."
"Advertising should be directed solely at adults, inexperienced drivers should avoid having more than 0.2% alcohol in their bloodstream and parents, associations and sports personalities should persuade children and adolescents to resist the massive onslaught by manufacturers, retailers, bar and club owners and advertisers."
"At the same time, we should rely on these people to act altruistically and to stop selling or advertising alcohol to children."
"In other words, trivial, anodyne, fragmentary proposals which, at best, are ingenuous, in that they are a long way from dealing with a problem which claims the health and lives of millions of minors."
"Nowhere did we find any reference to the causes of the problem or any proposal to deal with the huge financial interests which use all means, fair and foul, to manufacture, market and promote alcohol to children and adolescents."
"Obviously, unless these issues are addressed, any proposal will just be an ""aspirin"", a simple wish list which merely perpetuates and exacerbates the problem."
"Finally, we note that the introduction to the report stresses that, under no circumstances, will even these anodyne proposals - which will run off the back of economic interests and profiteering - become binding proposals or legislation; they will simply remain as recommendations to the Member States."
"- (SV) We believe that the focus of alcohol policy should be decided at national level."
"Issues of taxation, retail monopolies, advertising, import restrictions and age limits should all be decided by the individual Member States."
"The Stihler report addresses a recommendation from the Council in this area."
"As it is not a matter of legislation for Member States, we have voted for the proposal, as we share its main political stance."
"We all know that alcohol consumption is high, with all of the unfortunate consequences that this entails, specifically when young people are concerned."
"As a recent survey of fifteen- and sixteen-year-old adolescents revealed, the highest levels of excessive consumption are seen in Ireland, the United Kingdom and in Denmark."
"It is these last two, however, together with Finland, France and Sweden, that have the highest percentages of young people who have been drunk at, or under, the age of 13."
"Studies that have been carried out show a strong link between alcohol consumption and anti-social behaviour such as violence, and that immoderate consumption of alcohol is a proven factor in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, crime and road traffic accidents."
"Furthermore, consumer habits acquired in youth can also affect health and set longer-term consumption patterns, which means that we must not only give a commitment to health promotion, education and information policies, but also to measures limiting alcohol consumption by children and adolescents and structural actions in the field of treating young people and helping them to better adapt to society."
"The Commission' s proposal, however, is extremely superficial and starts from the premise that those who stand to benefit from alcohol sales will work to prevent greater consumption amongst children and adolescents, which is quite a utopian idea, as is well known."
"The rapporteur goes somewhat further in her proposals, and tries to lay down certain rules and stresses the need for more precise codes of conduct, but what is really needed is for the Member States to pay greater attention to this problem."
"If we are to pursue a responsible policy we must concern ourselves with the health of Europeans, particularly the youngest among them."
"Therefore, we need to be very vigilant in face of the rising alcohol consumption by children and adolescents."
"That is why I voted for this recommendation of the European Parliament, which calls on the Member States to take measures to protect young people."
"Action should therefore be taken in the European Community countries to raise public awareness of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption and persuade children, adolescents, but also parents, to be more responsible for their actions."
"Children and adolescents are particularly receptive to the messages transmitted to them and the appropriate educational action could therefore produce practical results."
"We must remember that young people are the main victims of the murderous road accidents caused by alcohol abuse."
"Furthermore, if the appropriate messages were disseminated to make even the youngest children aware of the dangers of excess alcohol consumption, that could prevent some of the tragedies we have seen."
"At the same time, we have to distinguish between different drinks."
"We know, for example, that the moderate consumption of wine can have beneficial effects on health."
"That is why we certainly do not wish to condemn the producers."
"Our aim is to put a stop to the excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks among young people."
"Yet the producers do have a role to play."
"They should not target their commercial and advertising campaigns specifically at adolescents."
"We know what an impact these campaigns can have on young people, so this temptation must be suppressed in favour of preventive measures."
"Lastly, we should give some thought to whether it might prove effective to affix warning labels to the products, as France is doing in relation to advertising."
"The consumption of alcohol by adolescents and, alas, more and more often by children, is a real cause for concern and we must do our utmost, we who are supposed to be responsible adults, to protect young Europeans against the abuse or, as the rapporteur calls it, the harmful use of alcohol."
"That is why we will vote for Mrs Stihler' s report and for most of her amendments."
"I would add, however, that the protection of children and adolescents against certain abuses must be absolute."
"Yes, we must protect the youth of Europe against alcoholism."
"But we must also protect it against drugs, including the drugs some people dare describe as 'soft' ."
"We must also protect it against the actions of perverts, against the sexual practices that some left-wingers advocated in the 1970s in order to 'shock the bourgeoisies and justify their shameful paedophilia."
"That is why I am surprised that a report such as Mrs Stihler' s can coexist, within this Chamber, with militant speeches in favour of decriminalising the use of cannabis or against the death penalty."
"We cannot have two weights and two measures when it comes to the health, the stability and the future of our children."
"Swedish alcohol policy differs from that of many other EU Member States."
"The restrictive sale of alcohol, the ban on alcohol advertising and the high age limits are vital tools for limiting the damage caused by alcohol, both in young people and adults."
"We want to retain this system."
"Mrs Stihler' s report on drinking of alcohol by children and adolescents is very detailed and an example of extensive meddling."
"We are convinced that European level is not the right level at which to decide on such detailed regulations for issues such as how alcohol may be displayed in shops."
"The work on reducing the damage caused by alcohol among children and young people must be adapted to the various regulations on alcohol sales of each Member State."
"Therefore, we are voting against this proposal."
"While I fully agree with the objectives and the measures proposed in this legislative proposal to restrict the consumption of alcohol by adolescents and young people, I cannot endorse the rapporteur's proposals that, directly or indirectly, assimilate alcohol, tobacco and drugs, or the proposals that are of a repressive nature."
"The fight against alcoholism among minors should be based on education towards healthy living, information, persuasion and the active participation of the producers and retailers of alcoholic products."
"The Commission's original text was more consistent with that objective than some of the amendments that were finally incorporated."
"For these reasons, I preferred to abstain."
"Sturdy report (A5-142/2001)"
"Mr President, we are constantly calling for environmentally-friendly, ecological production methods in multipurpose agriculture."
"We already have a long tradition of this in Austria, where the rethinking process started in the minds of farmers and consumers a long time ago, unlike in many other countries of the EU."
"We farmers in Austria are at the vanguard here and I am convinced that this approach is also the right approach for European agriculture."
"I therefore support the Commission proposal, which could be integrated into a European agricultural model."
"That is why I voted against the proposed amendments which seek to exceed the 90-animal limit for premium payments - I refer to Amendments Nos 1, 10, 2 and 12 - and I am sorry that they attracted a majority during the vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in amending the common organisation of the market in beef and veal, we have taken an urgently needed step in the right direction, i.e. towards extensifying cattle farming."
"Apart from reducing beef production, I am also in favour of safeguarding a minimum wage for small holdings and increasing animal premiums."
"However, the European Union still needs to be prepared for any sudden crises in the future."
"It is not yet clear if the funding for this regulation from the savings made from reforms under Agenda 2000 will last."
"Promoting agriculture with no upper limits and arbitrarily shifting money from the organisation of the market into rural development will upset any budget planning in the long term."
"This problem has yet to be resolved."
"Mr President, the matter at hand is the measures adopted as a result of the fight against BSE."
"Well then, in the middle of a chat, Daisy cow says to Buttercup cow: ""Have you heard?"
"Isn't BSE a good thing!"
"Maybe we will not all have to end our days as beef steaks!"""
"""You're right,"" says Buttercup to Daisy, ""but I bet that all these actions and studies of the European Union governments will just lead them to say: 'These cows live too long, they receive a pension for too long and we do not have enough money.'"
"I bet that, when all is said and done, we will end up as steaks after all."""
"""I do hope not,"" replied the other cow."
"I also hope that this will not happen."
"I therefore voted for the motion."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Commission' s proposal concerning the organisation of the market for beef."
"We have also voted against Parliament' s report."
"Both proposals are along the wrong lines."
"The crisis in the beef sector must be used to reform the organisation of the market, not to introduce still more aid."
"We have therefore voted against all amendments aimed at increasing aid."
"The proposal is all too short-term."
"It does not limit the production of beef."
"Instead, the proposal will introduce still more bureaucratic and expensive premium schemes."
"Instead, the opportunity should be taken to reform the organisation of the market."
"That mainly means reducing prices."
"The crisis in the beef sector is not only about structural inequality in the market for beef, but undoubtedly also about a lack of consumer confidence in food safety."
"The crisis is therefore a good reason for embarking upon a fundamental reform of agricultural policy."
"For a long time the European institutions encouraged, thanks to subsidies, the kind of intensive farming and cattle rearing that suits the interests of the agro-food industry."
"Intensive breeding and the massive use of animal and bone meal led to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy."
"Even after it was clearly established that animal and bone meal was responsible for propagating this disease, the European institutions continued to conceal this evil and to hand out subsidies to promote consumption and marketing."
"Faced with the scale of the disaster, the European authorities eventually and belatedly changed their approach."
"Under cover of financing measures to make up for the errors of the preceding period, they rushed into a policy of 'purchase for destruction' , which it is difficult to reconcile with the European budget."
"Now, after having encouraged intensive farming, they are trying to 'boost' extensive rearing and 'organic farming' ."
"We abstained on this report, which in effect asks for a full discharge for a chaotic 'agricultural policy' , in which the only factor that remains constant is the payment of substantial amounts in the form of subsidies that are often only of limited benefit to the small farmers and are of far greater benefit to the beef and veal industry and the capitalist firms that are prospering in the sector of animal feed and meat processing and marketing."
"The beef and veal sector was heavily penalised in the last CAP reform because the fall in prices was not fully compensated through direct aid, which only compensates for between 30% and 50% of the fall in produce prices."
"Furthermore, the BSE crisis, followed by the crisis of foot-and-mouth disease, caused a fall in consumption and a further fall in produce prices."
"Portuguese producers are still suffering from the ban on beef and veal exports."
"Given this crisis scenario, the Commission presented a plan of 7 proposals designed to redress the imbalances in the sector. Instead of presenting a well thought out and coherent proposal, the Commission presented a proposal that is loosely defined and whose sole aim is to make budgetary savings."
"Whilst the Sturdy report shares the Commission' s reasoning, it nevertheless puts forward some interesting ideas, for example on the slaughter of calves and increasing aid."
"Nevertheless, it rejects the Commission' s proposal for strict compliance with the limit of 90 animals per holding and the future creation of a system of individual premium rights, which are positive proposals that might not only combat the tendency towards more intensive farming, but also support the implementation of a system of aid adjustment."
"In any event, if the current system remains in place, we must guarantee that if rights are bypassed, the proportional reduction of the premium will not affect producers owning fewer than 15 animals."
"Furthermore, the Commission' s proposal on reducing stocking density from 2.0 to 1.9 Livestock Units per hectare of forage area would, in Portugal, cause annual penalties totalling ESC 300 million to be imposed - for 9000 premiums - which would mainly affect small and medium-sized family holdings."
"On this issue, the rapporteur goes even further than the Commission, recommending the creation of new premiums for greater reductions in stocking density."
"For all of these reasons, we did not vote in favour of this report and chose to abstain."
"The European Commission is still clearing up after BSE."
"Having failed to deal with the root cause of the disease in 1990, which is what Jacques Delors and his gang refused to do so as not to interrupt the triumphant march, firstly towards the single market and then towards the euro, we have since adopted numerous financial and technical stop-gap measures to ward off the never-ending effects of what has been a disaster in health, trade and financial terms."
"This is the case of the new measure for the COM in beef and veal, which is the subject of Mr Sturdy' s excellent report."
"In order to save the market which it brought to the brink of collapse, the Commission is going back to its ideological Malthusianism."
"The special premiums for male cattle and suckler cows would once again be limited to 90 animals or 1.8 LU per hectare."
"The supply of beef would thus be limited in order to adapt to the drop in demand."
"Every Member State will set an individual ceiling for each of its farmers."
"Mr Sturdy is proposing a series of amendments to maintain farmers' income, particularly for farmers involved in extensive farming."
"The report recommends, for instance, that the premium for steers be increased, and there are also calls to promote beef and veal by proposing an increase in the current budget of EUR 10 million, which is insufficient."
"To cap it all, a 'Special Purchase Scheme' is proposed for cattle over 30 months old, so that they can be stored and sold off at some point, like the terminally ill who have themselves frozen, in the hope that they can be resuscitated when a cure has been discovered."
"When we know that public stocks are increasing by 50 000 tonnes each month, that the Commission had already bought back 175 000 tonnes in April and that the beef sector used appropriations worth EUR 7 billion in 2001, you can see the scale of the financial disaster that Jacques Delors' team made inevitable when it turned its back at the first signs of the BSE crisis."
"And the new measures proposed by Brussels, which are, moreover, completely ineffective, are seeking to further increase the debt by EUR 1 million."
"The matter is still not over."
"We voted in favour of Amendments Nos 1, 10, 2 and 12, not so much because we agree with a policy of highly intensive production under the CAP, which must be reviewed for the sake of farmers, consumers, environmental protection and food quality, but because we think that loosely-defined restrictions, in this case on the number of male cattle that can benefit from the beef special premium, imposed in isolation from an overall and coherent reform, make no sense and create unfair situations in comparison to the premiums established for other types of agricultural and animal production, which remain unchanged."
"I have voted against the Sturdy proposal."
"The reason is that the proposal is based on the continued false principle of patching up and mending a non-transparent agricultural policy in the EU instead of taking a joint and radical hold of the issue."
"Problems are moved to new areas or are not addressed at all."
"The report is also based on increased economic commitment for the EU and the taxpayers in the area of food production, in this case in order to promote increased sales of beef to consumers."
"The Doha summit is approaching and is due to take place in November 2001."
"After the failure of Seattle, Doha must be a success for the WTO, and if this is to happen, the United States is not to be counted on."
"Never in history has the hub of an empire conceded its hegemony to its far-flung outposts."
"The American superpower is giving up none of its claims, especially now it has the Texan, Mr Bush, in office, the man who perpetrated genocide on the children of Iraq."
"Who, apart from Europe then, can give in?"
"And this is exactly what is happening."
"First of all, we have reformed the CAP in order to cave in to the demands of the US Administration in the Uruguay Round negotiations."
"As consensus must be reached at Doha, however, giving in to the United States and the Cairns Group by abandoning our farmers to the productivist and ultraliberal global market is not an adequate approach."
"We also need the agreement of the poorest African and Asian countries, which also opposed consensus in Seattle."
"This is the whole point of the new Council regulation, which concedes our customs duties on bananas, sugar and rice for the 48 least developed countries."
"Between 2006 and 2009, these three products will become entirely duty free."
"In the meantime, customs duties will be reduced by 20%, 50% and 80% by 2009."
"Sudan will, therefore, be able to send us its sugar, free from customs barriers, by virtue of the fact that it is a poor country."
"Sudan is nevertheless able to find the resources to bomb its own villages that stand in the way of its oil wells and is also choosing to starve its inhabitants in the south of the country."
"The Council regulation, based on the slogan 'everything but arms' , is therefore, the height of hypocrisy because the additional income that Sudan, for example, will make as a result of the additional exports that we are giving it the opportunity to make, will buy it additional arms with which to fight the Christians in the south of the country."
"The real problem, however, is the generosity of the socialists and the Christians, as combined in the person of our Commissioner, Pascal Lamy."
"Christian Europe is offering fundamentalist Sudan, which is of symbolic importance, the financial means to increase the martyrdom of its Christians in the south of the country."
"This is all the more shocking because the 48 LDCs will act as intermediaries, flooding Europe with bananas, sugar and rice from countries other than those benefiting from a wide range of preferences."
"A precedent has already been set with garlic from China, for example, which is appearing in Europe via Malaysia, Jordan and other Trojan horse countries."
"If we understand, however, that European integration is itself nothing more than a Trojan horse, in place to establish the ideological and trading empire centred on the United States, with outposts in every corner of the world, then we see that Mr Miranda has produced the report of a loyal servant of that country' s blueprint for the world."
"The beef and veal sector has been doubly hit by disaster."
"'Mad cow disease' was followed by foot-and-mouth disease; the fall in domestic consumption as a result of much exaggerated consumer fears is now joined by a serious decline in our exports to third countries."
"While millions of animals have gone up in smoke, the slaughterhouses are running idle and the stock-farmers are suffering severely, both from the loss of outlets and from the falls in prices and morale in face of this crisis that has turned their world upside down and given rise to unjustified consumer distrust."
"Two types of measures can be identified in the 'seven point plan' presented by the Commission to deal with this crisis."
"First, there are the emergency measures to manage the markets and to try and restore the balance between supply and demand."
"One example is the proposal to set up a special purchase scheme and not to apply the ceiling for buying into intervention."
"We approve of these measures, while recommending avoidance of buying into intervention for storage purposes, which would merely defer the problem to a later date."
"It would be better to provide food aid whenever this can be done without destabilising the beneficiary countries' markets."
"Secondly, there are long-term measures to rather radically amend the COM or even to change the nature of the CAP."
"These measures are not all bad, but they should not be decided too hastily."
"Some of them, however, are quite frankly bad, such as the introduction of a system of individual rights for the special premium for male bovine animals, which would introduce a cumbersome and bureaucratic quota system, or reducing the density factor, which would probably not produce the desired extensification but would certainly reduce the income of farmers, something they certainly do not need."
"We endorse most of the amendments tabled by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which fortunately rectified the Commission' s regrettable tendency to amalgamate emergency measures to deal with the turmoil in the beef sector with the surreptitious reform of the COM, contrary to the Berlin agreement."
"We do not deny the need for reform, but this reform must not be improvised in this way or brought in on the sly."
". (NL) We voted against the whole Sturdy report and most amendments to it, including those of the ELDR and the Green group, because they are in favour of an increase in subsidies and promote intensive, animal-unfriendly husbandry."
"The collapse of the beef market is not the fault of external causes, but is directly connected with the way in which production and trade are organised in the livestock sector and with the way in which crises such as BSE and foot-and-mouth disease are being combated in the EU, with the support of the sector."
"The sector is therefore now experiencing the consequence of what we regard as the normal operation of market forces."
"There is no reason for further increasing subsidies."
"Mr Sturdy' s proposal to take the pressure off the market by organising subsidies in such a way that instead of beef more veal is produced - from crated calves, that is - is the height of cynicism."
"Langenhagen report (A5-0129/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I was the only person to vote against the Langenhagen report, which regulates approves the Agreement on fisheries with Greenland."
"Why did I vote against the motion, Mr President?"
"I voted against the motion because the Pensioners' Party does not approve of the fact that the States of the European Union go and fish other waters."
"We should let every State catch its own fish!"
"I do not agree with the system whereby we pay in order to receive authorisation to fish the waters of other States."
"This is not just because, as is well-known, I uphold the rights of fish and I have a good relationship with fish from all over the world, but, indeed, because I feel that the European Union should change its policy on fishing in the territories and seas of others."
"Miranda report (A5-0128/2001)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, as usual, Mr Poettering had a wry smile on his lips when he came into the Hemicycle."
"How, therefore, could we not smile the smile of Riley while we talk of rice, the subject of Mr Miranda's report?"
"It is precisely the treatment of rice in this report that concerns me."
"I voted against the report because, while I fully support the opening-up of European markets to underdeveloped countries, I do not feel that this should apply to the rice markets."
"In Italy, particularly in the provinces of Novara, Vercelli, Pavia and Milan, rice is the basic source of income of a great many farmers."
"I therefore totally oppose the opening-up of the rice markets to all the world markets."
"And now, ""Bon appétit,"" Mr President. I hope there will be a good risotto on the menu."
"We are not against the decision aimed at 'giving unrestricted access for all LDC products except arms and munitions to EU markets' because there is no reason to impose customs duties at the European Union' s borders on products from the poorest countries."
"It is clear, however, that this measure, which is presented as benefiting the poorest countries, will mainly benefit the multinationals established in those countries, which are generally the only companies to produce and sell on the international market."
"It is a sign of the hypocrisy and pretence in this field that there are only three products for which implementation of this decision is deferred: bananas, sugar and rice, i.e. the three products for which production and marketing is in the hands of powerful trusts, each fighting the other for control of the international market."
"That makes it all the more clear that the implied suggestions that this measure may help the poorest countries to 'develop their technological capability so as to be able to export finished products as well' , in other words that these countries have a chance to develop, are simply a con."
"That is why we abstained."
"The report rightly notes that the gap between the 48 poorest countries and the others 'grew even wider' ."
"The development of these countries, in which a large section of mankind lives in indescribable conditions, would require a distribution of wealth at international level that is totally incompatible with a world economic system based on inequality, exploitation and the plundering of the poor countries for the profit of the capitalists in the rich countries."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Situation of Turkish prisoners"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation of Turkish prisoners."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council welcomes this opportunity to discuss the situation in Turkish prisons and notes with satisfaction that the European Parliament, like the Council and the Commission, is heavily engaged in this issue."
"The visit to Ankara from 30 April to 1 May by members of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee showed that the European Parliament has an important role to play."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament should continue their joint efforts to stimulate the Turkish government into continued political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen Criteria and take measures to bring the hunger strikes to an end."
"The Council deeply regrets the fact that these hunger strikes in various prisons across Turkey continue to lead to the loss of human life."
"This is a major human tragedy."
"Therefore, the Council has pressed the Turkish authorities to take suitable steps to avoid further deaths."
"We have also encouraged Turkey to make changes to the law and take concrete action to follow the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture."
"Discussions with the Turkish government are ongoing, particularly within the framework of our deeper political dialogue."
"Meetings took place in Stockholm on 14 March and in Brussels on 26 April."
"The coming Association Council with Turkey on 26 June will also cover human rights issues."
"In addition to these contacts, a dialogue is underway with the Turkish government through the local representatives of the Presidency and Member State representations in Ankara."
"Meetings have been held with the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice, with the prison situation high on the agenda."
"The Council notes with satisfaction that the Turkish government decided at an early stage to co-operate with the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which has visited Turkey three times so far due to the current situation and the hunger strikes."
"Changes to legislation have entered into force, or will do so shortly, aimed at reducing the isolation of prisoners."
"It is necessary for these reforms to be generously and correctly applied in practice, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture."
"The Council strongly hopes that these measures now being carried out by the Turkish government will bring the hunger strikes to an end."
"In this confusing situation, it also feels necessary to appeal to the hunger strikers and their families to react so that no human life is lost."
"The Council will continue to monitor the development carefully in dialogue with the Turkish government and voluntary organisations."
"In this context, the Council would point out that the Accession Partnership for Turkey, which was adopted by the Council in March, contains prison reforms as a priority area which Turkey needs to address to meet the political Copenhagen Criteria."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes today's debate on the situation in Turkish prisons."
"Parliamentary representatives, the presidency and the Commission have all endeavoured over recent weeks to resolve this serious humanitarian problem."
"The forthcoming visit of the prisons by a delegation from the European Parliament will give new impetus to the reform of the criminal justice system in Turkey."
"The Commission deeply regrets that 22 people have already died during the hunger strike in Turkey, while many others are suffering terribly."
"Their condition is worsening day by day."
"Many will be staring death in the face if no way is found of ending this hunger strike."
"Quite apart from where the organisers stand politically, the Commission feels that the current situation gives serious cause for concern on humanitarian grounds."
"The situation in Turkish prisons was one of the main topics of conversation between me and the Turkish foreign minister in Brussels yesterday morning."
"It was clear from what was said that the Turkish government feels that action is needed in order to avoid more deaths."
"In this respect, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Turkish parliament has already passed an amendment to Article 16 of the Turkish anti-terrorist law."
"The main point of this new regulation is that it allows prisoners to take part in social activities while serving their sentence."
"We must call on Turkey today to ensure that the new regulation is implemented as quickly as possible, so that the conditions of detention in the prisons actually improve."
"The Turkish foreign minister also informed me that two other bills are being drafted which will guarantee that sentences are properly executed."
"One of these two laws makes provision for a new penal monitoring committee made up of representatives from Turkish NGOs."
"The second law requires that a judge oversee the execution of sentences."
"Both laws have already been adopted by the committee on legal affairs of the Turkish parliament and are due to be debated in the Turkish national assembly very soon."
"I should like to stress that the Commission attaches great importance to further judicial and penal reform."
"The Commission supports the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, as we set out quite clearly in the accession partnership."
"The situation in Turkish prisons was a cause of concern to the Commission even before the unrest broke out and the hunger strike began."
"The Commission repeats the call it made to the Turkish government on 21 March 2001, i.e. that it take all appropriate measures to prevent further deaths."
"Suitable medical care must also be provided."
"The Turkish government and Parliament should continue to work together to speed up the reform of the criminal justice system in Turkey."
"We expect human rights to be respected everywhere in any country wanting to become a member of the European Union, including in its prisons."
"The Commission also urges the organisers of the hunger strike to distance themselves immediately from any action or demands which might lead to further loss of life."
"Those who have taken it upon themselves to represent the interests of detainees should prove first and foremost that they no longer intend to risk the lives or welfare of the detainees."
"In every situation, care must be taken to avoid endangering human life or health for reasons of political expediency."
"The Commission is certain that further loss of life can be prevented and that the conditions of detention in Turkish prisons can be improved if everyone involved, including the organisers of the hunger strike, acts with restraint and a sense of responsibility."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to thank the Council and the Commission for agreeing to update us on this delicate and painful issue of the Turkish prisons."
"The situation is highly critical and, as the President of the Council pointed out, it has already cost 22 lives and may cost many more."
"At the same time our Parliament does not want to intervene too hastily."
"Several initiatives, from different sides, have been taken with a view to resolving the situation: by the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission, as Mr Verheugen pointed out, and, on a personal basis, by the chairman of our parliamentary delegation that visited Ankara and met all the actors involved in this singular conflict."
"Our objective is to support these initiatives; we do not want to interfere to no purpose but to demonstrate the European Parliament's enduring interest and vigilance in relation to human rights and everything that concerns our Turkish partner."
"Turkey has been going through difficult times since the beginning of this year."
"The very serious financial crisis put paid to some extent to the economic recovery plan that was already under way."
"The European Union is supporting and underpinning the IMF action to promote the implementation of the vigorous measures that Minister Kemal Derviº resolutely adopted."
"At the end of the summer we will have an opportunity to look at the results of this policy and to evaluate the national programme to adapt the Community acquis, which the Ankara government recently adopted."
"Over the same period of time, however, the Turkish prisons have been the scene of riots that were suppressed by particularly bloody means, followed by hunger strikes that turned into death fasts."
"We are aware that this creates an extremely difficult situation for the Turkish authorities."
"The leaders of the movement belong to fanatical extremist organisations that do not hesitate to play with the lives of their militants, or even their families, for political propaganda purposes."
"Oddly enough, this movement sprang up when the prisoners concerned were about to be moved from the overcrowded prisons into which they were crammed under shameful conditions into modern prisons that complied with the Council of Europe's recommendations."
"During the 1970s and 1980s, similar events occurred in our own democracies, although on a lesser scale."
"While we do not underestimate the difficulties we do, therefore, emphasise the importance of rapidly finding a solution to the humanitarian aspect of the crisis, to bring an end to the daily deaths, without giving in to what is plainly an unacceptable form of political blackmail."
"A delegation from our Parliament will be visiting the Turkish prisons in early June to try to evaluate the situation on the ground objectively and make recommendations on a longer-term prison policy."
"It is very much to be hoped that this humanitarian problem can be settled in the meantime."
"As Mr Verheugen said, this could be helped by speeding up the modernisation of the Turkish penal code and penitentiary code as also by adopting measures to calm down the situation in the new prisons."
"At the same time, I am convinced that these would be regarded as a significant expression of Turkey' s resolve to move closer to the European model."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as the Commissioner and President-in-Office have pointed out, we are dealing here not with a country which is far flung from Europe, but with a candidate country with a whole host of serious problems."
"It has economic problems which people are trying to resolve - and good luck to them - and we in the European Union shall support the reforms."
"To all intents and purposes, Turkey is still both unwilling and unable to reform the political system - as the president of the republic and the military have both pointed out."
"Hardly any progress whatsoever has been made on the so-called Kurdish question, i.e. the question of minorities, and the situation in the prisons is horrendous."
"You would think that a government with so many problems would at least try to resolve the most pressing and urgent problems."
"I recently made a short visit to Turkey with Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"I personally was only there very briefly, but it was time enough to see that this is a dialogue between two people who are either hard of hearing or stone deaf; I refer to the organisers of the hunger strike on the one hand, who should end or at least suspend the hunger strike, and the Turkish government on the other."
"If the European Parliament delegation just announced is to make any sense or have any chance of success, then both sides need to be willing to find a compromise or, at the very least, to stop what they are doing."
"We all know that reform is needed in the Turkish prisons."
"But the various proposals made - and this is a mild criticism of the work of the Council of Europe and its anti-torture committee - must not lose sight of the underlying problem."
"Turkey is a country which, because of its laws, still generates a lot of political prisoners; that is the problem."
"There are not so many political prisoners because there are so many assassination attempts, there are so many political prisoners because the laws in Turkey make political prisoners out of so many people - and that should be the starting point."
"Secondly, even where people become prisoners or political prisoners as the result of terrorist activities - which I do not condone but which I cannot deny - solitary confinement must be abolished or at least reduced to what is humanly bearable."
"The Commissioner announced a series of measures which Turkey intends to implement."
"I spoke with the Turkish justice minister in January and these issues were already being discussed."
"But the point with the monitoring system, with Article 16 and with the system of a judge to oversee how sentences are executed in Turkey is, how is all this going to be implemented?"
"The same law can be applied in a humane manner, with due respect for human rights, or it can be applied in a way which tends towards isolation and solitary confinement."
"I call on Turkey to give us, the European Parliament, and Europe a chance to help it overcome this problem, but Turkey must also show willing."
"Those of us who have studied the matter closely are certainly able to welcome the real progress that is nevertheless being made by Turkey to reform its prison system."
"We also share something of the suffering of the political prisoners and their families who have chosen to starve themselves to death."
"The Turkish judicial and penal system is in transition from a regime of retribution and oppression to a more western approach, where prisoners are penalised but not persecuted."
"The European Union should assist this reform process by supporting financially and also technically certainly carefully selected confidence-building measures, without which the fasting will not cease."
"These measures include training of judicial officials, prison officers and gendarmes, ensuring first-class medical services, improving conditions for prison visits and installing the independent scrutiny of the prison system and protecting lawyers."
"Solitary confinement must be the exception and not the norm."
"Prison rules must be applied scrupulously and the arbitrary treatment of all prisoners must stop."
"Mr President, allow me to start by making a basic observation."
"Prison reforms are the hardest reforms of all to implement, not just in countries like Turkey, but in our own countries as well."
"We all know that."
"Prisons are always the Achilles heel, the weak point of a democracy."
"Even in the highly developed democracies of the European Union, the situation in the prisons is far from rosy, let alone democratic."
"Applied to Turkey, this means that the situation in the prisons in a country which, culturally speaking, still has to find its democratic feet, is a mirror image of this contradiction in terms."
"That is why I think it is very important to establish one thing: I do not know if it was the Council or the Commission which said that it called on Turkey to be generous in its application of the law."
"I think that, legally, this is the wrong approach."
"The law is one thing and generosity is another."
"To my mind, what is contradictory about reform in Turkey is that, basically, it leaves reform up to the prison administration, which then has the opportunity to apply it as it sees fit."
"With the situation as it is, this does nothing to inspire confidence in prisoners with painful experiences of the prison administration and the prison guards."
"That is the problem."
"How to create trust?"
"Which his why I think - and we established this on our trip - that we need to find a solution quickly because the prisoners have changed their standpoint."
"They are not making so many incredibly complicated demands."
"Isolation cells to be opened at once, new arrangements to be made for visits by relatives and lawyers at once, medical attention from doctors of their choice, these are more or less their immediate demands in order to call off the hunger strike."
"That is why we call on Turkey, first, to be generous in implementing what is yet to come and to start by opening cells and doors so that the hunger strike can end."
"Secondly, to instigate a dialogue with the prisoners so as to clarify exactly what they want."
"It is important to recognise that."
"Thirdly - and essentially in my view - Turkey must make it clear that it is ready in the dialogue to acknowledge these people as people."
"On the other hand, we say to the organisations organising this strike that the decision to end the strike must be taken by the prisoners, not by some party leader or other."
"That is our demand because it is these people who are risking their lives, not the leaders in Brussels, who still have plenty to eat and drink."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hunger strike by Turkish prisoners and their relatives has been going on for months and has cost many people their lives."
"The European Union must stop standing by in silence as more and more people die."
"The European Parliament must take a decisive stand if it is to be taken seriously as a negotiating partner."
"We must not be indifferent to the massive violations of human rights in Turkish prisons."
"We must not forget human values."
"The European Union must insist that human rights are respected."
"The Turkish parliament recently passed a law relaxing conditions of solitary confinement."
"Now prisoners sentenced under the anti-terrorist law are to be allowed to take part in cultural and sporting activities."
"My criticism of this law is that it does not allow all prisoners to take part in group activities."
"All prisoners must be treated equally."
"I cannot stand by while prisoners are tortured and maltreated in solitary confinement and exposed to the arbitrary treatment of the guards without witnesses."
"People in solitary confinement are totally cut off from the outside world."
"And yet everyone needs human contact and interaction."
"We urgently need to find a way of preventing further deaths."
"On behalf of the GUE/NGL group, I therefore call on the Turkish government and the prisoners' organisations to reach an agreement through political dialogue."
"Dialogue will allow a social consensus to be reached, while force will only be answered with force."
"My group cannot regulate Turkey's internal affairs."
"But we would all like to help put an end to this situation."
"If Turkey wants to be accepted in the European Union, it must stand up for democratic, humane values in the penal system."
"Human rights must apply to everyone, including prisoners."
"My wish is for agreement, for internal peace and for an end to hatred which opens up deep wounds."
"That is why we must speak out."
"Mr President, in my group ""Europe"" , in quotation marks, quite often stands for a meddlesome attitude."
"However, that does not apply to the item on the agenda on the situation of Turkish prisoners."
"Quite rightly the Council, the Commission and Parliament are jointly examining the issue, since the Republic of Turkey after all enjoys the status of a candidate country."
"In order to actually join, such a candidate must meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"An important European demand in this connection is that there should be a constitutional state."
"In view of the continuing serious accusations about the Turkish prison system, this thorny national problem therefore demands European attention."
"The recent introduction of the new F type prison in Turkey forms an extra complication."
"It led to a veritable deluge of complaints and even mass hunger strikes."
"On the basis of my Christian belief I certainly reject the final political weapon of voluntary death by starvation."
"This view of life, however, also requires a humane treatment of prisoners within a constitutional framework."
"The above considerations lead me to agree wholeheartedly with the institution of an ad hoc delegation of Parliament on the Turkish prison system."
"As a member of this delegation, I trust we shall receive the full cooperation of the Turkish authorities on our visit at the beginning of June, in the hope that the European Parliament by applying the principle of hearing both sides of the argument can contribute to ending the tragedy of the hunger strikers."
"Mr President, my contribution to the debate concerns the Christian groups in Turkey which are punished disproportionately severely and are detained in Turkish jails precisely because of their ethnic origin and their faith."
"There they experience many difficulties."
"They are badly treated, not only by the management of the prisons, but also by their fellow-prisoners and are scarcely given any protection."
"Turkey has some 62 million inhabitants, 99% of whom are Muslims and less than half a per cent Christian."
"The largest group of Christians are citizens belonging to the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church."
"Then in Western Turkey there are the Greek Orthodox Christians. And although the Turkish constitution respects freedom of religion, courses run by the Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches have been closed on a massive scale, as have the courses of the Syrian Orthodox Church."
"The Armenian Christian community particularly is constantly subject to new attacks."
"Not so long ago, a Christian bookshop in Eastern Turkey was besieged by armed soldiers, as a result of which one person was killed and 26 wounded."
"The only crime was the selling of Bibles."
"According to the spokesman of the Armenian patriarch in the last few years 40 plots of land belonging to the Christian Armenian church have been confiscated by the Turkish state."
"Anyone protesting is imprisoned and as a non-Muslim treated badly in the prisons."
"The Syrian Orthodox Church is treated even more harshly and as a result of the intimidation more than 100 000 Syrian Orthodox citizens have left Southern Turkey, some of them to Western Europe."
"In the province for which I am politically responsible, there are 9 000 Syrian Orthodox Christians and they have lost over 800 villages in Southern Turkey."
"Those people who have stayed are intimidated, imprisoned and badly treated."
"I am not an opponent of Turkey' s accession into the European Union, but I must say that if this mistreatment of Christians in Turkey continues, I may yet come out against Turkey' s membership."
"Mr President, may I start by thanking the Council and Commission for their information because I assume that they are doing a great deal, even though the newspapers have very little to say on the subject."
"Today I spoke on the telephone with a journalist from a Bavarian newspaper in Istanbul."
"Unfortunately, she told me that not only was the Turkish government ignoring some of the deaths in the Turkish prisons, but that Turkish society was barely interested either."
"In these circumstances it is, of course, very difficult to make people in Turkey understand why we debate these problems here in the European Parliament."
"But the Turkish public needs to know that it is unacceptable in a state under the rule of law for people to die in its prisons without anyone doing anything."
"Therefore, because we take Turkey seriously, because we want Turkey to have a chance in the future in the European Union, we also want Turkey to behave as we would expect our own Member States to behave."
"Having said which, it is really very, very sad and disturbing to note that ..."
"(Demonstrators forced their way into the Chamber chanting loudly; protests from numerous members)"
"Mr Ceyhun, it is fair to say you do not usually create so much excitement with your speeches."
"Mr President, I shall not take advantage of the situation by taking up more time."
"I assume that I have about half a minute left and shall wrap my speech up straight away."
"Naturally, I regret this incident."
"I have no problem with any sort of demonstration, but people could at least show some respect for Parliament's work, rather than obstruct it, just when we are trying to end the situation as peacefully as possible and stop people from dying."
"I shall say no more."
"As far as the problem itself is concerned, this incident just goes to show how difficult things are."
"I can only appeal on Turkey, as my fellow member Daniel Cohn-Bendit has already done."
"It would be possible to induce certain people to stop what they are doing if Turkey showed willing on the three points listed by Daniel Cohn-Bendit."
"I hope that Turkey will, at last, take these efforts seriously and show a little willing and stop being so stubborn, because otherwise no-one in Europe is prepared to tolerate Turkey's behaviour."
"And it is Turkey's reputation that stands to suffer most."
"Mr President, could you please find out how these three people even got in here?"
"We have such a strict security system, that we have trouble gaining admittance for our own citizens who come here with good intentions."
"These people could not have got in without being let in."
"The fact that the Communists stood up when they came in shows where they came from."
"Please look into this very carefully and check who signed the slip."
"Well, the Members remained admirably calm when the demonstration was taking place."
"Let us not have a row now."
"We do not know how they got in but it will be fully investigated."
"The President will, of course, be informed and an investigation will be held."
"As luck would have it there was a discussion at the Bureau meeting on Monday on tightening security."
"Unfortunately no action has yet been taken."
"Mr President, with all due respect, I cannot subscribe to your view."
"It is not the political aspect which bothers me."
"I should like to point out that when my press officer wanted to step into the Chamber, he was stopped straight away."
"And rightly so."
"But I fail to understand how three or four people who have absolutely nothing to do with this Parliament can simply walk in."
"Secondly: when foreign minister Cem was with us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we had a similar incident which only just stopped short of an actual attack on the minister."
"Irrespective of the country involved, it is no laughing matter for Parliament when the security bureaucracy in this House - and I use the word bureaucracy advisedly - stops members at every turn but is unable to prevent this sort of incident when Turkey is the subject of debate, when you would expect them to, given that there has already been one such incident."
"It is a scandal."
"This needs to be taken more seriously, not the political aspects but what can be done here."
"Next time it will a president who is interrupted or attacked while making a speech."
"I should like to know what that will do for the European Parliament's reputation."
"You must have misunderstood me, Mr Swoboda."
"Of course, I take the incident extremely seriously."
"I just do not think there is any point in getting excited in the Chamber."
"The matter will be reported to the President, and the appropriate authorities will be asked to take action."
"As I said, we had a discussion about our security system in the Bureau on Monday and the Secretary-General is currently preparing a report on how it might be."
"There is, however, one problem."
"I happen to be a member of the Committee on Budgets but if I may use this platform for propaganda, the Budgets Committee is blocking the release of resources for the security services."
"We have about 15 posts blocked. So, if you want to know why we are short on security staff, ask the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have taken part in the debate for a useful discussion."
"I think it shows great, constructive involvement in the situation in Turkey."
"I believe that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission must continue their joint efforts."
"Our central message to the Turkish government must be extremely clear on this point: immediate measures are required to avoid more casualties."
"In this context, I would like to take this opportunity to give the visit to Turkey by Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Swoboda at the end of April/beginning of May the recognition it deserves."
"I believe it is exactly this type of initiative which is needed to focus attention on the acute nature of the current situation, to clearly and objectively report to the people of Europe what is happening."
"On behalf of the Council, I would like to thank you for this work."
"I also agree with what Mr Swoboda said about the importance of looking at the political system which produces a prison system of the kind found in Turkey."
"Of course we have to tackle the practical issues and examine the harsh prison conditions, but we also have to look at the bigger picture: the political system and the economic situation."
"This is why I, as President-in-Office of the Council, have become involved in supporting the IMF and World Bank' s work to help the Turkish government achieve economic recovery, as we believe that this could also create the basis for advances such as better conditions in Turkish prisons."
"I therefore look forward to continued close dialogue with Parliament."
"The Council will continue to present itself very clearly to the Turkish government."
"The Swedish Presidency, and no doubt the next countries to hold the presidency, will be very clear in their dealings locally with the Turkish government."
"Hopefully, we will soon achieve concrete results in what is an important issue for us, namely the unacceptable situation in Turkish prisons."
"The debate is closed."
"Situation in FYROM"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of February Albanian extremists took control of the village of Tanusevci on the border between Kosovo and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which caused violent clashes between extremists and FYROM' s army and police force."
"In the middle of March, unrest spread to the town of Tetovo in western FYROM when uniformed men took the villages to the north of the town and then fired on the town at random."
"The FYROM army launched a counter-offensive against the occupied villages which ended on 1 April."
"However, later that month, the extremists renewed fighting in villages north-west of the town of Kumanovo, and the fighting is still continuing."
"There is clearly a risk of out and out civil war, and the European Union has worked hard to prevent such a development."
"The European Union reacted almost immediately to the fighting around Tanusevci and Tetovo by issuing declarations condemning the violence and urging all the parties involved to cease the violence immediately."
"Intensive diplomatic activity commenced in Skopje to support the FYROM government, the country' s sovereignty and its territorial integrity."
"At local level, the EU Presidency set up close contacts with the key players."
"The FYROM government was urged to act with restraint against the extremists, and the leaders of the major Albanian parties were urged to openly distance themselves from and isolate the extremists, while the Slavic-Macedonian opposition parties were urged not to exploit the situation to whip up nationalistic feelings against the Albanian minority."
"From the outset, efforts were also made, through the country' s media, to get over to the general public the EU' s message of distancing themselves from the extremists."
"Then, intensive shuttle diplomacy was also started."
"Foreign Minister Kerim was invited to discussions with the EU' s President-in-Office and High Representative Solana in conjunction with the General Affairs Council of 19 March."
"The following day, an EU Troika of political directors travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje, and at the end of the same week the EU Troika of foreign ministers travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje and Pristina to emphasise their support for the government and their condemnation of the extremists' actions."
"One result of the visits was that the Troika got the Albanian leaders in FYROM and Kosovo to sign declarations publicly distancing themselves from the violent methods of the extremists and instead urging them to put forward their demands in political forums and in accordance with democratic procedures."
"As a further sign of the EU' s support for FYROM' s political leaders, President Trajkovski was invited to the European Council in Stockholm on 23 March."
"Here, he had the opportunity to present his views on the vulnerable position of the country to the entire European Council."
"In order to underpin the political support financially, a review was carried out of the EU' s aid to FYROM for this year."
"Intensive work was done by both the Commission and the EU Member States to, for example, make up the financial deficit for the new university in Tetovo, offering teaching in Albanian, and to try to rapidly implement measures to rebuild houses destroyed in the villages north of Tetovo and support other projects to strengthen inter-ethnic cohesion in the country."
"As everyone is no doubt aware, on 9 April, following almost a year of negotiations, FYROM was the first country in the western Balkans to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU."
"The agreement is a key step in FYROM' s rapprochement with the EU, and the signing was also an important symbol of the EU' s support for the country."
"Like other countries in the western Balkans, FYROM is currently seen as a potential candidate for EU membership."
"However, the unrest in FYROM has made it clear that there is a real need to improve the position and rights of the Albanians and other minorities in the country."
"In conjunction with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the FYROM government launched an action plan for reforms to speed up the comprehensive adaptation required by the agreement, but also to intensify the inter-ethnic dialogue and strengthen the position of minorities."
"Unfortunately, we have to say that the practical reforms have made slow progress."
"So far, all that has been achieved is avoiding a declaration of a state of war, postponing the public census until October and setting a date of 27 January 2002 for new parliamentary elections."
"However, the main success is that, after intensive negotiations and pressure from the international community, a broad coalition government has been set up which will function as the political basis for the difficult but necessary decisions which have to be taken in the near future."
"The Council believes that there are measures which the government should and could implement immediately."
"These include starting a third TV channel for minority languages, introducing the long-overdue act on strengthening local self-determination and ratifying the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages."
"In the medium term, and ahead of next year' s election, the government must also make the necessary constitutional changes to even out the differences between the position of the Slavic-Macedonian population and that of other minorities in the country, and also take the action necessary to strengthen the representation of the minorities within the administration."
"Today, the Troika of EU foreign ministers is returning to Skopje to promote this message."
"Foreign Minister Mrs Lindh travelled straight from this House to Skopje."
"At this meeting, the new coalition government will be invited to report on its progress and ongoing action plans in conjunction with the General Affairs Council of 25 - 26 June."
"In other words, FYROM is facing a difficult but necessary process of reform, and time is running out if a new civil war is to be avoided."
"It is important to point out that the main responsibility lies with FYROM' s leaders."
"The EU has an important supporting role to play, and the Council, along with High Representative Solana and, especially, the Presidency at central and local level, intends to continue its support for this process."
"We also believe that there is a vital role for Parliament and its party groups."
"In the period up to the end of June, the coalition government will need support and encouragement, as well as the exercise of pressure, to be able to implement the necessary reforms and, at the same time, keep the fragile government coalition intact."
"The Council believes that it would be invaluable if Parliament' s party groups could contact their partners in FYROM and support them in this process, if this is not already happening."
"It is still possible to avoid all-out civil war in FYROM."
"We must ensure that we make the most of this chance."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the efforts of the Macedonian leadership, which culminated in the formation of a larger coalition government on Sunday, and hopes that this new government will achieve tangible results in the dialogue between the parties."
"As you know, this dialogue started a few weeks ago in cooperation with the European Union."
"We shall also continue to support the new government in promoting tolerance and restraint and applying the principle of ""dialogue not force"" in order to settle differences of opinion."
"My colleague Chris Patten and the presidency will transmit this message to the new government and the president of the country when the troika of ministers of the European Union visits Skopje today."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Macedonia was signed in Luxembourg on 9 April."
"This was a very important and, without doubt, an historic step towards stability in the Balkans as a whole."
"Macedonia is the first country in the region to sign such an agreement. The second agreement with Croatia was initialled in Brussels last month."
"The agreement is symbolic of the close relations between the Union and Macedonia and will provide a basis for fast rapprochement with the European Union."
"The most important aspects of the agreement are the creation of free trade zone between the Community and Macedonia within ten years of the date on which the agreement enters into force, the start of political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation, an undertaking by the Macedonian authorities to harmonise their laws with EC law, especially provisions relating to the internal market, and cooperation on justice and home affairs."
"The agreement makes it quite clear that Macedonia has European prospects."
"These prospects now need to be given tangible form."
"The agreement does not therefore represent the end of a process, it represents the beginning of a difficult process for this country."
"It is now up to Macedonia to prove to the European Union that it has the will to fulfil the underlying criteria and, most importantly, this country must now show that it is in a position to resolve conflicts between ethnic groups through political dialogue rather than by force."
"The EU shall continue to give its unrestricted support."
"The Commission condemns the renewed acts of terrorism in northern Macedonia and urges all the members of the Albanian minority to leave it to the two official Albanian parties to explain the demands of this ethnic minority within a democratic forum, either with the new government or with the special committee chaired by President Trajkovski."
"The European Union is already doing its best to facilitate this dialogue."
"As the members of the European Parliament know, we are in an extremely critical phase in the history of Macedonia."
"The European Union shall continue to express its solidarity with this country and its confidence in its people."
"As far as we are concerned, the major objective of stabilising the Balkans cannot be achieved unless the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Macedonia are guaranteed."
"However, the basic effort needs to be made by the people themselves and their political leaders."
"They themselves are responsible for the future of their country."
"In all events, we shall promote continuing dialogue leading to tangible results."
"We are positive that a peaceful and democratic process which attends to the legitimate concerns of the minorities is the only way to set Macedonia on course for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes active support for the peace process in Macedonia."
"For the very first time over recent months we have seen the Council and Commission starting to act in concert in the case of the former Yugoslavia; everyone has the same take on the situation and we have joint action as a result."
"We just have to bear in mind that we cannot turn our back on this country once the fighting abates and the shooting stops."
"On the contrary, we must monitor the situation continuously and closely, by which I mean on the ground."
"The European Parliament has acted consistently since 1993."
"We have constantly discussed all the problems with our Macedonian counterparts and the Macedonian government."
"We have called on them time and again not to underestimate the simmering ethnic conflict and to do everything to prevent such conflict from breaking out."
"For years little was done and that is a pity."
"If the truth be told, this problem was criminally neglected for years."
"But now this last government has got down to business over the last two and a half years and has done much to help the Albanian people and get things moving."
"And then, just when we have important ministers of Albanian origin with important portfolios, just when a real solution has been found to the question of Albanian education and the problem of Tetovo University, at that precise moment, hostilities break out."
"And we simply have to concede that they have been imported from outside."
"I am surprised that none of the previous speakers, from either the Council or the Commission, reminded us that these hostilities were imported from outside."
"That is why we now need to look at the situation outside the country."
"Elections were held in Kosovo last year."
"If elections had been held in Kosovo this spring, we would probably have been able to prevent this unrest in the neighbouring country."
"But we have no proof of that."
"Now we have a situation in which Mr Hekkerup, without talking to us here in Parliament - I do not know if he has spoken to the Commission, but he has certainly never spoken to us; we pay for the administration of UNMIK, we are the main payers, but no-one asks us what should be done down there - is designing a constitution which neither the Serbs nor the Albanians support 100%."
"It may well be a very good constitution."
"But if a constitution is announced in May and a vote is held on it in November, that gives seven months for the extremists to again find plenty of cause for unrest."
"It is just not on."
"You have to learn from your mistakes."
"Perhaps they should have asked their counterparts in the European Parliament."
"We could have told them."
"So I think that mistakes were made."
"We must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward."
"Now back to Macedonia."
"The visitors in the gallery will have noticed that it says ""Situation ARYM"" up there."
"In English it would be ""Situation FYROM""."
"This is none other than the country of Macedonia, whose neighbours are refusing it its name."
"It is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"FYROM and ARYM are in fact temporary aids and should soon be consigned to the dustbin of history."
"We welcome the formation of the all-party coalition and hope that it will succeed in moving towards ethnic cohabitation."
"We hope that none of the parties will pursue separatist or nationalistic agendas."
"So I think we are on the right course here."
"I take up the Council's suggestion."
"We shall try to take a delegation to Skopje before the summer."
"Mr President, as the President-in-Office and the Commissioner said, we are still in a very difficult, delicate situation when it comes to Macedonia/FYROM."
"I still cannot see that there is the will to find a compromise and for understanding on both sides."
"But we must be clear on one thing: the KLA should not dictate events, developments and the pace of solutions in Macedonia."
"Nothing would please the KLA more than to parade the Albanian parties and dictate their demands and nothing would please the KLA more than overreaction on the part of the Slav-Macedonian parties."
"With all due respect for what Mrs Pack said - and I nearly always agree with her - I do not see the connection with Kosovo in the same light."
"Because the badly needed elections in Kosovo are elections for democracy, not for terrorist organisations like the KLA."
"So what is to be done?"
"First there are thoughts of changing the constitution and there is much to be said in favour of that."
"It is just that I think it should be determined with as few ethnic considerations as possible and geared to the rights of each and everyone under the rule of law."
"Secondly, the Albanian minority definitely needs more judges, more policemen and more officials in the administration."
"Here again the primary concern must be qualification, with the ethnic principle coming second."
"Thirdly, more certainly needs to be done in the area of education and training."
"In the medium to long term, we must assume that Tetovo University which, most importantly, has been substantially funded by the international community - with almost nothing from the Albanian diaspora, it must be said - will, at long last, become a public university."
"I think this is the right step to take."
"I should like to address one more fundamental point: both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner mentioned the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"In fact, just such an agreement has also been initialled with Croatia."
"However, we must think one step ahead."
"I think that the region as a whole needs to be able to feel at home in Europe."
"Perhaps we should consider whether, as a matter of principle, we could check every two years after a Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed, if the country is willing and able to acquire candidate status for the European Union."
"Because when I look at Bulgaria and Romania on the one side and at Turkey on the other, there is a certain restrained - one might almost say unfair treatment of the Balkans."
"What was done in Zagreb was a good thing."
"But I think we should go one stage further and say to the region loud and clear: if you are willing to resolve all your economic, social and political problems, then you have a real chance of obtaining candidate status for the European Union."
"We in the European Union are prepared to check this with the countries with which we have already concluded agreements at regular intervals. Only the road to Europe, the vision, the realistic vision of belonging to Europe can bring about stability in this region."
"Not in the short term, but in the medium and long term. And this vision, this Utopia must be very a specific vision."
"Mr President, I support what Mr Swoboda said about Macedonia and at the same time, wish to contradict him slightly."
"I think that we must definitely view Macedonia as a potential member of the European Union."
"But we cannot of course say that it is in fact already a candidate, for the simple reason that the Copenhagen criteria are just not being met in Macedonia."
"Therefore those political criteria must be fulfilled."
"For that reason, I think - and I should like to make a minor correction to what Mr Swoboda says - we should offer the prospect of possible membership, but only if, for example, that dreadful concept of a state-constituting nation disappears from the constitution and statutes of Macedonia."
"It is a huge obstacle, often in other countries too, to reaching a reasonable ethnic understanding between citizens."
"Surely we must be able to make Macedonia into an ordinary secular state and there are enough indications that the president of the country with his American experience understands that."
"Secondly, we as the European Union can do something ourselves."
"I remember very well from a previous period that a departing Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Elleman-Jensen, surprised the House by exclaiming that the whole Council was sick of Greece' s behaviour towards Macedonia."
"That caused a row."
"But I believe it was an extremely salutary expression of feeling, particularly since the Council could after all exert some pressure on Greece as a fellow-member and say : conclude those negotiations, ensure that there is a reasonable solution, do not persist with measures that are in fact humiliating for Macedonia."
"We can also ensure from outside that destabilising effects which were in fact at issue in those negotiations, are removed."
"Mr President, I would urge the Council to look into its own heart and say to its own members: friends, what can we do?"
"Stop going on endlessly about that name, that flag, etc. We can also ask the Macedonians to achieve a European approach to their own constitutional structure."
"Otherwise it will be impossible for them to become normal members of the European Union in the future."
"Mr President, I do not wish to hold up the debate, but Mr Oostlander must have misunderstood me."
"I do not assume that Macedonia can now be seen as a candidate."
"It should merely be given a chance to attain this status through regular monitoring."
"The Representative of the Council is quite right to say that we may well face a civil war or perhaps a more widespread Balkan war unless developments are contained."
"As regards the name and Greece's responsibility, which Mr Oostlander touched on, the only thing I have to say, yet again, is that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia only exists thanks to continuous material and moral support from Greece."
"Leaving aside the name, without this support, you can be sure that Milosevic's Yugoslavia would have broken it up long ago."
"As far as the present situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, we have a clash of two political philosophies: the political philosophy expounded by the Representative of the Council, whereby two different nations live within the same borders, cooperate and live in friendship, and the philosophy which says that the rights of the Albanian nation can only be secured by armed struggle and bloodshed."
"May I say to the Council representative that this is a philosophy - and I know because I come from these parts and I have lived through a civil war - which is deep rooted in the psyche of a nation which still has various atavistic responses."
"If we want to avoid civil war, someone has to gainsay this philosophy of armed struggle, but not, of course, the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, because if it undertakes to disarm the KLA, there will definitely be civil war."
"It is our duty to disarm the KLA, it is our duty to prohibit the KLA from using the security zone, it is our duty to tell the leadership in Kosovo not to incite the KLA to do these things, especially as we hold their purse strings - by the way, you could say the same to Turkey, that we shall stop all payments until they do something about the disgraceful state of their prisons - and, finally, we must use policing measures to prevent money from being collected in western Europe and sent to the KLA."
"Unless we do these things, the whole civilised approach argued by the Council representative - which of course we want - will be a waste of time."
"It is not just the responsibility of the Macedonians."
"Unless we do these things, we too shall be responsible for what happens."
"Thank you very much, Mr Katiforis."
"The debate is closed."
"Statute and financing of European political parties"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0167/2001) by Mrs Schleicher, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties [COM(2000) 898 - C5-0081/2001 - 2001/0011(CNS)]."
"We will adjourn the sitting for five minutes as neither the rapporteur nor the speakers who need to take the floor on this item are present."
"(The sitting was adjourned for five minutes)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to raise an issue that has come up before, pursuant to Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure. In other words, I wish to question the admissibility for debate and voting of the report and regulation which we were about to debate."
"I wish to contest their admissibility on a purely legal basis."
"I should simply like to quote from another report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which is currently under consideration, which will reach the plenary at the end of the month, and which, and I quote from the text in English, ""welcomes the fact that the Treaty incorporates a legal basis that will enable a statute for European political parties and rules governing their funding to be adopted under the codecision procedure"" ."
"In other words, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs itself is aware that only after the Treaty of Nice, at the earliest, could there be a legal basis that would cover this matter."
"This, however, is not enough and is even questionable from a legal point of view."
"The Treaties make no mention of European political parties."
"The Treaties talk about political parties at European level and consider all political parties acting at European level to be of equal standing."
"This is clearly what Article 191 of the Treaties says, before Nice and following Nice, and this is also stated in Declaration 11 annexed to the Treaty."
"Now, establishing a legal framework, as well as funding, for a tiny category of parties, the so-called ""European political parties"" and others which fall within its definition, would lead to discrimination, which is unacceptable in the light of fundamental rights and in the light of the Treaties."
"This discrimination would not only affect certain political parties, but also, in particular, the European public, since it is the voters, in accordance with electoral law and procedures, who determine the power and the representativeness of the parties."
"I therefore call on the House to declare this report and this regulation inadmissible."
"Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro."
"Pursuant to Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure, one speaker may speak for Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion and one against. The rapporteur may have the floor too."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion?"
"Mr Dupuis has the floor."
"Mr President, I fully agree with the motion tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro."
"I think that Parliament has already, on several occasions, put itself in difficult and ridiculous situations in terms of respect for the law."
"I think that this motion is extremely timely and I ask all Members to allow Parliament to take another look at this matter, to go into it in greater depth and, therefore, to vote in favour of this motion."
"Mr President, the motion before us will sink our work without trace."
"Thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Schleicher, we had a full debate in committee and now we want to report on it to the European Parliament."
"My group is holding a special meeting right now but I feel this debate is so important that I wished to attend in person."
"We need this debate now so that the Swedish Presidency can bring this matter to a close."
"Because if we do not debate it now, this party statute, this regulation will not come to fruition under the Swedish Presidency."
"That is why I ask all the honourable Members to show willing and debate this today so that we can vote on it accordingly tomorrow, when the time comes."
"So I am most decidedly against this motion."
"I am also sorry to have to say as much to my friend and colleague Mr Dupuis."
"May I ask you in a spirit of friendship, Mr Dupuis, perhaps to reconsider."
"Mr President, we debated this matter in committee."
"It has been discussed."
"The legal basis is such that we can take the article which the Commission used as a basis."
"Whether we want to or not is a political decision."
"The committee decided by a large majority that it would take this article as a basis."
"Mr President, I would like to request that we check we have a quorum before proceeding to the vote."
"We have been asked to check that we have a quorum."
"This request by Mr Barón requires the support of thirty-two Members."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as the request does not have sufficient support, we cannot verify a quorum."
"We must therefore proceed to the vote on Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion."
"(Murmurs of dissent)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have acted pursuant to all the relevant Rules, and Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s motion is approved."
"Mr Poettering has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would imagine that certain honourable members are delighted."
"It is a most interesting coalition which we have here."
"I hope that you will always feel at home in this alliance."
"But I must say on behalf of the large majority of my group that we shall not allow ourselves to be discouraged by the result of this vote, which is of course in keeping with the Rules of Procedure."
"I shall apply on behalf of my group to the President - and I say this here openly - for this matter to be discussed at the next mini session in Brussels, in the hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the Swedish Presidency."
"For the rest, I would point out that we were notified internally earlier that the debate on this subject would not start until 4.45, which is why we were surprised that things got off to such a fast start."
"As a good democrat, I do of course respect this result and I trust that those who snatched such a chance victory will be equally good democrats in the future."
"I should like to make perfectly clear on behalf of my group that we shall do everything we can to obtain a party statute because it is both good and necessary to the unification of and democracy in Europe."
"I merely think that there is another interesting coalition to which attention must be called, namely the coalition between the European parties which, over the heads of the people of Europe, are deciding to enrich themselves through this project."
"Mr President, the Commission and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs considered the question of the legal basis extremely carefully."
"This regulation is drafted as a temporary measure before the Treaty of Nice comes into force and I find it absolutely shameful that the nationalists in this Parliament are seeking to suppress the growth of proper, credible and legitimate transnational political parties."
"Mr President, as group coordinator in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I just wanted to point out that there are differing views on this subject in our group, something which I intended to point out in my speech today."
"I personally take the view that, given the criticism of the Court of Auditors, it is in fact fitting that we find a solution to the problem before us and this matter should also have been dealt with politically on this basis today."
"Mr President, I simply wish to make a point of order."
"I do not wish to comment on the matter in detail, or on the nonsense I have been subjected to today."
"I call on you, as President and pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure, to put a proposal to the House, namely that the agenda be amended to allow this item to be reintroduced. If it is not possible to do so today, then it should be done tomorrow."
"Mr Barón, as you are aware, this cannot be done at present. However, we have taken note of your suggestion."
"Mr Dupuis has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, perhaps it should be pointed out to Mr Barón Crespo that he often confuses his visions with reality."
"I would, however, like to warn Mr Duff about the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"As all honourable Members know, this committee has, on various occasions, produced in-depth studies on the legal basis of our reports, which have not been considered to be such by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"I think and fear that this is the case with the study we are looking at today."
"Mr President, I regret the fact that some groups in this Parliament obviously prefer that party financing should remain in the twilight zone where it is at present."
"My view is that we should remove party financing as soon as possible from that twilight zone."
"That is also in the interest of European citizens."
"I consequently hope that the time remaining will be used to approve this proposal with as large as possible a majority and to see what amendments might contribute to its further improvement."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to deny most vehemently what Mr Poettering has just said, announcing quite prematurely that this report could appear on the agenda of the forthcoming Brussels mini-session."
"I should like to remind my fellow Members that we have just voted to refer the report back to committee. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will, therefore, have to meet and discuss the matter again."
"Mr President, we can only accept what has happened here, albeit through sleight of hand."
"That too is a democratic right enjoyed by parliamentarians here."
"At the same time I should like to support emphatically what Mr Poettering and Mrs Maes have just said."
"We cannot continue making ourselves ridiculous as a Parliament by spending funds in a way that is patently not above board."
"We do not wish to do this. We cannot collaborate in this."
"This item must be put on the agenda as soon as possible and as spokesman of the liberal group I should also like to warmly support what Mr Poettering has said."
"We must discuss this matter again as soon as possible and then adopt a motion."
"Mr President, I would like to inform you that a very detailed debate took place on Mr Schleicher's report in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Mr Dupuis is, of course, free to think that the matter was not analysed sufficiently: that is his personal opinion and the opinion of other colleagues who represent a minority of the committee."
"When Mr Dupuis requested that the vote be referred to committee because the translations of the amendments were not available in all the languages, we granted his request."
"We have therefore acted totally conscientiously."
"If Mr Dupuis wishes to consider himself to be the self-appointed representative of the Court of Auditors to our committee, with a strange mixture of institutional responsibilities, then that is up to him."
"In any case, in view of the vote, which was obtained by majority despite the presence of only a small minority of the Members of this House, I will convene an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs without delay, so that a well-researched, clear decision can then be taken in plenary."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall limit myself to making a point of order."
"I believe that any decision taken by a parliament can be interpreted according to the motives that have been expressed."
"Some of you may not believe this, but I only discovered the motion tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro as I was coming into the Chamber."
"Our fellow Member has, to be precise, tabled a motion of inadmissibility based on the absence of a legal basis, pending the ratification of the Treaty of Nice."
"It therefore seems quite clear to me that Parliament, through its vote, has decided to postpone the discussion until the Treaty of Nice has indeed been ratified."
"That is my first point."
"My second and final point, which I shall discuss much more briefly, is that this is a question of democracy."
"I must say that democracy does not consist of those parties that have a majority gaining material advantages over the opposition and, furthermore, of assuming the right to deny the opposition these advantages for ideological reasons of their own."
"Mr President, it is unacceptable to give the impression that minority parliamentary groups and the smallest groups in this Parliament, which have taken the initiative of proposing that we reject this report, have done so in order to conceal the funding of European political parties, or those that claim to be such."
"This is simply an attempt, by the large groups in this Parliament, to cover up a decision by the European Court of Justice, which enabled them to benefit from funds to finance 'European political parties' , which are not 'parties' since they do not use universal suffrage, which are 'political' in name only, since they are only concerned about financing the activities of parliamentary groups, and finally, which are only 'European' because they are not African or Asian."
"We would be creating a monster."
"Until my view can be disproved, the funding of European political parties can only be justified, even after the Treaty of Nice, once it accepts the practice of universal suffrage, which is the only acceptable definition of a political party."
"Mr President, I make no judgment either of the procedure for or the outcome of this decision."
"However, I protest because, when the vote was taken, we and numerous other members were meeting in the Committee on Budgets."
"I just happened to hear the bell and I came unprepared and, to be honest, I did not know what was going on."
"How can you hold this sort of vote while committees are in session and hence, ipse facto, those present, i.e. those who are able to vote, are unable to determine the final outcome?"
"It is in this sense that I protest because my democratic rights have been undermined."
"Mr President, I think that we have to make the best of a bad job, because we are fortunate enough to have quite a full House, which is quite rare for a Wednesday afternoon."
"We can see that the trick worked and that it is perhaps for the best."
"In fact, my group was intending to vote for the Schleicher report, as long as some slight improvements were made to the rehash produced by the committee, which, it must be said, was not particularly impressive."
"We are now being asked to allow a short delay, in order to improve it further."
"There is certainly room for improvement and I think that some good can come out of this."
"My only regret is that Mr Pasqua did not come in person to tell us how he intends to proceed in the future to ensure that the funding of political parties is carried out with the utmost transparency."
"Thank you, Mr President, for not having overlooked me this time."
"I am very grateful for that, since this is the eighth time I have asked to take the floor."
"I should like to say three things."
"First of all, our fellow MEP, Mr Duff, pointed out a moment ago that the committee and committees had given thorough consideration to the issue of the legal basis."
"It is interesting to note that not a single instance can be found of consideration being given to the fundamental issue, namely that of whether Article 308 can be used to implement a real change in the Treaty."
"It is, of course, only with the Treaty of Nice which, it will be recalled, has not yet come into force, that a legal basis has been furnished."
"That is what the issue is about and, when Mr Napolitano now tells us that he is immediately to call an extraordinary meeting of the committee, he might perhaps be requested to see to it that this fundamental issue of legality and the legal basis is examined, at least in such a way that some indications of the legal issue emerge."
"I can refer to a long list of pronouncements by the EC Court of Justice, clearly showing that we really are concerned with a Treaty change here."
"Finally, I just want to add my congratulations to that majority which, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, prevented the matter from coming up for debate. Moreover, I would take the liberty of drawing the President' s attention to Article 143, Paragraph 2 which states that, once such a proposal has been adopted, Parliament should immediately - I repeat the word 'immediately' - move on to the next item on the agenda."
"Mr President, in this debate on a point of order the term 'nationalists' has been used, which does no justice to the arguments of the aggrieved parties."
"My impression is that a number of other matters are involved, the question whether it is legitimate to distribute taxpayers' money to parties and through government impose rules on parties that strengthen the distrust of citizens of what they see as a political elite."
"That is a problem."
"Parties should be bottom-up and not top-down organisations."
"Real parties do not emerge because the structures of a state require the organisation of a competitive struggle at election time but because there are people with common ideas, interests and activities."
"That is why it is rather artificial, at a moment when there is no European public opinion, to create parties from above in a forced way."
"I therefore ask for understanding of the objections which are something other than nationalism and I think that it mainly revolves around the question whether the European Union has the power to do such a thing, or whether it does not have the power, which is why Mr Krarup has already indicated that in that respect we are now on thin ice."
"I think that if such a measure were ever to be passed, we should all have to be certain that it does not conflict with previously agreed European rules."
"Mr President, I should like to support the motion by committee chairman Mr Napolitano and therefore request that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs be convened immediately as a matter of urgency."
"Combating social exclusion"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for a second reading (A5-0155/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion. [13740/1/2000 - C5-0046/2001 - 2000/0157(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Figueiredo)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the European Union continues to be of grave concern, with new groups, such as immigrants, falling into this category and new threats of exclusion, amongst which I would highlight 'info-exclusion' resulting from ongoing inequalities in access to the new technologies. This affects tens of millions of people, particularly women, children and the elderly, but also, increasingly, workers in precarious or atypical employment or workers with low salaries."
"Against this background, it is particularly important to place definition of a global strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion on the agenda, on the basis of Article 137 of the EU Treaty."
"Although all specific measures, both local and national, are important, it is crucial that we put in place a European Union strategy designed to coordinate policies and concentrate on the fight, which must be a priority, against this genuine scandal of living at a time when wealth is being created and increasing and yet, even today, more than 50 million EU citizens do not have access to fundamental rights enshrined in the Social Charters and the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself, recently proclaimed by the Community institutions."
"Nevertheless, as we all know, at the Nice Council, common objectives were adopted for combating poverty and social exclusion, which must be set out in a coordinated and integrated way, in a multidimensional approach, in the national action plans that the Member States have undertaken to draw up by 1 June."
"As we all know, the common objectives that must be set out in the national action plans are:"
"to facilitate participation in employment and access to all resources, rights and services;"
"to prevent risks of exclusion;"
"to work on behalf of the most vulnerable members of society;"
"to rally all the parties involved."
"Furthermore, at the European Council of December this year, at the end of the Belgian Presidency, we are to adopt common indicators for poverty and social exclusion in order to be able to compare the results expected by the Member States from implementing national action plans on social inclusion."
"Given this context, it is particularly important that we adopt and implement the Community action programme as urgently as possible to encourage cooperation between Member States in the fight against exclusion."
"Until this programme comes into force, we will not have the necessary mechanisms for Community-level coordination and monitoring of the actions that are undertaken. These are fundamental aspects of the global strategy which the Council undertook to adopt."
"It is, therefore, hard to understand the Council' s refusal to accept proposals made by the European Parliament, particularly those which the Commission has already accepted. We can see that the Council common position of 12 February 2001 fully or partially incorporates 25 of the 47 amendments adopted by Parliament on 16 November last year, whereas the Commission had accepted 31."
"In the proposals that are now being put forward again at second reading, which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted unanimously on 25 April, the positions which the Commission accepted but which the Council, regrettably, rejected are being adopted once again."
"Amongst these are the establishment of comparable parameters for national action plans and the 90% funding of activities undertaken by the main European networks participating in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. This percentage of funding has already been accepted, in the programme for combating discrimination, for example, and has been rejected here for goodness knows what reason."
"Furthermore, we are reconsidering the key issue of allocating the programme EUR 100 million of funding, rather than EUR 70 Million, as the Council and the Commission are insisting, although it is true that the Council has already accepted proposals that will require increased expenditure such as the networking of national monitoring centres and similar organisations for combating poverty. Spending will also be increased for exchanges of experience, preparatory meetings for the Annual EU Round Table Conference on social exclusion, with the participation of all speakers, and field visits to ensure that the excluded can participate."
"There are also issues of commitology, specifically concerning the Committee, including the Commission' s initial proposal, an assessment of the potential effects of macro-economic policies on poverty and social exclusion and the funding of innovative projects."
"I must also make a reference to some small technical amendments that were introduced, after the services of the President of the sitting pointed out the need for them, to improve the legal quality and the visibility of the text adopted by the Committee on Employment and, at the same time, to enable us to bring our text into line with other texts adopted by Parliament, such as the minor technical amendments to Amendments Nos 10 and 2, and the new Amendment No 18."
"I do not feel that Amendment No 3, tabled by our Committee, is necessary, bearing in mind the technical amendments I have just mentioned, but I shall, of course, leave the matter up to the House."
"With regard to the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People' s Party, I feel that these are merely procedural issues and that adopting them would make adopting the programme more difficult."
"Lastly, Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have contributed to producing this report and to express my hope that the programme will be adopted as soon as possible."
"Mr President, the programme to combat social exclusion is extremely important if we are to achieve the objectives set in Lisbon."
"It is even more important if we consider that there are Member States with no history of combating social exclusion using global policies based on scientific studies and reliable statistics and which do not understand the important of combating social exclusion, not on moral grounds, but for reasons of social cohesion and economic progress."
"I refer here in particular to my own country, Greece."
"That is why we are calling on the European Commission to make a fundamental assessment of the national action plans which it receives, using the agreed quantitative and qualitative indicators, and not to make do with lists of political measures which are neither complementary nor global in nature and which do not get to the root of the problem."
"We are also calling for help for the agencies involved in combating this phenomenon, not just in the form of coordination from Brussels, but at national level, close to the root of the problem, which is why we, as a political group, enthusiastically support any new innovative plans with European added value to combat social exclusion. In order to facilitate this, we support funding to the tune of 90%."
"We also call for the European Parliament, the social partners and other agencies in the civil society to be given an opportunity to help prepare the annual conference on social exclusion."
"My political group maintains that the European Commission should not take recourse to extraordinary technical assistance or make use of external experts and, similarly, that the proposals financed should be selected on the basis of invitations for expressions of interest."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo most warmly on her good work in preparing this report."
"I am also very glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has put forward these amendments."
"What the Commission has tried to do in bridging the opposition between ourselves as Parliament and the Council is also gratifying."
"But I really must say that the Council has taken precious little notice of us."
"Only a few formal matters have been adopted."
"The Social Council and the Swedish Presidency, the Swedish socialist presidency I would almost say, are not aware that there is also such a thing as codecision, they what to keep control of everything themselves."
"They think: there is open coordination and you as a Parliament must simply pay for our stunts from the Community budget."
"That is, I believe, unacceptable."
"That will undoubtedly lead, Madam Commissioner, not only in this case, but also in a number of others to great problems with the Council if the Council does not manage to clarify its position somewhat."
"We have had one discussion with the Council in which obviously the way was pointed to compromises between this Parliament and the Council, Mrs Figueiredo did that splendidly, but the Council did not listen at all and simply made a kind of blueprint, a kind of stamp of what it previously intended and that is a kind of circuit for civil servants, by civil servants and for civil servants, so to speak."
"Our amendments are an attempt to change that just a little."
"I believe that we must adhere to them, since only then can the fight against poverty and the combating of social exclusion be tackled in a truly European way, namely if everyone has a hand in it, and not just a bunch of highly-paid civil servants gathering cosily together in Brussels."
"Mr President, first I would like to assure Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou that all the national action plans on exclusion and poverty submitted to the Commission will be examined in the framework of the indicators and concrete goals agreed in the Stockholm Council."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on the excellent work she has done, which is both helpful and useful."
"I believe that since we all agree how important this programme is, we can agree as soon as possible to start implementing it."
"As you will recall, in its amended proposal the Commission accepted in full or in part 31 of the 47 amendments that were tabled by the European Parliament."
"The common position that we have been examining incorporates 25 of these amendments."
"With regard to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept six of them in full or in part."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 2, reference to the Social Charter; 4, reference to the compatibility of the proposed budget with the current financial framework; 6, strengthening the comparability of indicators; 7, as it refers to the involvement of the local and regional level, 11, reinforcing the monitoring of coherence between this programme and other policies; and, most importantly, Amendment No 14, referring to raising funding to NGOs under exceptional circumstances to 90%."
"The following amendments cannot be accepted. Amendment No 1 proposes adding solidarity among Member States to the list of relevant Community tasks."
"The fight against poverty and social exclusion in each Member State is a national effort and should be placed in the context of promoting national action plans underpinned by Community-level objectives and policy-oriented cooperation."
"So it is obvious that these are national efforts and national targets."
"Amendment No 5, in which the European Parliament is proposing to be involved in the agreement of targets, is not in line with the decisions of the European Councils of Lisbon and Nice."
"As regards commitology, referred to in Amendments Nos 3 and 10, despite the fact that our proposal referred to the creation of an advisory committee, I believe that the mixed committee is a fair solution."
"This is the option that is applied in two other programmes: the equal opportunities and the anti-discrimination programmes."
"The Commission is assisted by a management committee for horizontal issues concerning implementation, and by an advisory committee when dealing with individual funding decisions."
"Amendments Nos 8 and 12 refer to the role of the European Parliament in the open method of coordination in the social exclusion field."
"I am ready to explore with you all the appropriate means of making sure that the European Parliament can play its full role within this framework in this context."
"For example, I have already accepted the setting up of a round table, which will bring together the relevant actors."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 13 propose to open funding under the programme to innovative projects with a European added value in combating social exclusion."
"As I have already stressed, the aim of the programme is to encourage close national policy cooperation and mutual learning, and not to fund actions on the ground."
"Moreover, innovative projects on the ground can be funded by the European Social Fund and by the new EQUAL initiative."
"My next comment relates to your proposal in Amendment No 14 to name the actors to be consulted in the preparation of the annual Round Table Conference."
"I feel that such a list risks being more restrictive, incomplete and less flexible than the admittedly more general term ""all the actors concerned""."
"As regards Amendment No 9, as I said at first reading, the Commission has carefully examined all the questions concerning the budget and is of the opinion that the original proposal for EUR 70 million is an appropriate one."
"I cannot accept at this stage an increase in the budget."
"Amendment No 18 seeking to delete Article 7 is not acceptable to the Commission because it will make the execution of the programme very difficult."
"Amendment No 15 attempts to restrict the implementation of measures, under Strand 1 of the programme, to tenders only, in fact excluding the possibility of promoters of the innovative projects participating in the call for proposals."
"Amendments Nos 16 and 17 seek to curb the role of the Commission by preventing it from using external expertise as well as technical and administrative assistance."
"To summarise, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6 and 11."
"It can accept parts of Amendments Nos 7 and 14."
"It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18."
"I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner."
"If I have understood correctly, she rejects any mention of the European Parliament in the programme."
"Is that correct?"
"Secondly, she also rejects increasing the programme, even though the Commission proposes to diminish the amount for other social actions in the next year by 17.5%."
"Is that also correct?"
"The role of the European Parliament is a very important one but, of course, this role is defined by the decisions of the Council."
"According to the Lisbon and Nice Councils, there is a role for Parliament and cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, but nothing more than that - if you mean the commitology issue."
"Of course, we can find other ways of cooperation."
"I have already said that we can organise a round table."
"There can be cooperation between the Commissioners and the high-level Social Protection Committee, which deals with exclusion issues."
"Of course, the European Parliament has a very important role to play in the joint employment report, which will evaluate all the programmes."
"As far as the budget is concerned, I insist on the original proposal of EUR 70m."
"It is very difficult to change it."
"We have to be realistic about what the Council will accept and how this programme can be implemented with the human resources at our disposal."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"Safe and sustainable pensions"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0147/2001) by Mr Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on The Future Evolution of Social Protection from a Long-Term Point of View: Safe and Sustainable Pensions [COM(2000) 622 - C5-0011/2001 - 2001/2003(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this House will tomorrow put forward its position, ideas, hopes and also its concerns regarding the future evolution of pensions from a long-term point of view on our continent."
"The Commission communication on the future development of social protection, pursuant to the mandate granted by the Lisbon European Council, has provided us with the opportunity of doing so."
"I should therefore like to begin by welcoming that communication. It has brought the problem out into the open, provided Parliament with an opportunity to discuss it and presented a broadly-based study of the phenomenon of ageing in Europe."
"It is only right to congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou on having involved Members of the European Parliament as representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a debate of this nature, crucial to the future of the Union. I would like to take this opportunity to do so."
"This is not just a form of words, I am genuinely grateful to them. Not only have they been kind enough to adopt this report by an overwhelming majority, but they have also many useful contributions in the course of discussions."
"I have no wish to appear boastful but it does seem to me that in the Committee on Employment we have revived a broad consensus across all groups in this House."
"Clearly, this has proved possible because instead of each group seeking to impose every last detail of its own plan on this issue, we have sought consensus on its most important aspects. We are all aware that the ultimate responsibility rests with our States."
"Nonetheless we realise that in the Europe we hope to build, there is scope for establishing criteria, objectives, values and principles which will be common to all Europeans. We are also conscious that it is our right and our duty not to remain silent in the face of this major problem."
"I should also like to state, in this initial overview, that I am firmly convinced this is a problem which demands a broad debate and social and political consensus."
"When it was created, the European social model was founded on broad social and political consensus. It will not be possible to reform this European social model under the auspices of new forms of enlightened despotism as advocated by those who believe that select groups of experts, high-ranking bureaucrats or certain Finance Ministers should rule the world."
"The social and political consequences of modernising the European social model are such that the matter cannot be entrusted to those who only appreciate the financial perspective and neglect the social dimension of the problem."
"It would be irresponsible of us to ignore the data on economic requirements."
"However, we would be making an even greater mistake if we focused entirely on the economic consequences, and failed to take the impact on human beings into account."
"Unless there is a dramatic upswing in the birth rate, this will have serious repercussions. It will impact on the financial capacity of the system, on the balancing of public accounts and also on individuals."
"If we fail to resolve the problem or do so in an unsympathetic manner, we run the risk of unleashing a wave of poverty and social fragmentation across our continent."
"Consequently, the first message I should like to send out, or rather that I feel Parliament should send out, as our committee has already done, is that all the challenges posed by ageing must be taken into account in a balanced way. I could mention in particular the challenge to public finances and also the challenge to the methods adopted by previous generations for the building Europe."
"In our committee we noted that the demographic dependence ratio is a very important factor, but not the only one involved."
"There is another even more significant factor, namely the economic dependence ratio. This means that our main problem will not be the number of pensioners we are confronted with, but the rate of employment."
"The crux of the issue is that if Europe grows, it will create employment, it will create firms capable of ensuring that that rate of economic dependence does not deteriorate. Europe has a long way to go, because our rates of employment are inadequate."
"They could become adequate however, if we achieved economic growth and if that growth were directed at creating the jobs needed on our continent. The figures are far below those of our main competitors, the United States and Japan."
"In fact, if we attained the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit, the objective could be perceived as far less daunting that the data available indicates."
"Furthermore, this data, although certainly significant, amounts to long-term predictions and is therefore subject to revision."
"No Biblical curse is about to befall us."
"We could yet find a way out of our predicament because there is still time to deal with a number of factors currently causing concern."
"Constant monitoring of that data will be called for, and increasingly rigorous criteria must be applied, to ensure that it does not become grist to the mill for those who are intent of benefiting from the situation."
"Mr President, I should like to make one final point. If we are to create the jobs Europe needs, the jobs the social protection system needs, we need to include women and older workers."
"They are the reserves we have to mobilise."
"We must activate all the Union' s social and economic potential. In the Committee on Employment we believe that is the best way of tackling the problem of ageing on our continent."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for a well-balanced report."
"Ideally there would be no need for the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities to make any particular comments from a gender perspective on the design of pension systems - if only we were living in an ideal world where equal opportunities were guaranteed."
"That is not how things stand, however."
"The injustices which women suffer throughout their lives continue when they get older."
"I am pleased to say that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has taken on board the majority of the comments made by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Someone once said that if it had been men who consistently fell foul of the pension systems, the basic principles would have been fundamentally overhauled long ago."
"The committee recalls the goals of the Lisbon Process, as does Mr Cercas."
"Women' s right to their own income and so to financial independence is extremely important."
"Today the employment rate for women ranges from 38 to 71 percent in Europe."
"Generally speaking, women must have the opportunity to take on paid employment."
"Women and men should also be able to choose freely between paid employment and a career break to take care of family members."
"Joint taxation in many Member States and a lack of childcare and care for the elderly are a couple of reasons why many women are unable to enter or stay in the labour market."
"One important principle is that care of children and dependants should be compensated for in the pension system."
"A more equal Europe is a fairer Europe, a Europe which manages both employment and future pensions."
"Better equality can only be achieved through a change in fundamental attitudes and in partnership between men and women."
"A more even division of responsibility for the home and family could lay the foundation for more equality in the workplace and a labour market of equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work."
"In the end this will also produce a fairer pension system."
"Mr President, for years the European Parliament has been arguing for Community initiatives on pensions and consequently we are pleased with the principles agreed in the Council and the work prepared by the Commission."
"The task now is to use the texts in front of us in order to promote the convergence of the systems through cooperation and coordination between Member States."
"There are two ways of approaching this."
"On the one hand, there are a series of common challenges, the ageing of the population and the dearth of younger people or the relation between younger and older people, the changing degree of dependence or the ratio of active to inactive people, etc., limited budgetary resources, technical potential in health care, and so on. On the other hand, there are number of cross-border complications: the mobility of individuals or the option of working in another Member State and drawing a pension, the mobility of capital or the option of saving in another Member State and drawing a pension, the supplementary pension funds, which unlike the compulsory pension schemes appeal to people in various Member States and even in other countries."
"For all those reasons, the systems must be made sustainable so that they can withstand common challenges and cross-border complications."
"The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs indicates current thinking in the European Parliament and also in the European People' s Party on the convergence of pension systems."
"It is not for the European Union to prescribe to Member States how pensions should be organised and financed."
"The Member States themselves choose the appropriate ratio of compulsory scheme to supplementary schemes, between an apportionment method and capitalisation, between contributions and payments or between social security or index-linked prosperity."
"But, on the one hand, solutions must be found for difficulties that hamper the free movement of pensions and pensioners and on the other efforts must be made to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of systems with budgetary resources in the service of social aims and not the other way round."
"For the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and for the PPE-DE Group too the combination of cooperation between Member States and coordination between the systems seems the appropriate way of safeguarding pensions and reassuring pensioners and consequently this point must be clarified at the European Council in Gothenburg."
"I think that years ago the Luxembourg Summit on employment, where the open coordination method was effectively introduced, showed us an excellent way but of course a link must be made between pensions and employment."
"For as long as Europe and the various Member States do not succeed in solving the difficulties surrounding the employment of the over-55s and for as long as the case is not pressed more urgently, more opportunities are not created and more things are not made virtually compulsory, the pensions problem will not be solved."
"It is essential to link the two."
"This should be one of the guidelines in the framework of the coordination and indicators which is about to be drawn up."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou warmly on behalf of my group for her solid work in this communication, which gives us the opportunity to discuss pensions in a different way and allow me also to congratulate Mr Cercas Alonso on his excellent report."
"I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that our recommendation, on which we shall vote tomorrow, can prove an inspiration to the Gothenburg Summit and particularly will move the Council to involve the European Parliament in a more structural way in future in the discussion on the open coordination method on pensions."
"For that matter I am also grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the work that already been carried out in this field."
"I hope with all my heart that Gothenburg will be able to give a clear mandate to the Belgian Presidency to formulate common social goals in the context of European cooperation on pensions."
"As Mr Smet said just now it is, of course, the Member States who decide what pension system they want, how they organise it, and how they underwrite its financial robustness."
"However, the fundamental aim, namely to maintain and improve the quality of pension systems in Europe, is surely an aim that we must all share."
"It is, of course, clear that because of the dynamics of economic and monetary union, the pension dossier is already on the European agenda, although very one-sidedly, as part of the debate on the financeability of pension schemes."
"We believe that in the discussion we must never lose sight of the essential component, namely modernisation of pension systems so that we can guarantee today' s and future generations of pensioners a reasonable pension and a participation in social life."
"That debate is also about solidarity and also the equality of men and women."
"For us a number of principles are essential in this. I should like to mention four."
"Firstly, pension systems must be able combat poverty in an efficient way."
"It is unacceptable that in the European Union there should still be pensions, especially those of women, that fall below the poverty line."
"I should therefore like to be so bold as to ask the Commission, on the basis of the recommendation of 1992 to retable this pensions dossier on minimum payments."
"Secondly, reasonable pensions are of course more than the minimum necessary for survival."
"It is a matter of guaranteeing a certain standard of living."
"It is therefore important to retain the link between the general rise in prosperity and pensions."
"Thirdly, the second pillar of pensions must never replace the first because it is the first that gives the fundamental guarantee that everyone has access to an adequate pension."
"For my group it has long since ceased to be a question whether one is for or against the second pension pillar. Rather, it is a question of how we are to ensure that, even in that second pension pillar, solidarity is organised so that supplementary pensions do not remain the privilege of a small group."
"Naturally, Mr President, I could also continue the discussion on the necessary raising of the pensionable age, but I shall not do so."
"One thing should be clear: for my group, this does not mean a general compulsory rise in pensionable age, does mean measures to encourage people to continue working longer and to prevent companies from jettisoning older staff."
"I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Gothenburg will be able to translate these principles into common objectives."
"Mr President, seeing the great care taken by the Ecofin Council to anticipate the long-term impact that funding pensions has on public finances makes one wish that equivalent care could be demonstrated with regard to sustainability, in order to prevent the deplorable long-term effects, for example, of the lack of fiscal harmonisation or of investments in the nuclear industry."
"Do not think, however, that the Group of the Greens is suggesting that we entrust the future of pensions to the Ministers of Finance."
"We support those in the Commission, in some Member States and in Parliament, who see the future of pensions and of social protection primarily as social issues, as key elements of the model, which must be strengthened, and which cannot be reduced to its financial dimension."
"To hear some people talk, we might wonder if the prospect of living increasingly longer, and by 'living longer' I mean in good health as well, is not the greatest disaster threatening the citizens of the twenty-first century."
"The report by Mr Cercas Alonso has the merit of not skirting the crux of the issue and of the debate."
"A certain increase in spending on pensions in the GDP is certainly unavoidable because of greater life expectancy, but the rapporteur quite rightly emphasises that changes in the rate of employment is a decisive factor."
"In this context, he recommends taking account of the rate of economic dependence and not only of demographic changes."
"Given the prospect of full employment, this takes us away from alarmist rates, which clearly seek to legitimise new forms of finance, raised individually and through capitalisation."
"The report also emphasises the invaluable role of guaranteed pension systems in combating the insecurity and social exclusion of the elderly, particularly women and workers who have had long periods of atypical work and who should be guaranteed a sufficient level of income to lead a decent life."
"Lastly, the report warns against any attempt to undermine public pay-as-you-go pension systems."
"These systems guarantee intergenerational solidarity, which is essential to social cohesion and they enable real-time adjustments to be made to contributions, regardless of the fluctuations of the stock market situation."
"This is why our group recommends that we adopt this report, without undermining its current balance."
"Mr President, I think there are many good points in the Commission' s report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a job well done."
"Much has been said about solidarity and security. This is exactly what should be addressed with regard to pensions."
"There is still great anxiety about the discussion on pensions."
"My colleagues have expressed unease over certain crucial points."
"In my home country, Sweden, we have already started to adapt to this type of change, and a considerable part of our future pension system will be linked to a supplementary pension based on what happens on the financial markets."
"In Sweden, most people have started buying and selling shares and in the past few years many of them have experienced just how risky buying shares can be."
"Many have lost a great deal of their savings and are now wondering whether the same thing could happen to a pension system which is so heavily dependent on what happens on the financial market."
"There is a worry that the system will be unfair. Most of all, perhaps, there is a worry that it will be unreliable."
"Our group has tabled an amendment to tomorrow' s vote, in which we ask that the effects of the new system are at least assessed and the impact on solidarity on society studied."
"What will happen to security?"
"How will it affect women?"
"Several speakers, including Mrs Jensen and Mrs Van Lancker, have pointed out that women are a particularly vulnerable group, and in many countries I believe that women could lose out in the system now being introduced."
"I would also like to mention our Amendment No 13 in which we address a general raising of the retirement age as a way of solving future pension problems."
"It is tempting to use such a solution to try not only to increase levels and ratios of employment, but also to reduce the pressure on the pension systems."
"However, this presupposes that people will manage to keep working up to the raised retirement age."
"This may work in certain countries as they currently have a relatively low retirement age, at least for certain categories of pensioner."
"However, in my country and other Scandinavian countries, where we already have a relatively high retirement age of 65 - 67, there is currently talk of raising the age threshold to 70."
"I believe this is unrealistic."
"Most people are worn out from a long working life long before they reach retirement age."
"In this situation it is foolish and inhuman to try to force people to remain in the labour market."
"Finally, I would like to point out that I believe it is regrettable that neither the Commission nor the report we are now discussing mentions anything about the candidate countries."
"It could be said that this is a problem for the future, but when talking about pensions we are talking about the future."
"It is clear that there should have been a discussion on what a system of the type we now want to introduce will mean for poor candidate countries."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to address my thanks to the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and my heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done."
"There is no doubt that a prospective cause for alarm in the field of pensions is the ageing of the population."
"But it should be noted above all that some Member States have already undertaken reforms of their systems without trauma, with significant contributions from social actors. These reforms have, over the course of time, also had positive effects on the health of public accounts."
"The problem should therefore, perhaps, be split in two: on the one hand, States that may still have some imbalance in public spending but in the context of a stable economy, and on the other, those that have deficient social security systems and an economy in transition."
"In the first case a gradual approach is essential."
"Almost all public pension schemes, in fact, are still run completely or partly on a pay-as-you-go basis, and without a gradual changeover to a fully funded system, accompanied by harmonious taxation systems and effective family policies, there would be serious social repercussions."
"For the second hypothetical scenario, and in the general case, we agree with the rapporteur in hoping that a convergent basis of parameters for maintaining the dignity of pensioners can be put in place at Community level."
"This will also prevent a widening of social gaps which supplementary schemes, although useful, cannot fully remedy. In the meantime, in fact, the only path open is to increase the contributor base, while noting that the current rise in the employment rate seems rather insecure."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur that what is avoided in all cases is anticipating even for the sake of intergenerational solidarity - paradoxical here - a reduction in the current levels of public protection."
"Mr President, this is a very good report."
"It has received widespread approbation in the committee and I hope that when it is voted on tomorrow it will receive similarly widespread support throughout the House."
"The matter of pensions is a hugely important issue, and I say that not just because I have a vested interest in this matter, being close to pensionable age myself: it is an issue of increasing importance to the people, for example, sitting up at the top in the gallery there."
"Today's youngsters will need a pension in the future."
"We must remember that these generations deserve the same sort of pension security and safety and sustainability as that which we are talking about for ourselves."
"I really just wanted to make a couple of points: there are two amendments that we have put in for the vote tomorrow which very nearly got in through the committee and were only just defeated, and I hope that when they are re-submitted tomorrow in the name of the EPP-ED Group, the whole House will be able to support them."
"They are to do with recognising that pay-as-you-go schemes can no longer be exclusively relied upon to keep people's pension expectations fulfilled and also exhort Member States to sort out their tax and spending policies."
"It is all very well for us to wish that people should have a safe and secure pension, but for this to happen, pensions have to be sustainable, the funding has to be put in place."
"Anything less than that and we would be betraying the generations which are looking to us for support and we must not let them down."
"Mr President, the insurance issue divides political opinion in all the Member States and yet, interestingly, it unites the general public."
"The rapporteur, Mr Cercas, had to cope with pressure to liberalise and privatise the insurance system, alongside other maximalist positions wanting to undermine a whole series of new data."
"He has managed to find the common ground, giving us a report which, it seems, Parliament will adopt by a large majority."
"Of course, congratulations also go to the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, who has courageously speeded up the insurance initiative."
"There are three messages or conclusions which could come out of this report."
"Ôhe first is that we continue to believe that the state insurance system should take priority or, if you like, we believe in the political option of not undermining it."
"The second results from the fact that, in the end, the progressive line has prevailed. This means that the cost of funding the insurance system is not seen as a negative factor in the economy and it is accepted that social protection forms part of sustainable economic development and that there will inevitably be a relative increase in the ratio of pension costs to gross national product."
"This brings us to a third and particularly useful conclusion, which is that there is no such thing as insurance policy per se or insurance policy as an isolated problem and that, within the framework of a horizontal approach, it is a necessary aspect of other policies, especially tax policy, employment policy and policies to combat discrimination and exclusion."
"If these are basic political choices rather than academic declarations, we need to accept that it will not be easy in the future to adopt proposals which may increase inequality, reduce the income of senior citizens and compromise the quality of services provided by the central insurance system."
"I would point out that part of the report constitutes an acceptance of the need for immediate support for the care of the ill and elderly at home in the form of fiscal, social and employment measures, the need to safeguard not just any pension, but a pension which can support a dignified life and the need for a package of proposals so that new insurance legislation can properly assess all the special aspects of women's work."
"In short, without denying the funding aspect of the problem, we have cut it free so that it no longer depends solely on that aspect."
"The people of Europe need to be convinced that we shall pursue our options consistently."
"Mr President, Mr Cercas Alonso has drafted a quite excellent report."
"As we have seen, this is an issue which we are all itching to get our hands on: safe and sustainable pensions, a truly hot potato which gets hotter rather than cooler the longer we leave it."
"That is why both the Member States and the European Union need to act here."
"We need a satisfactory pension system, which is why the reference to the 1992 recommendation is, I think, particularly important."
"But we also need a flexible pension system which has one eye on social change and the need to adjust to the job market."
"The idea of an active old age has, basically, been accepted."
"You only have to think of the employment policy guidelines for 2000, i.e. maintaining employability and lifelong learning."
"I should also like to mention the contribution by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to the report."
"It refers to the numerous women on widow's pensions with no source of income of their own."
"We must reverse the trend whereby these widows' pensions are being whittled away."
"This is one very important matter addressed in the report."
"As far as the future is concerned, the concept of open coordination is on the table."
"We must also ensure that this has real meaning as far as pensions are concerned."
"We should not simply use it as an open sesame; we have to understand that the employment policy guidelines cannot simply be applied line by line."
"On the contrary, we need new forms of coordination and these need to be created."
"For the rest, I really do welcome the fact that the second and third pillars are dealt with as well as the first."
"I would also mention the idea of capital formation by employees."
"We must ensure that capital formation and old-age pensions complement rather than contradict each other."
"The decisive step for the future of social protection in Europe was taken at the Lisbon Council and enshrined in the Treaty of Nice."
"The issues put to the recently-established committee are extremely wide-ranging and require practical responses under the terms quite rightly laid down by the Commission and by the particularly excellent report that we are now assessing."
"I therefore call on the Council to reformulate its mandate for this committee."
"It is not enough to calculate the financial contribution needed to meet the requirements of the various systems. This should already have been done under the Stability Pact since, like employment, social protection is conditioned by macroeconomic policy decisions and by the increased dependence of the elderly and the unforeseeable increase in changes in the labour market, with periods of training alternating with periods of activity and inactivity."
"It is absolutely crucial that we consider the cost to our societies of failing to transfer our citizens' pension systems, in terms of loss of political confidence in Europe, social upheaval, greater insecurity and poverty, a fall in consumption, economic recession and greater inequalities."
"This is the key political question to which we must respond and which the Council must soon answer."
"Capitalisation must have clearly-defined borders and must be part of the solution, not part of the problem."
"It cannot be an obstacle to mobility, because it does not solve demographic problems and does not involve solidarity."
"It involves benefits and risks and stimulates the financial markets, factors which must be considered. It is not, however, and cannot be part of the problem, and would contribute to greater risks for social protection."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are social policy as well as financial, economic and employment policy aspects to the pension issue."
"All these areas must be addressed together if pensions are to be secured in the long term."
"I would also add that we have economic policy guidelines and the stability and growth pact on the question of employment and growth policy."
"When it comes to the question of demographic change as one of the causes of the problem of pensions, there are several problems: one is the unfortunate fall in the birth rate, another is early retirement in numerous countries and a third is longer life expectancy, for which we, of course, thank God."
"As far as birth rates are concerned, we must help to create a stronger awareness of what mothers and fathers contribute from a social policy point of view and ensure that family and work can be smoothly combined."
"As far as early retirement is concerned, we must ensure that the retirement age can be brought up to the statutory retirement age in all countries."
"A variety of measures is needed for this."
"Without doubt, the question of life expectancy has repercussions on the actual retirement age as well as on the statutory retirement age in many countries."
"I trust that we can help to strengthen the second and third pillars as well as the first pillar in Europe."
"We have countries today in which 80% of people in employment have a company pension."
"In my country it is just 9%, while the European average is 25%."
"We are currently debating a directive here in Parliament, and I call on the Council to stop blocking a European regulation on company pensions at long last."
"I call on the Commission to set up a European pension forum to discuss the different fiscal and employment and social regulations and to help harmonise these issues throughout Europe."
"I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cercas, who worked very closely with the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights, resulting in the impressive consensus in today's debate."
"The question of pensions is a key political, economic and social question which every government has to address."
"Some reforms are under way, others are being discussed and others were completed a mere year or two ago."
"So it is a European problem and the sustainability of pensions is the wager for the next generation."
"There is a set of policies which, if they are successful at European level, will support and strengthen the sustainability of pensions."
"The aim of these policies is to increase the rate of growth and employment and they include policies to provide efficient support for parents, so that they can combine work and family, and immigration policies."
"However, over and above these general policies, every country needs to reform the system itself, which has been inherited from a previous era of industrial development."
"This reform is social and economic in nature."
"I think that it is particularly important, as numerous speakers have stressed, that pensions are no longer the exclusive preserve of Ecofin and budgetary discipline and have been discussed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as by the ministers."
"Pensions are, first and foremost, a social issue, but with huge, serious economic implications."
"Of course, under the Treaty, insurance system reforms and policy are national responsibilities."
"But do not forget that we are also required, that it is a specific objective of the Treaty to safeguard a high level of social protection and sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth."
"It is therefore important, post Lisbon, that the heads of state have agreed for the first time that they need to work together on pension issues."
"It is a very important change of direction towards European policies, which illustrates the extent of the problem."
"With cooperation between the Member States, the reforms will no doubt be more efficient in all the countries."
"An initial Commission communication was ordered following Lisbon and has been issued."
"The subject of pensions has been discussed at all the Councils - in Feira, Nice and Stockholm - and the study to be presented in Göteborg is being prepared by the newly formed Committee on Social Protection."
"This study will analyse all the problems Member State by Member State and will table proposals on basic principles for sustainable systems."
"I would just point out that one basic guideline given to this committee concerns the gender dimension."
"Numerous members mentioned that it is impossible to take a neutral approach to the question of pensions because women face more serious problems and poverty in Europe is closely bound up with the pension system and the economic and social position of women."
"What is important is that it was decided post Stockholm to examine the method of open coordination on the question of pensions, taking account, of course, of the question of subsidiarity and the specific problems of each Member States."
"We are preparing a Commission communication, which will be presented before the summer, in which we try to approach the question of the open coordination on pensions in a more analytical manner."
"I must say that this resolution by the European Parliament, assuming that it is approved tomorrow as it stands today, will provide strong support for this coordinated effort to reform pensions in the European Union."
"I think that this new chapter which is being opened at European level, the chapter of collaboration on pensions, will allow for new forms of cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"And may I remind you that the Commission specifically supported the need for the European Parliament to collaborate with the High Level Committee on the subject of social protection and that this collaboration is now under way."
"Honourable Members, I think that the fact that we have opened up this chapter and given a European dimension to the question of pensions will give the governments in all the Member States the support and backing they need in order to bring about sustainable reform, taking account of the economic and, more importantly, the social dimension."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0169/2001)."
"Question No 1 by (H-0323/01):"
"Subject: Common organisation of the market in the sugar sector On 30 June the current sugar scheme will either have to be extended or changed."
"Last year the cost of overproduction in the sugar sector amounted to EUR 800 million, almost as much as the sum made available for dealing with the BSE crisis."
"Despite strong criticism of the current scheme by the Court of Auditors and the negative effects on consumers and third-world producers, the Council appears very unwilling to make changes to the sugar scheme as proposed by the Commission."
"There is a threat that a number of EU Member States may give in to the short-sighted approach based on self­interest taken by the sugar industry."
"Does the Council intend to back the Commission proposal, given the strong criticism of the current sugar scheme by the Court of Auditors and the negative effects on consumers and third-world producers?"
"If not, why is the Council advocating maintaining a sugar scheme which has been strongly criticised by the Court of Auditors and which has negative effects on consumers and third-world producers?"
"Reforming the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector has been discussed by the Council since October last year, during which time the Council has taken on board certain criticism from the Court of Auditors."
"As this House is aware, Parliament made its declaration on this matter on 13 March 2001."
"In looking at this declaration, I can say that it is generally not along the lines suggested by the honourable Member."
"I would also point out that the Commission has stated that it may approve an extension of the current organisation of the sugar markets beyond 1 July 2003 on condition that all the other parts of its reform proposal are approved by the Council."
"I also believe that there is disagreement among Member States between those who support reform and those who oppose it."
"The Council will continue addressing the issue at its meeting in May and will look at all contributions, including those presented in the question which has just been put to the Council."
"In addition, the Council adopted a regulation on 26 February 2001 on the ""Everything but Arms"" initiative to extend duty and quota free access to all products except arms and ammunition originating in a large number of least-developed countries."
"With regard to sugar, full liberalisation of trade will apply from 1 July 2009."
"I understand the caution with which the Council must answer, given the fact that there is so little unanimity among the countries of the European Union, but it remains disgraceful."
"In effect we are subsidising the sugar industry - last year to the tune of over EUR 800 million - as if there were not enough sugar in the world and as if we were eager for these subsidies to help our farmers survive."
"I really think that the policy we are pursuing with regard to the developing countries is and continues to be hypocritical."
"A splendid initiative like ""Everything but Arms"" is actually tainted by the fact that we maintain our hypocritical attitude and prefer to continue doing what suits us, by supporting the sugar producers, who traditionally belong to the castes of our nineteenth-century industrialists."
"I note that we have once again made an exception."
"I hope that the Council will continue to exert pressure for unanimity for reforms."
"The Presidency will do what it can, i.e. ensure that the issue is constantly discussed."
"There are differences of opinion among Member States."
"This is a sensitive issue for many Member States."
"We will be taking the matter up at the Agriculture Council of Ministers in a few weeks and I promise that we will continue to give the issue high priority."
"At the same time, it is unfortunately impossible to predict what any future compromise will look like."
"Question No 2 by (H-0325/01):"
"Subject: Euro Council Despite earlier Council decisions that the preparatory talks held prior to Ecofin meetings between ministers from the 12 euro countries would be completely informal and that only euro-related issues would be discussed, the signs are increasing that such talks are becoming formalised to resemble a 'euro Council' and, in practice, by taking preliminary decisions on a range of Ecofin issues, are taking over real power from ECOFIN."
"Belgium, in particular, has put forward proposals for 'developing' the informal euro Council."
"In view of this situation, what steps will the Council take to put an end to all attempts contrary to the Treaty to formalise a 'euro Council' and gradually transfer Ecofin's powers to such a Council?"
"The 'Eurogroup' is an informal body set up in 1998 on the basis of a resolution on economic policy coordination in stage 3 of EMU."
"The resolution was adopted by the European Council in Luxembourg on 13 December 1997."
"The resolution states that the Ministers of the States participating in the euro-area may meet informally among themselves to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency."
"The resolution also confirms that decisions will in all cases be taken by the Ecofin Council in accordance with the procedures determined by the Treaty."
"The European Council in Nice in December last year welcomed the improvements made to the workings of the Eurogroup and its visibility."
"It also welcomed the intention to extend the range of mainly structural matters dealt with in this forum, with due regard for the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council meeting, i.e. that the Eurogroup be informal and without any decision-making powers."
"I would like to thank Mr Danielsson for his reply."
"In some ways it is positive if it is saying that the Eurogroup does not make any decisions at all."
"My first supplementary question is this: is it really the case that no real decisions are made in the Eurogroup, or is it the case that decisions have already been taken by the time the matter reaches Ecofin, which simply goes along with whatever has actually been decided in the Eurogroup?"
"My second question concerns the future. The Presidency is aware that proposals have come from a number of sides, not least from Belgium, to develop the informal ""Euro Council"" and add more functions."
"Mr Danielsson confirmed that the Eurogroup has started to take on additional functions and address more issues."
"My second question is therefore: can we be absolutely sure that the Eurogroup will not actually take over more and more real power in the future?"
"It is vital for the countries not in the euro to be able to remain outside the euro area without losing power over matters directly concerning the euro."
"I am willing to admit to Mr Gahrton that, on taking over the presidency on 1 January this year, Sweden was quite concerned about how things would work with the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council."
"We were worried that we would end up with a situation in which - as Mr Gahrton was suggesting - decisions would be taken in a room to which we had no access."
"As such, we would receive a 'fait accompli' which we would just have to process in the Ecofin Council."
"However, I can honestly say that things have not turned out that way."
"A great deal of respect has been shown for the principles set out in the decision I quoted from Luxembourg, i.e. the European Council Resolution of December 1997."
"Of course, there is need for discussion in the circle of ministers of finance who share the single currency, but no real decisions are taken in this circle."
"The position of the Ecofin Council has been respected, with great unity shown on the principles of this matter."
"Can we be absolutely sure about what will happen in the future?"
"As someone once said, it is difficult to predict, particularly about the future."
"I think there is every reason to believe that the members of the Council will continue to feel solidarity on the principles laid down in the European Council' s previous decisions, i.e. that the Ecofin Council' s position will be preserved."
"The fact that some representatives have expressed a personal opinion that the position of the European Council should be expanded is a matter for them."
"We are trying to assess how things have worked in practice, and we believe we can say without hesitation that the position of the Ecofin Council has been respected."
"Question No 3 by (H-0329/01):"
"Subject: Western Sahara The UN has decided to extend the presence of MINURSO in Western Sahara by two months in spite of the fact that the settlement plan signed between Morocco and the Polisario Front is not yet fully applicable."
"On the contrary, the threat of renewed armed conflict between the two parties is now greater than ever."
"For example, several indicators point to the fact that Morocco is seeking to rearm, such as the announcement that it is purchasing American or French fighter planes by investing part of the money obtained under the recent agreement between Vivendi and Maroc Telecom (US $ 3.5 bn)."
"The British press has also recently revealed that Morocco benefited from trade agreements with the UK, thus enabling it to acquire more arms and renew its military capability: Mirage fighters, and spare parts which may already have permitted the manufacture of 56 field guns."
"These weapons are now deployed at the border, along the so-called 'defence wall' ."
"If confirmed, this transaction would be illegal since Community legislation - the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports - prohibits the sale of arms to countries or areas where there is a conflict situation."
"Can the Council confirm this information ?"
"Does it propose to intervene with the Member State in question?"
"The Council has not discussed the particular matter brought up in the question."
"Contrary to what is suggested in the question, there is no Community legislation on arms export. Therefore, the question cannot arise of whether or not a particular transaction is legal in accordance with Community Law."
"The Code of Conduct to which the honourable Member refers was drawn up on 8 June 1998 and is based on common criteria for conventional weapons transfers."
"According to the operative provisions of the Code of Conduct, each EU Member State will assess export licence applications for military equipment made to it on a case-by-case basis against the provisions of the Code of Conduct."
"As such, decisions on whether an export licence should be granted are made by each individual Member State, and it is not up to the Council to decide on such individual transactions."
"According to the Code, every year Member States must exchange information on their arms exports in the Council, allowing a joint review of how well the Code is operating."
"This annual review is presented in an annual report in accordance with Operative Provision No 8."
"The general political stance of the Council with regard to the conflict in Western Sahara is to fully support the United Nations and the UN Secretary General' s personal envoy James Baker in their work on finding a solution to the conflict."
"The Council is convinced that the UN process constitutes the best framework for a rapid, lasting and mutually agreed solution which would also increase stability in the whole region."
"It is clear that every solution must be acceptable to all parties and based on complete respect for fundamental democratic principles and human rights."
"In line with this political aim, the Council is willing to contribute to the process and help to create a climate of trust between the parties concerned."
"In this respect, at the end of last year the EU submitted a proposal to the parties concerned for a number of humanitarian and trust-building measures."
"The EU is maintaining close contact with James Baker and is looking into how best to support the UN' s initiatives."
"I would also like to emphasise that the EU is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to the Western Sahara refugees, giving aid of EUR 20 million over the next three years."
"Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council, although I should like express my disappointment that we are unable to ensure that the quite important and strict criteria of this code of conduct are respected."
"Amongst these criteria I would highlight the idea of banning the sale of arms to countries or regions that are involved in conflict."
"This matter is so serious that now, in the United Kingdom, MPs have obtained the right to vet arms sales from their country to anywhere the world. This move has created quite a stir in that country, even though the decision is not retroactive and British MPs cannot take action on this matter of arms sales to the Western Sahara."
"I would nevertheless put my question once again: do you not think that there may be 'sanction' -type measures that the European Union could take when this code of conduct is breached?"
"Furthermore, what concerns me the most is that this affair appears to demonstrate Morocco' s desire to rearm itself."
"Deplorably, it also demonstrates the support that the country is receiving within Europe."
"This can only heighten the already tense atmosphere in the region."
"Although the situation in this 25-year-old conflict is currently deadlocked, largely as a result of Morocco blocking the validation of the electoral lists established by MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), there is a risk of armed hostilities flaring up overnight."
"Can I ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Swedish Presidency plans to issue a statement on the matter before the end of June?"
"I am thinking back to the German Presidency, which made a specific statement on Western Sahara."
"Given this background, why does the European Union not officially recognise the Polisario Front as a negotiating partner in this conflict, something that the United Nations did 25 years ago?"
"The code of conduct concerning arms is not legally binding, so there are no legal grounds for sanctions."
"However, the Swedish Presidency is working to achieve greater openness and transparency in this area as in most others."
"I believe that we have seen several positive, constructive steps taken on the road to greater transparency, even in the application of the code of conduct for arms export."
"We will continue to work with our supporters in the Council to take further steps to increase transparency in the issues surrounding arms export."
"As far as the Western Sahara conflict is concerned, it has gone on far too long."
"I believe that we all currently feel great frustration over the lack of progress."
"However, the Council is of the firm opinion that we can best help the work on finding a peaceful solution by continuing our clear support for the UN and the UN Secretary General' s personal envoy James Baker."
"This is the stance the Council will continue to take."
"The Presidency has given Mrs Boudjenah very satisfactory answers, not just on the subject of the code of conduct for arms but also regarding the conflict in the Sahara. The President-in-Office of the Council is well aware that Mrs Boudjenah' s question arises out of her concern about the conflict between Morocco and Western Sahara."
"He outlined the need to reach an agreement acceptable to all. He stated that Europe is in fact the largest donor of humanitarian aid, contributing EUR 20 million."
"Given that we are the largest donor of humanitarian aid, ought we not to play a major political role in this conflict? We should prevent the inhabitants of Western Sahara returning to arms and an escalation of the fighting."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, an acceptable agreement was reached back in 1992, when the inhabitants of Western Sahara laid down their arms to vote in a referendum which should have been held that same year."
"Do you not agree that the best way forward would be for that referendum to take place, with European backing?"
"The Western Sahara conflict is extremely difficult and has a complicated background."
"I believe that the best course of action for the EU, which wants and will have an active role to play in important and difficult international conflicts, is to provide strong support for the UN' s work."
"I can see from the report presented by Mr Baker in April this year that progress has actually been made in developing various proposals for self-governance for Western Sahara."
"I believe that it would be foolish at this stage for us to choose any other approach than continuing to provide this constructive support for Mr Baker."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I invite you to follow the straightforward train of thought I am about to present."
"You stated that the Council has tackled the issue of the conflict in Western Sahara, and that a range of measures have been taken aimed at rebuilding trust between the parties."
"Do you believe that a measure of trust between the parties is that a Member State, one as important as the United Kingdom, should be selling arms to one of those parties when a cease-fire is in force?"
"Secondly, continuing my straightforward train of thought, which code of conduct are we referring to?"
"My impression is that many individuals and organisations must be referring to a different code of conduct from the one you mentioned. The code you mentioned might or might not exist."
"Thirdly, I hope you will give up that metaphysical position which allows you to state that you support Mr Baker' s efforts without specifying exactly how you propose to do so."
"I would be grateful if you could explain how you plan to support Mr Baker."
"The Council has not had occasion to discuss any individual Member State' s sale of arms to the region."
"I cannot therefore comment on this."
"However, I believe that I have been sufficiently clear in trying to underline the Council' s view of how best to achieve progress in the conflict itself."
"For example, the Council has stated its regret that the situation is deadlocked on the issue of a referendum."
"The UN Secretary General has proposed that the parties discuss alternative solutions to achieve a solution to the conflict, as the issue of a referendum has proved so difficult."
"I repeat that I believe it would be most unfortunate if the EU did not wholeheartedly support the collective, international efforts to solve this difficult conflict."
"Question No 4 by (H-0330/01):"
"Subject: Deaths of four African emigrants on the beaches of Tarifa on the coast of Andalusia, Spain On 21 March 2001 another four people, two men and two women, one of whom was pregnant, were found dead after having tragically drowned, like so many others, in an attempt to reach European territory in search of work and a new life."
"When will the European Union act, directly and by interceding with the Spanish authorities, to put an end to this appalling situation which is a disgrace for all the European institutions and for those of the Spanish state?"
"The Council has had the opportunity to answer similar questions from the honourable Member on several occasions."
"Therefore, the Council' s stance ought to be well known."
"I would refer the honourable Member to the reply to his oral question H-27/2001 of 14 February 2001."
"In addition, let me emphasise the hard work which the Council and the Commission have put into carrying out the action plan for Morocco."
"Let me also point out that the battle against human trafficking is a priority issue."
"I would also like to stress that Spain does not have any authority in Morocco and therefore cannot control when vessels of various kinds leave Morocco."
"Mr Minister, since I raised this issue the last time, thousands of immigrants have continued to arrive on Andalusian, that is European, beaches in small boats, risking their very lives."
"Women, men, young people, both boys and girls, and children, some of whom have arrived dead, discovered lifeless on the beaches and rocks of the tragic border between Africa and Europe."
"Others have been arrested and many have escaped inland to try to find the work that did not exist in their own countries."
"Given this unacceptable situation, when will the European institutions understand that this is their problem and one that affects them directly?"
"When are they going to take action to prevent such occurrences, so that when these people arrive, they enjoy conditions that befit them as our brothers and the human beings that they are?"
"I have already said here on another occasion that the European Union cannot turn a blind eye from a tragic situation that should shame the European and Spanish institutions and that this should force them to implement the measures necessary to remedy the situation."
"The Council is not turning a blind eye."
"The Council realises that this is a major problem which represents a large amount of human suffering."
"The Council is deeply involved in a dialogue with Morocco to try to change the circumstances in such a way that we do not see these terrible examples of human suffering which the honourable Member has brought up."
"I would remind the honourable Member that the decision by the Council referred to in the question is based on a Commission proposal from 26 January 2000, a proposal for a Council Regulation determining the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders, including Colombian citizens, and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement."
"The Council would also like to point out that Parliament confirmed the Commission' s proposal on this issue on two separate occasions, in its declaration of 5 July 2000 and in its second declaration made as recently as 1 March this year."
"The Council adopted the ensuing regulation with a qualified majority on 15 March, and it entered into force on 10 April, i.e. just over a month ago."
"The Council cannot therefore understand Mr Carnero González' view that the decision was wrong."
"The system as it is set up was devised with full consideration for openness and transparency, as Member States should inform the other Member States and the Commission of what measures they are taking in accordance with this regulation."
"For the same reason this information should also be made public in the Official Journal of the European Communities."
"I shall rephrase the question, because it is essential for the Council to reply in political terms. I do not need to be reminded of European Union procedures for adopting decisions of this kind."
"The Council' s decision to include Colombia in the list of countries whose citizens require visas to enter European Union countries is not simply useless in the fight against the organised crime some Colombian citizens might be involved in. It also forces ordinary citizens to bear the additional cost of obtaining a visa."
"Furthermore, this decision clouds relations between the European Union and Colombia unnecessarily."
"In addition to myself, many Colombian intellectuals, led by none other than Mr García Márquez, have stated how close Colombia is to us."
"It has come to my notice, for instance, that Mr García Márquez did not travel to Spain to take part in the recent celebrations marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the newspaper El País. This was to comply with the undertaking given by those intellectuals who stated that they would not travel to the Union, at least, not to Spain, until this rule is withdrawn."
"I would ask you please to reply to my question and I hope the reply will be in the affirmative. Will the Council review this decision in the near future, having first consulted the Colombian authorities and Colombian society?"
"The reason why I gave what Mr Carnero González considers to be a bureaucratic and procedural reply was that there was a suggestion in his question that the decision was wrong."
"As such, I feel there is reason to point out that all the rules, including two hearings in this House, were followed."
"Mr Carnero González is, of course, free not to sympathise with the content of the regulation adopted, but it was taken recently and all applicable rules were adhered to."
"As far as I know, there are no plans to make any changes to the regulation."
"Question No 6 by (H-0338/01):"
"Subject: Report by Christa Klaß, MEP, on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine On 24 October 2000, Parliament adopted by a large majority a report (A5-0195/2000, C5-0090/2000) on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine."
"What stage has been reached in the further consideration of this document in the Council?"
"Why has the Council not yet completed its consideration of this directive?"
"When will the directive be placed on the Council's agenda for final consideration and forwarded to the Member States for implementation?"
"The Commission's proposal and Parliament's report on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine create greater legal certainty for the economic partners concerned in these areas which are so important for wine-growing in the EU."
"Clear rules on cultivation, authorisation, registration and checks should simplify trade and establish a clear legal basis therefor."
"It is incomprehensible that, five months later, the Council has still not reached a decision."
"Let me start by saying that I entirely agree with the honourable Member on the importance of the legal instrument in question."
"Let me also say that the Council appreciates the work of Mrs Klaß as rapporteur for this important issue."
"The Council has also taken on board Parliament' s declaration to a large extent."
"It is therefore quite understandable that Parliament is concerned by the delay in the Council' s final decision on the issue."
"The final decision has been delayed because some Member States have asked for more time to consider the provisions on genetically modified organisms, despite the fact that these provisions are no different from Community legislation in force and are equivalent to those recently adopted in accordance with the Community directives on the marketing of seed and forest reproductive material."
"Adopting the directive was on the agenda at the Agriculture European Council in November of last year."
"It was postponed until December and then until January of this year, as no agreement had been reached on the provisions concerning genetically modified organisms."
"However, the Swedish Presidency aims to reach agreement on the Council supporting and adopting the new legislation before the end of the Swedish Presidency, i.e. by June of this year at the latest."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office if we can reasonably be expected to wait five months for a decision."
"We too have worked on this."
"Think about this directive; in the final analysis it is also about having clear provisions on selection, licensing, registration and control so as to create legal security for vine propagators in the European Union."
"This part is also very important to economic operators and economic partners in the EU."
"On the other hand, according to my information, the plan was to wait until the release directive, i.e. Directive 90/220, had been adopted."
"This directive has now been through conciliation, i.e. it has been adopted."
"I therefore see no reason to delay this any further."
"This directive says nothing about definitive licensing."
"That needs to be decided in the release directive."
"I would therefore ask you to advance, not to block Parliament's work in the Council."
"I totally share the honourable Member' s view."
"The Presidency' s firm strategy is to try to get a decision on the issue."
"As I said, we have until June to try to achieve this."
"Question No 7 by (H-0340/01):"
"Subject: Swedish exemption from rules restricting public access to EU documents A brochure entitled 'The EU Agreement' published in 1994 by the Foreign Ministry's department of trade ahead of the Swedish referendum on EU membership stated that 'the principle of public access to official documents remains intact and is non-negotiable'."
"This promise was given to the Swedish people ahead of EU membership."
"Does this reservation imply that Sweden is exempt from any EU rules which may restrict the application of the national principle of public access to official documents?"
"As President-in-Office of the Council, I can be very brief to start with."
"I would point out that national legislation on public access to documents is not covered by harmonisation of the Community' s legislation."
"Nor do we foresee any such harmonisation in the future."
"Thank you for your answer."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council must certainly have suspected, I am thinking of EU documents received by Member States."
"The EU has now adopted new rules, a Regulation on the basis of Article 355, which means that there is a more secure legal basis."
"The Regulation talks about loyalty to the EU' s rules and also about having to request guidance in cases that are unclear."
"If, on the basis of this Regulation, the Commission and the EU' s Court of Justice find that a country cannot make documents available at national level that are classified at EU level, Community legislation may be contrary to Sweden' s principle of public access to official records."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that such a scenario is out of the question and, if so, why?"
"I believe that a procedure such as Mr Sjöstedt describes is out of the question."
"I note first of all that the introduction to the Act that has been agreed upon expressly states that it is neither the aim nor the effect of the Regulation to change national legislation concerning public access to documents."
"Secondly, Mr Sjöstedt refers to the loyalty principle."
"This is not new."
"We have been living the whole time with what is known as the loyalty principle, as described in Article 10 of the EC Treaty."
"It has not been changed in relation to the agreement made here and approved by Parliament at the beginning of this month."
"I want to emphasise that the consultation procedure being introduced through Article 5 into the new Act is only advisory."
"If we talk about the situation in Sweden, the fact that, in order to be able to make a correct assessment of damage, Swedish authorities may need to consult the institutions when applying the rules concerning foreign secrecy is not in itself anything new."
"That is a familiar fact of Swedish legislation, and the new Act does not change anything in that regard."
"I want to thank the Swedish Presidency, and I want to thank Mr Danielsson for his answer."
"I want also, of course, to express my gratitude for the committed work that has been done to give the EU a new approach to the principle of public access to official records, in this case EU documents."
"I nonetheless wish to ask a question."
"Might we in Sweden see a development in which representatives of Swedish authorities practise self-censorship in situations in which Brussels and European authorities differ from Sweden in the assessments they make as to whether, and to what extent, the secrecy rules are to be applied?"
"This issue of self-censorship and of being able to adopt a distinctively Swedish view when a different assessment is made in Brussels is a relevant subject for discussion."
"The question put by Mr Sacrédeus is obviously of relevance."
"It is perhaps even more relevant in a Swedish Parliament than in this illustrious European Parliament."
"I have a lot of confidence in the Swedish authorities' ability to make independent assessments of such issues."
"I think the risk of self-censorship is very slight."
"Allow me just to emphasise that, in the Council' s view, the system we have had up until now regarding public access to documents is subordinate to the rules on which this Parliament has adopted a position and which it has actively helped to devise."
"We now have an Act covering all documents, and last year' s Solana decision, as it is known, is no longer valid."
"We have compulsory registers."
"We have a requirement for rapid assessments to be made of whether or not documents can be released."
"We have clearly defined provisions governing secrecy etc."
"Thanks in large part to this Parliament, the EU' s institutions will therefore acquire much better and clearer rules governing transparency and accessibility."
"Just to show that this question is not only of interest to Swedish Members of the European Union but to other nationalities as well, is this new procedure in the Council in operation?"
"If not, when will it be in operation?"
"In other words, when can I get my first document out of the Council?"
"I do not know whether the Member is asking the President-in-Office of the Council to assess a practical matter."
"I rather think that is impossible."
"I presume that, once this Act has come into force, all the European Union' s institutions will apply its provisions in a competent way, which means that it will sooner or later be possible for Mr Newton Dunn and others to obtain access to those documents not covered by the secrecy test which must always be carried out."
"Question No 8 by (H-0342/01):"
"Subject: Council's position on acts of violence by Turkey During his recent visit to Skopje, capital of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Xavier Solana, stated that it would be a mistake for the government of FYROM to negotiate with the terrorists (of the KLA)."
"He also added that the FYROM leadership had the support of the EU as there was no place in the Union for those who resort to violent means."
"In the light of this categorical statement, will the Council say why this position of principle does not also apply to Turkey, which used violent means in 1974, in breach of international law, to seize 40% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, which it has since held under occupation in defiance of UN resolutions?"
"Is the Council unaware that the country in question, which has recently been declared a candidate for accession to the EU, uses violent means to prevent the Kurdish minority from exercising its personal and civil rights, uses excessive force against prisoners, imprisons journalists and, in general, exercises the power of the State by violent means, violating all human rights charters, a fact which has also been established on numerous occasions by the International Court of Human Rights?"
"The Council' s position regarding the issue of Cyprus and the human rights situation in Turkey, including the issue of the Kurds, is well known."
"It is perhaps most clearly apparent from the Council' s decision, adopted on 8 March 2001, concerning partnership in connection with Turkey' s accession."
"A considerable number of the priorities and objectives in the accession partnership have to do precisely with human rights."
"Regarding the issue of Cyprus, this Act repeated what was said at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999."
"In the light of the accession partnership and of Turkey' s national programme for adopting the rules, the European Union will now concentrate on ensuring that Turkey really implements these priorities."
"An Association Council is planned for 26 June 2001, when the issue of implementation will be addressed."
"The Commission has given notice that another in the series of reports on Turkey and the other applicant States will be published in November of this year."
"Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office for the reply which he has given me which, in principle, I find satisfactory, although he has strayed from the point."
"I asked because, in Turkey's case, although it exercises violence against Cyprus, a dialogue is under way, on friendly terms no less, and it is already a candidate country, while in other cases Mr Solana says that we do not engage in dialogue with countries which exercise violence."
"I should also like the Council to tell me if it knows about the following new provocation on the part of this country, by which I mean Turkey."
"First, the allegedly pacifist, europhile foreign minister, Mr Cem, threatened that if Cyprus was accepted as a full member of the Union, his country's reaction would know no bounds."
"In other words, he threatens all and sundry."
"Secondly, the Turkish air force has repeatedly and frequently violated Greek air space, forcing the Greek air force into dangerous interceptions."
"Thirdly, the International Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg found last week that Turkey was blatantly violating the human rights of Greek Cypriots from the part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish military."
"What does the President-in-Office have to say about all this?"
"I note, as I have done on quite a few occasions before, that the partnership agreement with Turkey gives the European Union the opportunity to follow political developments in Turkey carefully."
"It also provides an opportunity to conduct a dialogue with the Turkish authorities and the Turkish Government, when the Council considers that such a dialogue is called for."
"According to its usual practice, the Council opts for dialogue as a method of dealing with states of affairs considered to be unacceptable."
"I would also point out that the next opportunity for discussion is precisely the forthcoming meeting of the Association Council with Turkey on 26 June 2001."
"Mr President, this Chamber was illegally stormed this afternoon during the debate on Turkey."
"This is not the first time we have been pestered in this way."
"This is also a question of the security of the European institutions."
"Does the Council have any plans to strengthen security in the European institutions?"
"I do not believe it is for the Council to comment on Parliament' s security arrangements."
"Mr Rübig, I can assure you that security is a matter of great concern for Parliament. The Bureau is currently working on it and considering the budget implications, given that security measures have proved inadequate."
"Clearly, debates must go ahead, regardless of who the protesters may be and of the legitimacy or otherwise of their cause. The Council is not going to be responsible for security in all three premises used by Parliament."
"Rest assured that no effort is being spared in dealing with the matter."
"The second supplementary question is by Mr Fatuzzo."
"You have the floor."
"I have listened to the reply by the President of the Council to the problem that was well illustrated by Mr Marinos: the relationship between Turkey and the Greek Cypriots and the Kurds."
"I should like to ask the Council whether it checks, watches, is aware and takes account in this context of the situation of the Armenian population living in Turkey which also has not inconsiderable problems in manifesting its ethnicity."
"Last week, I met a bishop of the Armenian Church who told me about this very difficult situation of the Armenian population in Turkey."
"Allow me to repeat that one of the advantages of the partnership agreement with Turkey is that it provides the opportunity to carefully monitor the situation in the country."
"That applies not only to the situation of the Kurdish minority but also, of course, to that of the Armenian population."
"Such monitoring is taking place."
"Questions Nos 9 and 10 lapse."
"A letter has been sent to their authors explaining that pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, items already on the agenda are not dealt with during Question Time. As the House will be aware, the Commission and the Council have made statements on the serious issue of those Turkish prisoners on hunger strike."
"Clearly, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure have been applied correctly in this case. There can be no doubt about that."
"In any case, Mr Alyssandrakis has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, it is true that the Council has replied and that the Council and Commission have made statements."
"However, we are allowed a supplementary question during Question Time."
"The decision not to hold a debate under this procedure deprives us of this right."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, these questions may not be raised because they have already been dealt with in the statement by the Council and the Commission."
"I do not believe that applying the Rules of Procedure to this case constitutes a breach of any fundamental right."
"There are many ways in which you may express your views in this House."
"Question No 11 by (H-0348/01):"
"Subject: WEU satellite facilities at Torrejon Following the decisions made at Nice by the European Council, what are the plans and the timetable for transferring these facilities from the WEU to the EU?"
"The European Union confirmed at the Nice Summit that it intends to take over the WEU' s crisis management responsibilities."
"The Council noted the decisions on principle that have been taken to incorporate the appropriate tasks of the Western European Union into the Petersberg tasks."
"These included setting up a satellite centre and an institute for security studies in the form of bodies into which suitable parts of the current, parallel WEU structures would be incorporated."
"The Swedish Presidency was called upon to join with the Secretary General of the Council in continuing the work on this issue in the Council (General Affairs)."
"A draft Community measure on the establishment of a satellite centre for the European Union is in the process of being discussed right now by the Council bodies."
"The Swedish Presidency aims to have it adopted by the Council before the end of June."
"A satellite centre is of the greatest importance for increasing early warning and crisis monitoring capability within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, especially the European security and defence policy."
"The centre must have a constitution and structure which will enable it to respond flexibly to the demands of the European Union and its Member States and to carry out its tasks in close cooperation with existing institutions within the Community at national and international levels."
"The staff and infrastructure of this centre should come, to begin with, from the WEU' s satellite centre."
"The precise arrangements for this have not yet been determined."
"The recently established satellite centre, which is to be located in Torrejón de Ardoz in Spain, will begin its activities on 1 January 2002."
"Thank you for that very full reply, Mr President-in-Office."
"Since the budget will become European Union operational on 1 January, will the budget for the Satellite Centre be part of the European security and defence budget, which the Council will put forward and which Parliament can debate and amend, as necessary?"
"Will it be budgetised within the EU's normal financial procedures?"
"The Satellite Centre' s budget will consist of contributions from the Member States, with these distributed according to what is known as a GNP key. That is to say, it lies outside the traditional budget."
"There will be a special system for sharing responsibility for financing the Centre' s activity among the Member States according to their gross national income."
"Question No 12 by (H-0352/01):"
"Subject: Statements by the President of the USA concerning the Kyoto international treaty The President of the USA has made it clear by his statements that the USA will not observe the Kyoto international treaty, which requires the country to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases, on the grounds that the Treaty is not in the economic interests of the USA."
"The verbal reactions of European leaders to the statements by Bush do not constitute a policy."
"What measures is the Council considering in response to the cynical attitude of the USA which is sabotaging the international treaty?"
"Is the possibility of economic sanctions under consideration?"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"I am satisfied with your answer and just hope that you will continue with your efforts to persuade the United States to join the Kyoto Protocol."
"I just want to add that the issue of the Kyoto Protocol will naturally be an important subject during the discussions between the European Union and the United States which will take place on 14 June 2001 at the European Council' s Summit in Gothenburg."
"The President of the Commission and the President of the European Council will then have the opportunity to emphasise directly to the US President the degree of importance we attach to this issue."
"Question No 13 by (H-0353/01):"
"Subject: Remembrance of the Holocaust Following up the Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson's initiative in arranging the well-received Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust in January 2000, Parliament adopted a written declaration on 7 July 2000 on the remembrance of the Holocaust."
"In that declaration, Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to strengthen their efforts to promote education, remembrance and research about the Holocaust, to encourage the study of the Holocaust in all its dimensions, to encourage appropriate forms of Holocaust remembrance, including an annual European Day of Holocaust Remembrance, and to take all the necessary steps to facilitate the opening of archives to ensure that all documents bearing on the Holocaust are available to researchers."
"What action has the Council taken in response to Parliament's appeals?"
"Are there any current plans to introduce a joint European day or national days of Holocaust remembrance?"
"With regard to the issue of educating people about the Holocaust and raising their awareness of it, I would just remind Mr Sacrédeus of the answer which was given to a written question from Mr Colom i Naval in March 2000 and which I know that you too have had the opportunity to study."
"On the issue of establishing an annual European Day of Holocaust Remembrance, the Council would simply point out that it has not received any practical proposals in this area."
"Those Member States which are involved in the international working party to promote remembrance, education and research in connection with the Holocaust have followed the recommendations of the committee of government representatives and representatives of voluntary organisations, to the effect that annual days of Holocaust remembrance should be established on a unilateral and national basis."
"This has happened in, for example, Germany, Sweden, Great Britain and Italy."
"As from next year, Finland too will have such a national day."
"The Council would emphasise that what history, including the Holocaust, can teach us is that it is necessary here and now actively to combat racism and xenophobia in all its forms."
"In this context, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna will have an important role to play, especially when it comes to cross-border efforts."
"It may also be noted that, on 28 May, the Council and representatives of Member State governments will adopt a declaration concerning the fight against racism and xenophobia on the Internet."
"It is, unfortunately, a sad fact that new technology is exploited by anti-democratic forces."
"As part of the further efforts being made to disseminate knowledge concerning the Holocaust so that it will be possible, for example, to draw conclusions about the ways in which contemporary intolerance is to be combated, an international conference was held in January of this year in Stockholm on the very subject of the fight against intolerance."
"Representatives from all the EU' s Member States, the Commission and the OSCE, together with the Secretary-General of the UN, met to discuss strategies for combating racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia."
"Allow me also to conclude by saying that the Council really appreciates the European Parliament' s commitment in this area."
"I would say a special thank-you to Mr Sacrédeus himself for his work on the important position adopted by Parliament in July of last year on this subject."
"I would thank the Swedish Presidency and Mr Danielsson for their comprehensive answer and for their most generous concluding words."
"The European Parliament' s decision following the written declaration in remembrance of the Holocaust - a direct follow-up to Prime Minister Persson' s initiative in arranging a conference in Stockholm on this subject in January 2000 - indicates that we should like to see the Member States establish national days of remembrance or, better still, a European Day of Remembrance."
"I would point out that - as current President of the EU and, at the same time, the person who took the initiative to arrange this conference - Prime Minister Persson has a unique opportunity and a special authority for getting even more countries than those which Mr Danielsson has just mentioned to establish annual days of remembrance and perhaps to agree upon a common day of remembrance."
"I welcome the work that is being done on combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism."
"My practical follow-up question is this: is the Prime Minister prepared, during the time that remains of the Swedish Presidency, to bring to life - if only on an informal basis - the possibility of an annual day of remembrance of the Holocaust in different countries?"
"It is a very pressing issue that Mr Sacrédeus is addressing."
"It has also been discussed in detail in the Council."
"One conclusion drawn is that there are unfortunately many historical events of the 20th century in which atrocities have been carried out."
"That applies, unfortunately, not only to the Holocaust which we have just been talking about but also to other events which there will be a desire to remember and use as a point of departure in the fight against intolerance and xenophobia."
"We have therefore arrived at the view that it is probably most appropriate to let the issue of a national day of remembrance be purely a national issue and to inspire national authorities to take decisions to establish such days."
"It might perhaps be better to refrain from recommending a specific day, for example 27 January, as a European day of remembrance."
"There are so many other dates."
"For example, there is Crystal Night, which is important to remember in many countries, and we have the days around the end of the war in 1945, which can also be important days to remember."
"We therefore believe that the best course is to inspire national decisions rather than try to put forward proposals to be decided upon at European level."
"Question No 14 by (H-0356/01):"
"Subject: Hake fishery: significant discrimination due to the greater reductions in sub-area VIII (Bay of Biscay) In December 2000, the EU Council of Ministers for Fisheries set the TACs and quotas for Northern hake for 2001 providing for a greater reduction in the allowable catch (45%) in sub-area VIII (Bay of Biscay) than in the more northern sub-areas (58.9%) without any justification based on scientific management advice, given that for the purposes of monitoring and scientific assessment, this resource has since the late 70s been considered to form a single stock which is not divided into regional components."
"What criteria did the Council use to justify this distinction?"
"Given that there is no scientific evidence to show that the stock consists of different components rather than constituting a single fish population occupying a vast area of the sea, is the Council aware that the subjective political criteria used have resulted in significant discrimination against some fleets in the Community ?"
"Does it not consider that it should take this into account so that it can remedy the situation when setting the TACs for 2002?"
"I would first of all refer to the answer to Question No 280, given by the Council to the honourable Member during the part-session in April of this year, and also add the following."
"In the light of scientific opinions from the ICES, recommending that lowest possible catches be adhered to and that a recovery plan be implemented for the stock in question, the Council has laid down the Total Allowable Catch for hake at 22 623 tonnes, compared with 42 090 tonnes during 2000."
"The Commission had proposed a TAC of only 11 000 tonnes for 2001."
"The Total Allowable Catch for hake is divided up into four administrative areas."
"According to the scientific information to which the Commission had access, the situation regarding hake in Divisions VII a, b, d and e was worse than in the three more northerly areas, which is why a proportionately greater reduction in the TAC was made there."
"Measures for 2002 must be taken in the light of the current discussion concerning a recovery plan for hake."
"I cannot understand your reply. According to the information at my disposal, scientific studies consider northern hake to be a single stock."
"I therefore have no idea as to the source of the data differentiating between the Bay of Biscay and elsewhere with regard to the situation or the reduction in stock."
"Secondly, I should like to suggest to the President-in-Office of the Council that the Council should have taken socio-economic and commercial factors into account. As far as possible, it should have safeguarded the viability of hake fishing, insisting on strict compliance with the technical measures for fisheries management which the common fisheries policy has been unable to implement in recent years, despite the constant warnings issued by the bodies from which the scientific management council is drawn."
"The distribution of quotas is based upon biological and scientific advice and not, therefore, upon socio-economic advice."
"According to the scientifically based advice, the serious situation of the hake stock requires drastic measures to be taken."
"Because there is clear scientific evidence that the hake stock is at present considerably over-fished, a number of measures have been proposed by the scientific advisers in this area."
"These will, of course, have short-term socio-economic effects but, hopefully, also positive, long-term effects when it comes to the stock."
"Question No 15 by (H-0357/01):"
"Subject: Chairman of the EU Military Committee The post of chairman of the Military Committee has been created within the structures of the Council of the EU."
"Which institution will pay this official' s salary, how will it be determined, and is it intended to seek the European Parliament' s approval for the post and the appropriations necessary to pay for it?"
"The chairman of the European Union' s Military Committee is a part of the despatching Member State' s delegation, in the same way as the chairman of a committee or working party within the Council."
"That also applies to chairmanships that do not go with the Presidency, such as the chairmanships of the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee for Economic Policy."
"It is therefore up to the despatching Member State to determine and pay out the chairman' s salary."
"The procedure for appointing the chairman of the European Union' s Military Committee does not require the European Parliament' s approval."
"Thank you for your answer."
"The matter is clear."
"Have you forgotten, however, that you promised to send out information concerning the so-called wise men' s salaries in the Austria case?"
"That was something you promised last time."
"Do you intend to send out that information?"
"I can assure the honourable Member that I have in any case signed the answer."
"I hope that it is on its way."
"Sometimes, it is an awfully long way between Stockholm and Strasbourg, but I can promise that the answer is on its way."
"Let us hope that the problem will have been resolved by the next sitting, and that the Community letter will have arrived."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 16 and 17 will be taken together."
"Question No 16 by (H-0359/01):"
"Subject: Association Agreement with Algeria and the situation of women Will the forthcoming Association Agreement between the EU and Algeria provide for any commitment to defend the human rights of women (including the right to education in rural areas) and to improve the status of women within the family?"
"What improvements are planned?"
"What assistance will the EU provide to ensure that the process of democratisation also reaches women?"
"Question No 17 by (H-0377/01):"
"Subject: Algeria It is now estimated that 200 000 people have been killed over the past ten years in Algeria."
"These killings are continuing at a rate of about 200 a month."
"Will the Swedish Presidency indicate what measures it has taken during its Presidency in support of an international independent inquiry into these killings and what initiatives it intends to pursue at UN level with a view to stopping the killings and the reported widespread use of torture?"
"Allow me first of all to point out that the negotiations for an Association Agreement between the European Union and Algeria are going according to plan but that a number of important issues remain to be resolved."
"The negotiators meet almost every month with a view to concluding the negotiations this year."
"Much has been achieved."
"Algeria has already given its preliminary approval to the following human rights wording: 'Respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires the domestic and external policies of Algeria and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.'"
"This broad reference covers human rights for all human beings, irrespective of gender, as well as all areas of civil and political, as well as social, economic and cultural rights."
"Another provision in the draft gives each of the contracting parties the right to take suitable measures if it considers that the other party has omitted to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement."
"In the ongoing negotiations, agreement has also been reached concerning two important matters affecting the situation of women. Special emphasis is to be placed on giving the female section of the population access to education, including technical education, higher education and vocational education; and - within the framework of social cooperation - priority is to be given, through education and the media, to promoting women' s role in the process of economic and social development, concurrently with Algerian policy on the issue."
"Concluding an Association Agreement will facilitate and institutionalise the political dialogue with Algeria, including on issues affecting human rights."
"With regard to Mr Andrews' s question, the Council shares his concern about the murders which have taken place in Algeria over the last ten years."
"Through the Swedish Foreign Minister, the Presidency addressed the issue at the meeting for political dialogue between the European Union and Algeria which took place in Algeria on 24 April."
"We expressed our concern about disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture."
"Moreover, a list of such cases was passed to the Algerian authorities, and we requested information about these cases."
"The European Union has also expressed its concern along the same lines at the annual meeting with the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"Within the framework of MEDA' s technical and financial aid to Algeria, the EU supports a project for modernising the police force."
"The programme includes training in respect for human rights in the course of police interventions. EUR 8.2 million have been set aside for this purpose."
"The European Union is also providing aid to selected institutions with a view to strengthening civil society."
"Once the Association Agreement with Algeria that I have just mentioned has been concluded, the political dialogue with Algeria will be institutionalised."
"We shall then have a framework within which we can express our concern about, and criticisms of, Algeria."
"I am grateful for the reply given by the President-in-Office of the Council. However, his role is to some extent that of a messenger and he must know as well as I do that women' s rights will be disregarded unless there is an explicit reference to their recognition in the association agreement."
"We are discussing a country where Algerian Berbers were killed as a result of police charges on 29 April of this year."
"We are actually talking about an association agreement with that country."
"I do not think that an explicit reference to the rights of women and Berbers is too much to ask. This association agreement should also provide for the respect of the civil, cultural and linguistic rights of Algerian Berbers."
"Is the President-in-Office of the Council prepared to pass on this request?"
"As I stated in my answer, the general wording on human rights is included in the draft Association Agreement which is now on the table."
"It is important that the General Declaration of Human Rights in the Association Agreement should cover not only women but also minorities."
"You yourself mentioned the Berbers."
"There are many other groups which also need to be mentioned."
"As an example, I can assure you that, with this general wording as a basis, the Swedish Foreign Minister, who is a woman, made clear references to precisely this need to draw attention to the position of women in Algeria."
"That is repeated the whole time in the dialogue with Algeria, and we shall be able to repeat it still more powerfully once we obtain an Association Agreement."
"The Agreement will give us a framework which will make it possible to address all the problems related to human rights."
"I believe we have precisely the same view of the necessity for improving the position of women in Algeria."
"I also believe that we have precisely the same view on the need to ensure that Algeria does not only respect women' s rights, but all human rights."
"Let us therefore work together in order to achieve this."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for a very comprehensive reply, and it seems to me that everything is going to be perfect after this Association Agreement is concluded."
"I want to ask him: Does the Council intend to approve this Association Agreement if the appalling human rights abuses continue in Algeria?"
"It is all very well to have human rights agreements signed, but the reality is that no matter what efforts have been made in Algeria over the years by the Council and by the European Union, the situation, like in Turkey, has got worse instead of better."
"I want to ask him: Is it the intention of the Council to agree to the final statement on the association agreement when it arises in October or November?"
"My own feeling is that every possible sanction should be imposed on the Algerian Government to ensure that human rights are respected for everyone: men, women and children."
"I do not want to anticipate the Council' s final position on the Association Agreement, but I nonetheless think it is important to ask the question. Why does the European Union have such an instrument as an Association Agreement?"
"It is not, in any case, because an Association Agreement would give a government or a country some kind of carte blanche to do whatever it likes."
"An Association Agreement exists because the European Union desires a framework, a form within which, for example, a political dialogue can be conducted - also concerning matters about which there is no agreement."
"That is why we want Association Agreements."
"The Council believes that this is a more effective instrument than just letting things happen."
"As the case of Turkey shows, the Association Agreement is an effective instrument enabling the European Union to highlight and criticise states of affairs it does not accept."
"Matters proceed slowly sometimes, and we can all feel frustrated but, in these contexts, dialogue is always more effective than isolation."
"Question No 18 by (H-0366/01):"
"Subject: ""Everything but arms"" agreement What are the consequences for Community banana producers and traditional ACP suppliers of the recent ""everything but arms"" agreement to eliminate tariffs for the least developed countries?"
"This is an important issue that the honourable Member has addressed."
"I shall therefore give a relatively long answer, in spite of the lateness of the hour."
"As the honourable Member is aware, what is known as the 'Everything but arms' Regulation was adopted by the Council on 26 February 2001, when freedom from duty, without any quantitative restrictions, was extended to include all products, except for weapons and ammunition, originating in the world' s 49 least developed countries."
"The Regulation came into force on 5 May 2001."
"We think that this measure forms a significant contribution to the economic development of the least developed countries and that it is also concrete proof of the European Union' s political goodwill towards the developing countries in connection with the preparations for the next round of the WTO negotiations."
"The Regulation was the result of intensive discussions in the Council, where full account was taken of the consequence analysis prepared by the Commission and of the Member States' need for assurances concerning the more detailed provisions for implementing the proposed system."
"These assurances related not only to the Member States' interests, but also to the consequences of the proposal for those ACP states that are not among the least developed countries, as well as to the desire to guarantee that the least developed countries themselves, rather than third parties, benefit from the new system."
"The doubts related mainly to three particularly sensitive products: bananas, rice and sugar."
"The final text took account of these doubts, while the main principle, according to which the EU should adopt meaningful measures to improve the economic situation in the least developed countries, was maintained."
"When it came to bananas, rice and sugar, implementation was therefore deferred until such time as agreement had been reached on the principle of access without duties and quotas."
"Where bananas were concerned, complete liberalisation was postponed until 2006."
"In the meantime, annual 20 per cent reductions in duty would be introduced as from January 2002."
"In the light of the problems of infrastructure that would-be banana exporters in the least developed countries at present encounter, it is difficult at this stage to assess with certainty what direct effect the Regulation will have on the banana market."
"As has been mentioned previously, adjustments have been made to the Regulation so that account might be taken of the misgivings experienced in this regard in the European Union and the banana-producing ACP countries that do not belong to the group of least developed countries."
"Moreover, the Commission has undertaken to monitor the application of the Regulation in order to discover and deal with all the difficulties as soon as possible."
"The Commission will investigate to what extent the least developed countries are benefiting from the Regulation, whether the available tools are sufficient for tackling - where justified - more serious disturbances in Community markets and when it is a question of bringing the adjustment mechanisms into play, especially for rice, sugar and bananas."
"In the light of this investigation, the Commission will present a report in 2005 and table the necessary proposals."
"As the honourable Member certainly knows, the Council is fully aware of its ACP partners' problems when it comes to the operation of the banana market and is doing its utmost to take account of these misgivings in all relevant initiatives."
"In connection with the Cotonou Agreement, the EU acknowledged the overwhelming economic importance of exports to the EU for banana suppliers in the ACP countries and agreed, if need be, to take measures to guarantee the continued profitability of banana-exporting companies in the ACP countries and continued opportunities to sell their bananas in the EU market."
"When the Council acts in order to meet the need to alter the organisation of the banana market so that it complies fully with the WTO' s rules, the attempt will therefore also be made to introduce guarantees to prevent ACP bananas from being excluded from the market."
"On this point, I also want to mention the agreement in principle reached immediately before Easter between the Commission and the United States regarding the protracted dispute between the EU and the United States concerning the trade discipline for bananas."
"In very general terms, those parts of the agreement concerning ACP suppliers are designed to protect the latter' s position by guaranteeing more reliable and more favourable conditions for the ACP states' access to the EU market."
"Of special importance in this regard is the proposed introduction of a quota, exclusively reserved for ACP suppliers, and of an historic licence system which is seen to benefit the ACP suppliers more than the previous 'first come, first served' proposal."
"In this connection, I would also remind you that, when, in 2006, the EC' s organisation of the market in bananas becomes a duties-only system, a reduced duty will, in any case, give the ACP states a relative advantage."
"According to the Commission' s proposal, the Council will have to submit formal points of view regarding certain details of the agreement in principle with the United States."
"Parliament' s views will, of course, be sought regarding each possible change to the Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas."
"Finally, I would remind you of the Council Regulation establishing, from 1 January 1999, a special aid scheme for ACP states that are traditional banana suppliers."
"This system offers technical and financial aid to help ACP suppliers adjust to new market conditions and increase their competitiveness, at the same time as encouraging environmentally more friendly production and marketing methods."
"The financial and technical aid supplied in accordance with this Regulation amounted to almost EUR 45 million in 2000."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his detailed reply. However, I would like to ask him whether as from 1 January 2006, pursuant to the new banana regime, the only protection offered to Community banana producers and ACP countries which are also included will be the tariff."
"The Community has just given up the tariff."
"Consequently, no protection of this sort will be available after 1 January 2006."
"I anticipate that the beneficiaries of this measure will be the large multinationals."
"If I were in charge of a multinational company, I would relocate the plantations from Central America, Ecuador or any other country to one of those least developed countries. The reason would be that thanks to this agreement I would be assured that as from 1 January 2006 there would be no restriction on the import of bananas."
"My question to the President-in-Office of the Council concerns whether consideration has been given to the implications of all this both for Community producers, some of whom live in very underdeveloped areas of the Community, and for producers in other ACP countries who do not enjoy a particularly high standard of living either."
"As I mentioned, the Commission has carried out a consequence analysis of the effects on the Community' s own banana production."
"The Commission' s assessment is that there will be minimal consequences in the medium term."
"The honourable Member also indicates other possible measures that multinational companies can take on the basis of these changed rules."
"It is precisely in order to be able to counter such measures that the Commission will be reporting - next time in 2005."
"I assume that there will subsequently be continuous monitoring by the Commission so that this new organisation of the market in bananas is not abused."
"I am convinced that, with its usual diligence and promptness, the Commission will see to it that this new scheme, whose main aim is to benefit the least developed countries, is not abused."
"Thank you for being so very helpful this afternoon, Mr Danielsson."
"We shall now invoke the Rules of Procedure."
"Questions Nos 19 and 20 lapse because the Middle East has already been referred to in the statement made this morning by the Commission and the Council."
"Questions Nos 21 and 22 have been withdrawn."
"As the time allocated to Question Time to the Council has now elapsed, Questions Nos 23 to 44 will receive written replies."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Aid scheme for olive oil"
"The next item is the combined debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0137/2001) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulations No 136/66/EEC and (EC) No 1638/98 as regards the extension of the period of validity of the aid scheme and the quality strategy for olive oil [COM(2000) 855 - C5-0026/2001 - 2000/0358(CNS)];"
"(A5-0114/2001) by Mr Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the European Court of Auditors' Special Report 11/2000 on the support scheme for olive oil, accompanied by the Commission' s replies [C5-0009/2001 - 2001/2001(COS)]."
"Mr President, it is now two years since the COM in olive oil was last reviewed."
"Hoping to receive more and better information on the actual situation in the sector, the Commission has postponed the final review for two years. It has presented a proposal with a bearing on quality aspects and market actions."
"Although the proposal' s aim is commendable, it does have a number of shortcomings concerning three issues: the market situation, checks, and the marketing of blended oil."
"Public intervention purchases were done away with in the 1998 reform, against Parliament' s wishes."
"This decision was taken even though their average cost was the lowest in existence."
"As a result, market prices have fallen dramatically and the producers' income has dropped."
"This matter is not part of the Commission' s proposal, but that does not justify turning a blind eye to the consequences of the last revision."
"In its replies to the Court of Auditors, the Commission stated that it would make provision for closer checks in this revision."
"It has to be said that in general, it has failed to do so. The report therefore formulates proposals to improve the efficiency of controls by increasing the frequency with which oil mills are to submit information and introducing similar conditions for aid to pomace oil."
"Parliament has been speaking out about the problems ensuing from marketing blends of olive oil and other fats since 1996. We have called for similar protection to that in place for milk and butter, for example."
"Unfortunately, no regulations have been adopted in response to these requests."
"On this occasion, the proposal' s shortcoming is all the more conspicuous since the Commission' s proposal focuses on quality strategy."
"The European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture therefore proposes a ban on marketing blends of olive oil and other fats, in line with measures already in place in most of the producer countries."
"Regarding the content of the proposal, the designations proposed by the Commission have been somewhat modified."
"In addition, the report proposes a number of measures concerning labelling. The most significant of these is aimed at preventing the designation 'olive oil' being used as an advertising slogan, thus confusing the consumers."
"In cases where olive oil was not the only fat contained in a food product, the use of the denomination 'olive oil' would therefore be restricted to the quantitative description of ingredients."
"As far as labelling is concerned, the inclusion of two other details is proposed: the origin of the oil, namely the place where the olives were grown, and in the case of ordinary oil, a requirement to state that it is produced from refined and virgin oils."
"I trust the Commission will respond more positively to these points than it has in the past."
"On 25 October last, for instance, the Commission rejected some thirty of our amendments to the proposal for the COM in fruit and vegetables on the grounds that they would be included in a later report."
"That report has now been published, but the substance of our amendments was not included."
"Furthermore, our document includes a number of amendments aimed at making the Commission' s proposal more flexible and precise."
"The Commission intends it to be implemented in two years' time, through the collaboration of what it terms the 'organisations of economic agents' ."
"Since the actions planned are to be financed partly from a deduction withheld from aid to production, it follows that producers will be involved in the administration."
"Some clearly defined entities already exist, such as producers' organisations, their associations and interbranch bodies."
"Given the circumstances, a two-year period for the introduction of the proposed actions should not be necessary."
"A clear list of actions which may not be included should also be drafted, to provide legal certainty and speed up and facilitate the preparation of programmes."
"Their amendments have enriched the report considerably, bringing it into line with the requirements of producers and consumers in all the states involved. This was evident at the meeting organised by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture in Verona as recently as last April."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by offering my sincere congratulations to the European Court of Auditors, whose report on olive oil has made another major contribution to the debate on the effectiveness of the system of common organisation of the markets under which the common agricultural policy still operates."
"My first thanks go to the Commission, which spared no effort during the drafting of this report to make themselves available, to answer the questions put to them and to explain their decisions. I also wish to thank our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the draftsman of the opinion on this report, Vincenzo Lavarra and the rapporteur on the olive oil sector, Mr Jové Peres."
"My sincere thanks go to them for their contributions and for the way in which they cooperated so willingly with me."
"I wish to make very special mention of the excellent study on the environmental impact of the common organisation of the market in olive oil, produced for the Commission' s Directorate-General for the Environment by accredited institutions for agro-environmental analysis, from which I shall quote frequently in this speech."
"The COM in olive oil is based on aid for production. In other words, it encourages higher productivity as a means of increasing farmers' incomes."
"The average production of an olive grove varies between 200 kg and 500 kg per hectare per year for traditional olive groves in poorer areas and between around 8 and 10 tonnes per hectare per year in the more intensively cultivated groves with the best soil."
"Since it is possible, then, to increase the productivity of olive groves by 10 or even 20 times, a policy geared towards increasing the quantity produced has inevitably led to traditional olive groves and the most difficult land to cultivate being abandoned and has led to the intensification of production on more fertile land."
"Traditional plantations have a low density of trees, which are generally old - trees that are centuries old are common - also contain arable crops or grazing land for sheep or goats, are frequently planted in terraces and are very labour intensive."
"The value of olive trees for heritage and for the landscape in terms of protecting land from floods and landslides or in terms of increasing biodiversity is incalculable."
"The study to which I just referred counted 120 plant species, 70 species of vertebrates and 160 species of invertebrates in traditional olive groves in the province of Cordoba in Andalusia."
"Ancient olive groves and trees play a particularly important role in preserving many species of birds."
"The value of subsidies for production is too low in this area and traditional olive groves are being abandoned throughout the Mediterranean, with the inevitable damaging consequences for the environment and for rural development."
"Modern intensive plantations have a high density of low-yield trees, which are chopped down after a few years. These plantations use copious amounts of water for irrigation, up to 350 kg of fertiliser per hectare and pesticides and herbicides to clear the soil of vegetation."
"These plantations do not use terraces, which often creates slopes of more than 12%."
"It is estimated that modern olive groves in Andalusia have caused erosion of 80 tonnes per hectare, whereas more than 50 tonnes of erosion per hectare is considered to be an extremely serious level."
"The around 1 million new intensive plantations in Andalusia are therefore causing erosion at a rate of 80 million tonnes of soil per year, making this one of the main factors for desertification in the southern Iberian Peninsula."
"Although fewer studies have been made of the problem in these areas, it also affects huge swathes of the Peloponnese, Crete, the Aegean islands and Tuscany."
"In areas such as Liguria and in many parts of Portugal, erosion is caused more by traditional olive groves being abandoned than by the establishment of modern groves."
"The current system of production-related aid is not only stimulating the human and environmental desertification of the southern part of our continent, but is also making the work of those who adulterate olive oil easier, enabling them to cheat the Community budget, cheat consumers of their right to buy a natural, high-quality product, and cheat the farmers."
"The level of fraud and irregularities uncovered by this Court of Auditors report on the olive oil sector is far too high."
"It is true that there is every indication that the only reason for more fraud being discovered in olive oil than in milk is that there are tighter controls, not because there is any greater propensity to commit fraud in that sector."
"The European institutions must make the fight against the adulteration of food in areas such as meat, milk, wine and olive oil absolute political priorities, which will inevitably mean overhauling the way in which the CAP operates."
"Preserving and improving the environment and farmers' incomes is the prime objective of the agricultural chapter of the Treaty."
"Our current approach, however, is proving of greater benefit to the agro-industrial conglomerates than to agriculture. It is causing the desertification of the poorest rural areas, is having a damaging effect on the environment and makes the sale of bogus products easier."
"We therefore need to abandon the old COM system of providing incentives for productivity and to create a new CAP that focuses on protecting farmers' incomes, the rural world, quality and the environment."
"Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Jové, for his splendid work and for always being willing to collaborate with members of the Committee on Agriculture."
"I should also like to thank the European Commission for its report on quality strategy for olive oil and for the draft regulation. Both these documents are sound in principle."
"Nonetheless, the proposal in question has been much improved by Parliament' s report. Allow me to highlight a number of areas where this is the case."
"Regarding checks, we fully agree that they should basically be undertaken at the level of the oil mills. This is a far more efficient method of monitoring."
"The geographical oil information system should become complementary to it. Secondly, as far as mixtures of olive oil and other fats are concerned, we advocate a total ban on marketing."
"The consumer can easily be misled by such mixtures, and olive oil' s reputation will be adversely affected. It should be noted that this in no way restricts consumer choice, as any individual interested in such a mixture can produce it for personal consumption."
"Thirdly, following revision of the COM in 1998 and the end of intervention aid buying, aid to private storage became the only way of regulating market prices."
"This measure has not been implemented correctly, however. As a result, price levels have been below the limits set by the Council for many months, when such measures had not been authorised."
"It is therefore very positive that Parliament' s report should call for the automatic opening of private storage. This will allow olive oil prices to be maintained at an appropriate level."
"Its purpose is to ensure that the by-products of olive mills are handled in an environmentally-friendly way. We feel that such aid should be calculated with reference to the amount of pomace oil actually produced, and should not be awarded on a lump sum basis as is currently the case."
"Furthermore, this proposal is certain to have a beneficial impact on quality strategy."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs on these important issues."
"I shall just take a few minutes to comment on the proposal for a Council regulation on the new COM for olive oil, first thanking Mr Jové Peres for the competence and willingness he has shown, which have led to the considerable understanding of our Committee."
"The conditions were not right for a thorough reform and so we have chosen to bring forward the introduction of some important rules allowing this sector to face the new challenges posed by the World Trade Organisation, the liberalisation of the markets and the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"This has been the driving force that has led us to identify specific rules and requests for new aid."
"In particular, for us it is important to give the origin of the oil as the place where the olives were harvested and not where it was produced."
"We have the duty of transparency and of coherence with the principles of traceability: it is a matter of courtesy to the producers and the consumers."
"I hope the Council will approve our position and issue an order to revise Regulation 2815."
"Equally worthy of consideration are the ban on blending olive oil with other oils or fats and the incentive to the producer organisation to increase market supply capacity, because this is the paradox to overcome: a rising demand for consumption of this precious commodity and a fall in prices."
"With these measures we think the whole sector can be sustained, and I am pleased to finish with a particular comment on the method we have used, that is to say the meeting of Parliament with the whole sector, which has led to these points which I hope we will approve today in this House and which I hope may guide the final decision of the Council."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Peres for the work he has done and especially for his willingness to receive proposals and suggestions;"
"I thank the Commission for having done such a thorough job; and I thank the Committee on Agriculture for having unanimously approved the amendments tabled."
"This means there may be a unanimous vote in Parliament tomorrow, and there is hope that a strong proposal may reach the Council, strong because it is expressed by a unanimous Parliament."
"It is true that in the debate about the reform of the common agricultural policy, which is beginning to be discussed, the conviction is emerging from many parts that in time aid for production will gradually be cut down."
"Producers are not frightened by this prospect as long as it is possible to sell on the market at a fair price."
"This objective can be pursued essentially in two ways: either by organising a promotion, information and consumer awareness campaign as well as advertising the product, which is the only way to make quality prevail on the market, or by preventing and discouraging fraud and adulteration."
"The latter is a problem that cannot be left just to the Member States, but one that the whole Union must face by understanding that it is responsible."
"The amendments tabled and approved are a step in this direction."
"Here I shall ask the Commission a formal question."
"With this resolution we are going to intervene in Regulation 1638/98."
"There is, however, an amendment which explicitly seeks an undertaking regarding Regulation 2815, the regulation which provides for the possibility of marketing oil without labelling and lays down the origin of the product linked to the place of pressing and not the place of harvesting."
"Commissioner Fischler gave me and Mr Lavarra an undertaking that at the time of the COM reform this Regulation too would somehow be eliminated or at least modified."
"The Regulation expires on 31 October 2001."
"My question is this: what is the Commission going to do?"
"Does it intend to keep faith with this undertaking and also with this approved amendment which will surely be approved by Parliament tomorrow, and thus not renew this Regulation from November 2001 onwards, or change it in line with the wishes of the highest democratic assembly?"
"We ask for an explicit undertaking by the Commission because while we are discussing and legally intervening in Regulation 1638 we do not want the other Regulation to go off in a different direction which does not allow for the possibility of its being legally amended."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its report, and also by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, for his excellent input."
"In my opinion, the Commission' s proposal to extend the current aid regime for a further two years is sound. However, I share the sector' s concern at the Commission' s intention to resort entirely to an operational geographical oil information system for future monitoring of this regime."
"We feel this could prove a good monitoring tool, but only a complementary one."
"We believe it would be more useful and fairer to put in place appropriate checks at the oil mills, not just a geographical information system. Hopefully, such checks would be more effective in preventing fraud."
"We do not agree with the Commission' s proposal where it introduces a new concept, that of economic operators."
"This concept is quite unclear. Any one of us could set up tomorrow as an economic agents' organisation and withhold significant funds from those genuinely involved in oil production, namely producers' or interbranch organisations recognised by the Member States themselves."
"This is essential to pursue fraudulent blending with seed oil. The ban must be central to management of the olive oil market, so as to avoid defrauding customers and to establish a clear policy on quality and food safety."
"We endorse the general feeling within the Committee on Agriculture concerning the new designations. They result from extensive consultation with the sector, as does the reduction of maximum permitted acidity for extra virgin oil."
"Ladies and gentlemen, no other crop is so closely linked with the people of the Mediterranean and with their culture. No other crop shaped the landscape over thousands of years, as this one has."
"We are convinced of the environmental value of olive groves in maintaining biodiversity and stemming the advance of desertification. Those of us who live in the area are especially aware of this."
"In drafting programmes aimed at improving the environmental impact of olive groves, consideration should therefore also be given to recycling material removed when pruning the groves. Both the olive wood and the leaves can be used commercially, thus taking full advantage of all the by-products of cultivation."
"Following the last 'reform' of the common organisation of the market in the olive oil sector and now that the transitional period has come to an end for the Commission to change the aid system, from aid for production to aid per tree, the Commission has presented its strategy for olive oil quality and is extending the present aid system for a further two years."
"This extension is to be welcomed, but the Commission has failed to provide a solution on three points that were not resolved in the 1998 reform. These are: the establishment of compensation aid for small producers, as proposed by Parliament; a ban on the sale of olive oil mixed with other fats and labelling that does not mislead the consumer and which only gives the name 'olive oil' to products made from olives."
"Furthermore, doing away with mechanisms for public intervention and replacing them with private stockpiling has not managed to prevent a fall in prices and the consequences of this on reducing farmers' incomes."
"Salvador Jové' s report seeks to resolve some of these fundamental issues, particularly with regard to blends, and I support his ideas on this matter."
"The report by Paulo Casaca undermines the European Parliament' s resolutions by using an opinion on the report by the Court of Auditors to go ahead with proposals to replace the current system of aid for production with direct aid to farmers, which opens the way to the Commission' s option of per tree premiums."
"We must reject this proposal."
"Aid per tree would not only have damaging consequences for production and for employment - with the olives not being harvested - but we would also lose a key element for monitoring the production of olive oil and its quality. This would consequently increase opportunities for fraudulent practices."
"Mr President, several times over the last year I have addressed enquiries to the Commission for news about the large consignments of extra-Community oil imported into Italy via third countries."
"I have requested that a Community database be set up for oil and that Regulation 2568/91 be revised, in order to check analytically for the presence of hazelnut oil in the olive oil imported into Italy."
"Unfortunately the answers have never been reassuring, and sometimes they have been quite alarming."
"The observations made in the explanatory statement in the Peres report are all true, highlighting once again the demand for a guaranteed income for farmers and respect for the space and special character of the Mediterranean environment, the strong demand to prevent aid per tree by supporting aid based on production, and the valuing of the quality and genuineness of the product to protect the consumer."
"It is clear that Parliament' s position is not yet in tune with the Commission' s, and I hope that at least some fundamental amendments in the Peres report will be approved to clarify the important function of the producer organisations as a useful presence on the market, to value interprofessionalism, to protect the consumer from any abuses by preventing the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, to establish the place of production of the olives as the place of origin, and lastly something which particularly concerns the south of Italy and the Puglia region: to add some cultivars to the genetic mark, preventing them from being regarded as defects of organoleptic characteristics whereas instead they are expressions of techniques and special characters that can be found in the production specifications of protected denomination of origin olive oils"
"Mr President, in just two years' time we will be facing a series of important dates for the common agricultural policy: from the verification of Agenda 2000 to the review of the common organisations of the market for seed plants, sugar, milk, and at this point also olive oil."
"By chance, by a strange stroke of luck, we have the competent Commissioner here today."
"The financial resources and the aid that the producers expect will become a sort of financial bottleneck which must in no way affect the solidity of any of the above-mentioned dossiers."
"Oil in particular should be safeguarded as a sector because it represents European agricultural values throughout the world."
"We must work so that quality and safety and also the multiple uses of the product can be the key to the future of Community olive oil production."
"To achieve this aim it is necessary, however, that in the period before these important dates arrive there should be a review, reappraisal and enhancement of the role of producer associations especially; in fact, the centralisation of the operators is essential for achieving consumer protection based on labelling and traceability."
"From this viewpoint, the introduction of a clear classification of oils can only result in greater access to the competitive advantages of guaranteed production."
"In addition, alongside the financial aspects of a sector like that of oil, the Community law on designation of origin must necessarily be revisited."
"The European principle must in fact become that of identifying the origin of the oil with the place where the olives are produced and no longer with the place where they are crushed, as has debatably been the case until now."
"In this context the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils, in the absence of labelling that will identify each component in the blend, damages the image of the producer, the consumer and the Codex Alimentarius."
"It would in fact be deplorable if we were to find ourselves facing not just the existing uncontrolled piracy of digital music but also unfair competition in foodstuffs, playing on false denominations and bogus labels."
"Adulteration must be repressed, especially in the area of foodstuffs, because what is at stake are the interests of consumer safety and the producers' right to entrepreneurial freedom."
"The whole olive oil sector, supported by the political institution at whatever level, should assume the responsibility of carrying out the activities of management and market control through concentration and the marketing of the product, to the benefit of quality, certification, research, promotion and traceability."
"I thank Mr Peres for the truly excellent results of his work."
"This evening I take the opportunity - and I shall repeat this in the House tomorrow - to say that we have a problem with the Italian translation: the translation of 'brut' , referring to oil, as 'greggio' (crude) is not acceptable in my country and so tomorrow I shall ask for the Italian version to use the term 'naturale' (natural) or 'vergine' (virgin)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my congratulations to Mr Casaca on his excellent report, which amply demonstrates that we have still not managed to bring olive oil regulations into line with the demands of modern agriculture and the fact that this agricultural policy is in need of radical reform."
"I should like to cite two examples here."
"First: one of the main objectives of production aid is to give olive farmers a fair income and guarantee market balance."
"As the Court of Auditors quite rightly states, the objective of production aid in relation to producers' income has never been defined."
"In other words, no one knows if this objective has ever been achieved, because we have never been able to assess it."
"The same applies to market balance."
"In 1998, the Commission established that there are 180 million olive trees."
"That came as something of a surprise, because Olistat had reckoned with a lot fewer trees, some 140 million."
"That is a difference of 40 million trees, a discrepancy of about 31%."
"Just consider, you think you have market balance and then you find out that you have 30% too much stock."
"The increase in stock over the last two years does, in fact, indicate that there is a surplus."
"Secondly, there were similar weaknesses in the consumption aid abolished at the end of 1998."
"There was no obligation to keep records or ledgers of accounts payable."
"As a result, there was a huge amount of fraud and irregularity."
"EUR 429 million in undue amounts have still not been recovered for the 1985-1998 period."
"Only 6% has been recovered so far."
"Just think how financial control and recovery were reorganised in connection with the reform of the Commission."
"We really do have our work cut out here."
"As far as export refunds are concerned, just 13% of the money has been recovered."
"Anyone who takes the protection of European taxpayers seriously just wants to get on and reform this agricultural policy."
"Mr Casaca's report shows us how."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission for their excellent work."
"The area which we are discussing is not important just for the regions; it is also a very important area for the European budget."
"After all, this year's budget includes EUR 2.4 billion for the olive oil sector."
"In this respect, it is also an extremely important area when it comes to audits by the European Court of Auditors."
"Mr Casaca has dealt with the special report by the Court of Auditors."
"Mr Jové Peres has led the debate on the Commission proposal."
"Strictly speaking, these two areas are totally separate because the special report by the Court of Auditors addresses the measures and aid applied over a three-year transitional period before the Council decision in 1998, whereas the Commission proposal relates to measures to be taken from November 2001 onwards."
"First to Mr Casaca's report."
"The Commission can accept most of the points in Mr Casaca's motion for a resolution on the Court of Auditors' report."
"However, I should like to take a more detailed position on two points."
"The Commission stated in the middle of last year, during its examination of the Court of Auditor's report, that improving the control system would, of course, be an important issue in the forthcoming reform of the common organisation of the market."
"Having examined this question closely, it is clear that radical reforms are needed if any decisive improvement is to be made."
"However, come what may, we need a geographical information system."
"As the right conditions will not all be in place for this sort of reform in 2001, the Commission suggested at the end of last year that, the decisive importance of the geographical information system notwithstanding, the reform should be postponed for two years."
"Besides, the Court of Auditors' proposals suggested other ways of making improvements here."
"After highly constructive talks with the Member States, these improvements were set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 648/2000."
"This motion for a resolution expresses surprise at the fact that the Commission questions the reliability of the International Olive Oil Council's statistics."
"These doubts should come as no surprise."
"They were expressed at every Council meeting between 1995 and 1998."
"The Commission checked the data in question and clarified the details with the Member States on several occasions."
"The International Olive Oil Council's statistics for 1999 had to be revised for the purpose of standardising the data."
"This resulted in a 30% reduction in the stock calculated."
"It was also found that it was best to assume that national statistics had a margin of error of 10-12%."
"I have the following to say about Mr Jové Peres's report: the report on the Commission proposal on the future common organisation of the market in olive oil is divided into two parts, dealing with two different subjects."
"The proposed amendments relate to four main issues: market measures and final reform, controls of the current regulation, classification and labelling of olive oil and the activities of the organisations of market operators."
"I should like to comment on all four."
"As far as general market aspects are concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendment No 2 on the need to assess the results of the transitional period."
"The Commission acknowledges Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 9 but cannot formally accept them because they anticipate the decision on final reform, which the Commission wants to leave open at the moment."
"I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 6 and 26 on automatic private storage arrangements even where the market situation has no need of them."
"Nor can the Commission endorse Amendments Nos 1 and 46 on aid for actual olive-residue oil production because this would complicate controls still further."
"Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 27 extending production refunds to products not in international competition with cheap olive oil."
"As regards Amendment No 37, concerning the basic ban on the planting of additional olive groves, the Commission takes the view that conversions and the legal consequences with respect to land use would give rise to huge problems."
"Numerous provisions on control measures have already been issued during the course of the year."
"The outstanding problems are connected with marketing structures."
"No decisive progress can be made until we introduce the geographical information system which the Commission has suggested as the basis on which aid should be granted from 2003 onwards."
"Most of the substance of the amendments proposed here has already been taken into account in the Commission's regulations."
"Amendments Nos 7, 11 and 14 call for greater involvement of the Commission and additional research."
"But the Commission is already working closely with the Member States on controls without, however, disregarding the fact that they have the final say."
"Research programmes have already been funded under the general procedure in the areas which you mention."
"Amendments Nos 8, 10, 22, 23, 24 and 36 relate to improved monitoring of mills, the main concern being to use electronic data transmission."
"The relevant Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 already provides a legal basis for priority monitoring of mills."
"As a result, at least 30% of mills must be controlled in situ."
"In addition, the mills must send in data on their stock accounts at the end of every month."
"These data have already been compared with the information available on olive oil production and marketing."
"The proposal for a computerised system for monitoring on a day-to-day basis is being examined."
"If it proves to be sensible and practicable, the Commission could issue the corresponding regulation."
"However, we must bear in mind that, unfortunately, the IT tools for the Member States for which provision has been made are still not fully ready for use."
"As far as classification and labelling are concerned, as addressed in Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 45, together with Amendments Nos 19 and 35, we have taken note of your proposals, especially the call for the place where the olives were grown to be taken as the place of origin."
"However, as these questions come under the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission cannot agree to their being included in the basic Council regulation."
"Amendments Nos 33 and 34 call for the specific reference to olive oil as an ingredient to be banned on food labels."
"These proposals are questionable from a commercial point of view and the Commission therefore takes the view that food labelling should comply with Directive 2000/13 (EC)."
"Obviously, the Commission is aware of the fact that the olive oil sector is calling for a ban on the marketing of mixtures of olive oils and other fats."
"However, the Commission cannot ban healthy, properly labelled products for which there is a demand simply to protect sales of another product."
"We therefore reject Amendments Nos 17, 20 and 32."
"However, the Commission will make sure that suitable labelling requirements are drafted. It goes without saying that olive oil sold under one of the four compulsory names is still pure olive oil and has all the qualities which make it such."
"Amendment No 47 suggests that the term ""natural"" should be used instead of the term ""crude"" and Amendment No 48 adds the term ""ordinary olive oil"" to the term ""standard olive oil"" ."
"The Commission is unable to accept this at the moment because it prefers to find terms which correspond more closely to the perceptions of the sector as a whole."
"The Commission will, however, include your suggestions in subsequent Council discussions."
"Under Amendment No 21, the new classification would enter into force on 1 November 2002, i.e. a year before the date proposed by the Commission."
"As it will be impossible to complete the necessary implementing measures, market adjustments and international negotiations by then, the Commission cannot agree to this proposal."
"Finally, as far as organisations of market operators are concerned, the Commission agrees to Amendment No 12 with its more general wording of the objectives, Amendment No 25 proposing that table olives be included in current provisions for quality improvement programmes and Amendment No 30 subject to legal examination and with the words ""for recognised interbranch organisations"" ."
"The very specific Amendment No 13 could be helpful for measures promoted in environmental programmes, but not for the basic regulation of the sector."
"As regards measures for which organisations of market operators can claim a grant, the Commission is prepared to examine the inclusion of table olives and the assurance of origin."
"However, the details of possible measures must be decided by the Commission."
"The various methods for promoting sales must stay within the harmonised framework which applies to all agricultural products, which is why I have to reject Amendments Nos 39, 40 and 43."
"If an organisation of market operators is to be licensed, it must meet certain criteria which the Commission has yet to decide."
"The restructuring of the olive oil sector was less comprehensive than in other sectors and new discussions and conditions therefore appear to be needed."
"The Commission has taken note of your request that organisations of producers and branch organisations be given priority."
"However, there seems to be little point at present in restricting measures which could help to improve the quality and hence sales of olive oil."
"Numerous proposed amendments call for new regulations on organisations of market operators to enter into force as quickly as possible."
"This is certainly a good idea."
"However, we need a good two years to work out detailed regulations for the sector, for the organisations of market operators and their programmes, for checking programmes and for the Member States to check and licence organisations and design the monitoring tools needed."
"If we rush things, we will jeopardise the success of the quality strategy, which is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 28, 29, 31, 38, 41, 42 and 44."
"However, I can confirm that the Commission does appreciate almost half the proposed amendments, even if it can only directly accept a few of them."
"The remainder are mostly provisions for which the Commission itself is responsible and which will be drafted and amended over coming months, taking account of your recommendations."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner for this very full answer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Draft SAB 2/2001"
"The next item is the report (A5-0138/2001) by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 2/2001 of the European Union for the 2001 financial year [60/2001 - C5-0153/2001 - 2001/2026(BUD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has again presented a supplementary budget in order to set the Common Foreign, and Security Policy and defence policy in Europe on a broader basis."
"We examined the original draft supplementary budget sent to us by the Council very closely and came to the conclusion that it was not acceptable as it stood and I should like to say why in no uncertain terms: what we need in this important political field is to safeguard the necessary transparency and the necessary controls."
"The common foreign and security policy of the European Union is one of the core elements in the further development of this European Union."
"We cannot withdraw control functions from the national parliaments in this important area without giving them to the European Parliament and we felt that this democratic gap needed to be closed."
"I should like to say quite clearly that interinstitutional agreements are all well and good, but they are not the right tool for effective control."
"Nor are the Western European Union and its parliamentary assembly the right tool for effective control."
"That is why it was clear to us that transparency can only be reasonably guaranteed and this important political field can only be controlled within the framework of the budgetary procedure."
"That is why I am most grateful to my fellow members for staying the difficult course which we have taken together and seeing the tough negotiations with the Council through to the end and for supporting the line which I, as rapporteur, have taken from the outset."
"I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for making it possible to broker a solution now which guarantees the Council's ability to act in the area for which it is responsible under the Treaty and which also guarantees Parliament's right of control."
"That was the brief which we stood up for and which we negotiated."
"We resisted the temptation - and I am most grateful to my fellow members for this - to make a distinction between administrative expenses and operational expenses."
"That would have been too confusing."
"You cannot distinguish, post by post, when someone is administering and when they are operationally active."
"But now that we have succeeded in ensuring that a separate title in the Council budget includes activities in the area of the common foreign and security policy, this distinction - and hence controls - are guaranteed in an optimum manner."
"The supplementary budget, in terms of numbers, totals EUR 9.846 million."
"It makes provision for 51 new posts in this area and for the further technical resources needed in order to refurbish the buildings."
"I should like to say quite clearly at this point that we shall of course check the Council budget in general and this new title in particular very closely during the course of the 2002 budgetary procedure."
"We cannot allow the Council to build up powers which the European Union already has, for which provision has been made under the Commission budget, especially in the area of crisis prevention and civil crisis management, as a parallel structure."
"And, as long as that is not the case, I see no need to recommend that the House reject the Council's supplementary and amending budget."
"We shall also ensure in future, as regards heading 5, that the European Union's ability to act is still guaranteed when it comes to administrative expenses."
"I should like to urge the Council not just to deal with this important area in supplementary budgets, but to include it once and for all in its normal budget, so that we have a reasonable set of figures at our disposal when discussing other areas under heading 5."
"My thanks to the honourable members from nearly all the groups for supporting me."
"However, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that the Greens have moved to reject the supplementary budget."
"The chairman of the Committee on Budgets will cast our vote on this motion tomorrow."
"Until such time as we can prove - and we need ammunition here - that there are twin structures, it makes no sense to reject en masse something which represents a huge success for the European Parliament and, by extension, for the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, we object on principle to the accelerating growth of European Union military structures outside the NATO Alliance, with all their attendant costs and politically divisive intent."
"We believe that the duplication of decision-making bodies and the development of a military staff separate from NATO will inevitably exacerbate policy differences between allies, to the detriment of the transatlantic relationship and the long-term security of our people."
"The European Union should be focusing its efforts on economic, administrative and humanitarian contributions to crisis management, to complement the military capabilities which should properly be a NATO responsibility."
"The European Union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes."
"Now it wants more money to spend on yet another ambitious and seriously misguided project."
"Parliament is being asked to approve a draft supplementary and amending budget of nearly EUR 10 million to fund staff and equipment for the separate European Union military bodies."
"In addition to some 90 staff redeployed from other tasks or seconded from Member States, 51 extra personnel are now to be recruited to expand the European Union military structures."
"Can we have an assurance that this total of 141 personnel will not be exceeded?"
"How long will it be before there is a further increase in staff for the European Union military structures?"
"Mr Blair tells people at home that European Union's defence policy is all about strengthening NATO."
"Mr Hoon has even said that there is no concept of a European rapid reaction force as such."
"From what I hear, everyone speaking on this side of the Channel has an entirely different perspective."
"The aim is to establish an autonomous European Union military capability to underpin a distinctive EU foreign policy in which the Americans are not involved - in due course, a European army."
"That is a reality."
"That is what it is all about."
"It is very dangerous."
"Tonight we are discussing an unnecessary EUR 10 million."
"I wonder how long it will be before we are discussing a defence budget of EUR 10 billion or more."
"The development of an autonomous EU military capability, separate from NATO, has come about as a direct result of initiatives by the British Labour Government in 1998."
"Now their project has run out of control."
"We know who is to blame and we cannot support this budget."
"Mr President, I am truly amazed - I freely admit - by the last speaker as the official spokesman of the PPE group."
"I really expected nothing of the sort."
"I would have expected him to be closer to us, now that we know that the Greens have tabled a proposed amendment rejecting this supplementary and amending budget."
"But nothing should come as a surprise in the European Parliament, especially not in this area."
"The common foreign and security policy is one of the policies of the European Union which, to all intents and purposes, has yet to be developed."
"In the past, it is true, we had a situation in which several Commissioners had to agree between themselves as to who was to look after and deal with which part of the world."
"At times we remember this and smile."
"But, when you look at politics from the point of view of content, it is irresponsible of the European Union not to speak with one voice and to behave like a dwarf in the world when it is in fact an economic global player and - to put it nastily - could in theory push the Secretary-General and representative of the common foreign and security policy around like an operetta general."
"That is why we are convinced that anyone who wants to take the common foreign and security policy seriously and really implement it, anyone who wants to prevent the lack of European policy in the foreign policy area that we have seen over recent years, must support the common foreign and security policy."
"This morning, Mr Brok said in the debate on the transatlantic dialogue that we, as the European Union, had no profile in Ukraine and that blunders had been made, which is why we must take the Council's desire to make real progress here seriously and support it."
"So support in principle is there."
"When the supplementary and amending budget was presented to us - and here I concur fully with Mr Ferber - not only did it fail to convince us; on the contrary we got all worked up and opposed to it."
"It is wrong to try and hide such an important area which is so crucial to the future of the European Union beneath a gentlemen's agreement between Parliament and the Council in a budget over which only the Council has any influence."
"All that does is to demonstrate that you do not want any parliamentary control or any parliamentary support."
"Which is unacceptable."
"We said as much from the outset and we shall continue to take this view and to formulate our policy and vote accordingly."
"But if you enter into negotiations and can clear up this point, i.e. if you can demonstrate that the supplementary and amending budget has been changed so that we can assume in future that we have are involved and have a say, when there is a separate chapter under which the Council shapes future policy in the common foreign and security policy area with parliamentary support and control, then you have to agree to it if you really want to make progress."
"That is not the time to stand on the sidelines and say, we are waiting to see what happens next."
"In all events, one thing is clear: when in reply to questions from the relevant Commissioner one is told in the Committee on Foreign Affairs or in the Committee on Budgets, with the wink of an eye, according to my sources, that there is no overlap, then it is hardly surprising that people ask questions and want to know exactly how things stand."
"What we shall not support - and I say this now as a member of the budgetary authority, we are talking here first and foremost as the budgetary authority - are overlapping structures."
"We cannot stand and watch two different people doing the same work under the same structures for the same tasks in the European Union."
"That cannot be."
"In this respect, we have to know what the common foreign and security policy should look like in the future and who is to be responsible for it."
"We need concepts here and the Council and Commission need to know where they stand here."
"We shall, of course, bring our standpoint very clearly to bear in the overall debate."
"We shall wield our power as budgetary authority on every future demand in order to stop this sort of blunder."
"Now is not the time to be petty."
"Europe's share of the common foreign and security policy is still very small."
"We should not start by being petty."
"But we shall monitor how everything develops very closely, we shall address painful subjects and say stop as soon as we get the feeling that we are being taken for a ride."
"That cannot be."
"We shall agree here, but everyone should know that we shall be extremely vigilant in connection both with heading 5 and with how expenditure develops and with future developments in the common foreign and security policy."
"Of course, we shall also give our input so that a forward-looking policy for the world and for Europe as a whole can be developed."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report."
"I know that it was the result of hard negotiations in which the rapporteur and the other representatives of the Committee on Budgets successfully defended the rights of the European Parliament."
"With the supplementary and amending budget the Council intends to set up three new directorates within its General Secretariat to implement the common European security and defence policy."
"These directorates are: 1. a Political Affairs Directorate, 2. an Operations and Exercises Directorate, and 3. an External Action Mechanisms Directorate."
"There would be a total of 140 employees involved in this new organisation, of which 51 would be in newly created posts."
"One' s attention is drawn the urgency of the situation."
"Why is there such a hurry to create the new posts immediately, even though the actual budget is to be discussed in a few months' time?"
"Another problem is the overlapping of functions."
"The structure of the organisation menacingly indicates that the same functions are to be discharged in the areas of both crisis prevention and civil crisis management in the Commission and the Council."
"This overlapping must definitely be prevented."
"Under pressure from Parliament, the Council is now creating a special Title in its budget for the common security and defence policy."
"It is obvious that this will involve the creation of an entirely new Council activity, which will, in fact, have nothing to do with normal administrative expenditure."
"For this reason the 'gentlemen' s agreement' between Parliament and the Council, according to which they undertake not to interfere in each other' s budgets, cannot be extended to these actions."
"Expenditure relating to the common security and defence policy falls within the competence of Parliament."
"Finally, it should be noted that the margin for 'Administrative Expenditure' in heading 5 is now only EUR 34 million."
"On the threshold of enlargement this is so little that it does not make possible any operative additional expenditure at the cost of administrative expenditure."
"Mr President, I too must say that this is a most interesting debate."
"We already had a taste of it in committee when Mr Laschet suddenly stepped forward ardently advocating rejection, despite belonging to the same group as the rapporteur."
"If we are in favour of rejection today, it is not because we do not appreciate Mr Ferber's work."
"On the contrary, we truly believe that Mr Ferber was a tough negotiator."
"We have the greatest respect."
"Nonetheless, we take the view that one voice here in Parliament must give a clear warning because a development is being introduced here which should give us all cause for concern."
"Like the previous speaker, I consider that this agreement cannot come under the gentlemen's agreement because it does not concern administrative expenditure."
"These are politically charged questions, as Mr Ferber has already made clear in his speech."
"They are also questions of transparency and control of the common foreign and security policy and of defence policy."
"Here too we are of one opinion."
"But Mr Ferber believes that introducing a separate title is sufficient guarantee that Parliament will be able to exercise control in the future."
"We have our doubts."
"We take the view that this separate title alone does not empower Parliament; on the contrary, because these posts are the Council's responsibility, they are beyond our influence and control."
"I think this is the deciding factor; not just the overlap, but the question of who can exercise control."
"What is at stake here is the delicate balance of power between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The Council is taking on more and more, trying to resolve more and more intergovernmentally rather than by really communitising these areas."
"That would mean making the Commission responsible and strengthening Parliament's right of control."
"That is our one great fear, namely that we have no real control."
"There is also another point which must also be addressed."
"In our view this question should be resolved in a conciliation procedure, not under a trialogue, because that would demonstrate exactly how much importance we attach to this question and just how much store we set by Parliament's having full right of control."
"I think that the Council should be quite clear that Parliament will not brook this policy of using supplementary budgets to alter political relations and the political balance of power."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just two brief comments."
"First, may I assure you on behalf of the Commission that we shall make very sure that no overlapping structures are created - and I say that not just as the member of the Commission responsible for the budget."
"Secondly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets on using their initiative and exerting pressure to bring about a change in how the budget is represented, a change which affects not just how it is represented per se but which represents an important contribution towards both enhanced democratic control and transparency."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Commission presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 2002"
"The next item is the Commission presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 2002."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we acknowledge the Commission's preliminary draft budget and, as always, shall check very closely to ensure that sufficient account has been taken of the priorities set in advance by the European Parliament."
"By that I mean both new and traditional priorities."
"No doubt the rapporteur, Costa Neves, will have something to say about this now."
"We shall have to check that the Union's revenue is going to be used efficiently and for its intended purpose within the framework of our budgetary law, the financial regulation and the commitments entered into."
"And we shall have to look very closely to ensure that due account has been taken of the reforms announced, only some of which have just begun."
"Obviously, we too want a speedy and fair budgetary procedure without too much arm wrestling."
"The Council needs to heed that more than in previous years."
"I should also like to add the following in the wake of the discussions and votes in the Committee on Budgets this year: we shall oppose any suggestion which tries to trim or limit the budgetary powers of the European Parliament in any way, such as by amending the financial regulation or in some other wondrous manner."
"I also advise the Commission to take a constructive position which favours Parliament here on all these questions."
"That will be a help to all of us who so keenly refer to ourselves as allies in the European integration process."
"The truth is we have commitments of EUR 100 billion, payments of 97.8 billion, payments well below the ceiling or 1.06% of GNP or, to put it another way, EUR 265 per capita of the population, of which EUR 121 per capita is for agricultural for agricultural produce, policy and the countryside. That sounds solid enough."
"Taken overall, it is geared towards stability and certainly does not overburden the Member States, the taxpayers or consumers, as many official but emotional and one-sided accounts would have us believe."
"At the same time, however, it is the penultimate budget of the Union of the Fifteen."
"We need to bear that in mind at this point."
"I just want to list a few points which will be important to us."
"It is good that the Commission intends to do more about clearing the backlog of payments."
"Commissioner Schreyer has just quoted a few figures here."
"But we also need a guarantee that payments for new commitments will be dealt with speedily so as to avoid another mountain of backlogs in the future."
"We also welcome thoughts of setting up an earmarked reserve in the agricultural area."
"The idea of creating a contingency reserve, given the imponderable nature of these markets, was originally Parliament's."
"I would add that the ad hoc procedure has proven to be an increasingly constructive procedure between the institutions over recent years."
"The actual figures will be available in the autumn."
"It is good that the Commission has left room for manoeuvre in internal policy."
"Nonetheless, the reasons behind certain estimates require clarification. For example, -5.3% for culture and the audiovisual sector, below average rates of +1.8% in the area of social dimension and employment and -14.5% in the area of the labour market and technological innovation."
"These are examples of where there is a real need for consultation."
"In foreign policy - which was addressed earlier - the question arises of how democratic control and discussion of operational expenditure under the common foreign and security policy will take place in future."
"Then there is the fact that Asia is down 2.2%, Latin America is down 6% and food aid is down 4.5%."
"The question is, has the necessary balance between traditional priorities and new tasks been duly safeguarded or might this positioning be construed as concentrating on Europe and its neighbours."
"That would be too little for me from a foreign policy point of view."
"Commissioner, I should like to address one final point: administration."
"I should like to remind you that Parliament stipulated that the second tranche of 317 posts was linked to the early retirement commitment, so as to bring about a bit more budgetary neutrality, and it is up to the institutions to achieve this."
"I remember the resolution passed in spring last year, in which we clearly stated that the second tranche was linked to very clear, precise considerations as to how measures to guarantee the ability of the European Union to act during the course of the enlargement process could be prepared while retaining the substance of the acquis communautaire."
"I should like to remind you of this resolution."
"Clearly, therefore, we shall all be called on to discuss the introduction of and introduce a realistic pre-accession and accession strategy as of this year, including in the administrative area, so that we have sufficient time left over to include this aspect in the budgetary policy."
"I get the impression from all the discussions that resolving these questions will be more difficult and more complicated that resolving many agricultural and structural problems, which is why we intend to tackle these and other questions during the budgetary procedure."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by emphasising the need to respect the timetable unveiled by the Commission when it presented its preliminary draft budget. I must say that it did provide us with the information we needed."
"This is a further contribution to a positive climate for the debate on the proposed budget for 2002."
"My initial reaction to the preliminary draft budget is that, overall, I welcome the proposal to increase appropriations for commitment by 3.4% and for payment by 4.8%."
"The difference between these figures seems insufficient, given the need to make good payments that are overdue."
"I would point out that one of the European Parliament' s priorities is precisely to eliminate quickly the difference between commitments given and payments that have actually been guaranteed."
"To confirm our fears, the reduction of unpaid commitments (RAL), will be in appearance only."
"The truth is that, if the increase in appropriations is insufficient, paying the commitments that have been outstanding the longest will delay the payment of new commitments."
"This would be the equivalent of rehashing the RAL and would not solve the problem."
"The solution lies in paying off old RAL, specifically in categories 3 (internal policy) and 4 (external action), not in creating further RAL."
"With regard to this matter, we shall carefully analyse the progress report that is to be presented to us at the end of June, as was agreed, and we will continue to do everything we can to improve the budget' s implementation rates. In other words, we want to contribute to a more effective discharge of the European Union' s commitments."
"I have noted the fact that, despite the 4.8% increase proposed for payments, these will remain at a level of 1.06% of the European Union' s GDP, whereas the financial perspective would allow the figure to reach 1.10% in 2002."
"I must also stress that we shall be undertaking a thorough assessment of the Commission' s commitment to the priorities defined by Parliament which feature in the broad economic guidelines adopted in April."
"In the agricultural sector in particular - category 1 - I have paid close attention to the impact of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises on the budget."
"It would be useful to have the precise figures as soon as possible."
"Nevertheless, the existence of a reserve of EUR 1 billion proposed by the Commission seems acceptable, given the unpredictable nature of these crises."
"I would state my view once again, however, that we consider a reserve always to be non-compulsory expenditure, as we want to be able to intervene in decisions on its use."
"We hope to find out, in the Letter of Amendment which is to be presented following first reading, if not before, exactly what the costs arising from BSE and foot-and-mouth disease are."
"In this context, I would remind you that we are counting on a Commission document on the direction to take with regard to the mid-term review of the last common agricultural policy reform, in which I hope to see consistency between the decisions taken on the crisis, and guidelines for the future."
"The broad economic guidelines give 15 September as the date for this document to be presented."
"The Letter of Amendment is another possibility to consider for the presentation of this document."
"With regard to fisheries and given the much-discussed failure of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco and the consequent need to restructure our fleets, we must make a careful assessment of how this will be funded."
"In internal policies (category 3), the current margin is limited and the broad economic guidelines lay down clear priorities in this area, which must be respected."
"In external action (category 4), it is still difficult to guarantee the stability of the European Union' s action."
"Reprogrammings have been the rule and we are concerned about the possibility of once again facing reductions in appropriations in budget lines to which we attach great importance."
"I am referring here to Latin America, human rights and the fight against Aids, for example."
"In the meantime, in the Balkans, where the European Union has also made clear commitments, we are seeing, as I understand it, a reduction in budgetary resources."
"Everything indicates that account has not yet been taken of the report by the World Bank, which will give precise details of reconstruction needs."
"What will happen then?"
"And what about the operational costs of our defence and security policy?"
"In the field of administration (category 5), to what extent are the appropriations proposed sufficient, when added together, to cope with the reform of the Commission, enlargement, the launch of new policies, an increase in the Council' s budget of around 10%, and the proposals of other institutions?"
"It seems quite clear that the resources decided on in Berlin are insufficient."
"We shall see."
"In the field of pre-accession, (category 7), I would stress that Parliament came out in favour of reallocating unused appropriations, similarly to what is happening in category 2."
"Once again, I wish to state my hope that we can maintain a constructive approach to the debate that has now begun."
"Consensus with the Commission and the Council is both desirable and possible."
"We must therefore watch out for clouds on the horizon, and I am referring specifically to the fact that the Committee on Budgets today voted on its position on the financial regulation."
"I would stress that this position complies with the broad economic guidelines."
"These stated that Parliament will not hesitate to reconsider its position on such matters in its budgetary decisions."
"It is still possible to guarantee a real assessment of our position on the revision of the financial regulation."
"I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"Estimates of the European parliament for 2002"
"The next item is the report (A5-0166/2001) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee for Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2002 [2001/2062(BUD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, during the formal meeting with President Schuster of the Republic of Slovakia, we spoke yet again of the historical opportunity of overcoming once and for all the division of Europe."
"An opportunity that must be given concrete shape, as the honourable Member Böge said."
"In just three years' time we shall be able to work together on an equal footing with colleagues from current candidate countries, at any rate in theory."
"Consequently we must speed up institutional changes to ensure that enlargement goes smoothly."
"We shall shortly be receiving the three-year plan on administrative preparation."
"Perhaps then, we may come to the conclusion that it would be sensible to employ civil servants from candidate countries in advance so that they can play a part in preparing for enlargement."
"Think, for example, of people required to set up a language regime."
"It therefore strikes me as extreme foolish to reject that option now in the resolution of Parliament."
"Enlargement must be prepared for not only administratively, but also substantively."
"In order to exchange mutual experiences it is important that contacts between ourselves and colleagues from candidate countries are intensified."
"The Committee on Budgets asks that the most appropriate form for this be included in the three-year plan."
"I myself can imagine that it might, for instance, be useful if a very limited number of facilities were offered to these parliamentarians and future Member States so that their visits are as effective and useful as possible."
"Mr President, enlargement will increase pressure on the margin of the budget."
"It is therefore a financially sound policy to pay off real estate costs faster, creating scope for future budgets."
"In addition accelerated financing leads to considerable savings in interest."
"It is, though, a pity that I now have the doubtful honour of being the rapporteur who is investing a very considerable sum in the parliament building here in Strasbourg."
"But you will agree with me that for as long as the Parliament is condemned to being a travelling circus, it is not sensible to force another EUR 210 million down the throat of the European taxpayer."
"It is becoming less and less of one, so that it is all that money for just four days in Strasbourg."
"This brings me nicely to another point in which I hope content will win out over the fine words, and that is the environmental audit."
"Mr President, this House also devoted some fine words a few years ago to the desirability of an environmental audit."
"An interinstitutional working party was even set up."
"But since it was not given the slightest priority, it was short-lived."
"So we shall now again, and more resolutely, take responsibility and consequently, Parliament should make a clear political promise to participate in EMAS, the Community eco-management and audit system."
"Our political position against discrimination must be converted here in this House into policy."
"Equality of opportunity is still not a reality."
"And I am talking not only about women in influential positions but, for example, about equal treatment irrespective of sexual orientation, race or religion."
"The Committee on Budgets therefore asks the Secretary-General for clarification on what measures are necessary to be able to keep the promise of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, in recent years we have gained greater understanding of the advantages of Activity Based Budgeting and Activity Based Management."
"The old management structures method of budgeting need a radical overhaul and part of that is a clear division of responsibilities between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets in the area of personnel policy as at present specified in the budgetary procedure."
"The Committee on Budgets examines the financial envelope and its limitations and the Bureau concerns itself with specific content."
"This system must be complemented by guiding statements by the House to the Bureau and close monitoring of the management of the Secretary-General."
"Should problems arise in future with the Bureau or the Administration, they should lead to changes at that level and not to the assumption of management responsibilities by a House of 626 political representatives."
"The new modus operandi must go hand in hand with a radical change in culture, so that the Administration can be democratic, monitored and also very decisive."
"To those honourable Members who have been seriously concerned about the margin of category 5, I can say by way of reassurance that that this afternoon' s vote on the schedule of part-sessions for next year at any rate turned out very favourably financially."
"Estimates were based on a four-day week in Strasbourg and the decision now taken entails no change in costs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work on behalf of the members in the run up to the preparation of Parliament's budget."
"Nonetheless, I should like to take this opportunity to pick out one or two points and examine them more closely."
"Enlargement: of course we must prepare for enlargement."
"But anyone who thinks that preparing for enlargement merely means creating new posts has failed to recognise the problem."
"Everything has to be tested against what we have learned to appreciate and love about the modus operandi of the European Parliament over the last twenty years."
"We face a huge challenge if we want to master all that."
"Nor is it a question of creating new posts and manning them with officials from applicant countries."
"Why are there no other options in situ?"
"For example, the Commission intends to work with satellites in applicant countries in the translation area."
"We need to create information offices because we have a problem as regards the acceptance of accession to the European Union."
"That is our job as representatives of the people."
"It is not a question of taking a few people to the fleshpots of Europe here in Strasbourg or in Brussels or Luxembourg, it is a question of bringing people to the European Union."
"That is best done locally."
"That is why I ask you to consider carefully what really needs to be done and what is better done through activities in the candidate countries, in order to save money."
"The Commission is on the right track here."
"Buildings policy: I agree with the rapporteur that, as things stand, the cheapest solution here in Strasbourg is to pay off the outstanding amounts as quickly as possible."
"But that is only the second cheapest solution."
"We must be clear about that."
"The cheapest solution would be to build ourselves."
"Then we can decide on the layout and fittings, without having to admit in the end that someone has done well out of us and that now we must somehow take over."
"We went through that in Brussels and we have been through it here."
"We could show a bit more intelligence here."
"That would be the cheapest solution."
"What we are doing is the second cheapest and I should like to make that clear."
"Staff policy: I am surprised at the administration, which is calling for numerous new posts on the one hand, while at the same time making increasing concessions in the so-called non-occupancy quota."
"This means that more posts are saved than new posts requested."
"We still need an in-depth discussion of how this can be reconciled."
"In other words, there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre by transferring staff between the services of the European Parliament without always needing to create new posts straight away."
"I can tell you now that the PPE group will be looking at this issue very closely in the autumn, once we have the actual figures to work with."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur has also taken up our transport options."
"I hope that we shall not have to cycle around Brussels."
"I consider that far too dangerous."
"I think the initiative by the town of Strasbourg following the change in the mayor's office is real progress."
"We too can take the tram now."
"Perhaps we can take the metro in Brussels."
"That would take us one stage further."
"But, as I say, bicycles in general are too dangerous in my book."
"I hope that we can find a reasonable solution here."
"We in the PPE shall carry out a strict and close examination of the budget line by line in the autumn, once the figures are available."
"But let me make one thing clear: if the report is adopted tomorrow, this does not mean free passage for the reading which we shall have to hold in September or October."
"Madam President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work;"
"I support most of what she has said, especially on reform."
"You may be aware of the findings of a recent Euro poll, which showed that the European Parliament is one of the most recognised of all EU institutions."
"Therefore, the onus is really on us to ensure that we increase the confidence of European citizens in the EU as a whole."
"This is why we need to set an example and lead the way in improving effectiveness, transparency and accountability, as outlined by the rapporteur."
"However, the reform process embarked upon so far sometimes feels a bit slow."
"We need to speed things up in the coming year and try to embrace reform and modernise our working methods and decision-making processes."
"As everyone agrees, this is essential because of the challenges presented by enlargement."
"There is a clear danger that the EU could be deflected from its course if the public does not see concrete and swift reform being carried out on a significant scale."
"All of us know that enlargement will have far-reaching effects on all aspects of Parliament's services."
"The additional budgetary cost of enlargement could be in the region of EUR 145m per year, according to one report."
"We could need about 459 new offices in Brussels alone."
"This will need considerable planning, with all the implications well thought through."
"Therefore, Parliament's three-year plan is essential to make enlargement successful."
"It is critical that this plan should be considered and not rushed."
"I strongly oppose the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group imposing a deadline before the summer for this report, because if we do not have a considered and well thought-out enlargement plan, it could backfire on us."
"The PPE-DE Group has tabled other amendments, which are equally nonsensical and will not enhance the standing of the European Parliament if adopted."
"What I find particularly astonishing is that, on the one hand, we are constantly nit-picking about minor new establishment posts for the executive and yet, in practice, we are happy to increase posts for the political parties, when it suits particular needs, without any real justification."
"Where are the principles of budgetary rigour and efficiency which the PPE-DE Group often talks about?"
"It is important that we review these issues, but not at this stage."
"I wish to stress that the three-year plan should be considered because we face many challenges, but we should - and must - be more dynamic in all areas, in particular languages and buildings, because that is where the substantial costs lie."
"I hope the plan will in some ways think the unthinkable and radically review the language services, given that in two to three years' time we may have six new official languages to deal with."
"Just to give you some food for thought: the Commission is a very different institution from us, but it manages to work in two languages."
"Let me make it clear that I strongly believe in linguistic diversity, but we cannot just add on all these additional languages and still try to be an efficient and effective organisation."
"In relation to buildings policy, we must carefully examine all available options."
"I know there is a proposal to purchase this building, and although it makes financial sense here and now in terms of the savings we will make in the immediate future, I am concerned about the long-term suitability of the building: it hardly meets our requirements now, so what is it going to be like six years down the line?"
"Madam President, I will try and keep to the timetable."
"Mrs Buitenweg has drawn up an excellent report as a basis for Parliament' s budget next year."
"My sincerest thanks go to her accordingly."
"Among the main challenges for the European Parliament are improved administration and increased efficiency."
"The EU' s forthcoming enlargement will make these especially necessary."
"Next year, we must prepare for the fact that in 2004 Parliament will grow by more than a hundred members bringing with them a dozen or so new languages."
"This will make very special demands on the organisation and enhanced effectiveness of the translation and interpreting services."
"There will also be totally new demands on general administration, which is why it is absolutely necessary to extend Activity Based Budgeting and Activity-Based Management to parliamentary administration also."
"The other problem is buildings policy."
"There must be an aim to rationalise the work of Parliament so that buildings expenditure can be cut."
"Buying property is quite acceptable when money can be saved as a result."
"On the other hand, we must insist that the Member States that have seats here do all they can to ensure that a swift decision can be taken on settlements in respect of property."
"It does not do the host country credit if the European Parliament in its territory has inconceivable difficulties trying to establish a rational building policy."

"Address by Mr Schuster, President of the Slovak Republic"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I take particular pleasure in being able to welcome the presence here today, in this Chamber, of the President of the Slovak Republic, Mr Rudolf Schuster."
"Mr President, since the Slovak Republic was founded on 1 January 1993, and particularly since Slovakia presented its candidature for accession to the European Union in 1995, relations between your country and the European Parliament have developed steadily and fruitfully, paving the way for mutual understanding and the building of ties of trust."
"The change of government in 1998, and then your election as President of the Republic in the first presidential elections to be held in Slovakia using direct suffrage, in May 1999, are events that have had a very positive influence on enhancing relations between us and making them more effective."
"Since you were invested in Bratislava, having served your country in various roles, including as mayor of the town of Kosice from 1994 to 1998, the Slovak government, led by Mr Dzurinda, the Prime Minister, has turned its policies towards the prospect of accession to the European Union."
"Under your Presidency, Mr Schuster, democracy has been established and consolidated in Slovakia."
"The Helsinki European Council of December 1999 took the decision to open the negotiations for accession, which began in March 2000."
"The opening and progress of negotiations between your country and the European Union demonstrate, and I am particularly pleased to see this, that Slovakia has fully mastered the 'catching up' principle, because it was at the request of the European Parliament that this principle was established at the Helsinki European Council."
"Slovakia has now decided to place itself, as you have just said, Mr President, at the vanguard of the accession process."
"I want your country to know that it has the support of the European Parliament. It can count on a totally constructive attitude towards this accession being achieved as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I shall now ask you to address our Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, only a short while ago I paid my tribute to the memory of Louise Weiss, an exceptional person, initiator of the idea of European unification, journalist and politician who gave the opening address at the first session of the European Parliament in 1979 - ten years before the fall of the Iron Curtain."
"Louise Weiss was connected by ties of deep friendship with one of the most noted personalities of our history, a Slovak politician of European-wide standing - Milan Rastislav tefánik - politician, diplomat, scientist and astronomer who made France his second home."
"Louise Weiss said in her address to the European Parliament that it was the happiest day of her life."
"Today, I have the exceptional and great honour to speak to you at the plenary session of the European Parliament, representing the most important political parties of the Member States of the European Union and for this opportunity I wish to thank you."
"This is the first time that the Slovak language has been spoken at your plenary session."
"It is my deep conviction that, in a not too distant future, it will become one of the official languages of the European Union."
"Just as, geographically, my country is an indivisible part of the European continent, its history, culture and traditions are an inseparable part of European history."
"Shutting my country out behind the Iron Curtain was nothing more than an artificial move by the holders of power on the political chessboard of history."
"It is therefore natural that we should link the future of Slovakia with Europe."
"Europe that is unified and prosperous, peaceful and attractive."
"Our common Europe."
"You are performing your work for Europe in a truly momentous period."
"Your term coincides with the taking of historical decisions on enlargement which, and this is my deep conviction, represents the most important contribution to the stability and prosperity of our continent in its modern history."
"We owe you our respect and gratitude for promoting this process."
"The citizens of Slovakia will always bear this in mind."
"The accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union is among the key priorities of our foreign policy."
"However, I view accession also from the broader perspective of the development of our society and of Europe."
"Slovakia's progression towards the European Union means that the country is returning to the culture and civilisation where it belongs both by its history and its system of values."
"This is the general framework in which the Slovak Republic defined its foreign policy priorities right from the outset, when it set out to obtain full membership of the European Union and NATO."
"In 2000 Slovakia gained membership of the OECD and is one of the most hopeful candidates for NATO membership when the Alliance decides to enlarge."
"We are pleased to note that around 70% of our population of more than five million people support accession to the European Union."
"What is even more important is that this percentage includes the supporters of the strongest opposition parties, because these political parties too, currently in opposition, built their political programmes on the integration ambitions of the Slovak Republic."
"The right course of Slovakia's security policy whose ultimate goal is membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, through active participation in the European Security and Defence Policy was confirmed by the security strategy document adopted by our legislature."
"The fact that this document was adopted with the support of an absolute majority in Parliament, demonstrates that both the ruling coalition and the opposition pursue the same strategic principles when it comes to the future orientation of the Slovak Republic."
"However, as the President of a young democratic country, I cannot fall victim to the feeling of self-satisfaction with this rare political consensus."
"Ever since I assumed my presidential office I have been trying to impress not only on the political leaders, but also on all those who are not indifferent to the future of Slovakia, that the direction of the country must not depend on a momentary euphoria or on the fleeting political preferences of those in power."
"This is the reason why I and a group of experts are drafting a medium-term and a long-term vision, which should be adopted as a constitutional statute by the National Council of the Slovak Republic with the support of the broadest possible political spectrum."
"This document - may I call it a State doctrine - should define in very clear terms and at the highest legislative level the future orientation of Slovakia to the European and transatlantic structures."
"It would convincingly dispel the doubts with which I am often confronted during by trips abroad in my discussions with the friends and observers of Slovakia who ask: ""What changes can be again expected in the foreign policy orientation of Slovakia after the next elections?"""
"As I have said, we are pleased with the public support for the integration ambitions of Slovakia."
"However, we cannot ignore the worries or mistrust among citizens of the EU Member States who fear that the enlargement of the Union could have undesirable consequences."
"I can understand their concerns - they are natural and human."
"At the same time I have the impression that these worries are often conjured up artificially."
"It is not our wish to disturb what has been achieved in the integration process in past decades."
"We have to jointly focus on two areas."
"We - in the applicant countries - must thoroughly prepare for membership and, together with the EU members, we should alleviate the doubts concerning enlargement."
"And we must work together to strengthen European solidarity and the feeling of togetherness."
"Europe is not only a map."
"I am convinced that the basis for its permanent revival is an ongoing honest dialogue with the citizens of the unifying Europe."
"The entry of each new country will enrich the common house by its spiritual, cultural and historical heritage."
"We want to contribute to the enlargement of the common market but at the same time we want to be a contribution to the economy and thus contribute to greater stability and security for all of Europe."
"You are familiar with the fact that the Slovak Republic was not invited to open accession negotiations in 1997 in Luxembourg because of its failure to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria."
"This was not a good situation for Slovakia."
"The European Parliament was the first to respond to the new situation in the Slovak Republic through its Resolution of October 1998, which acknowledged the changes in the style of government of the country and its new orientation after the elections."
"I would like to take this opportunity to state how highly I regard the relations between the European Parliament and the Slovak Republic which, especially during the last two years, have gained a new momentum."
"The relations between the European Parliament and the National Council of the Slovak Republic have also intensified thanks to the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Committee which I personally highly appreciate."
"Parliamentary democracy is also greatly strengthened by the joint meetings between the President of the European Parliament and the presidents of the parliaments of applicant countries."
"The next such meeting is to be held in a few days in Bratislava."
"Slovakia was invited to open negotiations on accession to the European Union in 1999 in Helsinki."
"Today - after 17 months of negotiations - we note great progress."
"I am convinced that by the end of the Swedish Presidency we will provisionally close negotiations on more than half the chapters."
"At this rate our country has a chance to catch up with the countries that had started negotiations earlier, and to complete accession negotiations by the end of 2002."
"We make no secret of our hope that the citizens of the Slovak Republic will also cast their votes in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament."
"The path of integration is interspersed with exceptionally lively political discussions and, sometimes, disputes."
"We are happy that we have got rid of the one-sided monologue of political elites we knew in the past."
"This path is not a smooth one, but the prospect of future membership of the European Union multiplies the sorely needed pro-reform energy."
"I want to assure you that we have no shortage of this energy."
"The year 2000 was the year of the ""economy""."
"We continued implementing the reforms launched by the Slovak Government after its coming to power in 1998 with a view to restoring stability at the macro-economic level."
"Structural adjustment brought improvements in the effectiveness of the corporate sector."
"However, if I want to take a realistic view of the economy of my country, I must consider it from the point of view of the everyday life of people, their economic possibilities."
"And here I realise - as confirmed in my direct contacts with the citizens of my country - that economic reforms can have painful consequences for the socially weakest groups of the population."
"I am convinced that the current - and the most difficult - phase of the reform will soon bring its positive effects."
"In this respect, I feel that the Slovak Government may have lost some time when, during its first year in power, it was too absorbed with pointing to the mistakes of the previous government and pronouncements of the need to eliminate their consequences, rather than immediately and constructively tackling all the problems, especially in the economic field."
"It is too late to say now that if the style of government had been more flexible right from the start, today the citizens could enjoy the fruit of all those sound economic steps."
"This too is the reason why in every political or professional discussion on the subject of economic and legal reforms I stand up as an advocate of the reforms, even though I always view them in terms of their benefits for the majority of our citizens."
"This year, 2001, is the year of ""legislation""."
"In February the Slovak Parliament passed the long awaited amendment to the Constitution, compatible with the constitutions of EU Member States."
"The amendment has put in place the legal prerequisites for the integration of Slovakia."
"The amended text explicitly provides that the Slovak Republic may delegate the exercise of some of its powers to the European Union through or on the basis of an international treaty."
"The amendment also lays down the precedence of legally binding acts of the European Union over the laws of the Slovak Republic."
"Moreover, it sets out the procedure for the transposition of legally binding acts into the national legislation in the form of laws and government ordinances."
"Other necessary steps include the taking of measures for implementing public administration reform, completing structural reform, strengthening the banking sector and building a modern state administration."
"The national legal system of the Slovak Republic is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"Through its Constitution and the ratified international instruments on human rights, the state guarantees the enjoyment of rights and freedoms to all citizens without any distinction."
"However, unemployment and the adverse economic situation in some regions of Slovakia have created serious problems for dealing with the issue of the Roma national minority."
"In my opinion, finding effective solutions in this area is one of the most important tasks of society as a whole."
"The serious attention given to this problem by the government is expressed through the Government's Strategy for Addressing Roma National Minority Issues and the set of measures for its implementation."
"I take the view that this is not a problem of Slovakia alone, but a broader European problem whose solution is very complex and requires a partner-like approach."
"The visit to Roma settlements in Slovakia by Commissioner Günther Verheugen exemplifies the commitment to a common approach to dealing with the Roma issue, which is one of the key areas that will require our attention in the future."
"During my years as the mayor of the city of Kosice, situated in the region with higher concentrations of the Roma population, I learned the basic precept - effective assistance requires active involvement of the Roma themselves in the solution of their problems, otherwise the efforts will be wasted."
"The Project on Eliminating the Disproportions of the Roma National Minority, launched on my initiative, envisages the participation of the representatives of individual Roma groups in its implementation."
"The first experience gained indicates that the level of legal awareness and democratic thinking - even among educated Roma - has been marked by decades of a paternalistic approach by the state to the Roma community whose members find it difficult to exercise their powers."
"This is why I believe that this issue will still have to be addressed by the generations that come after us."
"I have also brought my initiative to the attention of the Presidents of other Visegrad Group countries; we agreed to adopt a common procedure with the President of the Czech Republic."
"I fully agree with the individual approach and the assessment of the countries on their merits."
"This is the reason why we internally are striving to make the Slovak Republic take its place among the first countries to enter the European Union."
"We make no secret of our ambition to do it together with our neighbours - the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, our partners in the Visegrad cooperation process."
"This cooperation, which strengthens our good neighbourly relations, is being positively received both at home and abroad."
"Not only does it enhance the atmosphere of regional European allegiance, but is also an important element of integration."
"In this connection, on my initiative and in cooperation with the President of the Republic of Poland, several cross-border cooperation projects were launched under the patronage of the Chancellery of the President."
"Because of their positive results I plan to extend similar projects also to other border regions - those with Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"I attach great historic significance to the creation and functioning of the Visegrad grouping whose aim is to encourage close cohesion of an mutually beneficial cooperation within the central European region as the basis for its future integration into economic, political and security structures."
"These common objectives of the V-4 countries contribute to the development of Europe as a whole and to expanding the zone of stability to the entire continent."
"The idea of the accession of Visegrad countries to the European Union as one group has logical implications for the definition of the Schengen-type border whose length will depend on the map of the enlarged European Union."
"When speaking about the future of the European Union, the discussion on which was launched in the wake of the Nice summit, I would personally prefer to speak about the near future and the distant future."
"It would not be easy to mix everything together and to try to resolve all the issues facing the European Union by 2004."
"I support the opinion that the candidate countries should be given a chance to effectively contribute to the exchange of views in the preparation for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is personally hardly conceivable for me to see the prospective members of a family left standing at a closed door during the discussions on important matters that concern everybody, older members, newer members and prospective newcomers, especially if the latter are expected to enter the family within the time horizon in question."
"We all, both members and candidates for membership, want a stronger Europe."
"We may agree with many, although not all the opinions."
"Thus, it would not be appropriate to delay the process of enlargement on the ground of what I consider to be unjustified worries about the enlargement bringing the threat of ""dilution"" of the European Union, or endangering the possibility of the continued political integration."
"I am convinced that the Slovak Republic and other candidate countries are no less prepared for further integration than some current members."
"Our objective must be to further build the European Union as a political community."
"I agree with the words of the President of the European Parliament Madame Nicole Fontaine according to whom we cannot continue building the European Union in ""closed circles""."
"At a certain stage of development, several issues may emerge and require solution, while it is not always possible to resolve all of them."
"But the process must continue and the system must remain open."
"An important part of the entire European integration process is the building of the European identity."
"National identity plays an important role in the life of individuals, because it is the means for their self-identification and affiliation with a certain group."
"As the President and a citizen of the Slovak Republic, I have no worries about the loss of sovereignty after our accession to the European Union, because in an integrating Europe, a sovereign country is one that takes part in the decisions that concern the development and direction of the European Union."
"The entry of the Slovak Republic to the European Union will be the real completion of sovereignty of our country."
"The future of Slovakia lies with the European Union which will become the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I am speaking to you as a European to Europeans, facing a unique challenge and immense responsibility."
"Let us turn the ideal of common spiritual values and historic experience into the reality of a unified and prosperous Europe, attractive to all citizens of its countries and serving as an example for other regions and continents."
"The Slovak Republic declares its willingness to share in this common responsibility."
"Thank you for this opportunity of addressing you"
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, yesterday, as we all know, there was a minor incident here during the debate on the situation of Turkish prisoners."
"In this connection it was stated, by the Vice-President in the Chair amongst others, that the Committee on Budgets was blocking the posts which were necessary to strengthen the security service."
"As the rapporteur responsible, I should like to state here that the posts requested were entered in the reserve with the agreement of the Bureau and that the Bureau has not yet made any request for these proposed posts to be taken out of the reserve."
"I firmly refute, therefore, the accusation that the Budgets Committee is blocking the posts necessary to improve security in Parliament."
"In so doing I would point out that the Bureau is required to request the relevant transfer of appropriations."
"Mr Ferber, your point has very little, if anything, to do with the Minutes."
"That said, you raise the issue of yesterday' s incident."
"I can assure you that we take such incidents quite as seriously as they deserve."
"The Quaestors have already met and looked into the matter."
"I would also point out that the group involved was brought in by a Member, and neither he nor his assistant seemed to be around any more, so it was a kind of orphan group, no longer accompanied."
"That is one thing."
"As regards the Bureau, Mr Ferber, thank you for raising that, we are currently working to adopt some very strict security measures, which I believe many Members want in the interest of our institution, because what happened yesterday is one thing, but other things could happen."
"Everyone is well aware of that."
"Of course, the Bureau is seeking the cooperation of the Committee on Budgets."
"We hope we will be successful as soon as possible."
"Madam President, yesterday's incident has nothing to do with the fact that certain posts have not yet been approved."
"The two are wholly unconnected."
"Firstly, a mistake was made at the checkpoint here on the way into the Chamber."
"The people are there."
"We do not need any new posts."
"Secondly, people are saying that the security guards posted at the entrances were responsible."
"That does not have anything to do with the posts either."
"What is important is that we improve security."
"Mr Ferber is right there."
"However, there is no direct link to yesterday's incident."
"(Applause)"
"Absolutely, Mr Schmid, that is what I said myself: yesterday' s incident is one thing, the general security problem is another."
"Madam President, I also wish to address item 23 in yesterday's Minutes concerning security."
"We are all very grateful for the explanation that you have given about how the matter occurred yesterday, and it is very important that the House recognises the point that you also made, namely that this is a subject that the Bureau is also currently discussing."
"It is an extremely serious and vitally important point, because security in this House is not good enough."
"What happened yesterday, however, is slightly different, because it calls into question the status and the responsibility of individual Members as to whom they invite into this House."
"We have had a very lively discussion in our own political group this morning on this matter, and I am going to ask you, Madam President, to convene a special meeting of the Bureau so that all these matters can be discussed."
"I recognise that it is already on the agenda of the Bureau and is an on-going discussion, but it is so important that we have time to consider the issue properly that I believe we need a special meeting of the Bureau and I hereby request you to convene that meeting."
"Thank you Mr Provan."
"We will see if that is possible tomorrow morning."
"I am joking."
"That being so, on 30 May, we will look at the whole situation in all its aspects."
"I do not think Mr Provan has understood my invitation."
"Thank you very much indeed for that statement, Mr Wurtz."
"Madam President, what I have to say concerns the Minutes to the extent that, although it states correctly in the German version of the Minutes that the Secretary-General has been asked to report to the Bureau on the matter, at least in the Spanish version of the Minutes - admittedly I have not been able to check all eleven language versions - it states that posts are being blocked by the Committee on Budgets."
"I should like to request that the Minutes be aligned with the German language version."
"The Spanish version, in any case, is incorrect."
"Madam President, I should simply like to add one more point: the striking thing about this situation was that one of the three people who caused the commotion here was the same person who attacked the Turkish Foreign Minister during a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I should like this to be recorded in the Minutes once again."
"I did say it yesterday to your representative."
"Surely it cannot be possible for an individual, who has been identified, not to be banned from entering this House!"
"Why is there not a computer with an alarm signal stored in it by means of which a person of this kind is denied access?"
"There must be no repeat of this!"
"I would really ask you to ensure that these matters are investigated."
"Quite, Mrs Pack."
"Mr Wurtz did indeed explain that his colleague had been mislead, but you raise another issue, which I have also recognised. We are going to look into it, together with the Quaestors, to prevent this happening again and ensure that security checks are in place."
"Madam President, I want to speak on the item 'statute and financing of European political parties' ."
"I do not think the Minutes accurately reflect the point Mr Ribeiro e Castro raised yesterday."
"He invoked Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure, raising the question of prejudice and contesting the legal base for Mrs Schleicher' s report."
"A majority in Parliament agreed with Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s interpretation, and as there is therefore a question of prejudice - the fact that the Treaty of Nice has not yet been ratified - it seems to me that Parliament certainly cannot return to this issue pending the Treaty' s ratification."
"It cannot therefore be put back on Parliament' s agenda."
"I would also like to thank the President for the sitting, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, for the way he conducted yesterday' s debate, and mention a letter from Mrs Palacio, who reminds each of us that the legal bases underpinning Parliament' s decisions are not determined by strength of majority alone, but also by legal factors and assessments."
"Mr Dupuis, I do not feel that what you have just said requires us to amend the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting."
"Madam President, on item 25 of the Minutes and on the excellent motion of inadmissibility by Mr Ribeiro e Castro which was adopted yesterday, I would like to point out that the Minutes mention the speeches by Mr Poettering, asking for the report to be included in the agenda for the next part-session, Mr Barón Crespo, asking for it to be added to the agenda of the next day' s sitting, and Mr Berthu, who replied, but whose position is not stated."
"For accuracy of the Minutes, I would like to make it clear that, in any case, the motion of inadmissibility was adopted, the report cannot be put back on the agenda and, were it to be, that would not be possible without another meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"It would not be proper to proceed otherwise."
"Is that what you said yesterday, Mr Berthu?"
"Absolutely, Madam President, those were the remarks I made yesterday and they do not appear in the Minutes."
"Very well, we shall amend the Minutes so that your remarks are properly reported."
"You have jumped ahead rather, but we are still on the Minutes."
"That being the case, we will be able to save time later on."
"Madam President, with a view to clarifying the situation, allow me to say the following: yesterday, as we all know, there was great confusion here in the Chamber, and I do not wish to reopen the debate on the issue itself at this stage."
"However, the reason why it was suggested that we should not debate this report on the status of political parties was in fact that it was said that it did not have a legal base."
"In this respect it is right, however - as you said - that the relevant provision is Rule 143 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Now the impression has been given that I and my colleagues thought that the report ought to be referred back to the committee; this has arisen from the fact that we mistook the number of the rule in the Rules of Procedure, and after all to err is human."
"The relevant provision was Rule 143."
"That is why there can be a vote straight away on whether we address this report or not."
"Madam President, I have since read up on exactly what was written in the Minutes about the incident involving the demonstrators."
"I would like to make something clear."
"During the sitting, three demonstrators carrying banners entered the Chamber."
"That is what it says."
"I have to tell you that these three people did not make their way into the Chamber calmly, but sneaked in quickly, and they had not unfurled the banners at that stage."
"They did not do this until they were in the Chamber, and our staff were unable to see them."
"I simply wanted to say this, because as it is minuted here, one could assume that the staff should have noticed the fact that they were carrying banners. That was not the case."
"Are there any other comments?"
"Madam President, with regard to my speech on the debate about the inadmissibility or supposed inadmissibility of the Schleicher report on the status of parties, I asked for the point to be included in the agenda for today, but I would like to add the following: I made this request pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure, which gives the President the authority to propose it, and I would like this point to be added because here we are not debating a referral back to committee, but whether a commando act during a plenary sitting of Parliament can modify the agenda and wipe a subject as important as this from the attention of the Members of this House for years to come, basically, for ever."
"Quite, Mr Barón Crespo."
"We will make that change to the Minutes."
"Madam President, I would ask the various parliamentary units to listen to yesterday' s tapes before recording Mr Baron Crespo' s opinion in the Minutes, as, to my mind, the opinion he expressed this morning is not the same as that he had yesterday."
"We will look into all that, of course."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Agenda"
"Pursuant to Rule 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure, and at the request of several political groups, I propose to include in today' s agenda, as the first item, the report by Mrs Schleicher, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the statute and financing of European political parties."
"Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?"
"Madam President, I do not wish to repeat all that I have just said."
"It is completely justified to make this proposal here in accordance with Rule 111."
"Our group, like the other groups - not all of them, but those which have a major interest in this issue, because we believe that it promotes democracy in Europe - are of the opinion that we must not give way to the opponents of Europe in order to postpone this report, but that we must do our duty here."
"That is why we are in favour of this item being placed on the agenda and also of it being voted on today in the voting block at 12 noon."
"The people of Europe expect us to discharge our responsibility here."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Poettering."
"Mr Dell'Alba, you want to speak against this proposal."
"Madam President, I cannot understand what Mr Poettering is talking about."
"This does not actually involve either Europe or the citizens as such, but only the bureaucracies of the European political parties."
"Under the rules you certainly have the right, Madam President, to ask for this report to be included, but I would like to remind you, before you confirm your request, that only yesterday afternoon, the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, supported by six Members, Mr Gollnisch, Mr Abitbol, Mr Souladakis, Mr Onesta, Mr Krarup, and Mr Meijer, as well as the rapporteur himself, proposed dealing with this matter in committee as soon as possible, which seemed to me to be a wise gesture."
"So I cannot understand the rush."
"Secondly, while Rule 111 does indeed authorise you to take a proposal for an amendment, that Rule also stipulates that the agenda cannot be amended, except pursuant to Rules 112, 143 and so on. Rule 143 has been applied."
"We are not going to do that twice in the same part-session and on the same subject."
"That really is quibbling."
"So let us be realistic, there is a mini-session soon."
"Your services can, I think, wait a little while."
"There is a serious problem about the legal base;"
"Mr Napolitano, the Chairman, has said so. Let the Committee on Constitutional Affairs deal with the matter first."
"We have heard one speaker in favour and one speaker against."
"As reference has been made to action by the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and as he is asking for the floor, I am very happy to call him."
"Afterwards, Parliament will decide."
"In my speech of yesterday - as can be seen from the verbatim report - I certainly did not say, Mr Dell' Alba, that there is a problem of legal base."
"I said the opposite: I said, rather, that in the matter of the legal base, in relation to the Treaties, of this Commission proposal - since we are discussing a Commission proposal and then Mrs Schleicher' s report - we had discussed it long and hard in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and had also received an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which did not come up with any observation on the legal base of the measure."
"As regards my proposal to convene the committee, that was a result of the confusion that Mr Poettering has mentioned."
"I unfortunately arrived in the Chamber - and I apologise for that - once the vote had already been taken and I was given some inaccurate information."
"Mr Berthu told me that he himself had thought of asking for a referral back to committee, but then in effect I realised that the vote had been taken under Rule 143 and not 144."
"Therefore my intention to get ready to rapidly convene the Committee on Constitutional Affairs no longer made any sense, once I had found out what had been the base in the Rules of the vote taken in the House."
"Mr Dell'Alba, I want you to know that before using Rule 111, I naturally gave the matter a great deal of thought."
"I met with Mr Napolitano, I met with other Members, and of course I took careful note of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs on this problem of admissibility."
"All the conditions seem to me to be in place - I say that in all conscience, but I may be wrong - for me to propose the inclusion of this item on the agenda under Rule 111."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"The report therefore becomes the first item on the agenda."
"Status and financing of European political parties"
"The next item is the report (A5-0167/2001) by Mrs Schleicher, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties (COM(2000) 898 - C5-0081/2001 - 2001/0011(CNS))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of meetings are taking place at the same time as this debate, despite the fact that this is an issue which actually concerns the whole Parliament."
"Parties are the foundation stone of democracies."
"Without parties, which ideally fight to establish a model which maximises the welfare of state and society, democracy is inconceivable."
"Today, all 15 Member States of the European Union are ruled by democratic forms of state, and therefore by governments composed of varying combinations of political parties."
"As citizens of democratically governed Member States we are right to attach importance to them; as Europeans we can rightly be proud of them."
"Many people ask whether we need a statute for European parties."
"The European Parliament is the only institution of the European Union which is legitimated by direct, free elections."
"The European Parliament is also regarded as the cradle of European parties."
"Cooperation in the groups required there to be increasingly close contacts between their constituent parties and with the national parties."
"In this way, new international party structures and European parties gradually developed."
"I should simply like to refer to the fact that the European People's Party has been in existence since 1976, the Party of European Socialists since 1992, the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party since 1993 and finally the European Federation of Green Parties also since 1993."
"If my information is correct, two more European parties have apparently been founded since then, which means that we already have at least six European parties now."
"The party political landscape is hardly uncomplicated."
"The number of parties represented in national parliaments varies considerably across the Member States."
"Our 626 Members of the European Parliament, at any rate, hail from 130 different national parties."
"Italy, with 21 parties in the European Parliament, is represented by the greatest number of parties."
"These different national parties have combined in the European Parliament to form eight groups, alongside the 14 non-attached Members."
"In response to these various developments, Parliament has been calling for a legal base for European parties since the eighties."
"The adoption of the Treaty of Maastricht ten years ago brought a breakthrough for the European Parliament in the shape of Article 191, which was adopted unanimously by the governments of the Member States."
"This article reads: ""Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union."
"They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union."""
"In the Treaty of Nice, Article 191 is amplified to turn that article, on its own, into a legal base."
"""The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall lay down the regulations governing political parties at European level and in particular the rules regarding their funding."""
"European parties therefore make a valuable contribution to European integration, which should not be underestimated."
"This work cannot be done by a national party."
"To continue this work, European parties need, for example, office space and employees, which means, in other words, money."
"Up until now the European parties have been supported by their groups in the European Parliament."
"However, it is precisely this indirect funding by the groups which the European Court of Auditors has criticised on the grounds of lack of transparency and the improper use of parliamentary funds, and it will not tolerate this any longer."
"The European Union budget already provides funds for the current financial year in line B3-500: EUR 7 million for all parties."
"This is certainly no cornucopia, as we hear from resentful quarters."
"How the funds are to be distributed is also laid down in the Regulation."
"The Commission generously tabled a proposal for a regulation in February to establish the conditions which would need to be met."
"One of these is for statutes to be submitted, providing evidence that a European party is committed to the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental rights and control of income and expenditure, which are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union."
"This goes further than existing national legislation on parties."
"In addition, a European party has to prove, amongst other things, that it has been successful in elections in at least five Member States or that it is represented in the European Parliament by Members from at least five Member States."
"There are also precise rules on how the Regulation is to be implemented and on control."
"The European parties are not permitted to use their funds to finance national parties."
"This ban also applies to the funding of election campaigns."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has added several points in its opinion, including the reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a definition of the party as having legal personality so that it can conduct legal transactions, and further-reaching proposals on controls, including on revenue from donations."
"Thanks are also due here to the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their good proposals."
"In addition there are now a further 40 amendments, which I should like to classify under three headings: those which make the text of the Regulation more precise, those which propose detailed rules and those which reject the proposal."
"You will understand that, as rapporteur, I cannot support the proposal's rejection because, after all, it is Parliament itself which has been calling for a regulation for a long time."
"There is another reason why rejection is also incomprehensible to me."
"It arouses suspicion that we want to prevent party financing being made transparent at European level."
"I cannot recommend detailed rules at present."
"This Regulation is a temporary solution until the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, when we will be in a position to draft comprehensive legislation with the Council."
"Today we are taking the first step and until the Council makes a unanimous decision we can unfortunately only deliver an opinion."
"It is in the interests of the European Parliament for a neat solution to be found which will enable the criticisms of the European Court of Auditors to be taken into account as quickly as possible."
"I should like to address one more point: the Council was present yesterday, and I received the speech of the President-in-Office on behalf of the Council Presidency."
"I should very much like to hand it over to the President of Parliament."
"In it the Council says that it is interested in our completing our work as early as today if possible."
"The Council is full of good intentions to do all it can to bring this dossier to a conclusion, possibly even under the Swedish Presidency."
"I should therefore like to thank the Swedish Presidency for showing such commitment in its efforts to allow the European parties to stand on their own two feet, by conferring legal status on them and making their funding transparent."
"This is a very difficult task which, in the interests of democracy, will hopefully be crowned with success."
"I hereby hand this speech over to the President of Parliament."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to point out the contribution that the European political parties have made to the affirmation of democratic values and the strengthening of a European awareness, the Nice European Council approved an addition to Article 191 concerning the statute of political parties at a European level and, in particular, the rules regarding their financing."
"Until the Nice decision is ratified, it is appropriate that a set of rules should be defined that apply to the creation and financing of the parties to ensure immediate effectiveness and transparency in this field from this moment on."
"This is the purpose of the timely proposal by the European Commission, to which can be added the proposals set out in the report by Mrs Schleicher, whom I congratulate on the quality of her work."
"The opinion of the Committee on Budgets seeks to strengthen the guarantees of transparency in the financing of parties, particularly through the express identification of the origin and destination of all funds."
"At the same time, the clear distinction between political groups in the European Parliament and European political parties is maintained for the next legislature, particularly as regards their buildings and staff."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the party statute and the resulting statute on political parties is of far greater significance than most people probably believe."
"We think that a party statute, in the truest sense of the word, is important for the unification of Europe and for democracy in Europe."
"How then is the will of the European people to be expressed, if not through parties?"
"As varied as our views may be, it is after all the parties who, in the end, give expression to our political will, even if this is often only after a very tough process of debate."
"That is why the significance of this party statute for the unification of our continent and for democracy in our continent cannot be overestimated, even if it is criticised here and there in the media or in extreme quarters of this House."
"The last time that we debated this initiative - I myself was astonished that it is already nearly a year ago - was on 14 June 2000."
"Yesterday we had certain events here in this House and I would also say, Mr President, that we need to consider how we can prevent an anti-European minority from stopping progress in the future."
"That is why we need to amend our Rules of Procedure."
"I should particularly like to express my appreciation - and for me as a democrat this was a cheering sight yesterday - of the fact that after yesterday's tumult four conscientious groups immediately realised their responsibility for Europe - the Christian Democrats, the EPP, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Greens - and sought a way out of the situation."
"That was a test of democracy here in the European Parliament and I would expressly thank the other groups who took that step with us."
"I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to Ursula Schleicher, who by working unbelievably hard in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the Chairmanship of our esteemed colleague, Mr Napolitano, managed to forge agreement on majority positions."
"My dear Mrs Schleicher, you have done an excellent job here and people will always remember your name with gratitude when this party statute is adopted."
"I should also, however, like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Barnier and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for responding to the initiative taken by the four aforementioned groups in this Parliament and tabling this proposal."
"Even though it is still based on the old law - we are being heard - it is nevertheless a prerequisite for the Swedish Presidency to be able to decide."
"I should also like to acknowledge explicitly the very great effort that the Swedish Presidency is putting into this."
"Of course Mr Danielsson is not able to be here today."
"He was here yesterday, however, and we only have ourselves to blame for the fact that we are not able to debate this with him today."
"I regret this, and in the future we need to find a means of cooperating with the Council of Ministers to ensure that the Council is represented here in the European Parliament - and this is not to criticise the Swedish Presidency - throughout the week that we are in session."
"We want more transparency. We want straightforward financial control, Commissioner Schreyer."
"That is why I was astonished - I must mention this now - to see a statement by Messrs Kuhne and Van Hulten in Euronews."
"They had not secured a majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control and were attacking us."
"That is completely inappropriate!"
"If a rapporteur in a committee does not succeed in securing a majority in favour of his report then that is due to the rapporteur's own incompetence, and he should not defame others who are full of good intentions and wish to contribute to the overall result."
"We want transparency and we also need this party statute so that we can integrate the parties from Central Europe."
"There, where democracy is only just being established, it is even more important than it is here for democratic structures to gain stability."
"I should like to refer to one further point: legal personality for the parties."
"Parliament's Bureau will, as you know, after consulting a committee of eminent persons, advise on the basis on which it will be decided which organisations are genuinely European parties which comply with the criteria."
"Obviously there will also always be the temptation of political opportunism to say yes or no to a political party."
"That is why the parties need to be endowed with legal personality, so that they are able to appeal against a decision if they believe that the rules have been violated and the right decisions have not been made."
"Legal certainty is actually the most important thing in the European Union."
"In conclusion I should like to say that whenever there are conflicts between us it is important for those conflicts to be resolved peacefully."
"This peaceful conflict resolution is only possible on the basis of the law."
"That is why it is important for there also to be recourse to the ECJ."
"I hope that a large majority of this House will vote in favour of this proposal tabled by Ursula Schleicher."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is an important day for European democracy, because we always talk about the institutions of the European structure, but we never talk about the protagonists and we need protagonists on the European stage."
"They are the political parties."
"Following the awful things that I heard in this House yesterday, allow me, Mr President, to say something that is based on my own experience, which is shared by you, in your country, and by Mr Poettering, which is that those who are against political parties are against democracy."
"Parties will have their flaws, but there is no pluralist democracy in the world without political parties that represent the will of the people."
"We therefore need to be very careful with demagoguery on this very important issue."
"I have to say that I feel particularly proud, because almost ten years ago to the day, with the help and support of President Martens, President De Clercq, who is still our colleague, and President Spitaels, as President of Parliament, I made the first proposal that was given form in Article 138 of the Treaty, now Article 191, in which, in agreement with President Lubbers, we succeeded in having the political parties incorporated into the Treaties."
"We must not now simply content ourselves with proclaiming principles."
"What we have to do is develop and give personality to the European political parties, and ensure that they do not continue to be some sort of annex to our groups."
"This is the reason why, although we debate and disagree on many other things, we are in agreement on these matters, which are essential for democracy."
"With regard to the debate and the report drawn up by Mrs Schleicher, whose work I welcome, I would say to my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, that we disagree on many things, but I would ask him not to get angry with Mr Kuhne, who raised a request made to us by the Court of Auditors in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I would ask him, before twelve o' clock, to reconsider his anger and support these amendments, which I think could be positive for everyone."
"Another aspect that we think is essential, and here I would also ask for the support of your group, is that we should take a step forward on an essential issue for European democracy, which is the funding of the parties, in terms of who can contribute funds."
"This is an open debate."
"In the United States we have just seen the McCain initiative on soft money and hard money."
"In many European countries we have had bitter experiences in this area."
"We have not taken drastic action. We have worked instead on the basis of experiences that have occurred in the various European countries... what we say is that legal entities, basically commercial companies, should not be able to give money to parties."
"We are in favour of a ban in this area, because we believe that this is good for democracy and for transparency, because what we are talking about here are not acts of philanthropy. Something is always asked for in return - you only have to look at what President Bush is proposing for the energy sector."
"To conclude, Mr President, allow me to point out the happy coincidence that today the majority of this House and the groups that have a European dimension, and we should not forget that we have a European dimension, have members from all the countries in the Union."
"We want order, regulation, transparency and responsibility to the citizens and we therefore ask that our positions be respected in this debate and above all that there should be a shared democratic will at this decisive moment for European integration."
"Mr President, in line with our Rules of Procedure, I believe that I should first of all indicate that there is a conflict of interest in my case, as I am also treasurer of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"This is not a financial interest, since the position is unsalaried - exceptionally so, I may say - but nevertheless, this is in any event probably a case of conflict of political interests."
"However, I am speaking here on behalf of the liberal group, and not on behalf of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party."
"The thing that should, of course, stand out in this entire discussion, is the fact that the situation as it is now is really not acceptable."
"The situation in which the groups are keeping the parties afloat."
"There was no other way until now."
"There was no other way around this, but I believe that we all have understood by now, even intuitively speaking, that this situation is untenable."
"The Court of Auditors has highlighted this, which is to be applauded."
"Needless to say, nothing has happened in secret."
"Everything was above board, everyone was able to see that things were done in this way, but it cannot continue like this."
"As it happens, our groups cannot live on air, and if they do not receive support from general resources, where does that support originate from?"
"Do we want the European political parties to become a plaything of whatever pressure group, be it trade union, businesses or other non-governmental organisations, rich individuals or whoever?"
"It is patently clear that political parties must be able to lead an independent life."
"If we do not, we will have American-styled practices on our hands, and I would not simply refer to President Bush, but also to the practice of candidates actually only accruing funds instead of pursuing politics."
"We must never end up in a situation of that kind."
"We need effectively functioning parties, as Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo already stated very eloquently."
"Indeed, that is where representative democracy comes into its own."
"That is the case nationally and even much more so at European level."
"We need stability in our democracy with a view to enlargement."
"The new countries which are about to join us are also politically active."
"They too have political parties which need to feel at home in the existing European political families."
"Only in that way can we in this Parliament help democracy develop in the future."
"That is of key importance."
"Furthermore, we need stability with a view to democratic development in the European Union."
"We do not know how this will develop, but we cannot rule out that there will come a time when there will be European electoral lists."
"Someone will then need to put forward these candidates."
"We cannot rule out that a system can be set up whereby it is possible to become individual members of European political parties."
"For that too, a proper system will need to be developed to accommodate this."
"In addition, it is necessary for those parties to be independent."
"It is, of course, too crazy for words that the political parties must be financially independent from those elected on behalf of that political party."
"It should be the other way round."
"Those who are elected, should be checked out by their political parties."
"That is how democracy works most effectively, and in that respect, I believe that even the present system can be improved on."
"There is more to say on this subject."
"We very much share the view, of course, that this cannot mean support for national parties."
"We also agree that the system does not mean that pro-European campaigns are funded with this."
"We believe that a number of issues still need to be examined, including legal status."
"We should examine these aspects further."
"For example, the aspect of support for political campaigns should be addressed."
"We can come back to this during the amendment procedure, which will take place in due course, and then we will be able to put the finishing touches to the system."
"Mr President, I have little time, that is why I hardly have the opportunity to highlight the importance of the forming of European parties."
"Whoever claims, however, that parties are needed should also be aware that they take care of their financial resources and so far, this has been done in an unorthodox fashion."
"It had to be done in the twilight zone."
"We need a solid basis, transparency and control."
"That is why our group is principally in favour of no donations from businesses for political parties, so as to vouch for the independence of Parliament as an institution and of the individual MPs."
"Virtually every country has had its fair share of scandals, and we know that it is necessary to act very strictly and monitor closely."
"If there are donations, it should be made very clear and transparent where they are from and what they will be spent on."
"It must be possible to form democratic parties without creating too high thresholds."
"That is why we support the proposal which the Commission presented right from the outset, to take five countries as the norm, so as not to deter any forces - at least if they are democratic."
"There should also be sufficient funding for all recognised parties to be able to function as a party."
"The overheads - and this can be verified objectively - must be covered before the resources are shared out proportionately."
"Finally, we should be acutely aware of the fact that the citizens keep a watchful eye over the system."
"We ourselves should ensure that the democratic fundamental rights are observed, for we cannot subsidise parties which subsequently undermine democracy."
"Mr President, our Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is not the group of a left-wing European party."
"The parties represented in our group have differing positions on the political proposal on European political parties."
"Some colleagues wonder, not without good reason, how meaningful it is and to what extent they actually can represent a European public."
"The direct link to the people is not actually forged through Europe; it exists at national and regional level."
"That is where the parties have their grass roots; that is where they have their members and electors."
"I should like to ask Messrs Poettering and Barón Crespo to reconsider their words."
"Mr Barón Crespo has just said that those who are against parties are against democracy."
"I do not think that this is the case."
"Rather I think that parties often tend to take themselves particularly seriously."
"The public, for example in Germany, are very sceptical - not without reason - about membership of political parties."
"I think that it is only 3% in the Federal Republic who take an interest in politics by joining a political party."
"Nevertheless they are still democrats."
"They get involved in society through other organisations of civil society, such as citizens' action groups and non-governmental organisations."
"I want to say that the European party should not be denied the right to exist."
"Those political forces which consider mergers of this kind to be right and necessary should also be able to proceed with them."
"Quite apart from that, I am convinced, personally, that European parties, as it states in Article 191 of the Treaty, do actually constitute an important factor for integration."
"That is why I support Mrs Schleicher's report and would also thank the Commission for its initiative."
"Against the background of the criticisms made by the Court of Auditors, I think it is necessary for clear conditions to be established."
"Legal certainty, financial discipline and transparency are indispensable, and I think that in particular the proposals on the statute, and especially the requirement for complete transparency of finances and any donations, should definitely be included in the Regulation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of my group, I must, of course, say that the positions I express here do not represent the whole group, in which there are two different feelings on this subject. I would come back, however, to questions of principle, which I believe we should examine thoroughly."
"Firstly, I regret that, in the various stages of the debate in which we have been engaged, the majority, whose strength we have never doubted, has never taken the trouble or care to respond to the legality issues. We should like to know how Article 308 is to be implemented."
"How can it be brought forward with regard to the Treaty of Nice? How can one jump from the equality of political parties at European level to the creation of restrictive entities: the European political parties?"
"There has never been a reasoned response."
"I should also like to take the opportunity to reply politely to Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo."
"We are not against Europe."
"We are against the bulldozing of rights, especially in the case of fundamental rights in Europe."
"Neither are we against political parties!"
"On the contrary, we believe that this Regulation is against political parties on a totally illegal basis, because it is not provided for in the Treaties."
"We are against illegal discrimination against parties."
"Besides, it has been mentioned that our concern is to respond to the concerns of a court: the Court of Auditors."
"Given the ups and downs that this Regulation has been going through, it would not surprise me if, when the Court of Auditors first dealt with the matter, it raised the questions of the lack of legal base that have been discussed here itself."
"I should also like to draw your attention to Article 191."
"The Treaty says this: 'Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union.'"
"It does not authorise any discrimination between them."
"The only discrimination that may exist in this European Parliament is brought about by the power of the electors, the democratic vote, and not by any other kind of instrument that may favour some to the detriment of others."
"Mr President, SOS Democracy and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities unanimously rejects the proposal to use the flexible clause of the Treaty, Article 308, to finance supranational parties at EU level."
"The Treaty of Nice introduces a special legal basis for aid to parties and thereby demonstrates that there is no legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The Court of Justice has laid down that Article 308 cannot be used instead of Treaty changes."
"Therefore, the basis of the proposal is clearly unlawful until the Treaty of Nice has been approved in all the Member States."
"The content will, unfortunately, also be unlawful following the Treaty of Nice because the latter does not deal with supranational European parties."
"It deals with political parties at European level and, in a special declaration, rules out discrimination."
"The Schleicher report would provide some parties with special aid not available to other parties."
"This is contrary to the principle of equality."
"In a democracy, it is the electorate alone that decides who is represented in Parliament, and the parties must compete on an equal footing."
"Particular parties cannot be given advantages according to whether they are organised on a local or supranational basis."
"It is not for the majority in Parliament to correct the election results by forcing the entire electorate to contribute to the financing of five supranational EU parties. It is incredible, moreover, that the Commission, as the guardian of legality, is able to submit such a clearly unlawful proposal, and it is inconceivable that Parliament should today adopt a proposal which, in accordance with current legal practice, can be declared unlawful by the EC Court of Justice."
"I would call upon the groups to talk the matter through with Parliament' s own legal service and, at least, to defer the vote until the next session."
"Mr President, I think yesterday' s episode and today' s represent another sombre period for our Parliament."
"It really is a Parliament of charlatans that has spoken this morning."
"I think the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will find the matter ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Dupuis, you too are part of this Parliament."
"Please try to measure your words."
"Mr President, for me our Parliament has been acting the clown."
"I warn you, we are working on going to Luxembourg."
"The reasoning given by Mr Ribeiro and other Members on the lack of any legal base is glaringly obvious in my opinion, and our Parliament has not wanted to see this."
"The discrimination issue is just as glaringly obvious."
"Then there are some other points: this report speaks of 'lasting' parties."
"I would like to hear from you, ladies and gentlemen, what a 'lasting' party means."
"There is a political judgment inherent in this report: the Bureau of Parliament will be called upon to decide whether a party is worthy or not of receiving funding."
"That is a political judgment!"
"I have listened with interest to the Members, and without too many surprises."
"Jules Maaten tells us so many fine things about where the funding for the parties is to come from."
"However, what are political parties?"
"They are the expression, they should be the expression of civil society, and therefore either civil society, the citizens (nobody has said anything about the citizens) give money to the parties, and so the parties survive because they are the expression of civil society, or they are condemned to die, as quite rightly they should die if they do not represent anyone."
"Nobody wants to talk about this."
"That is incredible!"
"It is the bureaucratisation not just of Europe but also of our society."
"They are parties that live outside society: an expression of this - read last month' s Eurobarometer - is the ever-increasing distance between you, your bureaucracies and the citizens."
"You have invented a new tax for the citizens, which forces them to finance your bureaucracies."
"This is intolerable; it is a measure against the citizens, and we will act with determination and take this to Luxembourg, because all of this is against Europe."
"Mr Barón thinks that somebody here is against parties!"
"We are for parties that are alive, are expressions of society and not expressions of bureaucracies."
"Mr President, yesterday Mr Poettering said that he was taking note of the decision made pursuant to Rule 143 Paragraph 1 as a democrat."
"He wanted yesterday's majority to prove themselves to be democrats if the tables were turned."
"I can assure him that we are behaving like democrats."
"It is precisely democrats, however, who are deeply concerned about the Rules of Procedure being complied with."
"If, in accordance with Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure, the inadmissibility - due to legal shortcomings - of a specific item on the agenda is once moved and agreed, then in my view there is no possibility of magically reinstating it on the agenda by means of Rule 111 Paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 111 Paragraph 2 provides, you see, that the agenda may not be amended, except in pursuance of Rule 143, amongst others, or on a proposal from the President."
"That is an exclusive rule."
"Since here the case in Rule 143 has occurred the second case does not apply."
"This means, in other words, that today's debate, in my view, is at variance with the Rules of Procedure, which is why I do not wish to contribute any further to it."
"I have one comment on the legal base: in COM document 2000/444 the Commission also proposed adding a legal base for the statute to Article 191."
"This was in July 2000."
"I cannot understand the assertion that this cannot have been discussed in the committee."
"Madam President, firstly I will refer to Mr Dupuis' s speech."
"He said that it is the people and civil society that should decide whether a party exists or disappears."
"I was concerned to hear this from Mr Dupuis, because obviously it is a subject that he knows well, as his party has just disappeared from the Italian political map."
"Going back to serious matters and serious speeches, I am the secretary-general of a European political party and moreover, I would like to stress, of a party that does not sit in the European Parliament."
"It is the only party that has its own headquarters, a small house in Brussels that is separate from the European Parliament, and funding that for the most part (more than 70%) is not dependent on the parliamentary group but on the parties that are members of our political family."
"I think that today is a great day for European construction, but I would go even further: today a big step is being taken in constructing a political Europe."
"Because those of us who believe in a political Europe, and in my group we do, of course, believe in this, know that the parties are a fundamental part of a political union."
"Political areas, such as the Member States, have parties that provide cohesion: France, Spain, Italy, Germany... all have national parties."
"Europe needs parties that deal with and work in the whole of the Union, and this is what will give cohesion and coherence to the European Union."
"I therefore think that this Regulation is a good one and is to be welcomed, for two reasons."
"Firstly and obviously, because it provides rules and transparency for the functioning and funding of these very important elements for the political future of the European Union."
"Secondly, because of the role that these parties will play in the future."
"Because, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a political union, a Europe of 23, 25, 27 or more Member States is going to be increasingly difficult to manage. It is going to be increasingly difficult to move forward and increasingly difficult to have common opinions."
"The European parties are a new instrument that can provide coherence, which can act as the backbone of this political union that we desire, in order to achieve a consensus where it would otherwise be difficult."
"I can imagine the different European political families meeting prior to the meetings of the European Council with 27 prime ministers and reaching consensuses that will enable the European Union to move forward with a firm step towards the future."
"I do not think, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that we realise the importance of the step that we are taking today."
"Madam President, this proposal will probably succeed as a transitional measure to regularise what is at present a flawed system of financing our fledgling political parties."
"I agree, however, with some of the critics who say that the proposal in front of us will not provide a lasting statute for the development of campaigning political parties, which are an essential factor should our vibrant transnational European parliamentary democracy flourish."
"We are proposing one amendment that will improve the proposal, which is to grant the political parties legal personality under European Union law."
"To leave things as they are at present, with 15 competing national jurisdictions, will be a cause of confusion and future problems."
"We should sort this out now and address the other outstanding issues more seriously and more successfully once the Treaty of Nice comes into force."
"We also welcome the compromise amendment, which lowers the threshold for the registration of political parties from a third to a quarter, which is in the interest of both fairness and pluralism."
"Madam President, first I wanted to return for a few seconds to what happened this morning."
"My group is slightly concerned about procedural squabbles ruining this text, which is important to us."
"We hope that the fact that there was a sort of forced passage this morning is not going to secure the future of this text because, for us, it is imperative to have transparent financing for these European political parties."
"We are well aware of what those who reject this financing mechanism are waiting for."
"They still prefer the system where suitcases of banknotes are handed over in the dark."
"As things stand, it must be flatly stated that the report which has emerged from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is still not acceptable."
"It does not really ensure transparency."
"The democratic threshold for accessing the financing is far too high."
"As for the type of financing, we are extremely disturbed to see that this text allows private companies to finance parties."
"Everyone is perfectly well aware of what that means too: when a company finances a party, it is hoping for advantages in return."
"That is called organised corruption."
"We therefore hope - because there are now some very good compromise amendments on the table - that this transparency will be strengthened, and that, as my friend Andrew Duff has said, the democratic threshold will indeed be lowered, five right away, and a quarter of the Member States after Nice. Above all we hope private financing will be totally banned, because it is not our calling in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to organise corruption, even if done transparently."
"I hereby announce that if private companies are allowed to use their money to buy political parties at European level, our group will not vote for this report at the end of the day."
"The extent to which there are, or are not, to be European parties must be a matter for the peoples of Europe and, in a democratic society, this is not something in which Parliament or a Commission should get involved."
"This is not, of course, about constructing European parties."
"It is about giving money to European parties, and that is quite a different matter."
"As I understand it, the problem is that there is now a grey area and that some are opting for corruption and other curious methods of obtaining money for their activities. In that case, however, we must demand that they clean up their acts."
"We must demand transparency, and we must demand that the existing European parties scrupulously observe rules and laws instead of cheating their way around them."
"Instead, a system is now being devised in which the parties themselves can put their fingers in the till. Fewer and fewer people are joining political parties."
"In Germany, the figure is 3%, which is certainly a very good reflection of the situation in my own country. No one joins European parties, and in that situation parties are opting to enrich themselves."
"It is an enormous problem we are creating."
"We are hugely deepening the gulf between ourselves and the people."
"It will be difficult to face the electorate at the next parliamentary election."
"We have just had a foretaste of what we can expect if the Regulation we are debating today were to be implemented."
"We have seen how Parliament has voted down the minority groups in contravention of clear legal principles."
"It stands to reason that Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure cannot be used as this majority has used it."
"It is shameful that there has not been a single legal challenge arising from the fact that Parliament yesterday voted to throw out the matter and is today saying that it is of no significance."
"The majority decides; the majority is always right; that is the attitude."
"Once this Regulation has come into force, the major political parties will subsequently have some very serious problems, however."
"They will have problems because it stands to reason that this Regulation cannot be implemented with Article 308 as its legal basis."
"This is completely clear following the Court of Justice' s pronouncement of 28 March 1996."
"Article 308 cannot be used to alter the Treaty, but that is what in reality is being done because the Treaty of Nice, which contains the necessary legal basis, has not come into force."
"That is the practical situation, and I can assure all the representatives of parties which vote down the minority groups - those parties that decide here in this Chamber - that we shall do everything to contest this legal basis."
"We shall take steps to bring the matter before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, and I can promise that there will be a political storm over the abuse of power of which this Regulation is an expression."
"Madam President, the proposal for a regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties is both inappropriate for all the reasons I shall set out in my explanation of vote, and is also lacking a legal basis."
"It is actually based on Article 308 (former Article 235) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but that cannot be used unless there is a Community power in existence first and no such power to act has been provided for."
"The Court of Justice clearly established this, in its opinion of 28 March 1996 on the possibility of the Community becoming a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights using Article 308 as the basis."
"It declared that the use of Article 308 in such a case was impossible, because no prior general Community power existed to define and modify fundamental rights."
"Consequently, in Paragraph 30 of its opinion - which I shall quote in full - the Court concludes that 'That provision (Article 308), being an integral part of an institutional system based on the principle of conferred powers, cannot serve as a basis for widening the scope of Community powers beyond the general framework created by the provisions of the Treaty as a whole and, in particular, by those that define the tasks and the activities of the Community."
"On any view, Article 235 cannot be used as a basis for the adoption of provisions whose effect would, in substance, be to amend the Treaty without following the procedure which it provides for that purpose.'"
"Today we find ourselves in precisely that scenario with the European political parties."
"Article 191 of the Treaty mentions them, but that only has declaratory value, because it does not entrust any mission to the Community as regards those political parties."
"Therefore that article can in no case serve as a point of departure for using Article 308, that is clear."
"Lastly, I would add in conclusion that the reform planned in the Treaty of Nice, which seeks to create the absent legal basis, has not yet been ratified, and I hope it never will be, because it runs counter to the French constitution and the general principles of a free society, by which political parties must be free."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European statute on political parties, which we are debating today, is long overdue."
"I should therefore like to thank the Commission for helping us, together with the European parties and the groups, to close this gap in European-level legislation in this parliamentary session."
"The provisions being introduced here have been national law and have applied to the national parties in all the Member States for a long time, despite varying rules."
"To all those who are now talking about parties I do have to say that each of us is sitting here because he was the candidate of a political party at national level."
"We are after all living in a multi-party democracy."
"Parties are not an end in themselves."
"They are an essential part of a functioning democracy and constitute a link between citizens, the groups and the public in the opinion-forming and decision-making process."
"In approving the Regulation that we are discussing today, we are making a contribution towards strengthening European democracy, intensifying the opinion-forming process and the debate within Europe and making the national parties more European."
"The Regulation helps to increase transparency in respect of the funding of political work, create greater clarity, and separate group and party work, something which the European People's Party - my friend Alejandro Agag has spoken about this - has been working hard to achieve for some time already, harder than the other parties."
"In addition it contributes to guaranteeing the right of the European Court of Auditors to monitor the affairs of the European parties."
"This Regulation is, however, also a basic prerequisite for a debate which we need to have on common electoral law and on common rules governing incompatibility for Members of Parliament in the different countries, and a prerequisite for the debate on the possibility of European parties standing in European parliamentary elections."
"It contributes to making the post-Nice process more democratic."
"We, the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, want more transparency and we want to strengthen the people's Europe, instead of having more closed doors - read the Council - and secretariats."
"We are in favour of the right to have recourse to legal action, enshrining the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a qualitative pre-condition for parties, European parties having legal personality and putting an end to cross-financing."
"Madam President, this Parliament certainly lacks neither imagination nor brutality when it comes to consolidating, underpinning and protecting the closed circuit system it christens 'democracy' . Here we are, faced with another of its innovations"
"Mrs Schleicher, good authors would say your text was about teratogenesis, that is, the production of monsters, a discipline in which the good Dr Frankenstein distinguished himself before you."
"That is what it amounts to when we are presented with a proposal to create European political parties out of nothing, and the very expression is absurd."
"They are not parties - they are not competing for the expression of universal suffrage which remains national in context - nor is this a matter of politics, because the only reason for this text is to let the large parliamentary groups get round a decision of the European Court of Auditors, and the whole thing is only European in the sense that it is not African or Asian."
"In reality, Mrs Schleicher, the pompous name of European political party disguises a trick as old as the hills, the great lottery for the benefit of the lottery organisers or, if you prefer, a comfortable pension granted to the parliamentary groups most docile towards the institutions this Parliament is actually either responsible for controlling - like the Commission - or supposed to share decision-making power with - the Council: a pension granted by those institutions themselves."
"The real name for that is misappropriation of public funds."
"Madam President, I feel rather like the great Blondin, just before he started out on his tightrope walk across the Niagara Falls."
"I have to say that my group and my delegation are opposed in principle to the regulation or financing of political parties at a European level."
"We, like others in this Chamber, have deep concerns that the proposed funding for European political parties has no legal base."
"It follows from this that we cannot favour a legal provision for state funding of political parties at European level."
"State funding of European political parties is quite different, therefore, to state funding of political groups within the European Parliament."
"In the UK, short money, as it is known, is provided for the support of opposition parties' leadership in their parliamentary activities."
"Our view also is that the Schleicher report does not follow the principles of the Nice Declaration."
"Article 191 of the Declaration states: ""The provisions on the funding for political parties shall apply on the same basis for all these political forces represented in the European Parliament."""
"The Schleicher report quite clearly discriminates against some of the smaller parties and groups."
"Finally, as Commissioner Patten said: ""This regulation is mistaken in principle, unworkable in practice and discriminatory in effect."""
"However, I wish to thank all the colleagues who understand that, like Europe, our group and our delegation do thrive on its differences."
"Nevertheless, for the reasons stated, that is why I and my British colleagues will be opposing this premature report."
"In conclusion, my late grandfather, Harold Macmillan, always held the view that Members of Parliament should not be paid, because when they were paid it attracted the wrong sort of chap."
"Thank you for the very full information you have been kind enough to give us, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"EUROJUST"
"The next item is the report (A5-0153/2001) by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic, the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to adopting a Council decision setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious organised crime (10357/2000 - C5-0396/2000 - 2000/0817(CNS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we Members think of the Council of the European Union we are by no means always filled with a deep sense of happiness."
"It is not only the lack of good will; difficulties with the subject matter and different priorities also sometimes make working with the Council rather a trial."
"All the more reason then for me to be glad today as rapporteur that everything has gone smoothly with Eurojust."
"We have acted in concert and made good progress in the fight against serious cross-border crime."
"I should like to express my thanks for this, in a personal capacity and on behalf of Parliament, but especially on behalf of the people who live in the European Union."
"If Eurojust starts work at the beginning of 2002 and supersedes the provisional unit to combat serious forms of organised cross-border crime, the public will have reason to be glad."
"This is because Europe will then have moved considerably closer to being an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The public also expect this of us, and I am convinced that they even have a right to it."
"That is why I should like to thank warmly colleagues in the committee who have helped to improve the Council initiative and make it more tangible."
"By so doing we want to create a judicial coordination unit which is as effective as possible and which works closely with the institutional partners, such as Europol, and the European Judicial Network."
"I would ask Parliament to vote in favour of the amendments and additions to the Council proposal which are necessary to achieve this."
"Allow me to give just a few examples from the Eurojust proposal where the hand of the European Parliament is visible."
"Firstly, the extended and clear-cut list of Eurojust's areas of competence is very important."
"It incorporates the essential features of my ideal of a European public prosecutor and goes far beyond the minimal concept occasionally put forward, which is based on the belief that it is quite sufficient to protect the financial interests of the European Union."
"From the public's point of view if we had adopted this minimal concept we would definitely not have gone far enough."
"We need to vigorously tackle all forms of crime which the people of Europe, not without reason, fear today."
"The fight must target cross-border fraud, corruption and crimes against the financial interests of the European Community just as much as computer crime."
"Money launderers must feel just as vulnerable as polluters."
"Of course Eurojust's general responsibilities must also include all of the other forms of crime and offences in respect of which Europol, as a police authority, is competent to act, including such dreadful crimes as trafficking in human beings or terrorist acts, which we have to read about every day in the newspaper."
"Secondly, we have added a recital on data protection."
"In my view this was also absolutely essential because the rule of law does not cease to apply in the fight against international and organised crime."
"This means that Eurojust must also submit to strict rules on data protection when pursuing all of its investigative activities."
"When collecting, processing and using personal data the international rules of the Council of Europe and the individual rules of the Member States apply equally in each case."
"Rules on data protection must also be observed unreservedly when personal data are exchanged."
"Thirdly, we want to ensure that Eurojust is able to work as flexibly as it possibly can."
"This is a fundamental prerequisite for success."
"Direct and uncomplicated contact between those involved is particularly important."
"That is why we have deleted the national correspondents from the proposal and removed anything which might foster the growth of bureaucratic hurdles."
"In conclusion, allow me to say that the Belgian government has announced that it wishes to complete the preparations for the definitive Eurojust unit during its presidency."
"With this undertaking and the agreement of Parliament on my report - which I earnestly request - Europe is striking a powerful blow against international crime."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half years have passed since the Tampere Council decided to set up Eurojust as a European coordination unit for criminal prosecution authorities and public prosecutors."
"This is a relatively short period of time if you compare progress in other areas of European policy."
"In Parliament we have been very positive towards this rapid progress and have taken an active interest in it."
"After Europol, the creation of Eurojust is a further important step towards combating organised cross-border crime in Europe more effectively."
"The first step in the judicial area, namely setting up the European Judicial Network, has already been a success."
"With the help of this network, for example, the public prosecutor in the German town of Celle was, within the space of a few hours, able to deploy an undercover detective from Belgian customs and, together with public prosecutors from another country, carry out an observation operation in a third country, again within the space of a few hours."
"Thus many an opportunity to give mutual assistance - which was supposed forgotten - has been made to bear fruit."
"Problems remained, however, for example with interpreting conventions on mutual assistance, criminal law and criminal proceedings and with the division of responsibilities."
"To compound matters there were communication problems because of the natural language barriers."
"With Eurojust these obstacles should now be surmounted."
"Eurojust has, first and foremost, a clearing function."
"The officials are to draft comparisons of laws, resolve bilateral disputes over the application and interpretation of conventions on mutual assistance, set priorities for fighting crime in Europe and monitor current transnational criminal prosecution measures."
"In the future, Eurojust will also have to keep lists of transnational investigations and be in a position to pass on this information; it will have to act as a registration point for information on serious offences and plan, coordinate and run training and development programmes."
"Through Eurojust, the national prosecution authorities will have access to reliable legal advice - without encountering language difficulties - and will be able to resolve transnational disputes."
"I should like to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, for drafting Parliament's opinion, which is now to be put to the vote, and for the good level of cooperation."
"Alongside her amendments, there is one further amendment in particular to which I attach great importance."
"Until now, the judicial network has been a body without a head."
"If we are now setting up Eurojust to be the missing head then we are also obliged to provide shared nerve fibres, without which body and head will not function together."
"Eurojust and the European Judicial Network should not stand alongside each other or only enter loosely into contact with each other; they need to be bound together in one unit."
"This can be achieved by using the already existing contact points of the European Judicial Network instead of the proposed national correspondents for Eurojust."
"Only in this way can a superfluous juxtaposition of two systems with the same area of responsibility be avoided in the long term."
"This is one of the ideas which our proposals contain."
"I should like to ask the Council to take account of these in its considerations."
"Then Eurojust really will be a success and make a contribution to the people of Europe living in greater security."
"Madam President, the construction of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice is making steady progress and growing day by day, although rather more slowly than some of us would like."
"Today we are discussing two important segments of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"The more important is precisely the creation of Eurojust, which has already been started off with the setting up of the provisional unit, which has prepared the ground for the definitive body."
"The European Parliament will, I hope, approve the excellent report by Mrs Gebhardt and hence the proposed amendments intended to strengthen the role and effectiveness of Eurojust."
"They do in fact indicate its duties and the scope of its competencies in a broad enough way to avoid difficulties and uncertainties in its actions and thus to be able to better ensure the security of the citizens."
"They set out better the guarantees that fundamental rights will be respected, especially with regard to the right to a defence and the confidentiality of personal data, and not least they ensure the autonomy and independence of the body, as behoves its nature as a judicial body."
"More effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters is a crucial element of the area of freedom, security and justice in order to face the challenge of crime in an area of free movement."
"However, in order to establish this cooperation in concrete form, the complexity of the procedures makes me hope yet again that in the next Treaty on the Union this matter too will finally become a Community matter, on a par with civil judicial cooperation, by means of the communitisation of the third pillar."
"Madam President, history will show that decisions to set up networks are more important than many other decisions we take."
"That also applies, for example, to the network of consumer ombudsmen."
"We see that we can all cooperate."
"We shall bring about practical results."
"As previous speakers have pointed out, it is important that the rules relating to personal protection are respected."
"I also want, however, to highlight an idea which Mr Watson has presented, namely that similar cooperation should be organised for those who have been accused and require a defence, so that everyone is operating on a level playing field."
"Our group fully supports the view that environmental crimes should be added to those crimes that are to be covered by this proposal."
"Unfortunately, we know that deliberate oil emissions are a significantly greater source of pollution than accidents."
"It is extremely rare for prosecutors to deal with these crimes."
"We therefore need Eurojust for cooperation in connection, for example, with my cherished Baltic."
"Our group has tabled Amendment 28 because we have to respect the different ways in which preliminary investigations are organised."
"In certain countries, such as my own, the prosecuting authority is, in part, dissociated from the preliminary investigation."
"That must be respected, as it also was in the Tampere conclusions, which are the basis for our decision and discussion today."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the continual increase in organised crime, the European Union has stepped up its initiatives to reinforce the fight against criminal organisations and improve cooperation between investigating and prosecuting authorities."
"The Tampere Summit provided new perspectives for this cooperation between police and judiciary, long regarded as the poor relation of European unification."
"Eurojust, made up of public prosecutors, magistrates and police liaison officers, has become the object of everyone' s attention."
"How, though, can we envisage effective operation of a unit which could become the future European public prosecutor' s office without prior harmonisation of Member States' legislation and a basic rapprochement of their procedures?"
"The purpose, for the Member States, is surely to achieve the highest possible standards, at the same time providing sufficient procedural guarantees and effective justice for all citizens, while respecting human rights, including the right to a defence."
"Yet, we have to recognise that today we are dealing with a body which is not subject to any European Parliament control."
"More serious still is the lack of all jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in accordance with Article 35 of the Treaty."
"Another point to bear in mind concerns the processing of the data that the unit is responsible for."
"Eurojust will also have the task of collating information from police records, police reports and Member States' registers."
"This gives rise to a few questions."
"What protection will be provided for this information?"
"Who can access and use it?"
"What right of reply and defence, indeed of correction of incorrect or out-of-date data is there?"
"That is the purpose of my amendments, on which our support for this report will depend."
"It is true, the European Union needs a supranational judicial structure to coordinate and enhance public action across the whole of European Union territory."
"The stakes are as high as they can be."
"That presupposes a willingness to implement a common crime policy which will go hand in hand with a minimum of national sovereignty being abandoned, whether the Member States want it or not."
"Eurojust is about giving Europol a real judicial partner."
"Its whole effectiveness will depend on the complementarity of the added value that the unit will be capable of bringing to the other players in the judicial and police worlds."
"So, what use is it to establish supranational structures?"
"Why ensure complex coordination between different countries to centralise an investigation if the judge in charge of the case does not have the resources to complete his investigation or secure conviction of the people charged?"
"To sum up, rather than having an endless epilogue on the possible powers of a real European party, surely it would be better to make a real decision on a structure which would distinguish itself by its rapidity, effectiveness, and availability to the citizens of Europe while giving them full guarantees."
"Mr President, the report considers that creating this overly centralised and authoritarian structure called Eurojust will give added value."
"This is an institution with public prosecutors and judges from the Member States with the widest independent powers to prosecute and conduct investigations into so-called 'serious cross-border crimes' , not that these crimes are described anywhere."
"It is an institution which will be able to circumvent national authorities in order to react instantly, which will be able to pluck a case from one Member State and give it - one wonders on the basis of what criteria - to another Member State."
"The right hand of Eurojust will be the Schengen system and Europol, which is promoted to the status of institutional partner."
"Provision is also made for the European judicial network to be maintained, while Eurojust will create its own database, that is, there will be four networks with sensitive personal data for the criminal records, four means of filing information on citizens and anyone who enters the portal of the authoritarian fortress called the European Union."
"The much-vaunted operational independence of the justice system, which civil democracy was so proud of, has been sidelined."
"Eurojust and the future European public prosecutor are the finishing touches to a suffocatingly centralised, unaccountable, nightmarish structure for each and every citizen and, more importantly, for the grass-roots movement."
"As we watch the European Union march towards unification, we note the trend towards full liberalisation of the market on the one hand, that is, the complete unaccountability of the monopolies in their quest for profit, and the authoritarian centralisation of institutions, the growing militarism of the European Union and suppression, on the other."
"The people of the European Union must reverse this march and they will."
"This is clear from events in my country, where the grass-roots movement and democratic powers in general have rallied and are resolutely opposing the new authoritarian and anti-democratic law on demonstrations which the government is currently trying to push through the Greek parliament."
"Madam President, for too long the European Union has had its hands tied when it comes to fighting organised crime."
"In approving the setting-up of Eurojust, I believe we would be adding a new weapon to take on Europe's criminal organisations."
"Organised crime in Europe has been at least ten steps ahead of us, taking advantage of weaknesses in our legal and economic systems."
"These criminals are experts in exploiting legal provisions and jurisdictions and they have taken full advantage of our open market."
"The European Union must no longer be a soft touch for serious crime."
"Traditional enforcement measures are no longer enough."
"National prevention measures must be complemented, where necessary, by appropriate action at Community level."
"This initiative specifies that it should include trafficking in human beings, and I wish to insist that this should also include the smuggling of illegal immigrants, prostitution rings and the sexual exploitation of children."
"In addition, we are talking about competence for dealing with acts of terrorism, protection of the euro, computer crime and protection of financial interests of the EU."
"It also extends to the laundering of proceeds of crime."
"Today in Brussels the EU Forum on Organised Crime is holding its first meeting."
"The Commission must keep us and the public informed of the results of such meetings."
"Let us make it a general rule that all relevant EU policies will incorporate a crime prevention element."
"Let us make it known that the EU programme against social exclusion can be matched by the crime prevention strategy."
"Let us make it known that the Regional Fund can contribute to the national programmes, supporting initiatives to fight and prevent crime."
"Let us make it known that the Community's cooperation and assistance policies and programmes already extensively incorporate the fight against crime."
"Let us ensure that all new legislation is crime-proof and existing legislation is evaluated."
"Our group will be supporting this report."
"Madam President, first I would like to congratulate you in that position, and assure you that, as usual, I will be speaking on behalf of the radical Members of the Technical Group of Independent Members."
"My friends and I have studied the issue of Eurojust in depth and frankly it deserves to be called 'Euro Saint-Just' instead, in view of the way this matter has come before us."
"I am told Saint-Just was a good lawyer too."
"Eurojust raises many questions, so I am glad Commissioner Vitorino is here."
"Nice clearly rejected the principle of an independent public prosecutor."
"The countries do not want it, for all sorts of reasons."
"A prosecution system cannot be developed without at the same time developing a defence system, a data protection system, and a rights guarantee system."
"A bureaucracy will be created which will try to ask governments for criminal proceedings, when criminal proceedings are reserved for the judiciary."
"The rules on that vary from one country to another."
"In our country criminal proceedings are obligatory, but that is not the case in others."
"These are complex matters which, in my opinion, are not going to be improved by this 'Euro Saint-Just' which seems to me to be a bit like holding the inquisition at European level, if we do not build a parallel system of control and legality."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, it makes me wonder when I think of the circumstances in which some countries have nominated their representatives - my country, for instance, which nominated Mr Caselli, in violation of rules laid down by the judiciary itself."
"It makes me wonder when my country sends you the procurator of Palermo, who brought charges against Mr Andreotti, Mr Muzotto and Mr Contrada, who has tried five cases on the basis of the revelations of penitents, and who lost five cases out of five - the people he charged were acquitted in court."
"I wonder where we will end up if these methods are exported to Europe."
"For pity' s sake, let us reject this 'Euro Saint-Just' ."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, international organised crime accounts for 10% of world trade, and a large proportion of it is in the European Union."
"If the statistics are correct, developments in the crime sector are extremely alarming because in the European Union 30% of crime is already classified as international organised crime."
"In the light of this trend we have to ask ourselves whether the border-free European Union is actually taking advantage of all the opportunities it has to take action against this organised crime."
"Where police cooperation is concerned we can say that substantial progress has been made."
"We have Europol, and Europol is working extremely successfully to fight crime."
"In the field of judicial cooperation, however, we must unfortunately note that here cooperation is still in its infancy."
"With Eurojust we now have a new instrument which will become operational in 2002 and will represent decisive progress in cooperation between the judicial authorities."
"In principle, then, Eurojust works like Europol."
"It coordinates the criminal prosecution authorities in the fight against organised crime."
"What we must hope is that cooperation with existing units, with the judicial network and with Europol, works and that duplicate investigations are avoided."
"I would congratulate the rapporteur."
"There is only one point on which I disagree with her."
"She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat."
"As an Austrian, who also knows that the enlargement of the European Union is at hand - and welcomes it - and that Vienna is moving closer to the heart of the European Union, I would make a counter-proposal and propose not Luxembourg but Vienna as the seat of this authority."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives adopted within the framework of the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice have made this major political objective of the Union one of the most dynamic vectors for the broadening and deepening of European integration."
"As regards the area of freedom, security and justice, the creation of a Eurojust unit in the field is certainly a most promising leap forward."
"Eurojust is facing and trying to find an answer to one of the most serious, pressing threats to the rule of law: transnational organised crime, which is estimated to be worth a frightening amount in the world economy and, of necessity, in the European economy too."
"The nation states have shown abundant signs that the legal mechanisms they have are insufficient to tackle organised crime in a satisfactory way."
"Here, then, the European Union will have exceptional scope for affirming the principle of subsidiarity, for Eurojust is the democracies' necessary, indispensable response to the scourge of organised crime. Such crime has accompanied the growing interdependence of economies and technological developments, exploiting the weaknesses in national legal systems which turn their backs on each other, impotent victims of an anachronistic pretension to self-sufficiency."
"Eurojust and the inevitable European public prosecution service of the future confirm that European integration is a necessity for citizenship, a tangible response to tangible problems affecting the ordinary citizen."
"It is on the success of all the concerted action at judicial and police level that the future confidence of societies in their democratic institutions will largely depend."
"Eurojust will help preserve the effectiveness and prestige of these institutions and will render a great service to the rule of law."
"Information, cooperation and joint coordination measures are the key to a new push forward in the fight against money laundering, the trafficking of human beings, environmental crimes, forgery and other serious offences."
"The proposed college is an innovative instrument essential to the pursuit of these objectives."
"However, for the rule of law to be strengthened as we would like with the creation of this important instrument of judicial cooperation, it is important that procedural guarantees, so important in domestic law, should also be worked into the operation of the Eurojust system so that the fundamental rights that these guarantees aim to preserve do not end up being diminished."
"In conclusion, I congratulate the rapporteur on the thoroughness and quality of her report and, in particular, on the sense of balance which inspired the proposed amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, a word of congratulation to Mrs Gebhardt on her excellent work and also to Mr von Boettcher, who was the PPE-DE shadow rapporteur."
"We are aware of the enormous proportions that organised and cross-border crime has reached, requiring swift, common and concerted action particularly in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, child pornography, the trafficking of people, forgery of the euro, computer crime and money laundering."
"On the subject of Eurojust, I have four things to say: first, we should be pleased to be making progress in this matter."
"When the European Parliament gave its opinion on the provisional unit in November last year, we made a clear recommendation that the creation of this unit should not be a pretext for undesirably delaying the setting-up of Eurojust."
"Secondly, we are taking one more step towards the creation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The Tampere decisions are moving ahead, making their way."
"Step by step, we are constructing a citizens' Europe, with the Commission scoreboard, respecting the role of Parliament and with an initiative shared between the Commission and the Member States. Commissioner António Vitorino knows full well, however, that we have found more to our taste in his initiative than we have at times in the Member States' initiative, as regards its coherence and comprehensive view."
"Thirdly, we are honouring the values of our civilisation, the principles of the rule of law: in Commissioner Vitorino' s fortunate expression, Eurojust is the judicial counterpart of Europol."
"Eurojust is to operate with appreciable independent status."
"Its annual report is to be placed not only before the Council but also before the Commission and Parliament."
"Fourthly and lastly, data protection."
"Parliament has already drawn attention to this issue: Eurojust will have to cooperate with Europol, with the European judicial network, with OLAF and with the Schengen information system, in addition to benefiting from crime information supplied by the Member States."
"It is particularly important to find a solution that is balanced between guaranteeing and safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms, on the one hand, and the instruments needed to fight crime on the other."
"It is also always worth emphasising, when talking about the Community institutions, that we must make every effort to avoid any duplication of tasks or conflict of competencies."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be extremely brief so as not to delay voting time."
"The Commission shares the overall view that Mrs Gebhardt presents regarding the Eurojust report and would like to congratulate her on the excellent job she has done."
"Above all, we stress the importance of finding suitable solutions for the relationship between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network, which has made a very important contribution to the development of judicial cooperation at European level, as well as defining the conditions under which the Commission itself and Europol can be associated with the work of Eurojust."
"At this stage, the Eurojust unit has no powers to take operational decisions or to promote investigations as such or to take cases to court."
"Obviously, however, the natural course of evolution for Eurojust will be to arrive at this higher stage of judicial cooperation."
"Hence the importance of the ideas set out by Mrs Gebhardt, which the Commission recognises, regarding guarantees of a defence for the accused, the rules on data protection and global issues of safeguarding citizens' fundamental rights."
"We all believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important guide in the adoption of these solutions."
"We agree with the suggestions made by Mrs Gebhardt, but there is just one point upon which I should like to express a reservation."
"One has to be very careful when defining the competence of Eurojust with regard to crime affecting the protection of the financial interests of the Communities."
"We feel it would be preferable to speak of competence in matters of economic and financial crime."
"One of the most sensitive questions is the relationship between Eurojust and OLAF. OLAF has competencies within the first pillar;"
"Eurojust falls within the specific intergovernmental context of the third pillar; therefore we feel it would be best to avoid giving the idea that Eurojust always has to be involved in cases where OLAF takes the initiative to safeguard the protection of the Community' s financial interests."
"Thus, we feel it is very important to specify their different scopes."
"Finally, Madam President, with regard to the imaginative and creative figure of speech used by Mr Dell' Alba, who called Eurojust 'Euro Saint Just' , I have to say that, for my part, I believe Eurojust is not an instrument of justice for saints: it is an instrument of justice for human beings."
"Aware of the difficulties, and even some risks, I say that, like any human endeavour, it is imperfect."
"It is not a holy office; on the contrary, it is a first step towards guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights and fighting crime at European level."
"Not perfect, but an essential first step."
"That is why I hope the House will support Mrs Gebhardt' s report."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a moment."
"Thank you very much Madam President."
"As you know, I was in the Chair yesterday when the Turkish demonstrators broke into the Chamber."
"It is not my intention in any way to delay the votes or to re-open the debate we had this morning, but I think it appropriate to place on record my thanks to the ushers for their very efficient and prompt handling of the situation."
"I think their professionalism in the situation deserves much credit."
"Thank you for that statement, Mr Martin, which we are very pleased to note."
"I ask for your permission to take up a minute of Parliament' s time to remind you that seven Portuguese citizens are still being held captive in the enclave of Cabinda, a territory situated to the north of Angola and incorporated into that African country."
"They are citizens who were working in Cabinda for Portuguese companies and were therefore totally uninvolved in the independence conflict which has been going on there for decades."
"Madam President, two of these hostages have been held for practically a year, I repeat, a year in captivity, and the other five for more than two months!"
"The little news that reaches us indicates that the Angolan authorities are currently placing enormous military pressure on the territory and, in a parallel move, recently ordered the expulsion of all foreign journalists."
"We therefore do not know what is happening there, and there is a total lack of impartial witnesses in the field. Naturally we fear for the safety or even the lives of the hostages."
"The seriousness of the matter led me to write to the Council myself recently, to ask Mr Javier Solana to intervene."
"He would certainly have the opportunity to create favourable conditions for our compatriots to be set free, the primary objective of this speech."
"As I asked in my letter, Madam President - I ask you to make every effort within your competencies and to exert all possible diplomatic pressure on the kidnappers and the Angolan authorities so as to create a situation in which the seven hostages can be set free."
"Mr Queiró, we have understood your message very well."
"For my part, I am going to see what I can do to throw light on that situation which is indeed absolutely tragic."
"However, it is 12.20 p.m. and we have an enormous amount of votes."
"All the same, we have certainly heard your message."
"VOTE"
"Madam President, I realised just now that this question, which was set aside by the vote in this House yesterday, pursuant to Rule 143, and removed from the agenda by a motion of inadmissibility, had been reintroduced pursuant to Rule 111(2)."
"Now Rule 111(2), explicitly states that the agenda can be altered by application of Rule 143, which has taken place, or on a proposal from the President, in other words you, Madam President. The word 'or' , however, clearly denotes, in law, an alternative."
"In other words, if the agenda was altered by application of Rule 143, it cannot be altered again, quite obviously, by a proposal from the President."
"That is the reason why I have the strongest reservations about the legality of the vote which is about to take place, with many Members prevented from taking part in the debate."
"I think the Court of Justice should rule on this matter and I have no doubt that once again, Madam President, it will, sadly, reveal your rather light approach to your responsibilities."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 12:"
"Madam President, I would ask, pursuant to Rule 130 Paragraph 3 of the Rules of Procedure, that of the three amendments on the table the committee's amendment be put to the vote first: a split vote has been requested here and I would ask that this request be taken into account."
"Please put Amendment No 12 to the vote first and then the others."
"After the vote on Amendment No 54:"
"Madam President, I should like to ask you to put Amendment No 63 to the vote first."
"It is a compromise amendment from the PSE, Liberal and Green Groups."
"A new situation has arisen."
"Now the parties are only required to be represented in a quarter of the Member States."
"It would be more logical to put this to the vote first and only then the Commission proposal."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 46:"
"Madam President, may I suggest to you that the adoption of Amendment No 46, does not mean Amendment No 47 falls."
"In my group' s view, it constitutes a wholly useful complement and is in no way opposed to the wording of Article 46."
"Madam President, I have checked the documents again and established that we already voted on the issue addressed in Amendment No 28 when we voted on Amendment No 7."
"For that reason this amendment is redundant."
"I would imagine that we will be able to discuss the quite specific problem which is the subject of this amendment with the Council at a later stage."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Thank you, Madam President, I just wanted to say, in accordance with the customs of this House and the recommendations of the Quaestors, that, in line with the legal position expressed just now, my colleagues and I would not be participating in the final vote of the Schleicher report."
"There, that was very simple, that was nothing much, and I will add just one small comment."
"Madam President, do not be afraid of us, do not be afraid to give us the floor, we will only take it to refer to the rules and conform to the customs of this House."
"All in all, we are not nearly as nasty as people say we are."
"Mr Gollnisch, I note that it is also an explanation of vote, really."
"So you are quite entitled to present it now."
"Thank you, Madam President, for giving me the floor after suggesting that the audience leave the Chamber."
"I want to make a comment, invoking the Rules, on the way you personally have been presiding over the sittings for two days now, on the Schleicher report, on the vote on Strasbourg yesterday, when you caught us on the hop as you very well know, and on the way you decide who to call, for example, refusing the floor just now to the excellent Mr Gollnisch."
"I challenge the way you carry out your role as President and I would inform you that we, I and some of my colleagues, will be sending you an open letter on the matter, for which we shall be ensuring wide publication in the French press."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"Fine, I do not think I need to respond to those remarks."
"I am delighted that you are planning a letter, and I shall make it a duty and a pleasure to answer it point by point, Mr Coûteaux, particularly about catching you on the hop for the vote yesterday."
"I think everyone can testify that the way that vote took place was perfectly objective."
"It is not my fault if you were not at the sitting at the time of the vote."
"I do apologise!"
"Mrs Doyle presented a procedural motion, and we waited some time."
"I can understand your being embarrassed, Mr Coûteaux."
"This is all rather stupid, really!"
"Of course I understand your embarrassment as a Frenchman, but that is not my business."
"I am the President of the European Parliament."
"I do entirely understand your embarrassment, Mr Coûteaux, believe me."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Figueiredo report (A5-0155/2001)"
"Madam President, the document by Mrs Figueiredo is very important."
"Combating and overcoming poverty in Europe is certainly a goal that nobody in the world has yet managed to achieve."
"Will Europe succeed?"
"I really hope so, for the sake of all the poor people in Europe, among whom there are unfortunately many pensioners."
"If we succeed, then it will be said that in Europe there are three fairy godmothers for the poorest citizens: the President of Parliament, Nicole Fontaine, who represents us all;"
"Mrs Ilda Figueiredo's report on the programme to combat social exclusion deserves our support."
"In fact, cooperation must be encouraged in order to make it possible for the European Union and the Member States to fight against social exclusion and to eradicate poverty - social realities still unfortunately deeply affecting some Member States, such as my own, Portugal - in accordance with qualitative and quantitative targets to be agreed by the Council and Parliament."
"The Commission is to provide Parliament and the Council with information on the progress made within this programme annually."
"Encouraging dialogue with our partners in this area at European, national and regional levels so as to combat poverty and social exclusion more effectively, and maximising financial support for innovative projects with a European added value are determining factors for its success."
"In order to give full practical effect to the programme, providing for field inspections, the involvement of those suffering from social exclusion and poverty and funding for operations carried out by NGOs, it is essential to raise the reference amount to 100 million euro, including technical and administrative expenditure."
"Core funding for key European networks involved in these actions should also be considered."
"The preparation of an annual Round Table Conference of the European Union on social exclusion, organised in close collaboration with the Presidency of the Council of the Union and in consultation with all the actors concerned, is another essential initiative."
"Finally, I should like to alert you to the insufficiency of the NGO financial control mechanisms, which will require closer supervision to ensure the strict and judicious application of public funds."
"The European Commission' s proposal, which is the subject of the report we have discussed today, aims to establish a programme of Community action to support and encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion."
"The aim of this programme is to encourage the Member States to combine their efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe in a framework of open coordination."
"To be more effective, this coordination must be based on national action plans to combat exclusion, with guidelines established at European level."
"The European Parliament examined this text at first reading in November last year under the French Presidency, which promoted a number of social affairs initiatives and was intent on making the fight against poverty a priority on the European social agenda."
"The Council' s common position fully or partially incorporates 25 of the 47 amendments adopted by Parliament during the sitting of 16 November 2000, while the Commission accepted 31 amendments."
"To my great regret, the Council has rejected some of the most important amendments."
"It has rejected the reference to the revised Social Charter (1996) of the Council of Europe, to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must now be added."
"It does not want to retain the 90% funding for the activities to be carried out by the NGOs under the programme to combat poverty and social exclusion, bearing in mind that the same level of support has already been approved for the programme to combat discrimination."
"The funding of the programme also represents a stumbling block."
"Believing that resources on a par with ambition are needed, the European Parliament hoped to increase the budgetary envelope from EUR 70 million to EUR 100 million, but in vain!"
"Just as questionable is the refusal to involve the European Parliament explicitly in the monitoring of the programme."
"I have naturally voted in favour of the amendments seeking to reinstate the provisions which were not endorsed by the Council and/or the Commission."
"Indeed, I think the programme ought to be as determined as possible."
"It should be an instrument for promoting equality of opportunity amongst all men and women, and send a strong political signal from the European Union."
"Just because our statistics for growth and employment are satisfactory overall, that is no reason to forget that far too many people still live on the margins of society."
"The main focus of this report relates to supporting greater cooperation between the fifteen Member States of the European Union to combat social exclusion."
"I believe it is very important that we all work together in a spirit of cooperation so as to ensure that the problems of social exclusion are solved within our community."
"In this regard I fully welcome the setting up of the new Social Protection Committee which is included as one of the changes within the Treaty of Nice."
"A Programme of Community Action to combat social exclusion must be fully supported."
"The European Union is economically strong, but there are still key social problems in many rural and urban areas."
"The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment is quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union."
"It is in fact concentrated in many specific blackspots."
"Putting in place initiatives to solve social exclusion and to give opportunities for the disadvantaged in our society must be a central policy of any government within the E.U."
"The principle underpinning this new Community Action Programme is to create an open method of coordination between the Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion."
"This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into National Action Plans and to implement policies to promote equal opportunities."
"The implementation of the Social Policy Action Programme 2000-2005 as published by the Commission will also help in combating social exclusion."
"Particular emphasis will be placed on setting up schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help early school leavers."
"There will also be continued national support for local job creation programmes under the principle of subsidiarity."
"There will also be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the Information Society, modern telecommunications services and Internet-related activities."
"We do not want to build a two-tier Europe, or a Europe of the haves and have nots."
"It is very important that education and training opportunities are given to those without skills."
"It is equally important to give retraining opportunities to those in the existing workplace."
"Partnership is the key at all times and consultation between all interested parties is very important if the problem of social exclusion is to be solved sooner rather than later."
"- My group is happy to support the Figueiredo report, and congratulates the rapporteur on her dedicated approach to the issue."
"We feel that the higher amount of funding proposed is essential if we are to be able to do serious work in tackling social exclusion and poverty."
"It is obvious that the current economic system is not delivering an adequate standard of living for many people within the EU, and before we push applicant countries in the same direction we have to know what we can do that is more effective in meeting people's needs."
"It is clear that we have a considerable number of working poor and people who will not be able to work at all, or work full-time and we need to see what can be done to ensure that they have an adequate income and other opportunities which allow them to participate in society."
"We cannot assume that work is the only activity that implies that you are a worthy citizen."
"Young people, those from minority ethnic groups, the elderly, people with disabilities, the homeless, the mentally ill and many others find themselves excluded in our societies in many different ways."
"Therefore, we support the rapporteur's view that there is a need for a wider body to evaluate the working of the action programme."
"We reject the view that only Member State governments should evaluate their own choices of research and other activities."
"They are not the poor and socially-excluded, so there is a role for civil society being involved in the evaluation to help ensure that the Commission and Member States are on the right lines in their approach and to provide greater transparency."
"Members of the European Parliament represent many of the poor and socially-excluded and also have valuable experience to bring to any evaluation."
"It is essential that we are given this opportunity."
"Ferber report (A5-0138/2001)"
"This, Madam President, is an adjustment of the budget for the systems and administrative organisation of the European security and defence policy."
"General White, an Englishman, of the future European rapid reaction force, meets Captain Rossi, an Italian."
"They are both veterans and pensioners of the future European force."
"'How are you?' asks the captain."
"'Fine, and you?' answers the general."
"'Not so good,' says the Italian."
"'Why?'"
"'Because my pension is too low,' says the Italian captain."
"'But no,' continues the Englishman, 'my pension is quite high, actually.'"
"'How much is it?"
"Oh, three times as much as mine!"
"But how come the pensions of generals who have served in the European reaction force are so different?"
"Let us remember to tell Mr Fatuzzo to bring up the fact that it would be good if pay and pensions in the future European army were the same for everyone.'"
"The Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget (SAB) 2/2001 presented by the Council aims to continue and to speed up the development of the common European security and defence policy (ESDP) by setting up three new directorates within the General Secretariat of the Council, recruiting 51 staff, paying daily allowances for military experts and purchasing telecommunications and data protection equipment."
"In this way, the ESDP management structures will be created, helping speed up the militarisation of the European Union, a process we reject and which is sufficient justification in itself for rejecting the current SAB and the Ferber report."
"Besides, Mr Ferber not only fails to question this process but he also 'welcomes the Council' s decision to launch with this SAB a new European defence policy' and also 'regrets that this policy is not more integrated in the first pillar' ."
"There are also, however, institutional and technical issues to examine."
"Firstly, the entering of this operating expenditure as administrative expenditure of the Council both confuses the nature of the expenditure and removes the possibility of democratic control over it, specifically by Parliament, which, in practice, is thus giving up its budgetary power."
"However, in addition to the issues of democracy and transparency, there is increased pressure on the ceiling for expenditure under heading 5 - administrative expenditure - at a time when the European Union is preparing for enlargement."
"The motion for rejection tabled by the Group of the Greens only deals with these last two issues but essentially accepts the position of the Ferber report, without commenting on the basic issues of the ESDP."
"We cannot, therefore, vote in favour of this rejection."
"Schleicher report (A5-0167/2001)"
"Madam President, the Pensioners' Party, represented by me in this House, has voted in favour of the statute and financing of European political parties."
"I am convinced, as Mr Maaten said in the report he described for us when he spoke on behalf of the Liberal Group, that Europe is also and most of all constructed through the European political parties."
"In my opinion, it would be appropriate if the European political parties took part in national elections, rather than having national political parties take part in European elections."
"Europe is being constructed by beginning to construct European centres for doing politics."
"As long as we have national parties, we will never have a Europe."
"I hope, therefore, that there will soon be a register for European elections, with at least ten per cent of us elected at a European level."
"Madam President, the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognise the importance of and need for political parties at European level in order to promote integration."
"I think, however, that the requirement to have representation in at least five Member States, that is in 33% of them, in order to obtain funding, is excessively restrictive and gives the impression of wanting to close the doors to new ideas and new ways of understanding politics."
"What would happen if, within a Member State, a party were required to obtain parliamentary representation in 33% of the constituencies in order to be considered an established party with the right to a presence and to public resources and funding?"
"Firstly, many of the parties from Federal States and regions could not get into the State parliaments, and we would therefore have less democracy, less integration and less Europe."
"The same applies to European parties."
"If we want to promote integration and the shaping of the broadest political awareness and will, we have to decrease this limit and immediately make representation in three Member States sufficient to be considered a European party."
"Moreover, the small parties of today could be the big parties of tomorrow."
"We should not close the doors on the future."
"Through this vote the large parties have tried to snatch the contributors' money to finance themselves."
"We are not, in principle, against the public financing of parties; but we are against this form of discrimination based on two factors: numbers and territory."
"In fact, this measure excludes the parties that support territorial identities, even if they are sizeable."
"A party could even represent 80% in its own country, but if it does not have European connections it will be excluded."
"It would be like saying that, in Italy, for instance, the Südtiroler Volkspartei or the Union Valdôtaine should not have access to public funds."
"It is a profoundly unfair measure, and that is why we have voted against it."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you for your skilful and impartial management of the sittings."
"My remarks concern Mr Schleicher' s report on the financing of European political parties."
"It states that parties' own funding amounts to just 25%, and, thus, 75% is from subsidies, which is why I did not think the support of companies was necessary."
"We have to accomplish things through being active and, furthermore, support must be obtained from members."
"For this reason I voted against donations by companies."
"In any case I think that the excessive use of money has started to distort elections, an excellent example of which is the Italian elections."
"It might distort elections in the future too, and for that reason a limit must be found to the use of money in elections."
"Madam President, the Schleicher report takes us down the road not just of corruption but of institutionalised corruption."
"The big parties, the departing parties, the establishment parties will have the oligopoly, if not the monopoly, of funding for their electoral campaigns and propaganda."
"Of course, they will deprive those not large enough of that funding."
"Few speakers, however, have noted that it will not be enough to be a party with a European base - which is already questionable, as my colleague Mr Speroni has mentioned - it must be more than European, it must be pro-Europe."
"As Amendment No 2 to recital 2 states, fundamental rights must be respected, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"What about those who would challenge the Treaties?"
"What about those who will be challenging the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"They are pariahs, vermin, scum."
"They will be deprived of financing."
"They will be prosecuted."
"As in Belgium, they will be placed under police surveillance."
"They will be dragged before the courts."
"Today' s totalitarian system is no longer behind any iron curtain."
"As I explained in the main debate, there is no legal basis for the Commission' s proposal on the statute and financing of European political parties or the Schleicher report supporting it."
"The obstinacy of the main federalist groups in pursuing their adoption come what may shows exactly how far the law is respected in the Europe they are building."
"The same can be said of the French government which, in its note of 9 May, sees no difficulty about using Article 308 in such a case."
"In terms of content, the proposed text turns the logical progress of a free society on its head."
"At national level political parties are created by the citizens and nurtured by their participation. They may eventually be granted public finance by law, but only later on."
"With this new text, the reverse would happen at European level: public finance from the Community budget would be intended to make European political parties - which do not exist today, or not with any real substance - 'emerge' ."
"The perversion, however, does not end there."
"Next, these artificial creations will be used as evidence of the existence of a so-called 'European political scene' , which will itself be produced as proof that 'European democracy' is working well."
"And this largely invented 'European democracy' will in turn serve to justify the removal of powers from the national democracies, the only truly genuine ones."
"This anti-democratic machine for despoiling the peoples is operating at full speed, activated in this case by the lure of gain, since the ectoplasms currently entitled 'European political parties' , supported by their friends in the European Parliament, are waiting impatiently for the time when they can feed on public funds."
"Added to these basic reasons for our opposition are many others relating to the irregularity of the text presented, because it gives a 'statute' to political parties which ought to remain free, because it is biased in favour of the partisans of supranationality, because it establishes a real political law, and because it institutes indefensible discrimination to the detriment of national parties acting directly at European level."
"Texts like these show how badly France needs a means of checking that acts derived from Community legislation are constitutional."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mrs Schleicher' s report on the statute and financing of European political parties."
"The Treaty contains provisions concerning the political parties."
"The most important purpose of this statute is to create openness and transparency in the financing of the European political parties."
"The European Parliament' s amendment is a substantial tightening up of the Commission' s proposal, which we can fully support."
"An important point are the demands that European parties be representative."
"We are of the view that the demands must not be so tough that it is only the major parties that are covered by the rules."
"It is important to recognise that smaller parties too contribute substantially to European democracy, especially in connection with enlargement."
"- (DA) We have voted against the report for two basic reasons."
"The first reason concerns the content of the report."
"It is contrary to democratic principles to favour larger political groupings over smaller groupings."
"The idea is unequivocally to give the largest political groups in the European Parliament a financial advantage, without its being in any way apparent that they represent people in the different countries better than the smaller groups."
"The second reason concerns the legal uncertainty and lack of basis in the Treaties, together with the President' s completely unacceptable reintroduction of the proposal, even though it was agreed to throw out the reading in accordance with Article 143 of the Rules of Procedure."
"It is well known that we are against the creation of 'European political parties' or other forms of organisation with supranational characteristics, since going down this path clearly means one more step towards a strengthening of the federalist orientation of the European Union and foreshadows predictable measures to this end."
"Although this European parties' initiative is presented as a way of getting round the criticism from the Court of Auditors regarding the financing of political groups in the European Parliament, it has really been imposed by the dominant forces in the European Union without there being any real support for the creation of such 'European parties' , since the Treaty of Nice has not yet even been ratified by any national parliament in a Member State."
"Lastly, mention must also be made of our disagreement in principle with countless points included in the current proposal, specifically the criteria for their formation and funding possibilities."
"All over Europe the funding of political parties is tainted by sleaze which is bad for democratic politics."
"For that reason I believe that European funding for European-wide political activity, be it for or against the European Union, should be considered seriously, so long as that activity remains within the accepted parameters of Western values."
"Nonetheless I have serious reservations about some of the detailed proposals in the Report, as well as considering it not to have a proper legal base."
". (EL) The Nice Treaty, which makes provision for a method to fund European political parties, has not yet been ratified by the Member States and therefore entered into force, and yet the Council and the parliamentary committee responsible have rushed to put a report on the statute and funding of European political parties to the vote in plenary."
"The pretext for the hurry is the EU's alleged concern at the increasingly poor turnout at elections."
"There is not a grain of truth in this argument, as is clear from the huge turnout at the recent elections in Italy and all the relevant studies, which talk of the disappointment and apathy of voters (due to the contradiction between what the bourgeois parties do and say) as regards the machinations going on in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"This alienation will increase even more when European parties with even looser ties to their voters are set up."
"Mainly using economic incentives as bait, legislation is being passed on what are, to all intents and purposes, binding rules governing the constitution and modus operandi of European parties."
"These strict binding rules concern both their statute and the electoral power which parties must have in order to qualify as 'European' and obtain the relevant funding."
"These parties must have clear European objectives, such as European integration, even if they appear to take the opposite approach."
"The word 'appear' is highly suspicious."
"Will a party such as the Communist Party of Greece, which not only appears but is, in fact, clearly opposed to European integration be approved?"
"Further on it says that a political party cannot qualify as European if it preaches intransigence."
"In other words, is it prohibited to preach intransigence against fascism or, more importantly, against class enemies and the exploitation of the working classes?"
"As far as electoral power is concerned, the proposal is that the party must either have elected representatives in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments in at least 5 Member States (either in one third of the Member States or in one quarter according to today's resolution) or must have gained at least 5% in at least 5 Member States at the last European elections (either in one third or in one quarter of the Member States)."
"This is direct interference in the electoral system of each country, because higher electoral quotas are being introduced which, in practice, will exclude the voices opposed to the so-called 'European ideal' , that is, the imperialist nature of the ÅU."
"Finally, provision is made for contributions to be published for the sake of transparency."
"However, as there is no limit on contributions, we must assume that even the names of the members and friends of a party who pay a subscription will be recorded."
"The report considers the ban on donations to a party by public corporations to be something of an achievement in the transparency stakes."
"Woe betide that it should say the opposite!"
"However, the problem lies in donations from the highly powerful private sector, on which it remains as quiet as the grave."
"The attempt here to introduce compulsory European parties is tantamount to serious interference in the political system of each country, the aim being to weaken the role of the national parties, especially those which oppose the ÅU."
"The parties are institutions set up to express the free will of their members, as regards both their programmes and their modus operandi."
"By setting up European political parties as described above, they are trying to get the people to accept the imperialist integration of the EU as a one-way street, as destiny and as the only course available, to hit out at and - if they can - exclude any dissenting voices from the European Parliament and to distance the workers even more from the centres which take the decisions which directly affect them."
". (NL) Parties should be organisations ruled from the bottom up, not from the top down."
"Real parties do not come into being because the structures of a state have a need for organising a competitive battle during elections, but because there are groups of people who share the same ideas, interests and activities."
"However, those in favour of a European multicultural state have discovered that there is no European public opinion."
"Artificially, from the top down, they now want to put forward leaders and structures which attempt to create an opinion of that kind."
"Four cooperatives of more or less like-minded parties in different Member States have now combined into a European party, and they support that party to some extent with funds from their common groups in this Parliament."
"In my view, this proposal is mainly a tool for legalising this unprofessional conduct."
"The doling out of tax money to parties, as well as the imposing of rules on parties by the government adds to the mistrust on the part of the citizens against what they see as a political elite."
"A centralistically organised European party could well create a situation where, within a joint political movement, member involvement, party democracy and the priorities which differ from Member State to Member State are being compromised."
"Although I welcome the fact that this proposal does not discriminate on the basis of their political persuasion and their scale, and that gifts from businesses are prohibited, I will be voting against it."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the proposal to lay down clear and transparent guidelines for the operation of European political parties and to regulate their finances."
"European political parties already exist and obtain public funds via their political groups in the European Parliament."
"It is therefore important that we regulate on this."
"The new rules would make the system more visible, more open, more transparent and above that fairer."
"Democracy requires parties to provide choice to the electorate and to articulate the views of voters."
"At European level, they remind us that, on most policy issues our differences of view are not between Member States but between different philosophies and political viewpoints that exist within all Member States."
"I have voted against the report for the following reasons: Article 308 of the Treaty does not provide the legal basis for giving the European Parliament the right to deal with the matter at this time."
"The statutes have the effect of being democratically and financially exclusive and also appear to be discriminatory in as much as high thresholds are introduced for determining whether a party is to be counted as a European party."
"Thus, they do not safeguard justice for minorities and the protection of the latter."
"There is also an obvious danger, along the lines of American policy, in companies being granted the right to provide financial subsidy to what have been approved as European political parties."
"Not until the end of 2001 at the earliest will all 15 Member States' parliaments and governments have ratified the Treaty of Nice."
"Only then will it be possible for the issue of the financing of European political parties to be dealt with in detail by the European Parliament."
"Today' s decision is premature."
"The EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg will examine and ascertain whether Article 308 of the Treaty really can be invoked as a legal basis."
"It is my conviction that today' s decision will then be declared as being contrary to the Treaty and thus repealed."
"Article 308 reads: 'If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures.'"
"The European Parliament believes that, to be eligible for subsidy at European level, financed by taxation, a party association must have obtained at least five per cent of the vote in at least a third of the Member States or be represented in the European Parliament or national or regional parliaments in a third of the Member States."
"The Commission does not want a relative number, but a fixed number, of Member States (five, irrespective of the size of the EU)."
"The European Parliament has made the democratic threshold remarkably high, too high in fact."
"Large groups of citizens, with representatives in the European Parliament, may be excluded from this financing of parties at European level through taxation."
"The wording in Article 3 concerning the approach to European political associations and national parties bears witness to a view of the future which I cannot in any way share: 'the party or its national components' ."
"In this way, the European Parliament has, then, established the national political parties as future 'national components' or types of district organisation of what are being called European political parties and which taxpayers around Europe are expected to subsidise."
"Developed as it was by pioneers with a strong spirit of self-sacrifice, perseverance and faith in the fundamental importance to society of the Christian ethic and view of human beings and of the family, Sweden' s Christian Democratic Party, led by Birger Ekstedt at the beginning of 1964 and by Alf Svensson from 1973, is far too significant and important in terms of democracy to be described as 'a national component' ."
"The debates arising from examination of the Schleicher report in this part-session reveal extremely disturbing anti-democratic trends within the Community institutions and particularly within this Parliament."
"Democracy means, first and foremost, respect for the law."
"Everyone knows perfectly well, even those who claim the contrary, that this plan for financing European political parties has no legal base."
"Article 191, as Mr Berthu has shown, cannot be used as a base for implementing Article 308."
"Court of Justice case law on this point is as clear as day."
"There is no Community competence."
"The majority of this Parliament, however, like the Commission, pretends not to know that, because there is so very much at stake for the federalist parties and the federalist ideology."
"What all this is really about is, on the one hand, the cash flow of several large parties whose members' subscriptions no longer suffice to maintain their bureaucracies, and which are tightly confined by strict national anti-corruption provisions, and, on the other, the creation of a new instrument of forced federalisation which will limit the peoples' freedom of choice."
"Next, democracy means transparency."
"There is a danger that the system of financing for supranational European parties proposed by the Commission and the Schleicher report will constitute an exceptional channel for corruption and in particular for money laundering, since companies can make unlimited donations and the conditions for accepting donations from individuals are extremely lax."
"European financing would therefore make it possible to by-pass and thwart national efforts to clean up the funding of political parties and apply strict conditions to make it transparent."
"Democracy is also respect for minorities."
"It is extremely disturbing that the debate on the Schleicher report, after being declared inadmissible by Parliament, was forcibly restored to the agenda this morning by an arrogant majority with minimal concern for respecting the law, as shown by Mr Barón Crespo' s alarming description of the minority in this Parliament as a 'commando' ."
"The majority of a Parliament that prides itself on teaching the whole world to respect minority rights would do well to start by respecting the minority within it."
". (NL) It is important for a democratic Europe to have European parties."
"They offer the citizen the opportunity to vote for a party directly."
"The elections, with European lists and people heading the list of candidates, should serve as a basis for making up the European Commission."
"In order to form major European parties, a sound legal basis is required."
"In this connection, it is important to establish transparent financial criteria and guarantee the independence of politicians and political parties."
"We cannot be bought."
"It is impossible to accept money from public companies or industry, however small the amounts involved are."
"We are at the service of the citizen who has elected us."
"Brussels is an attractive base for industry to lobby from."
"Lobbyists often perform the useful task of informing us."
"However, given the sometimes conflicting interests between the European Parliament and, for example, the pharmaceutical industry (the price of AIDS medicines) or the car industry (environmental standards), we cannot possibly accept donations from them."
"As we are currently in the development stage of European parties, we might as well get it right from the outset by creating one European standard."
"I would call on the Greens, the Liberals and the Christian-Democrats to support this standard."
"Jové Peres report (A5-0137/2001)"
"It is almost time for lunch, Madam President."
"Can you not smell the olive oil on the Neapolitan mozzarella, on the tomatoes from southern Italy, with a little parmesan and a good glass of red wine or beer?"
"It is the Mediterranean diet which makes Italians live so long and makes them remain pensioners for so long too, although much to the regret of the finances and the treasury ministers of several governments."
"Therefore, with this picture in mind, could I, Madam President, vote against a measure to increase the production of oil and regulate it so that we can always have olive oil in Europe?"
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Parliament' s report on the olive oil scheme."
"The report does not acknowledge that there has been extensive fraud involving the aid scheme for olive oil, and it is dismissive of the Commission' s proposed changes in the aid."
"At the moment, the EU provides aid per ton of olive oil."
"This form of aid requires the monitoring of actual production."
"Such monitoring has not operated at all satisfactorily."
"The Member States have not been anything like good enough at doing the monitoring."
"The Commission is proposing in the longer term to introduce aid-per-tree instead of per ton of olive oil."
"Such a form of aid requires the introduction of what is called a Geographical Information System so that the producers' cultivation declarations can be monitored with the help of aerial photographs."
"The Commission proposes extending the present system by 2 years until such a system is in place."
"We support the Commission' s proposal and hope that the whole sector can be reformed, together with the rest of agricultural policy, during the Danish Presidency in 2 years' time."
"The amendments proposed by the rapporteur of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are an improvement on the Commission's proposal, although they too fail to break away from the thinking behind the Regulation or address the basic worries of olive producers and the olive oil market, such as the abolition of intervention, the unaccountability and profiteering of the industry and the multinationals, the low quotas and the extortionate coresponsibility levies, that is, the disastrous consequences of Regulation No 1638/98, which have caused the olive oil market to collapse, prices to hit rock bottom and incomes to evaporate for olive producers, all of whom are small or medium-sized farmers in barren and island regions."
"The Commission deliberately and wittingly overlooks these consequences and does not even brook the idea of repeating intervention so as to secure a minimum wage for olive producers. It has not proposed any increase in quotas so as to at least cover existing production, preferring instead to focus on the quality of olive oil, as if the healthiest and most suitable product for consumers' health has been totally unsuitable in the past."
"The Commission's alleged interest in the quality of olive oil is misleading and hypocritical."
"If it is so interested in quality, why does it allow olive oil mixed with different seed oils to be marketed? Because that way large quantities of seed oil are sold, which have nothing in common with the nutritional value of olive oil and because that way the industry and the multinationals make more profit."
"What makes the Commission's deliberate undermining and blatant hypocrisy obvious is that it examines the application of measures, such as the subsidy per tree, with total indifference as to the disastrous consequences which this will have on the olive groves themselves, the quality of the product and the employment and income of the producers."
"And all this at a time when the Commission is arranging for mixing, that is, the adulteration of olive oil, to be legalised, is working to abolish the transportation and marketing of olive oil in cans of more than 5 litres on the pretext of avoiding adulteration, as if olive oil in cans of less than 5 litres cannot be adulterated."
"In other words, this measure is not intended to improve quality but to allow the industry and the multinationals to monopolise the marketing and transportation of olive oil."
"We need changes to the common organisation in the market in olive oil and for what is a catastrophic situation for olive producers to be reversed, not a few isolated interventions in secondary issues."
"Unfortunately, the Commission is able to cover up its unacceptable action with the collusion of the Greek government."
"Gebhardt report (A5-0153/2001)"
"Madam President, It was a deplorable feature of the document to which Mrs Gebhardt's report responded that, as I said in the explanatory statement, Parliament commented in detail on the protection of individual rights, which did not feature at all in the Council text."
"It seems to me that every step that we take and justifiably take in this direction must be, at the same time, one which recognises in the highest degree protection of the rights of the defence and of the rights of persons accused of crime in all parts of the Union."
"This should not become a way of achieving a lowest common factor of protection."
"It must be the case that at all points people involved in criminal processes achieve the highest level of respect for their rights of defence."
"May I remark that the provision on national representatives allows for substitutes?"
"I hope that the United Kingdom in appointing persons will take note of the fact there are two distinct systems of criminal justice in the UK."
"Madam President, yesterday evening at the asparagus festival - which I attended and for which I thank the Mayor of Strasbourg for having invited us and you, Madam President, for having agreed and coordinated this important annual event of friendship - I found I was sharing a table with a retired judge."
"Naturally, between one stick of asparagus and another, we chatted about various things and I did not let the opportunity slip of asking him for information on the significance of this report by Mrs Gebhardt, if, that is, it was a good thing to have Eurojust."
"His answer was unequivocal: 'It is an important document."
"Europe should proceed towards a European justice system, towards European cooperation, while looking forward to a European code.'"
"I followed his suggestion and therefore I voted in favour."
"The Eurojust judicial cooperation unit, as presented today following an initiative by a number of Member States, is intended to ensure good liaison between the national authorities responsible for criminal prosecutions in cases of cross-border crime."
"This cooperation excludes any action by an authority against Member States, and any desire to integrate national judicial systems."
"Its purpose is to make all the various legal players work better together, and its context is clearly intergovernmental."
"We approve of this approach, because it is the most realistic."
"There is no dream of any general merging of national legal systems - an impossible dream, which would only delay practical solutions - but, on the contrary, a determination to work from the basis of the existing judicial networks, by removing technical obstacles which might hinder fluid relations between them."
"For once a report by Parliament appears to rally to a realistic approach, and does not reject an initiative out of hand, as it has tended to do recently, under the pretext that it has come from the Member States and not the Commission."
"The report does not make the customary demand for a supranational European public prosecutor, a unified body of law, or indeed federal criminal courts."
"For once it seems to accept the intergovernmental approach as the most viable, and we can only rejoice at that."
"This apparent moderation, however, conceals several traps."
"First, the amendments proposed by the European Parliament seek to strengthen centralisation around the Eurojust unit, notably by seeking to eliminate the national correspondents, thus surreptitiously renouncing the 'network' idea, on which the system is supposed to be based."
"And above all, these amendments totally undermine the intergovernmental spirit, transforming the applications for investigations or prosecutions issued by Eurojust into decisions binding on the Member States, and eliminating their whole margin of manoeuvre in applying the law in their own territory."
"As we see it, this surreptitious transformation of the original text is utterly unacceptable."
"Obviously we must subscribe to a policy of strengthening the fight against all forms of corruption, both national and European."
"Nor have we ever stopped saying so, especially since the Schengen Agreement eliminated Member States' border controls."
"All these serious issues, which affect the actual exercise of justice, public freedoms and public order, can only fall within the competence of the Member States."
"It should be remembered that justice is a right bestowed and organised by national governments."
"With all kinds of organised and cross-border crime on the increase, however, with growing insecurity and violence, intergovernmental cooperation between Member States' police forces and judiciaries is desirable."
"Lo and behold, though, Europe is trying to impose communitisation of our judicial system and our internal public order on the pretext of this cooperation, notably by creating a European public prosecutor' s office."
"The Nice Council of December 2000 adjudged this latter measure a danger to respect for individual' s rights and democracy, and rightly rejected the creation of this supranational public prosecutor."
"The European Parliament is once again treating the deep feelings of the Member States with disdain."
"Following the old custom of coming through the back door in disguise after leaving through the front, it is actually trying, with the help of Mrs Guigou, French Minister of Justice at the time, to make Eurojust an embryo European public prosecutor' s office."
"A single prosecution service, independent of the Member States could therefore, at its convenience, decide to arrest, prosecute or extradite suspects, without any recourse to the judiciaries of the Member States concerned."
"Is this progress in common security?"
"No, more like another step towards confusion of powers."
"Situation in the Middle East (RC B5-0344/2001)"
"Madam President, this is a very serious and important argument."
"As you know, the Pensioners' Party - like all parties, in fact - is for peace and is aware of the difficulties in achieving this peace in the Middle East."
"You know that all over the world there are divisions between groups of people as a result of their race, their ethnicity, their origins and also as a result of the place where they have lived for so many years."
"The Pensioners' Party believes that these should not be the reasons that make us do things."
"We must strive in this life for all of us - all the citizens of the world - to become better than we are now: we must argue over how to achieve this result but not over ethnic divisions, which may exist but which must not lead to war."
"The dramatic events in Palestine over recent months, the heroic intifada of the Palestinian people and barbaric suppression by Israel have forced the European Parliament to adopt a resolution highlighting the responsibility of the state of Israel."
"The joint resolution on the Middle East, as it now stands, recognises what has become an unbearable situation for the Palestinians in the occupied areas, who are being made to suffer unbearable and unfair collective punishment."
"It condemns the illegal incursions by the Israeli army, the extrajudicial executions, the complete blockade of the occupied territories and the extension of the settlements there."
"It makes special mention of Israel's practice of marketing products from the settlements in the occupied territories as produce of Israel, so that it qualifies for Community preferences, and it calls for measures to be taken."
"It considers that the disproportionate use of violence by the Israeli army and collective punishment are incompatible with the principles of the Association Agreement between the ÅU and Israel."
"It calls for all settlement procedures to be frozen, including the natural increase in the population and it calls on the Member States to propose that the UN Security Council send observers and take a stand in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state."
"However, on certain points, the resolution resorts to a policy of equal treatment which puts the sacrificer and the sacrificed on the same footing, it talks of terrorist attacks by the Palestinians, it urges all the interested parties to put an end to the violence and it calls on the Palestinian Authority to make every effort to combat the terrorism, limit the violence and control the terrorists."
"Despite these shortcomings, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece supported the resolution, together with 57% of the MEPs present, because this is the first time a European Parliament resolution has highlighted the responsibility and condemned the practices of Israel."
"The situation of Palestine is extremely serious due to the occupation of its land by Israel and the brutal repression of its people by the Israeli army."
"Since 29 September 2000, the date of Ariel Sharon' s provocative act in the Mosque compound (Haram al-Sharif), the Israeli army of occupation has already caused hundreds of deaths, mostly children and adolescents, injured tens of thousands and arrested hundreds of Palestinians who are fighting to make their right to a have a State a reality."
"In the escalating aggression, Israel destroys Palestinian houses, continues its policy of occupation and the illegal building of settlements, restricts the free movement of Palestinian communities, drops bombs, sets up road blocks, does not fulfil financial commitments or signed agreements, carries out selective assassinations, invades territories under the administration of the Palestinian authority and attacks Syrian forces in Lebanon, attracting the strongest condemnation."
"As we all know, Israel has occupied Palestinian territories since 1947. Since 1967, it has occupied Gaza and the West Bank, forcing thousands of Palestinians to live outside their country, a situation which is condemned by the UN and only maintained through the support of the USA and with at least the connivance of the EU."
"Peace will only be possible when the UN resolutions are fully implemented and the Israeli aggression comes to an end. This means that we should support all serious initiatives so that the Palestinian people can secure their own independent, sovereign state."
"It is time for sanctions against Israel, Mrs Lindh."
"In today' s edition of the French newspaper, Libération (16 May 2001), one of Israel' s best known pacifists, the writer David Grossman, observes that, if one does not believe in miracles and does not approve of catastrophes, there is only one way to change the situation in the Middle East, namely through 'international pressure' ."
"He also states that it is Israel, the occupying power, which is mainly responsible and therefore in greatest need of external pressure."
"Because the United States never does anything that Israel does not like, there is an important international role waiting to be fulfilled in this area."
"The EU has for a long time been the biggest provider of economic and administrative aid and the most important supporter of the Palestinian Authority."
"EU politicians have complained that the EU does not play a corresponding political role."
"Why, then, not take up the gauntlet and do what the United States does not want to do and what both Palestinians and Israeli pacifists are pleading should be done, that is to say bring specific pressure to bear upon Israel?"
"Formal bases in international law for economic sanctions against Israel are to be found in the shape of those infringements of Israel' s Association Agreement with the EU, demonstrated by the Commission with reference to the fact that goods from unlawful Israeli settlements on occupied land are being sold to the EU with 'Israel' cited as the country of origin."
"If, now, it really is the case that the EU' s new rapid reaction force does not exist at all to protect the EU' s interests as a superpower but, in fact - and as Mrs Lindh usually maintains - is there simply to be unselfish about making peace in the world, why not propose that it be deployed in the Middle East along the only lawful dividing line between Israel and Palestine, namely the 1967 frontier?"
"Unfortunately, nothing of this was heard when Mrs Lindh presented the EU' s Middle East policy before the European Parliament today."
"There were a whole lot of words, but absolutely nothing concrete and nothing which could in any way put an end to the bloodbath and to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine."
"The matter is made that much the more tragic by the fact that Sweden' s own voice on the subject of Palestine has gone completely silent."
"The work of the former Foreign Minister, Mr Andersson, is being carried on not by Mrs Lindh but by her Danish colleague, Mr Lycketoft, who now talks in no uncertain terms about Israel' s violation of human rights and of international law."
"Both in her capacity as EU President and as Swedish Foreign Minister, Mrs Lindh appears, rather, to have capitulated before those forces which do not dare to stand up to Israel and the United States."
"That is deplorable."
"It is the extremist and terrorist violence which is holding back the peace process."
"It is the attacks that then provoke reactions from the Israeli state, which responds with measures that are perhaps disproportionate compared with the attacks that caused them."
"Where violence rules, however, it is difficult to classify it according to a scale of values and condemn only those who use it to defend themselves. I feel uncomfortable in approving the so-called compromise resolution."
"I find too many condemnations of Israel in it. It is not a resolution that expresses an equal distance from the parties in question."
"It is a document that upholds the rationale of just one side and belies the good will demonstrated on many occasions by the Israeli leaders."
"Besides, it is easy to see that whenever the peace process was about to resume, the terrorist extremists went into action."
"And Europe never spoke up at times like that."
"The 'principle of reciprocity' on which agreement was reached in Oslo in 1993 must be safeguarded."
"Dialogue, mutual understanding, condemnation of violence are elements characterised by an action that favours resumption of the process."
"Europe, and primarily our institutions, must not assume the role of judge but rather that of a credible and authoritative interlocutor, if it wants to contribute effectively to the peace process."
"Trust and respect for the legitimate aspirations of both sides should be expressed in a balanced way in the text we are discussing, but I do not find in it the balance I would like to see."
"State of the Transatlantic dialogue (RC B5-0342/2001 and RC B5-0345/2001)"
"Madam President, like, I am sure, many of us Members of the European Parliament, I consider the citizens of the other side of the Atlantic, in America, the citizens of all the Americas, to be our friends and my friends."
"I myself, as you know, have often stepped onto the soil of the United States, even if only on Saturdays, when I left the cruise ship the Oceanic, on which I had embarked as a crew member."
"I experienced the warmth, the enthusiasm, the creativity and the intelligence of the American citizens."
"I hope, therefore, that this collaboration will continue, and will continue also between American pensioners and European pensioners, so that a way can be found for all of us to live better."
"The transatlantic agenda reveals the special interest that exists in an in-depth agreement between the USA and the European Union on the major world economic issues, as is particularly evident in relation to monetarist and neo-liberal policies, policies of centralisation and concentration of wealth and exploitation of workers and peoples, showing greater concern for issues of interest to economic groups and multinationals and neglecting social issues, including health and education, the environment, development and cultural diversity."
"An identical situation occurs in relation to so-called security and defence issues and the policy of interference in the internal affairs of peoples, examples of which are cooperation within NATO and the adoption of the new strategic concept, as, moreover, was made quite clear in the war against Yugoslavia."
"Currently, however, the pretensions of North American imperialism for world hegemony and domination and construction of a 'new order' to suit US interests - dismantling the legal and institutional order resulting from the second world war, tackling the UN Charter and international law and rejecting protocols like the Kyoto Protocol, taking on a more aggressive character with the new Bush administration - all this is making the world situation deteriorate."
"It was in this context, then, that I supported the resolution that our Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left subscribed to on the state of the transatlantic dialogue and I voted against the rest."
"Cercas report (A5-0147/2001)"
"Madam President, on this document regarding safe and sustainable pensions I could not fail to give an explanation of vote."
"I voted for it, but I should like to draw everyone' s attention to the fact that the Pensioners' Party is asking for a European pension."
"The pensions problem can only be solved when the European Union has the competence to decide on pensions too."
"The Pensioners' Party is asking that social security, which is financed out of our wages, out of workers' pay, should be voluntary and not compulsory."
"The Member States have shown that they cannot administer our money: therefore we should have the right to administer our own wages in order to have our pensions, freely and without being forced to give money to the state."
". (NL) The Cercas report has not received our backing for the following reasons."
"First of all, the report turns social security into a Community issue in terms of policy development and policy measures."
"In doing so, the report imposes a certain vision: the pursuit of social convergence."
"Consequently, Member States are afforded little scope for creating their own solutions."
"It is precisely the diversity of systems that requires every Member State to use its own tailored approach."
"Many large Member States still need to restructure their provisions for old age in the light of the ageing population."
"The supra-national aspects affect the pre-conditions, such as the budgetary implications and the requirement that saving for a pension in one Member State should not hinder mobility to another Member State."
"We have more than enough to deal with."
"If the reforms are to be accompanied by coordination efforts for a European social security system, this will seriously hamper the reforms, and will stand in the way of an effective solution."
"It should be noted in this connection that the enlargement is already taking up a considerable amount of the limited resources."
"As such, the report is not in touch with reality."
"Pensions will thus become unsafe, untenable and unaffordable."
"Indeed, no one wants to be worse off, and the system which offers most facilities should be taken as the guiding principle."
"The document by the European Commission, on the other hand, gives a clear analysis of the issue."
"The Commission document has a much more targeted approach."
"The report is thus no improvement on the Commission document."
"This is why we have decided against giving our support to this report, which is only detracting from the sound approach in the Commission communication."
". (DE) We take the current and future problems of pensions policy and social change very seriously."
"The Commission communication and the report by Mr Cercas undoubtedly contain important and positive proposals."
"The calls for better social protection for women are a case in point."
"However, as regards the basic problem - defending and renewing social protection systems based on solidarity - the report conflicts with the fundamental positions held by our group."
"We therefore cannot vote for the report."
"The general emphasis on solidarity is clearly at odds with the specific proposals."
"The majority of Members of the European Parliament fully support the shift away from statutory pensions schemes based on solidarity towards a three-pillar model of pensions provision."
"The report does not develop any fundamental alternatives to the pensions reform initiated by the decisions taken at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, which lacked a social framework."
"I think it is especially tragic that by promoting the partial privatisation of pensions systems based on solidarity, European social democracy is breaking radically with its entire historical tradition."
"For more than a hundred years, social democracy has fought for a redistributive welfare state based on solidarity. Now it is at the forefront of the campaign to dismantle it."
"The emphasis on demographic arguments, such as the 'greying' of the European societies, is not convincing."
"Furthermore, no attempt is made to examine other options - such as the inclusion of all types of income in financing the pensions system, as in Switzerland - in terms of their viability."
"These are the watchwords of the 'pensions reform'. The Commission and the High-Level Working Party on Social Protection are calling for new regulations to push back the current retirement age."
"In future, the statutory pension will no longer maintain a person's existing living standards in old age, but will merely offer basic provision."
"Maintaining pensions systems based on solidarity is possible even under current and future conditions as long as policies are guided by the principle of social justice rather than the self-seeking interests of banks, investment funds and insurance companies."
"We therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy."
"Many of the children that are presently being born will live to the age of 120 or more."
"This has been as a result of evidence which has been forthcoming by scientific communities, both in America and in the European Union."
"The fact of the matter is simply this. People are living longer."
"People are leading healthier lives."
"People know what foods they should eat in an effort to promote healthy living and, in its simplest terms, people are living longer."
"Many people retire from work at the age of 55 and the fact of the matter is that EU governments are going to have put in structures to ensure that future pensions can be paid to public servants."
"Equally, those working in the private sector will have to look more carefully at their pension plans."
"I welcome a recent study carried out by Merril Lynch, a leading US bank, which stated that Ireland tops the European league for safeguarding future pension payments."
"One per cent of our GDP is now being put aside per annum into what is known as the National Pension Reserve Fund so as to ensure that pensions for our public servants can be paid after the year 2025."
"Per annum we are now paying as much as £600 - £700 million pounds into this fund."
"I also believe it is important that we not only promote good savings programmes in our country but also ensure that people take out a pension at an early age."
"I am aware that EU leaders discussed this matter when they met in Stockholm recently."
"It is incumbent on all the governments of the European Union to bring forward legislation which can ensure primarily the payment of public service pensions into the future and secondly, to promote good pension programmes for the private sector."
"If this entails giving more tax breaks for persons so as to encourage them to take out pensions in the private sector, so be it."
"This report deals with a problem of the greatest importance for the future well-being of workers in the European Union, for whom it is necessary to guarantee safe and sustainable pension systems for the long term."
"Now as is well known, there has been no lack of catastrophic visions for the future of social protection, based on the ageing of the population and increased life expectancy."
"Although the report does not distance itself enough from the more negative positions of the Commission, particularly when it refers to the need for greater flexibility in pension systems, it does highlight the importance of the rise in the employment rate and of public systems based on intergenerational solidarity, and a fair balance between proportional contributions and benefits, on the one hand, and the principle of solidarity, on the other, in order to prevent poverty and social exclusion."
"It also takes up the 1992 recommendation concerning the minimum income to be guaranteed by the social protection systems, by supporting initiatives for its implementation."
"However, the report does not go far enough regarding what needs to be put into practice in terms of economic and social policies so as to effectively ensure that public systems are sound enough and guarantee worthwhile pensions."
"For that reason, I abstained."
"So there you have it!"
"Despite all the hypocritical posturing, maintaining our pension systems by dividing them up is the least of your worries."
"Even if we agree that the vital demographic challenge facing Europe as a whole today is a crucial issue for the Member States, the very least we can say is that we disapprove of the pseudo-solutions which you propose in your report."
"The rapporteur has managed to duck the issue in 31 convoluted paragraphs."
"At no point is there any talk of encouraging the birth rate in Europe or promoting real family policies."
"The only talk is of how best to manage the demographic collapse and ageing in the Member States, with pension funds authorised in a passing nod to global finance."
"Après vous, le déluge, provided that, until such time as Europeans are replaced by immigrants, we maintain a modicum of inter-generational 'solidarity' by putting women and pensioners out to work, encouraging social breakdown by developing private insurance and promoting the dumbing down (or, to use the rapporteur's new-speak, the open coordination) of pensions."
"With the exception of a few paragraphs, the whole report invites a reaction somewhere between anger at how you cave in before what you think of as fate and disgust at the financial, mercenary solutions which you recommend in order to resolve such a challenge."
"You prove in the most striking manner, however, that the nation state is by far the only viable and reliable framework within which to organise solidarity and social protection."
". (DE) I am most grateful that in its resolution on safe and sustainable pensions, the European Parliament has included a number of ideas and demands relating to women in particular for which I have worked actively for many years here and in Luxembourg."
"The debates about the equal treatment of women and men in social security, which have been ongoing since 1975, have borne witness to the usefulness and importance of the European Union's support, through its equal opportunities and equal treatment policies, in dismantling discrimination against women in pensions provision."
"I hope that our proposals will be taken seriously by governments facing the challenge of safeguarding living standards through adequate pensions for all, and that they will lead to Europe-wide cooperation on pensions issues."
"One of the goals of the Lisbon Process is to increase the number of women in the workforce."
"Those who lament the low numbers of working women - in my country too - often forget the millions of 'invisible' women working in the 15 EU countries, namely the wives who work in family businesses and who do not appear in the employment statistics."
"For many years, we have called for framework legislation at European level for spouses who work in family businesses, especially to guarantee their statutory participation in pensions schemes."
"I should also like to call attention once more to our demand that women's derived rights to a widow's pension be safeguarded, especially for the generations who had no access to employment and who worked solely in the home."
"Naturally, I believe that women should increasingly build up their own individual pension rights."
"However, this means that spouses who take a break from or opt out of paid employment to care for children or dependent relatives must have guaranteed pension entitlements based on the right to continue paying their social insurance contributions during maternity leave, parental leave, etc."
". (NL) People outlive their productive lives by quite a margin, at least if their health care, housing, food, working conditions and social security are adequate."
"Now that working is threatening to turn into a kind of elite sport, people end up being burnt-out at a younger age, and the need for a lower pensionable age is growing."
"In addition, due to small families, younger generations are outnumbered by the older generations, as a result of which, fewer people will be working per pensioner in future."
"The wrong answer to that has come from most governments and businesses over the last few decades."
"They wanted to reduce the number of people entitled to pensions, by, inter alia, abolishing widows' pensions, and by starting the old-age pension at an older age."
"In this way, it was hoped that taxes and pension premiums would drop."
"It has now become clear that skimping on pension rights only leads to poverty in the long run."
"The only way to stave off that poverty then is to suddenly raise government spending sharply."
"The real answer is to start saving in good time for a general pension right for everyone at the age of 60, and to improve pensions caused by inability to work at a younger age."
"This report still leaves something to be desired but is moving in the right direction."
". (EL) Surely the title of the report under discussion - safe and sustainable pensions - is meant euphemistically, given that it is obvious both from the spirit and the letter of the report that its concern is for companies and employers and to radically dismantle social security and pensions in a way best in keeping with interests of big business."
"Using the ""challenges posed by the ageing of the population"", which extends the period of retirement and has an adverse effect on business activity, as a pretext, it promotes the gradual implementation of the Stockholm decisions on drastic intervention in social security systems: part-time employment, the abolition of early retirement, benefits indexed to contributions, harsh cuts in benefits, a longer working life and an increase in the retirement age or the number of years' contributions required before full retirement, the gradual dismantling of the welfare state and the promotion of alternative private care and welfare systems."
"This endless list of harsh, anti-grass roots measures which may fail to persuade us about 'safe and sustainable pensions' is a knee-jerk reaction to the other part of the report, which is the ""future evolution of social protection from a long-term point of view""."
"Fleecing the workforce, insecurity, expensive private care, commercialising the pension system, poverty and social exclusion."
"That is what is in store for the workers, while big business, which demands that the social security system be sacrificed in order to safeguard its competitiveness, can look forward to a more robust, completely unaccountable and hugely profitable future."
"The break up of the social security system, in conjunction with working time arrangements geared to employers' interests, that is, part-time work and 'flexible' working times, are the terrifying reality of what was so cynically referred to in Stockholm as ""the need to reduce bottlenecks in the labour market"", that is, the creation of a huge army of employable people with no rights and no demands who must dance to the tune of big business with its speculative, competitive interests."
"The reaction of Greek workers and the Greek people as a whole to the abolition of the welfare state, the mass, combative rallies and strikes taking place, even as we speak, are a most resonant and categorical response to leaders laying disgusting plans without any thought for the people affected."
"The Greek workers have said the first resounding and steadfast ""no"" to the poverty and insecurity in store for them."
"We are positive that all the workers of Europe will say the same and we shall be at their side."
"You are sowing an anti-grass roots storm and you will reap a grass-roots hurricane."
"However, you can be sure that what you are trying to do will not wash!"
"Buitenweg report (A5-0166/2001)"
"Madam President, before leaving for Strasbourg from Bergamo airport, I was followed and greeted by some pensioners."
"One of them, however, did not trust me and followed me by plane to see and hear how I would vote in this round."
"He is that gentleman in the red jacket you can see amongst the people in the public gallery; if you cannot see him it is because pensioners can only be seen when they are amongst themselves."
"I want to reassure him that I also voted for the European Parliament budget for 2002, although I still think that part of this funding should be used to have our plenary session seen on television throughout Europe."
"I think we should finance live broadcasts of the sittings of the European Parliament with all its trials and tribulations but also all its importance."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Situation in Algeria"
"The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0350/2001 by Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Algeria ;"
"B5-0361/2001 by Swoboda and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Algeria;"
"B5-0366/2001 by Flautre and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Algeria;"
"B5-0368/2001 by Ferrer and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Algeria;"
"B5-0373/2001 by Malmström and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Algeria;"
"B5-0384/2001 by Boudjenah and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Algeria;"
"B5-0394/2001 by Caullery, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Algeria;"
"Mr President, as an ex-journalist, freedom, as well as ethical responsibility, of the press are close to my heart."
"Islamic fundamentalists and state authorities threaten, and are determined, to extinguish the flame of the freedom of the press in Algeria."
"Nevertheless, it is still burning, despite the numerous killings and detentions among independent Algerian journalists."
"However, a tightening up of the clause on defamation in the Code of Criminal Procedure forms a fresh attempt on the part of the Algerian government to kill that flame."
"As a result, it is possible to lock up Algerian journalists more quickly and for longer."
"The extent to which the freedom of the press is at stake in Algeria is also patently obvious from the official resistance which the newspaper publisher, Omar Belhouchet, has experienced over the past couple of months when he imported a new printing press from Germany."
"His statement speaks volumes: 'To Algeria, that piece of equipment represents a technological, but mainly a political, revolution."
"At long last, the state printing office can no longer prevent our publications."
"We have taken a portion of the power from those in power.'"
"How exactly?"
"By not succumbing to the contempt of the citizens and their rights by the current regime, by openly defying the arbitrariness of political authorities, police and justice, which act in the interest of the ruling clans."
"The Algerians sum up this abhorrent government attitude in a single word: 'hogra' ."
"It is precisely this 'hogra' , according to critical Algerian minds, that drove their own young people into the terrorist tentacles of the fundamentalists."
"'Hogra' is, in other words, the key word in Algeria' s tragedy today."
"By way of healing social antidote to 'hogra' , the Algerian independent press - referred to as 'the incorruptibles' at home - deserves the support of the European institutions."
"As and when possible, they must provide the vital oxygen for this pilot light of the Algerian freedom of press, not least during the negotiations involving the country' s authorities."
"For in the final analysis, only the independent press in Algeria raises the issues which are really preoccupying the minds of the citizens."
"And what does this country, weighed down by so much violence, need more than an honest, public, political debate?"
"Mr President, since December 1991, Algeria has been in a situation of permanent violence."
"According to the official figures 100 000 people have died during that period, which represents around 1 200 deaths per month, and the figures that the non-official organisations are giving are even worse."
"In April 1999 the new President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, ordered a partial amnesty, a law of civil concord, and promised fundamental reforms in order to put an end to the ongoing crisis in the country."
"So far, however, this policy has had a very limited effect."
"It does not seem to have been accepted as a true policy of total democratisation and reconciliation."
"The terrorist activity of the violent fundamentalists has continued, and the situation has been aggravated by the violence of the last few weeks in Kabylia, where demonstrations by hundreds of young people, following the violent death of one of them in a police station, were very violently suppressed in a real bloodbath, which left more than 60 young people dead from police bullets."
"The situation is really very critical."
"It is, of course, an Algerian problem, which can only be resolved by Algerians and between Algerians, through a process that democratically restructures and gives greater legitimacy to the institutions and the State, through the agreement of all the political and social sectors who reject violence, from whatever source, and which can, in the face of the violent fundamentalists and also the sectors of the current ruling power that are resistant to change, achieve greater transparency and the participation of all the peaceful forces in the reconstruction of the country."
"This is a very complicated and difficult task, and the European Union should not miss the target in its support for those in positions of responsibility in the country, supporting all those who are coming from the point of view of peace and democracy."
"We should act without seeking to interfere, but with firmness and a positive spirit to promote human rights and the democratic process."
"Tomorrow, a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Algeria."
"I hope this debate will help to clarify our attitude, which is an entirely positive one, supporting the whole democratic political field in the country, in the institutions and in society, in finding a way out of this violent situation when there does not seem to be one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the outburst of violence which rocked the region of Kabylia was, unfortunately, predictable - or even inevitable."
"Instead of worrying if this sort of social explosion might happen, we should have been forecasting when it would happen."
"The region of Kabylia is a microcosm of all the ills which beset Algeria, with its unfortunate colonial parentage, a microcosm of the national cohesion which has never quite made it and is based on democratic and legal institutions and a rule of law which have never been credibly founded."
"And, centre stage on this Algerian social scene, masses of young people, the life force of the nation, crammed into a few urban centres facing nothing but mass unemployment."
"What choice did they have other than to rebel and bemoan their fate?"
"Are they supposed to keep quiet as well?"
"And what policy can the Algerian government engage in other than to establish proper rule of law, starting today with committees of inquiry."
"Is the government supposed to turn a blind eye as well?"
"Surely - and this is vital - it should at long last offer Algerians a real future by introducing economic reform."
"Otherwise, this fire will continue to smoulder beneath the surface of Algeria."
"Mr President, Algeria has a turbulent history."
"Colonial rule, which destroyed the country's traditional structures, was followed by a brutal war."
"After this brutal war, a socialist one-party system was established which finally collapsed as a result of corruption."
"Today, the country of Algeria - this large and important country - faces two major challenges."
"Firstly, there is a youth revolt in progress, for Algeria is a young country, and its young people are rebelling because they feel that no one cares about them and they have no future."
"When social exclusion is combined with national sentiment, the result is powerful and explosive."
"Secondly, there is the danger of Islamism, which is systematically fomented by certain groups."
"We must therefore give the country our support, but we must proceed very sensitively."
"President Bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up Algeria."
"He has moved towards reform."
"A few weeks ago, he held a landmark ceremony to honour St Augustine."
"We might regard this as gesture politics, but he wanted to show that St Augustine's origins lie in what is now Algeria."
"In doing so, he also wanted to tell his people that as Algerians in an Islamic country, they have cultural links with Europe and therefore also with the Christian world."
"These are signs of openness, and they are important."
"This kind of gesture politics, however, is not enough."
"Real and substantive reforms are required."
"They must include press freedom, the rule of law, but also tolerance towards different nationalities and ethnic groups."
"Traditionally, Berbers have cultivated their own culture and identity and have maintained a substantial measure of independence in Kabylie."
"This third major revolt among the Kabyle people sends out an alarm signal, for it is a revolt by young people who feel marginalised by the Algerian state."
"What is required, therefore, are sensitive reforms, respect for diversity, respect for freedom, and strengthening the rule of law."
"However, we must also ensure that measures are taken which we must support through dialogue based on equality and an absence of tutelage."
"Mr President, the slaughter of the Berbers is a fresh reminder of Algeria' s horrific reality."
"Once again, our courageous foreign affairs ministers have decided to put their heads in the sand."
"The entire world is being condemned, except for Algeria."
"However, neither the oil interests, nor the current negotiations are enough to keep the gross human rights violations under wraps."
"The MEDA agreements demand respect for diversity."
"One third of the Algerian population are Berbers."
"Pluriformity should form part of the state fabric."
"Cultural, linguistic, but mainly social rights must be recognised if Algeria wishes to become a Treaty partner."
"It is questionable whether we should enter into an agreement with Algeria where human rights are being violated on such a massive scale, even by government officials."
"In my view, this can only be done if the government assures us that it will make every attempt to prevent the wrong-doings, and to prosecute and bring to justice those responsible, from whatever quarter."
"An agreement on judicial cooperation is only meaningful if this is given substance by the Algerians."
"At this moment in time, I still have grave doubts as to whether that is the case."
"If I look back on ten years of oppression and extreme violence, I am shocked by the statistics."
"One hundred and fifty thousand killed and on top of that, 10 000 people who have disappeared without a trace, and Europe remains silent."
"President Bouteflika constantly promises to contain the violence."
"He pledges to investigate the recent tragedy in Kabylia, but will the guilty be punished?"
"I should like to reiterate it: the State' s most fundamental task is to protect its population."
"It is shameful that the Algerian authorities should not be able to put an end to the abhorrent reality in their country."
"Mr President, for ten days the region of Kabylia was the scene of a series of very serious incidents."
"Following the death, on 18 April, of the young high school student, Guermah Massinissa in the police station at Beni Douala, impressive peaceful demonstrations were held at several locations, demanding that the persons responsible for this 'mistake' be brought to justice."
"In addition, thousands of demonstrators, often very young, turned out to demand important social measures in this region, which has been hard hit by unemployment, poverty and even a housing shortage."
"Without doubt, the roots of this discontent lie in the serious social crisis which has affected the whole of Algeria."
"One rightly wonders if speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation already under way risks exacerbating the situation."
"There is also a strong cultural demand in this region for the Amazigh language and culture to be respected, especially since the Berber Spring in 1980."
"Provocation and other abuses of authority by the police with respect to the population also seem to be at the root of this positive outburst of anger."
"So these were peaceful demonstrations calling for more social progress and greater freedom and democracy."
"The marches turned into clashes which were put down by the security forces with a great deal of violence over a period of several days, leaving dozens dead and hundreds wounded."
"Numerous eye witness accounts printed in the newspapers talk of outright brutality."
"President Bouteflika and the national assembly announced that committees of inquiry would be set up."
"We can only hope that they will be set up as quickly as possible and will have the means needed to work efficiently - and, more importantly, transparently - so that sanctions can be imposed on those responsible for the repression."
"In another indication of the seriousness of the situation, the Rally for Culture and Democracy Party said that it was 'impossible for it to stay in a government which fires on young people' and withdrew from the coalition."
"I am positive that the future of Algeria, whose people have courageously resisted barbaric pressure from Muslim fundamentalist terrorist groups, lies not in repression but in heeding the people's social demands and the often very courageous action of the various associations acting to defend women's rights, secure the repeal of the family code, care for traumatised children, keep solidarity alive in the face of serious social difficulties or defend human rights."
"Nor does the future reside in the worrying restrictions on the freedom of the press which will result if the planned amendments to the penal code are adopted."
"The European Parliament delegation travelling to Algiers tomorrow will certainly help us to gain an insight into the Algerian situation from our various contacts and listen in return to their expectations of the European Union."
"In the same spirit, it will inspire the Commission to continue negotiations with a view to an Association Agreement, while taking better account of the opinion of political, trades union and community organisations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed the fate of this crisis-torn country since I was young."
"I was a member of the parliamentary delegation which attempted to break the ice in the relations between the European Union and Algeria."
"Yet many of our hopes have not been fulfilled."
"Even our hopes of the new President Bouteflika, who has undoubtedly shown some signs of courage, and of the RCD's inclusion in the Algerian government have been disappointed."
"In my view, the basic problem in Algeria is that the powers-that-be - le pouvoir, as the Algerians say - have failed to make genuine efforts to reach a consensus between the social groups in the country."
"Contrary to the frequent accusations made against us, I do not mean a consensus with terrorists and murderers."
"There can be no consensus here."
"I mean a consensus with all the groups which do not wish to witness the victory of the radical Islamist terrorist forces."
"However, the powers-that-be - or at least some sections of the military - have no interest in achieving this consensus. They want to maintain the status quo, and unfortunately, they are heavily implicated in corruption."
"This is why there are so many incidents like the recent events in Kabylie, with their shocking death-toll and the resulting alienation between the country's young people and its ruling class."
"I hope that the delegation which will be visiting Algeria in the next few days will be able to foster at least some understanding of what is required to give the young people of Algeria fresh opportunities and restore their sense of hope."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission deplores the recent incidents in Kabylie."
"The many dead and hundreds of injured bear witness to the fact that the reform process in Algeria has still not achieved the desired results."
"Yet it is also clear that there is no alternative to the policy of calling for and consistently supporting this reform process."
"The European Union regularly addresses the issues of human rights violations, arbitrary arrests and torture in its political dialogue with Algeria."
"At the 57th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March 2001, the EU called upon Algeria to take substantive measures in this area and allow the UN Special Rapporteurs on the question of torture and on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions to visit the country."
"The issue of the disappearances of individuals is of particular concern to us."
"During the troika's most recent visit to Algiers on 24 April 2001, the Algerian authorities were presented with a consolidated list of thirty old and new cases."
"The Commission will continue to pursue this issue vigorously in future."
"The Association Agreement currently being negotiated with Algeria contains a clause on democratic principles and human rights."
"The speedy conclusion of this Agreement will equip the European Union with an effective instrument with which to engage in more intensive dialogue with Algeria at institutional level."
"Since 1996, the Commission has committed EUR 300 million from its MEDA budget lines and under the financial protocols to support economic and social reform in Algeria."
"In 2001, our aim is to promote balanced social and economic development, and we are therefore preparing two comprehensive projects for local development in rural areas and for rehabilitation measures in the regions affected by terrorism."
"Human rights projects are also being funded through separate dedicated budget lines."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken today at 6.30 p.m."
"Situation in Bosnia/Herzegovina, particularly Banya Luka"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0357/2001 by Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina;"
"B5-0362/2001 by Swoboda and Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the attack against the rebuilding of the Mosque(s) in Banja Luka (and Trebinje) (Bosnia);"
"B5-0369/2001 by Pack and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the attack against the rebuilding of the mosque(s) in Banja Luka (and Trebinje);"
"B5-0375/2001 by Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the incidents in Banja Luka and Trebinje;"
"B5-0385/2001 by Morgantini and Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the incidents in Banja Luka and Trebinje;"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Bosnia-Herzegovina is, in fact, the touchstone of our dream about stability and peace."
"So far, the international community has made efforts to support the peace forces in those countries."
"Needless to say, there are also opposing forces, and those claim victims."
"In addition to the fact that attempts are still being made from different quarters to have the last word, and to threaten Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unit, there are also religious conflicts, of course."
"Conflicts which are related to the symbols, and anyone who is politically active appreciates the significance of symbols."
"That is also very much the case in a country which is torn by war."
"It is therefore of key importance for us to join forces in a resolute manner, with all international, and particularly local, forces which strive for peace on the ground."
"It is therefore also of key importance for us to be able to offer the guarantee that our presence there is not short-lived, that we persevere in our commitment, and that we can persuade the United States, which, with its new Bush administration, is forming a threat to that lasting stability, to continue its commitment to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the West, or the European Union, became actively involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina because it wanted to promote peaceful relations between the different social, religious and ethnic groups."
"We did not want to accept that in today's and tomorrow's Europe, conflict and war could be caused by ethnicity or religion."
"Dayton was the result, and led - as we believed - to the founding of a new state. This was and probably remains the only option to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina at this time."
"Many of us here in this House are not satisfied with Dayton, but as I said, it was a chance to end the war."
"What we cannot accept, however, is that we are now retreating from Dayton again."
"There are some forces which actively support this development and want to create new or restore old ethnic divisions within Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"First, there were the Croat extremists who, having lost Zagreb's support, have attempted to join forces and create their own new Croat (mini-) state in Bosnia."
"Then there are the Serb extremists, who can undoubtedly count on continued support from Belgrade and perhaps even from President Kostunica on occasion, and who also believe that the time has come to settle old scores and prevent some elements of life in a multi-ethnic community from being restored, like the mosque where these incidents took place when the foundation stone was to be laid."
"This development has undoubtedly been caused by the fact that refugee return and thus the 'mix' of the various ethnic groups have not taken place on the scale demanded by the international community, and especially by this House."
"Moreover, the hindering of refugee return at various levels has undoubtedly also fuelled hopes that the mono-ethnic orientation and focus of the individual entities, especially the Republika Srpska, can be preserved."
"We cannot be deterred now, however."
"We must call upon everyone in a position of responsibility in this region, and of course in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, to ensure that Dayton at least - which is the very minimum we can or should achieve at this time - and multi-ethnicity are restored on the scale or in the direction which formerly existed."
"To this end, it is essential that Croatia also takes measures with regard to its property laws, but also conditions at local level, to encourage refugees to return."
"Above all, however, it is vital that Republika Srpska plays its part."
"There is the agreement between the Croatian Foreign Minister and the former Prime Minister or President of the Republika Srpska."
"The President is no longer in office, but even during his incumbency, little was done to comply with the provisions of this Treaty or these agreements."
"This House must call on all sides and groupings in Bosnia finally to fulfil their commitments, and the commitments which were adopted on their behalf by the international community, because we - after all - were the ones who helped them end this dreadful war and the dying."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing an incident concerning a mosque."
"This mosque was not destroyed in any war."
"This mosque stood in Banja Luka, where there was no war."
"It was razed to the ground in 1993, its foundations were torn up, and a car park was built on the site."
"This mosque was destroyed - like hundreds of other Muslim and Catholic places of worship - on the orders of Karadzic and his henchmen."
"Not only were these places of worship destroyed; hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats were forced to flee their homes at a time when there was no war in this region, namely between 1991 and 1995."
"As Johannes Swoboda has already pointed out, the Dayton Agreement has now been in place since late 1995."
"We never liked this Agreement."
"It ended the war, but it has not yet brought peace to the region."
"Six years have now passed, and we have to recognise that Dayton contains few promises and has achieved even less."
"It has divided the country into two ethnic entities, a mono-ethnic Serb entity, and a Muslim-Croat entity."
"This situation has proved highly problematical in practice. In essence, we have created an artificial product."
"Do we really expect Bosnia's inexperienced politicians to cope with this state of affairs today?"
"It is extremely difficult."
"What's more, we do not always help each entity equally."
"The numbers of people returning are still too low."
"Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled, and there are still half a million displaced persons in Bosnia who have not returned home."
"I think we must appeal to everyone to take action here."
"The Republika Srpska lags behind the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina with regard to refugee return, and this is obviously one reason for the situation which we witnessed ten days ago in Banja Luka. At the laying of the foundation stone of this ancient mosque, and eight days earlier at the laying of the foundation stone for another mosque in Trebinje, hardliners from the SDS, the Serb nationalists, were yet again able to drum up supporters who interrupted the ceremonies, set fire to buses, and threatened the lives of participants."
"The President of the Republika Srpska and his government and Prime Minister must make serious efforts to condemn this incident and create an atmosphere which fosters peaceful relations between the communities, which were the norm in this region until 1991."
"In my view, we should also have no qualms about coupling financial assistance with conditions at last."
"We made it quite clear to Milorad Dodik, the previous Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska, that he could count on our financial support if he encouraged refugee return."
"We supported his work when he was in office, yet he did not allow any displaced persons to return."
"There is now a new government in office, and we really must proceed with caution."
"We are talking about taxpayers' money here, and we must be sure that it is used to achieve the goals set by the international community and the European Union."
"Refugees wishing to return must be able to do so."
"The same naturally applies to the neighbouring region of Croatia as well."
"In Croatia, there is a law preventing the restitution of property to Serb owners who fled from the region."
"Admittedly, many Serbs no longer want to return, but their property should at least be restored to them, and they should be given support to enable them to return to - or from - Croatia."
"We have addressed a number of other issues in our motion as well."
"In the Muslim-Croat Federation, hardline Croat separatists are also disrupting peaceful relations between the communities and trying to set up a breakaway mini-state in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"They will never be successful."
"The moderates are stronger, and we must give them our support."
"However, given that the international community has a certain amount of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should not use it arbitrarily to amend an electoral law in a way which discriminates against a specific ethnic group."
"This simply reinforces the hardliners' cause and increases support for them."
"I realise that this step is now regretted, but it is important to address this issue so that it does not happen again."
"I hope that we will do everything possible within the scope of our CARDS programme to ensure that the refugees are able to return to all parts of the region."
"This is the best contribution we can make to promoting peaceful relations between the communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Mr President, what is the European Union' s task with regard to Bosnia?"
"That is, of course, not difficult to answer."
"We need to lend our support to the principles of multi-ethnic tolerance and cooperation, and support those who advocate these principles."
"We also need to underline the importance of building democracy and the role of democratic, political parties in that region."
"We also need to call a spade a spade."
"This is done in this resolution, and the Republika Srpska is being urged not only to hand over Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic at long last, but also to mount a full enquiry into how the violence has actually been able to take root?"
"Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission, and particularly the Member States, to implement the recently concluded Stability Pact in its entirety and swiftly, including the pledged funds, since in that area, it seems as if things are not always running as smoothly as we would have liked."
"Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina will either be a three-nation state, or it will cease to exist."
"The country will only survive if - at least in the medium term - all three communities want to live in this state."
"That sounds simplistic, but it is a fact which we very often ignore."
"I therefore believe that the time has come not only to take action against the hardliners of all nationalities, but also to ask ourselves self-critically for once what we have done wrong."
"In my view, Doris Pack pointed the right way forward here."
"Dayton was a step towards the absence of war."
"Now it is time to start moving towards genuine peace."
"Moving towards peace ultimately means creating a tripartite federation in which all three communities enjoy equal rights."
"Believe me, I do not want to justify the actions of the Croat extremists in Mostar, but one reason why they are popular, of course, is that they do not see why the Croats, as an ethnic group, do not enjoy the same rights as the Republika Srpska, for example."
"This is an enormous problem which we must address, for in this respect, there is no equality or symmetry within the Federation."
"The second point which we must be clear about - as Doris Pack has already mentioned - is refugee return."
"In this area too, there must be no double standards, and the same applies to the issue of cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague."
"There is a considerable lack of symmetry as regards the extradition of indicted persons to The Hague."
"In the long term, the people in this region will only be prepared to cooperate with the Tribunal if they are confident that the perpetrators from all three communities will be extradited and convicted on an even-handed basis."
"This means that we cannot always point the finger at others; we must be self-critical for once and admit that for a whole range of reasons, we very often apply double standards."
"I should like to thank Mr Swoboda for openly addressing an issue which we must all be clear about: that unfortunately, President Kostunica also appears to be encouraging certain forces in the Republika Srpska to pursue nationalist policies."
"I believe that we must make it quite clear to Belgrade that there are conditions attached to the assistance we provide, and that this type of support for the nationalists in the Republika Srpska is unacceptable."
"There must be conditionality across the board: not only in our assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina but also to Serbia or Yugoslavia."
"As for Yugoslavia, our euphoria about the ousting of Milosevic - which we naturally welcome - threatens to make us lose our perspective to some extent."
"Unfortunately, that distorts our view of what is important in the region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares Parliament's horror and revulsion at the incidents in Trebinje and Banja Luka."
"My colleague Chris Patten, who is responsible for this area of work, is visiting Bosnia this afternoon."
"He has issued a statement condemning the violence and demanding that the Republika Srpska authorities find those responsible and make sure they face justice."
"As regards the Croats' 'self-rule' within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission fully supports the High Representative's decision to remove Mr Jelavic from his position as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and his appeal to the Bosnian Croats to support the development of a stable multi-ethnic state."
"Let me make one thing quite clear: the recent incidents do not further the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into European structures in any way; nor do they enhance the country's international reputation, especially among donors."
"On the contrary, the incidents make it even more difficult to attract the funds which Bosnia so urgently needs, and on which it continues to depend."
"The European Union will not withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"We will continue our efforts to promote the reconstruction of the country and support the many citizens who yearn to live a life in peace."
"However, the country's internal problems cannot be resolved merely by concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement or offering the prospect of closer relations with the European Union."
"Instead, a key prerequisite for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union is that the country itself undergoes a profound transformation at domestic level and that in doing so, it respects the fundamental values, such as human and minority rights, on which the European Union is founded."
"This transformation process is indispensable if integration into the EU is to bring additional benefits in terms of stability, security and economic development."
"In the European Union's view, the progress achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the stabilisation and association process are the test of the country's willingness to complete this transformation."
"Above all, we expect progress in implementing the specific measures agreed a year ago as part of the 'Road Map', which include refugee return."
"Of the 18 measures in total, just 5 have been fully implemented so far."
"A further 9 have been partially implemented, while 4 have still not been addressed at all."
"Yet the next phase of the process, that is, the feasibility study, cannot begin until all the measures have been implemented."
"As part of the CARDS programme, the Commission will continue to focus its assistance on target groups which promote refugee return and the reconciliation process."
"Out of a total of EUR 105.3 million in funding for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2001, EUR 37.3 million - by far the largest individual amount - will be used to support refugee return."
"Of this figure, around 16 million are earmarked for the fostering of integration, reconciliation and institution-building, which includes strengthening the constitutional court and three human rights bodies."
"In line with the calls voiced here by the honourable Members, the assistance provided within the CARDS framework is linked to conditions."
"As there have been more obstacles to refugee return in the Republika Srpska than in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska has received less funding in this area."
"When deciding on the restructuring or cancellation of assistance, it must be borne in mind that the CARDS programme provides support for major structural projects - such as refugee return, human rights, judicial reform, and the development of an independent media - which are a priority for the EU."
"Abandoning these projects would merely give fresh impetus to the extremists in Bosnia, who are also hostile to projects of this kind."
"In contrast to CARDS, the Commission's reciprocal macrofinancial assistance is not linked to specific conditions."
"The assistance is provided as part of a coherent macroeconomic package which was agreed by the authorities in the region and is supported by the international financial institutions."
"Due to the specific conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, the Commission tries to ensure that the overall political environment, that is, the political reality on the ground, is as favourable as possible and that the macroeconomic assistance ties in with other measures taken by the Community."
"Commissioner Verheugen, thank you very much for your statement."
"Following on from your comments about all the problems faced in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I should just like to ask whether it is true that Bosnia-Herzegovina is scheduled to join the Council of Europe at that body's next or subsequent meeting."
"I should like to ask whether this really is true, and whether all 15 of our Member States can shake hands on it before all the conditions which you have described are fulfilled."
"Mr President, I am sorry, but my answer is simply that I cannot answer the question."
"As you know, the Commission is not a member of the Council of Europe."
"I must ask you to address your question to the committee which coordinates the position of the 15 Member States in the Council of Europe."
"I would be very happy to assist you, of course."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we were all witness to a rare event - a Commissioner not knowing the answer."
"He is only human, and we must accept that!"
"Mr President, apart from the fact that yes, if Bosnia-Herzegovina is admitted, the country as a whole will be admitted, I would like to address the following question to you."
"Like Mr Posselt and various other honourable Members, I voted for the Friday in Strasbourg."
"This was rejected yet again, so we only have the Thursday."
"Could you tell us why we will be voting at 6.30 p.m. when the debate is likely to finish at around 5.10 or 5.15 p.m.?"
"I assume that it is too late for you to change these arrangements for today."
"However, I would ask you, Mr President, to ensure that when we discuss topical and urgent subjects on Thursday, we vote at the end of each debate, as used to be the practice."
"It will make no difference to our views for or against the Friday if we could vote immediately after the individual debates about topical and urgent subjects."
"We have already had this problem several times on Thursdays."
"We set the agenda and then the debate proceeds faster or slower than expected."
"We obviously need more practice!"
"As far as today's debate is concerned, it is difficult to tell at this stage when we will be finished. If we have a lot of interventions like yours, Mr Swoboda, it is quite likely to be 5.30 p.m."
"Then there is the debate about three reports."
"No break is scheduled between 5.30 and 6.00 p.m. The debate about the reports will take place during this period."
"Human rights"
"Mr President, Commissioner, until recently, Ethiopia and Eritrea were locked in war."
"Fortunately, that is now over, and this proud and wonderful Ethiopian people can once again start deciding on its own fate."
"Sadly, we are forced to note that human rights are being violated, that people are being tortured and locked up in prisons at random, and that students are calling for academic freedom, to no avail."
"This is painful."
"As international community, we have concluded a partnership deal."
"We will sign this as 'the Cotonou Agreement' ."
"In that document, we aim to establish good relations by entering into a dialogue with each other."
"This also applies specifically to Ethiopia, a country which time and again appears on the list of countries which quality for emergency aid."
"I hope that we, along with Ethiopia, can now finally turn over a new leaf, and that Ethiopia will be prepared - and I believe we should press for this, Commissioner - to free the people who are behind bars at present, because they are human rights activities, namely Messrs Woldemariam, Nega and Lidetu Ayalew, to allow students to return to their campuses in complete freedom and to observe the fundamental freedoms."
"Mr President, the resolution is right to condemn a number of matters, and also calls for action on the part of Europe."
"This is, in fact, possible within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement."
"That is done in a country, Ethiopia, which is occupying an important position in East Africa. It has, under Mengistu, experienced a horrific period, and has, following a fierce civil war, eventually found peace."
"Ethiopia is being governed by people originating from the resistance movement. At times, they still display characteristics of a certain 'bush' mentality and find it difficult to share power with others, as it were."
"Tigreans play a major role in the government and do so very expertly."
"The government also plays a crucial role in a number of peace-promoting initiatives, but is, at the same time, struggling to achieve good relations in Ethiopia, in its interaction with Eritrea, and also within Eritrea."
"Attempts are being made to build a regional autonomy within the countries, coupled with a certain level of ethnicity, with respect for minorities."
"This is a painstaking process and is also often accompanied by resistance from certain groups within Ethiopia."
"We simply have to establish that it is still costing them a great deal of effort in order to build a more powerful, stable democracy."
"In a way, I appreciate the efforts that this is costing them. At the same time, however, we as international community can hardly ask anything else from them here than that they understand that if they do not observe human rights, do not show respect for groups who think differently, react with violence and violate human rights, this will eventually seriously damage their own status and our position, as well as our chance to support them."
"I believe we need to operate within that context of understanding and insight, and must also be very clear. That is why we will give our unqualified support to this resolution."
"Mr President, few African leaders have been able to count on so much international goodwill when taking up office as the Ethiopian leader, Meles Zenawi."
"The end of the military dictatorship, the peaceful separation of Eritrea and the formation of a government of national unity turned the country at the time into a fine example of a successful transition from dictatorship to democracy."
"Unfortunately, this image has been brutally shattered."
"The bloody border conflict with Eritrea, the government' s inability to prevent another famine and the repression of the past couple of weeks have seriously compromised Ethiopia' s image."
"It is correct that unemployed young people have taken advantage of the student protests earlier this month to start plundering, but that in no way justifies the excessively harsh police action which claimed at least 30 lives."
"Neither does it justify the gulf of repression during which students, journalists, human rights activities and opponents were rounded up and accused of inciting violence."
"Ethiopia is facing two fundamental problems: firstly, the government' s insubstantial ethnic basis, and secondly, poverty."
"As far as the first problem is concerned, an inter-Ethiopian dialogue must be established urgently, representing all political and ethnic groups. Europe can play a crucial role in this."
"As for the second problem, the Ethiopian government must pledge its unconditional support to a peace agreement with Eritrea, so that the necessary funds for development are no longer diverted to defence expenditure and weapons."
"Cameroon"
"Mr President, I cannot myself claim intimate familiarity with circumstances in Cameroon, but together with other colleagues in this House I have been approached by friends and acquaintances whom we trust in non-governmental organisations, notably the International Federation for Christian Action Against Torture, drawing to our attention matters of the gravest concern, which merit the attention of the institutions of the Union and in particular of this Parliament."
"We have well-attested reports of the discovery of 2000 mass graves, of the arrest of senior officers of the gendarmerie, of inquiries into an organisation known as the Operational Command and generally matters of real concern."
"It has been put to us that what is required is: an independent commission of inquiry to shed light on human rights violations, acts of torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions, a commitment to protect adequately human rights defenders and local organisations working on this issue and the appointment of some special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary and arbitrary executions, with the working group on forced or involuntary disappearances being invited as soon as possible to inquire into matters in Cameroon."
"By coincidence, today's Le Monde has a special supplement on Cameroon, the opening sentence of which tells us that all the evils of Africa are to be found in Cameroon and yet also all the reasons for hope for the better."
"What has been revealed to us here suggests that both of these propositions are true: both the reasons for hope and the present evils."
"Also, this week in Le Monde in relation to General Aussaresses we have been reminded that torture, disappearance and evil-doing and the use of humans as means and not as ends in themselves have terribly scarred the history of our own continent, both during the war of 1939 to 1945 and afterwards."
"We are not in a position to hold ourselves up as being somehow superior but we can, as concerned human beings, share the concern of our fellows in Cameroon who are raising these points and members of international non-governmental human rights organisations who have been drawing it to our attention."
"I strongly commend this resolution to the House and hope it will be adopted unanimously this evening."
"Mr President, it is not the first time that NGOs and human rights organisations have sounded the alarm with regard to the human rights situation in Cameroon."
"They are referring to disappearances, extra-judicial executions, tortures, mass graves and overcrowded prisons."
"The special unit that controls banditry, in particular, is reported to indulge in the systematic violation of human rights."
"The UN Committee against Tortures called for the swift dissolution of this unit, with good reason, in fact. However, that is not enough, of course."
"Cameroon suffers from an enormously huge problem of lawlessness."
"We welcome the fact that the President, Mr Biya, set up an inquiry committee which led to the arrest of a number of suspected officers."
"It will take more than that, however, to restore the confidence in the rule of law, such as an independent inquiry into the disappearances and into the mass graves, and especially into punishing the guilty."
"Europe could help in this by making resources and expertise available to the legal system in Cameroon."
"Without wanting to let the Cameroon leaders off the hook, I would, by the by, like to draw your attention to one of the fundamental problems of Cameroon and, in fact, of large parts of Africa, namely the dramatic slump in the price of raw materials."
"Oxfam presented a report today in which it is assumed that the reduction in those prices of raw materials costs the developing countries more than the total amount that they receive in development aid."
"I would therefore urge the Council and Commission to take the recommendation of the Oxfam report seriously, and perhaps we can organise a debate on this issue before long."
"It is at any rate promising that the Belgian Presidency announced today that it wants to make Africa one of its priorities. We welcome this, and will give our full cooperation."
"Mr President, I am in complete agreement with my fellow members and would even add that the UN Committee against Torture has found that torture is rife in Cameroon and that this has been confirmed in the testimony of a former Cameroon minister who considers that the prison system is inhumane in Cameroon and that physical and mental torture are an everyday occurrence."
"All this leads me to believe that the government of Cameroon, and it is perhaps this which worries me most today, no longer has any control over the special forces which it has set up, the special forces which appear to be responsible, among other things, for the disappearance of 9 young people who allegedly stole a cylinder of gas in the Douala sports district."
"In order to prove good faith on the part of the government - my colleague said earlier that there were plenty of reasons for hope in Cameroon - I think that we have to go along with the UN proposal to set up a committee, as a matter of urgency, to look into all the extortion, torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions identified over recent months."
"I think that, today, Parliament cannot make do with adopting texts which are not respected and verified on the ground, especially as Cameroon has signed the Cotonou Convention of 23 June 2000 requiring that the parties undertake to promote and protect fundamental freedoms and all human rights."
"We must call on Cameroon to respect this convention and find ways of excluding this country and any other country which violates the conventions which it has signed."
"No difficulty, be it economic, social or demographic should or could justify torture."
"Mr President, we in the Socialist Group and the European Parliament need to send a clear message to the Cameroon authorities."
"In order for the Cotonou Agreement to be effective and credible, the European Union needs all the ACP countries, including Cameroon, of course, to use actions to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to democratic values."
"The governments and in particular the State security forces of all the countries associated with the European Union need to have a clear understanding that security and public order cannot come before the exercise of people' s freedoms, not to mention their physical safety."
"Cameroon is an important country in the regional context, whose indicators paint a hopeful picture of the economic situation, but we are obliged to look beyond this positive outlook and ask the government of Cameroon to make a greater effort to maintain the rule of law and to respect the rights of its population."
"Similarly, we must ask the government of Cameroon to comply with the recommendations of the United Nations, which has already asked it to reform the structure and activity of its security forces, in order to ensure that they are made up of regular members and always act within the limits of the law."
"Cameroon must understand that by making this effort, not only will it be satisfying the European Union and the other countries, but it will also be working in the interests of its own people."
"Also, it is good for the whole of the African continent that European cooperation with Africa, both under the Cotonou Agreement and under bilateral cooperation with our countries, should be governed by respect for the values of freedom that we all profess to share."
"I would like to finish by doing what my colleague Mr MacCormick did and also recognise the work and action of some non-governmental organisations such as FiACAT, which has passed on information and concerns to us in its constant monitoring of the situation in Cameroon."
"We want to encourage local organisations even more, such as 'Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture' , which are on permanent alert on the ground and have consequently been victims of injustice."
"They deserve and have our solidarity."
"Press freedom in the world"
"Mr President, freedom of the press and freedom of opinion are the cornerstones of democracy."
"People who have lived under totalitarian regimes know how important it is to establish and build on this cornerstone to its fullest capacity in every state."
"They therefore also understand that manipulation of the press is an assault on democracy. In other words, when the press is compromised and manipulated, or when it loses its political plurality because it is a corporate monopoly, democracy is jeopardised to a high degree."
"We must therefore not only put our finger on the wound in third countries, in the reform states, in order to foster democratic development by promoting freedom of the press. We must also look at ourselves."
"I think it is especially important to ask ourselves whether an election can genuinely be described as democratic if a large number of the television channels are compromised."
"Should we not also consider whether this is an area where we can make a contribution?"
"I think this applies to Russia as much as the EU Member States."
"I therefore believe that it is important to include press freedom as an indicator in the human rights report."
"Press freedom must be part of how we judge the clauses in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, how we judge how close the relations with Ukraine and Russia will be, but also how we judge the development of democracy in our own states."
"Mr President, press freedom is one of the keystones that underpins real democracy."
"This freedom is lacking in many dictatorships due to the fear on the part of those in power of informed citizens, debate, opposition and disclosure."
"Europe needs to take a stand in favour of press freedom and those who fight for this, in a consistent manner."
"Understandably, our attention turns to the developing countries and the former centrally governed countries which are now in transition."
"This is with good reason, for we can often lend these countries real support with our aid and resources to local NGOs, civil society and the different media involved."
"As Social-Democrats we consider this topic of press freedom to be a cornerstone of our belief."
"However, within Europe, we would draw your attention to a particularly disquieting phenomenon, namely the concentration of ownership and control of media in Europe in a limited number of countries."
"That affects diversity in a fundamental way."
"This becomes even more serious if economic power and political power are combined."
"That is when freedom is at risk."
"I do not need to name any names to make myself clear."
"The European Parliament' s socialist group will take the initiative for proposals which resist this threat of press freedom."
"Unfortunately, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats has announced that, despite the fact that it has taken the initiative for this resolution, it refuses to back this resolution."
"In fact, it has threatened to vote against this resolution if this section were to be adopted."
"Does the power, or the fear, of the aforementioned person extend so far that he already has the People' s Party in his clutches?"
"We would ask the People' s Party to consider urgently whether it would like to defend press freedom or the concentration of power."
"It will make for an interesting outcome of the vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a good time to reply immediately to Mr van den Berg."
"The debate is the result of an initiative for a resolution taken by the group of the European People's Party."
"When the world day of the freedom of the press was held on 3 May, we were anxious to show our solidarity with the journalists who fell victim to their own dedication during 2000, 36 of whom died and a further 77 of whom were imprisoned while on the job."
"As we are all aware here, to scorn the freedom of the press is to attack human dignity, violate man's quest for truth and thwart his full potential and we wanted to express this in the simplest terms possible."
"Unfortunately, this very simple idea was hijacked by other political groups, as Mr van den Berg has just told us, who used the occasion to restart a pseudo-political argument with one of our colleagues and a future leader of one of the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"Regrettably, although I instigated the initial project, because the calendar of plenary sessions has been cut and we are all forced to run around like headless chickens here in Strasbourg, I was unable to attend the conciliation meeting which resulted in the joint resolution which is about to be put to the vote."
"At the time I was in the House taking part in the very important debate on the future of the Middle East."
"A small majority of honourable Members has dictated that we cannot be in two places at once, a fact which I cannot but deplore."
"That is why - because I would have opposed the paragraph which has now been included in the joint resolution - I asked our fellow members in the group not to sign this joint resolution and to put the initial text of our resolution to the vote in all its simplicity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, one of the vivid memories that I have of my youth, when I began my career, was a comment from one of my bosses who said that the greatest thing that God had given to humans was freedom of expression."
"This comment had such an impact on me that I have always remembered it and applied it to what I do."
"I am therefore taking part today in this motion for a resolution on the freedom of the world press, which I am, of course, defending at a time when many of our writers, journalists and photographers are risking their lives right across the globe for a variety of reasons."
"I must make a special mention today of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and make a heartfelt mention of a Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, who unfortunately, like some of his colleagues, was the object of an attack by terrorists who wanted to end his life and therefore prevent him from freely expressing his ideas."
"I therefore agree with the amendment tabled by my fellow Members, Mr Galeote and Mr Salafranca."
"Mr President, I speak as a journalist."
"I must say that everything that has happened regarding this resolution has left me somewhat disconcerted and also highly perplexed."
"General Morillon has just reminded us that, as the European People' s Party, we had decided on this initiative on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May."
"I think it is an excellent initiative because it supports those who commit themselves on a daily basis to the fight for freedom and put their own lives at risk to tell the world what is happening in vast areas of the Least Developed Countries or even - it is worth remembering - in Eastern Europe."
"Then something absolutely regrettable happened. Someone thought of exploiting this excellent initiative for their own ends, bending it to a partisan political position, a political position that has emerged too often in this House, in my opinion."
"I do not even want to waste words on this."
"Last Sunday, 18 million Italians gave their answer."
"I just want to see the result of all this. The likely result is that a fine, important testimonial will lose much of its importance because of the aloof detachment of the world of the media, which prefers to report conflict rather than the exchange of ideas."
"Above all, the role of this institution has been renounced and less and less respect is shown for politics."
"We only believe in the politics of values and the exchange of ideas; we do not believe in the politics of venom."
"Venom has never produced anything in history, and in general it has never rewarded those who have used it."
"We only believe in positive values."
"Mr President, it is unlikely that a government that imprisons its own journalists should be democratic to such an extent as to guarantee a fair trial in accordance with international standards, and so I shall have more confidence in monitoring."
"To insist on the principle of the freedom of the press is obviously right and proper, but I remember the comments when the first law on the freedom of the press was passed in the Soviet Union."
"The journalists then asked: who will give us the money to publish newspapers?"
"The matter has still not been settled."
"I mention this problem since our draft resolution notes the decline imposed on the press in Russia and also deplores the attacks on diversity and freedom."
"I should like to add that the problem of the press is part of the struggle for power."
"In Russia the press subsidised by millionaires put Mr Yeltsin into the presidency, but the political line of that time is not to the taste of today' s leaders and the same millionaires are now either in the dock or abroad."
"Freedom of the press certainly played a part in the event, which, nevertheless, is primarily a stage in the struggle for power."
"I should also like to add that media science increasingly points to the so-called editorial routine as something that affects the free press."
"Individual journalists accept work where they can find it, and they adapt to the prevailing editorial climate and ideas even when these contrast with their own personal ideas."
"Turning conformists into saints, however, is not a job that can be regulated by resolutions."
"Here, of course, I should like to remind you of point number 10 in the draft resolution concerning conflict of interests, an issue that, as we all know, has been talked about a lot recently on the occasion of the Italian elections."
"It is said that governments should keep a scrupulous eye on conflicts of interest and ambiguous relations between editors and the proprietor."
"However, when the president and the proprietor are the same person, what can be done, Mr President?"
"Mr President, thank you, also for this piece of advice."
"Freedom of expression and particularly the independence of the media help guarantee and promote democracy in the world."
"The persecution of journalists in their profession is a sign of incapacity to respect a democratic structure, but this is a rule rather than an exception."
"Even today, journalists around the world are the subject of censorship, physical sanctions and infringements of personal dignity."
"In many cases, the journalists involved get killed."
"The problem lies, of course, in Russia where, since Putin took up office, we have seen fresh developments in Russia' s post-Soviet media market."
"The trend is clear."
"The Kremlin is trying to impose its will on Russia' s national networks ORT, RTR and NTV, and to develop an ideology in which the media will only be able to advertise State interests."
"We were able to witness this again recently when on 10 May, the Attorney General burst in on Echo Moscow, a radio station, and confiscated all financial and commercial documents."
"Where this will end in Russia, we do not yet know, but it is clear that that country' s democracy is in crisis."
"Needless to say, we also need to keep a watchful eye on democracy in Europe."
"The President of Italy has been mentioned a moment ago, who owns a company which owns, inter alia, three television channels, as well as the largest national publishing house, which, in turn, publishes magazines that support that politician."
"I find the initiative of Mr Van den Berg (PSE) an interesting one to contemplate."
"In fact, we should also be aware that this phenomenon not only occurs in Italy, of course."
"Maybe in England too, there is a media monopoly, and that is to the advantage of the Social-Democratic government in the light of the pending elections."
"There are similar developments in other countries too."
"It seems to me to be a good idea for the European Parliament to look into this issue and to see what it can do about it, for it concerns us all."
"Mr President, press freedom is undoubtedly one of the bases of any functioning democracy."
"I believe - also in my capacity as a journalist - that this is summed up very neatly in the motion."
"Yet if we look at freedom of information, we need to go a step further than simply guaranteeing that every journalist can practise his or her occupation without external influence."
"The public's freedom of information, however, is restricted to some extent even in some countries which guarantee freedom of the press."
"This is due, for example, to the financial relationships between media owners, but also an absence of journalistic responsibility."
"For example, it is worrying - even if it does not constitute a direct restriction on press freedom - that some magazines have now set up their various departments, including their political departments, as profit centres, which means that the political editors are now responsible for generating advertising revenue in their sections of the publication."
"There are also implications for press freedom if - as in Austria - a daily newspaper changes the political focus of its reporting when it is saved from bankruptcy by a bank with close links to a particular political party."
"There is one further problem in particular, namely the growing tendency to separate information from commentary."
"The result is a kind of 'readers' letter' journalism, which means that even in supposedly independent newspapers, we are tending to find little else but the opinions of journalists who are influenced by the owners and their interests."
"However, in order to guarantee the right to information, it is essential that there is freedom of information for the general public as well as freedom of the press."
"As the European Parliament, we have an obligation to monitor compliance with press freedom in all countries of the world."
"Perhaps we should respect the public's right to diversity and freedom of opinion to a greater extent in future too."
"Mr President, a resolution on the freedom of the world press makes no sense unless it contains, firstly, the solidarity of this Parliament with a Basque, Spanish and European journalist, Mr Gorka Landaburu, the recent victim of an ETA attack immediately following the Basque elections. Secondly, it should contain a clear call for the protection and guarantee of the freedom to exercise the profession of journalist, threatened as it is - and this is something that Parliament should be aware of - in a part of Europe, the Basque Country."
"Mr President, the political wing of ETA was severely punished at the ballot boxes, and what was its response?"
"The immediate response of this criminal organisation, once again, was to intimidate, threaten and make an attempt on the life of a journalist who was doing nothing more than defending the values on which European society is based, defending peaceful coexistence and defending the freedom of the Basque people."
"The enemies of freedom of expression, of democracy and of life do not deserve to be citizens of the Europe that we are building on such strong foundations as freedom, security and justice for those who live and move around in European territory."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the aim of the amendment that my group is tabling and which I hope will receive the support of the political groups in this House, and I also thank Mr Sánchez García for announcing it."
"Mr President, I should like to start by making a brief comment on Ethiopia."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that this issue has been tabled for debate here."
"The Commission took part in a diplomatic representation to the Ethiopian government on behalf of the Union on 26 April, during which it expressed its regret at the loss of life during the riots which took place last month in Adis Abeba and elsewhere in Ethiopia."
"It also regretted the violent action on the part of the security forces."
"The diplomatic representation called on the government to clarify recent events by carrying out a comprehensive, neutral investigation."
"As far as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is concerned, the Commission is still urging both countries to give the peace mission under the patronage of the UN and the OAU their unrestricted support."
"It expects both governments to guarantee the UN mission full freedom of movement, actively help with mine clearance, release all prisoners of war and internees and start demobilising a large part of its strike forces."
"The EU has supported the efforts of the UN mission by monitoring developments in both countries continuously and maintaining close contacts with the parties involved."
"It has made declarations proposing the process and - where necessary - voicing its concerns."
"The Commission thinks this is the best way of supporting the efforts of the UN."
"The Commission expressly welcomes the initiative of the religious leaders to visit areas on both sides of the border and start a reconciliation process."
"This decisive process should, in its view, be promoted and shaped by the people concerned."
"At the present time, the Commission considers a formal summit organised by the international community to be premature."
"On Cameroon, I should like to say that the Commission is monitoring the human rights situation in Cameroon closely and notes that this country has started democratising its society and institutions."
"There have been very positive developments in the area of human rights and civil freedoms."
"We also note, however, that the various players still have insufficient knowledge of and fail to respect these new rights properly."
"Cameroon has ratified the convention against torture and was the subject of a report by the committee against torture presented in November 2000."
"In addition, a national committee on human rights and fundamental freedoms has been set up in Cameroon, albeit with restricted functions, and a regional centre for the promotion of human rights has been set up in collaboration with the United Nations."
"The European Community has supported Cameroon within the framework of the Lomé Convention with a grant of EUR 6 million for institutional reform in the area of the rule of law, democratisation and respect for human rights."
"It has also examined a support programme in the area of the criminal justice system."
"We are supporting reform of the justice system and stronger responsible leadership of the institutions in coordination with Bretton Woods, with a special endowment from the preliminary financial framework of the ninth European Development Fund."
"Specific funding is also being granted under the ninth European Development Fund in order to support non-state players, especially associations and non-governmental organisations working in the government and to promote human rights and strengthen the rule of law."
"As part of the Cotonu agreement, the Commission is pursuing a positive approach based on dialogue and does not feel that there is any justification for starting consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonu agreement."
"The situation is being monitored on the ground together with the Member States."
"The government has set up a committee of inquiry, the findings of which will be carefully analysed by the Commission and the Member States."
"I should like to say on the last topic in this human rights debate that freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press are, without doubt, absolutely vital to a democratic society and that the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion can only be exercised where there are several media."
"Where this is not the case, there is either no democracy at all or democracy is under threat."
"Threats to the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion throughout the world are one of the most distressing aspects of our international work."
"Like Parliament, the Commission also takes rampant persecution and the repression of freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press very seriously."
"It starts with conditions in the media, as some members of the House have described in connection with Russia, and ends with terrorist attacks on journalists, as reported yesterday from the Basque country."
"However, I am in the happy position of being able to tell the House that the Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, the youngest brother of the Director-General of the Commission responsible for enlargement, has survived the attack."
"He is seriously injured but, thank God, he will survive."
"This clearly illustrates that journalists are the target of terrorist tactics because all extremist organisations throughout the world rightly perceive freedom of the media and freedom of opinion as their most serious threat."
"I should like to report briefly that the Commission took a position on freedom of opinion, freedom of worship and freedom of belief at the 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"The EU not only represents its point of view on the international stage, it also provides practical help from the Community budget."
"For example, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights makes provision for considerable sums to support independent media throughout the world."
"Assistance ranges from training measures for journalists to media monitoring."
"Over EUR 5 million was provided out of the 2000 budget for projects relating to freedom of opinion, freedom of the media and protection and training for journalists."
"A major project in Asia and Africa, which is being implemented in collaboration with Reporters sans Frontières, addresses some of the main risks to which journalists are exposed, as listed in Parliament's resolutions."
"The project makes provision for an assessment of the situation of imprisoned journalists, financial support for these journalists and their families and information and public awareness campaigns."
"Support under the European initiative should continue."
"The call for proposals in January 2001 expressly included the subject of freedom of opinion as one of the priorities."
"Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Forced labour by African children"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5­0359/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs Lucas, Mr Rod and Mrs Schörling, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on trafficking in children;"
"B5­0365/2001 by Mr Van den Berg, Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and Mrs Carlotti on behalf of the PSE Group, on forced labour of African children;"
"B5­0372/2001 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE­DE Group, on trafficking in children (ship from Benin);"
"B5­0379/2001 by Ms Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on child slaves in Africa;"
"B5­0389/2001 by Mr Sylla, Mr Miranda, Mr Herman Schmid, Mrs Morgantini, Mrs Frahm, Mr Alavanos and Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on forced labour of African children;"
"B5­0393/2001 by Mr Andrews, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Segni, on behalf of the UEN Group, on forced labour of African children."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if 43 children are found on board a ship, which is taking them away from home to work in plantations in another country, our hearts bleed, with good reason."
"We thought that slavery had been stamped out, but it continues to exist, and the most shocking form of slavery is, of course, the trafficking in children and the trade in child slaves."
"Children are being shipped off to work on plantations."
"Children are being abducted to be trained as soldiers, to carry weapons, to become a killing machine or to provide sexual services."
"Children are orphaned at an early age if their parents die of AIDS, and are then hired as house slaves of those who supposedly take care of them."
"In short, children are often slaves."
"Nevertheless, Africa is not traditionally considered a continent where it is customary to sell children."
"Abject poverty is at the root of child slavery, and child labour contravenes the Treaty on the Rights of the Child."
"Echoing what is stipulated in the resolution, I would therefore call on the Commissioner to focus on, and put an end to, the networks which set up the trafficking in children, to launch reintegration programmes for rescued or escaped children, but also for former child soldiers and street children, and above all, I would urge you to help ensure that the products of Africa are sold at a fair price, so that the parents can work, and can let their children go to school, as that is what is supposed to happen."
"May I ask the ladies and gentlemen in the galleries not to clap."
"It is not customary in a Parliament, although it is, of course, very nice of you to show your support for Mrs Maes' speech."
"However, I must ask you to observe the democratic rules of play here in Europe."
"After all, we are all Europeans."
"Mr President, over the past few months, we have witnessed the sad fate of children, uprooted from their homes, travelling on a slave ship off the coast of West Africa."
"As we established when we attended the parliamentary meeting in Gabon within the framework of the ACP-EU, these children are from various neighbouring countries and are taken to elite families in Gabon, for example, where they work in the household."
"They are farmed out by the 'aunties' - for that is the nice word for it, go-betweens, if you like - among those families."
"That means that they end up being slaves in those households, that they do not get any schooling, that they have to work from early in the morning until late at night, and that they are simply being robbed of their freedoms as a child."
"That contravenes all kinds of ILO Treaties."
"It is also fundamentally at odds with the Cotonou Agreement."
"One could at least expect that the elite itself, which often forms part of governments in the relevant ACP countries, would not take part in this practice."
"One could at least expect that according to the statutory rules of that country, action would be taken, or that they would take action amongst themselves."
"That is not done, however."
"I would therefore urge the countries involved not to classify this phenomenon under the heading of poverty, cultural tradition or 'that is how things are around here' , and therefore difficult to stamp out, but to see this to be in conflict with human rights."
"Children have human rights, which are fundamental agreements."
"I hope that we will be able to take a pro-active stance and penalise those countries, should this appear necessary."
"That is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated."
"I would also like to broaden the topic and include child labour, but I explicitly focused on this well-defined problem in West Africa."
"The violation of children' s rights should finally be a thing of the past."
"Mr President, according to UNICEF, 200 000 children are traded annually in West and Central Africa."
"Poor families in debt give their children on loan to the creditors as deposit, or to pay off their loans."
"However, because they cannot get out of the red, the children are often sold and moved to other countries."
"There they are used as household helps, unpaid workers on cocoa or cotton plantations, or employed in the sex industry."
"Child traffickers rarely get caught or punished."
"The discovery of the Nigerian ship Etireno in the port of Cotonou is probably only the thin end of the wedge."
"The international labour organisation estimates that there are 250 million child slaves worldwide."
"Surely it is unacceptable that practices such as trafficking in children and slavery still exist, and even thrive, in the twenty-first century."
"We should therefore put more mechanisms in place to track down and punish the trade in and use of child slaves."
"The legal apparatus in situ should be given far more resources and be better equipped to fight malpractices of this kind, and multinational companies must abide by the moral code not to abuse children for commercial purposes."
"At the same time, we must have the courage to tackle the underlying causes: poverty and unemployment."
"Let us hope that the pledge of debt discharge which was made at the Conference of the Least Developed Countries in Brussels this week is kept, and that our markets will at long last be opened up to agricultural products from those countries, so that we can give those people something to sell other than their children."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just heard, UNICEF estimates that there are 250 million children under the age of 14 in the world who are still working."
"In Africa, thousands are in forced labour in the coffee and cocoa plantations, the produce from which is often destined for export."
"That makes us indirect accessories to what is happening."
"Many of these countries, it should be said, have signed the convention on children's rights or the convention banning child labour."
"I think that Parliament cannot simply continue to take note of the multiplicity of legal instruments intended to ensure that children's rights are respected at international level or to issue a sort of good conduct label under the various conventions which these countries have signed unless there is a binding force somewhere."
"It is up to us to react rapidly, as has been said, by punishing or even excluding any country which violates these conventions."
"I should, however, like to point out that there are different debates, which take place at three different levels."
"There is the first level, which is the direct result of misery and unemployment, as we have heard, and it goes without saying that the IMF and the World Bank cannot continue to burden Africa with so-called structural adjustment policies."
"We know full well today that this debt hangs over Africa like a sword of Damocles and the IMF in particular needs a clear policy here."
"However, there is another debate which I think, as a parliamentarian, involves questioning if it is conceivable nowadays to keep all these conventions, all these different conventions, and accept that these countries are not going to comply with them."
"What is the point?"
"Finally, I think it is important for us to think about much more potent matters."
"In particular, I think that we should introduce a European social label which requires products from Africa and Asia to indicate their exact origin, so that we can see if they come from countries which exploit children or violate the labour code."
"Finally, I think that, as my fellow Member has said, the summit of Least Developed Countries is being held at this very moment with the European Parliament, including European leaders."
"I think that it is important for us to be able to call on them and for them to be able to take urgent measures on this form of modern slavery which affects children, children the same age as our children in Europe."
"Mr President, naturally I share what was said by my colleague Mr Fodé Sylla in his speech and by the other Members who have spoken here this afternoon."
"This problem has come to public attention due to the voyage of a boat, the Etireno, from Benin to Gabon."
"However, UNICEF had already clearly said that more than 200 000 children in Western and Central Africa were growing up in this awful way."
"When we see how European children grow up, we have to think about these African children."
"It is terrible to think that children aged between 7 and 15 are used as modern-day slaves in a wide variety of work, and sometimes for the sexual perversions of certain people."
"I completely agree with the measures that are proposed in the resolution: we need to inform consumers not to buy products that are known to be made or produced through the work of these children."
"We need to ask for a fair price and practice fair trade."
"I fully agree with the amendment tabled by my colleagues from the Green Group on the revision, with this in mind, of the World Trade Organisation standards."
"The Council and the European institutions need to work together with the countries that these children come from and go to in order to fight this horrific trafficking. Also, at the next sitting of the United Nations, which is devoted to children' s rights, the European institutions need to adopt a belligerent approach to this problem."
"As my colleague Mr Fodé Sylla was saying, recital G talks clearly about the effects of growing poverty on this problem."
"I think that we should ask ourselves if it is ethically acceptable to support a system that has such an awful effect on a sector of the population that is as weak as children are."
"Mr President, I think that we need to start thinking about whether we can allow this to happen."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like the European Parliament, the Commission is deeply concerned about the problem of trafficking in children in West and Central Africa."
"According to UNICEF figures, over 200 000 children are victim to cross-border trafficking in West and Central Africa."
"We call on the governments of these countries to do everything in their power to combat and punish the criminal practices of child traffickers."
"The Commission's strategy to combat trafficking in children and child labour is based mainly on its measures to reduce poverty in Africa."
"This is the primary objective of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement."
"I should also like to stress that the Commission is pursuing a strategy to promote food security and rural development in the countries of Africa, focusing mainly on the situation of women and children in its bid to bring about sustainable development in the countryside."
"At the same time, the Commission is funding measures which will help directly to resolve this problem."
"For example, over EUR 1.2 million have been provided to promote the rights of children and to protect children from violence and exploitation in Gabon, Benin, Togo and Nigeria."
"In addition, the Commission is funding a special project in this area in Benin, the objective being to build up a so-called brigade to protect minors, help ensure laws are implemented more efficiently and raise public awareness of this issue."
"Protecting and promoting the rights of children is one of the focal points of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2001."
"A host of other measures is being implemented by the relevant international organisations, especially UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation."
"A positive sign recently is that other countries will probably ratify the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention No 182."
"Benin ratified this convention last Monday, on 14 May, and Côte d'Ivoire should follow suit by the end of this month."
"The Commission emphatically supports these initiatives."
"The communication on human rights which the Commission adopted on 8 May 2001 contains concepts for political dialogue with partner countries."
"Most importantly, it states that, during discussions, the parties should examine how basic human rights instruments and other international agreements based on human rights can be ratified and implemented effectively."
"As far as the trade agreement is concerned, the European Union is currently enlisting support from its trading partners for these basic labour standards to be applied to child labour."
"The Commission feels that consideration should be given to additional trade preferences under the general preference system for countries which implement these standards efficiently."
"Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"I have an announcement to make."
"The services are trying to bring the debate on the Di Lello Finuoli report forward to 5.10 p.m., as suggested earlier."
"The speakers and rapporteur will be called and informed, so that we can make better use of our time."
"Floods in France"
"The next item is the joint debate of the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5­0381/2001 by Mr Le Pen, Mr de Gaulle, Mr Gollnisch, Mr Lang and Mr Martinez, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the floods in the French département of the Somme;"
"B5­0382/2001 by Mrs Berès and Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the floods in France;"
"B5­0383/2001 by Mrs Grossetête, Mr Morillon, Mr Lamassoure and Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the PPE­DE Group, on the floods in the Somme (France);"
"B5­0390/2001 by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the floods in France;"
"B5­0391/2001 by Mr Butel, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the floods in the Somme;"
"B5­0392/2001 by Mr Marchiani, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the floods in France."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, France has suffered serious flooding for several months now."
"First it was Brittany, now other départements have been affected, but it is the département of the Somme, and the town of Abbeville and the surrounding communes in particular, which have been hardest hit."
"Hundreds of residents have been forced to leave their homes, have lost all their possessions and are destitute."
"Every economic and social sector has been hit: road and rail infrastructures have sustained tremendous damage, shops and businesses have closed and farms are in serious trouble."
"There is much uncertainty as to whether they will be able to regain their original production levels."
"The persons hit hardest are those who were already the worst off and who have no family to give them financial or moral support."
"And just as we thought that things were quickly getting better, another disaster has struck and may last for several more weeks."
"The financial consequences are unquantifiable as yet."
"There is a great deal of solidarity between the local residents and a great deal of intervention on the part of the government and the French administration, the local authorities, the police, the army, rescue organisations and the community, but it is unable to absorb the effects of this disaster."
"That is why I think that Europe needs to do more than just offer words of support and compassion; we need to send out a strong message of our desire to stand by the people suffering the physical and psychological effects of this disaster."
"In order to do so, the European Union needs to provide one-off financial aid so that infrastructures can be quickly restored and economic activity can resume."
"It is also important for us to reaffirm our concern at the rise in the number of serious natural disasters over recent years both in Europe and across the planet as a whole."
"The European Union owes it to itself to do everything to respect and ensure that others respect the Kyoto commitments by the stated deadlines and to implement a policy of sustainable development."
"Mr President, having rightly expressed our sympathy and solidarity with the people who have been hard hit, especially in the département of the Somme in France, we should think about the numerous floods which have occurred not just in France, but also in Portugal, Spain and elsewhere, and about the fact that other countries may yet be affected."
"First there is the question of urgency; the previous speaker reminded us of the need to take into consideration the financial cost of the crisis in people' s lives."
"However, we also urgently need to take the measures needed to prevent the disaster caused by exceptional climatic conditions in France from turning into a crisis which permanently affects the families and enterprises in question."
"I obviously welcome the financial efforts already proposed and I hope that Europe will not be absent from them."
"We also need to strengthen our means of detection, so that we can react rapidly, and develop the best possible technologies, so that we have means of intervention which can be mobilised at once in any country of Europe."
"We have seen how far rapid reaction facilities are lacking."
"Parliament therefore looks forward to receiving the text on European civil defence, which could form the basis for transnational monitoring and solidarity."
"However, most importantly, we need to study the issue in depth."
"These disasters remind us, not that we need reminding, of just how important it is to review our regional planning policies, which will take a great deal of courage, and to implement the commitments made in Kyoto."
"Europe should not relax in its efforts to persuade its partners that a lack of respect for nature can have terrible social, environmental and economic consequences."
"For months we have heard that incessant rain has caused serious flooding in numerous regions of France."
"In the département of the Somme, where there was three times the normal rainfall between October 2000 and April 2001, several dozen communes are still under water."
"Thousands of people have been evacuated, often having lost everything."
"The damage to infrastructures, houses and crops has been put at several billion francs."
"Human and material resources have been deployed at all levels to cope with the crisis which families have been suffering for months now."
"This wave of solidarity, however, which many citizens have been involved in, is still not enough."
"The European Union should, I think, as others have already said, take an active part in this solidarity by paying emergency aid to the people affected, so that infrastructures can be restored and economic activity restarted."
"This is the main demand in the resolution by our group, which also stresses the need to step up action to protect ecosystems and fight the pollution which are partly to blame for increasingly frequent climatic disasters."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by saying that this debate is of particular interest to me because I myself live in Abbeville, the town at the heart of the area affected."
"The floodwaters are abating very slowly, as you have heard and, as I speak, 140 communes are still affected, with nearly 3 500 homes under water."
"The floods have caused huge damage - estimated at several hundred million euros."
"Houses are subsiding."
"Numerous infrastructures have been damaged or destroyed, companies have lost and must replace their means of production, not to mention the damage to the countryside itself."
"At local level, solidarity has been in evidence for a long time, providing humanitarian, food and material aid, but what the region needs most now is money."
"It is because I really am close to the ground and have been directly affected by this disaster that I called for European solidarity in Brussels on 2 May."
"Madam President gave me a positive reply and I thank her for that."
"I should also like to take the opportunity to thank the honourable Members who finally rallied to this initiative."
"For my part, I have asked the prefect of the region to allow me to help with any changes to the single programming document for the Structural Funds in Picardie, so as to find a suitable response to the problems encountered."
"I expect the same on the part of Europe: an urgent and, more importantly, a specific response to this disaster."
"This initiative should not - I repeat should not - be a simple declaration of intent."
"It should be backed as quickly as possible by practical decisions and tangible action."
"Consequently, I am delighted that the Commission, in collaboration with the local authorities, has authorised changes to the zoning of the Structural Funds so that appropriations can be channelled to all sectors of activity and to all the communes flooded."
"At the same time, I hope that it will speed up payment of these appropriations, which should normally be staggered up to 2006."
"In addition, one-off financial aid should be released by the European Union, to complement local, regional and national aid and meet the most urgent demands."
"Finally, measures should also be taken to fight the consequences of climatic change."
"The international commitments made in Kyoto should be respected by all countries without exception and I trust that the conference to be held in Bonn in July will be where this happens."
"That is the purpose of my amendment."
"Mr President, I would, of course, like to join my fellow Members in voicing our deep sorrow and our solidarity with the people who have been seriously affected by this disaster, which is unprecedented in terms of its scale and its duration."
"I am from a neighbouring region, and my father was born in Abbeville."
"I have regular contact with the département of the Somme. It is to be expected that we should express our desire for solidarity with this resolution."
"We are bound to express our sorrow when confronted with an urgent situation, with a crisis and with suffering."
"However, as well as this urgent situation, I think that we really must understand that the European Union will face problems of this kind over the long term, since the fundamental characteristic of this tragedy is, in fact, that it is not exceptional, that these events are no longer exceptional occurrences."
"We are faced with a future of sustained, unsettled weather in the same way that we talk about sustainable development."
"This crisis is not exceptional because it is going to continue."
"This is a disaster that is going to go on and on, and it will not go away."
"And this crisis is not an exception in itself, because the Somme has not been the only place in France or in Europe to be affected by the floods."
"In our capacity as Europeans responsible for European policies, we directly face the need to take action in the three main areas, namely the common agricultural policy and rural development, structural planning and structural actions, and lastly, international action designed to put into practice the commitments given in Kyoto."
"We must take both immediate and long-term action."
"The proposed resolution must not be something that we simply consider for ten minutes and which we then forget."
"We have given commitments over several years to eliminate this type of danger, to prevent this type of threat and to solve the awful problems that people face."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to join my fellow Members, who have signed this resolution, to express, on behalf of my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, our unwavering solidarity with all the people affected by the flood, and I am aware that even today, whole families are waiting to be relocated to safe new homes."
"Everything must be done in order to assist these people, who have suffered considerably."
"We can also support the observation in the resolution, which pinpoints disastrous flooding as the cause of these increasingly common situations and we have to look into the natural character of these happenings."
"The exceptional levels of rainfall do not explain everything and it is easy to attribute the repeated disasters to thoughtless planning policies which have disregarded and, all too often, still disregard the important role of the natural environment and the instability of high-risk zones, such as those liable to flooding, in alleviating flooding, for example."
"It is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this."
"It is absolutely imperative, however, that future regional planning policies incorporate this new information on environmental considerations and sustainable development, particularly within the framework of the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy."
"I therefore appeal today to my fellow Members, who are aware of these dangers, to bear in mind, when they come to vote on the guidelines for the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the ERDF, the consequences of the policies that we are implementing when we provide aid packages."
"Mr President, 114 municipalities in the Somme region are flooded, 2 800 homes are affected, more than 1 000 people have been evacuated and placed in temporary accommodation and the local economy has been paralysed. This is the toll inflicted by the floods that have hit the Somme valley."
"In addition to the understandable solidarity that has been shown towards the people who have been affected and the businesses that are, to all intents and purposes, out of action, these people are waiting for compensation to be paid out as soon as possible - in other words, as soon as the committee of inquiry into natural disasters has completed its report and issued its conclusions."
"Once the water levels have subsided, it will be time to work out who is responsible."
"For example, why has the Somme' s maintenance department not maintained the region' s riverbanks and why has the river not been dredged for decades?"
"Why have the municipalities allowed building in an area at risk from flooding, disregarding the most basic rules of land use planning?"
"Why have embankments, hedges and ditches been destroyed as part of land consolidation, which has, moreover, been carried out in favour of intensive farming?"
"Why has a reservoir not been built in the Somme bay and why have no real measures been implemented to prevent rising water levels and flooding?"
"To cite fate, high tides or exceptional levels of rainfall is not enough."
"People who are isolated, re-located in precarious conditions, deserve more than fine-sounding words from the French President or the few million given grudgingly by the French government."
"Insurance policies should, of course, pay for the damage caused by natural disasters within a reasonable timeframe, but, for the future, we must learn to respect and take account of the necessary and incontrovertible laws of nature, and prepare ourselves to prevent these natural disasters."
"The only way to respond to the suffering of the people is with practical, swift and effective action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to thank the House for its understanding of the consequences of the floods in France."
"The Commission regrets the problems and damage caused by the bad weather, which were particularly severe in the département of the Somme in the region of Picardie."
"The Commission has said that it is prepared to use all the measures at its disposal to facilitate the reconstruction of the area affected and the restoration of economic productivity."
"I refer here to measures within the framework of regional policy, agricultural policy, rural development policy and state aid policy."
"Within regional policy and rural development policy, much of the département affected is eligible under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds for the 2000 to 2006 programming period."
"The programme for the region of Picardie, which has a Community contribution of 1.7 billion francs for the period from 2000 to 2006, already contains measures against natural disasters."
"The Commission is waiting for suggestions from the French authorities and calls on the French authorities to present these proposals, so that the means provided for in the programme for the economic restoration of the areas affected can be supplied."
"As far as agricultural policy is concerned, the Commission has already taken the initiative to give producers a great deal of flexibility as regards the eligibility of aid for large scale arable farming and set aside."
"For the rest, the Commission has approved certain interpretations of current legal provisions by the French authorities."
"The Commission has also introduced measures to extend the seed time beyond 15 June."
"As far as state aid for the areas affected is concerned, the Commission shall do everything in its power within the framework of legal provisions to deal quickly with notifications of and approval for any state aid to remedy the damage caused."
"A few members of the House addressed the question of immediate assistance for families in the areas affected."
"Unfortunately, the Commission cannot see how it can accommodate this request."
"As you know, it is several years since state posts for disasters and immediate aid in the Member States were reported in the budget of the European Union and I do not think that Parliament will call on the Commission to make payments which it is not legally authorised to make."
"In view of the fact that there are other ways of providing Community aid for this sort of disaster, the Commission takes the view that it would be premature, given the financial and human resources currently at its disposal, to re-table such a proposal."
"Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"I should just like to thank all the members who took part, especially the rapporteur and the speakers, for being so flexible and attending earlier than the scheduled time of 5.30 p.m., thereby allowing us to make better use of the time available."
"Mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0145/2001) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters poses many problems, which we have tried to face and solve in the best way possible, thanks also to the input from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its draftsman, Mr Joachim Wuermeling."
"This report has not had any amendments, and this is evidence of the solidarity we felt over the proposal."
"I hope the solutions proposed may find a broad consensus in Parliament in order to give greater strength to the arguments of all those in the Council and the Commission of the European Union that share them."
"A common area of justice will only make sense if, within it, the court decisions of one Member State are effective in all the other Member States."
"In concrete terms the intention is to allow the execution in one Member State of a final decision issued by the competent authority of another Member State."
"Until today, the recognition of decisions among the various Member States has been achieved through the request mechanism, a slow, complicated process with an even more uncertain outcome."
"In addition to the obvious aim of legal certainty inherent in the rapid and effective implementation of the law throughout the territory of the Union, mutual recognition seeks to achieve not only the social rehabilitation of those sentenced, who are no longer uprooted from the country in which they have chosen to live, but also the protection of victims' rights."
"In order to set up a mutual recognition mechanism, two possible solutions could be put forward: either moving towards harmonisation of the legislative and judicial systems in the Member States, or basing the mechanism on mutual trust in the adequacy of the laws of individual states and the proper implementation of those laws in specific proceedings."
"We have opted for this latter solution, both because it is more feasible and because we are faced with legal systems which, although diverse, are based on a system of procedural rules that guarantee criminal decisions which are reliable and hence amenable to being enforced throughout the territory of the Union."
"We are, however, aware that, at least in the short term, it will be difficult to reach an agreement on a procedure for automatic recognition, since no Member State will ever be willing to associate itself with recognition of any final decision that does not respect certain essential common guarantees."
"The question is, precisely, that of the identification of these essential guarantees, such as respect for the principle of ne bis in idem, or respect for the right to an effective and not simply a pro forma defence, or respect for victims' rights."
"It will also be necessary to have common rules on jurisdiction and competence in order, above all, to prevent duplicated proceedings, just as there must be common rules for the application of penalties for re-offending or for the accumulation of penalties."
"It will, however, be necessary to remove some obstacles that today prevent full recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, and among these obstacles are the requirement of dual criminality, which often allows the competent authority in the enforcing state to re-examine the decision issued by the authority of another Member State in both form and substance."
"The dual criminality problem must be put into perspective since, in all Member States of the Union, the acts that arouse the greatest social condemnation are subject to criminal sanctions."
"There is still the option - favoured by many of us - not to apply mutual recognition to a limited number of crimes, such as euthanasia, on which it would be difficult to reach an agreement."
"This report signals a first step towards the creation of the common area of justice, freedom and security."
"The course has been traced out; now we need to find the will and the political strength to press on to the end, elevating the guarantee system to the highest possible level."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for introducing this difficult topic of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters."
"The House may be interested to learn that, according to a survey in my country, a large majority of the people are in favour of mutual recognition."
"Mr Posselt, as you see, the suggestion which you have made on numerous occasions, namely not to allow any periods to arise during which plenary has to idle, so to speak, has been applied by the parliamentary administration in a flexible manner today."
"As a result, it is again your turn to speak."
", deputising for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. (DE) Mr President, first may I say that I am delighted at this decision although, in this case, I am the one to suffer from this decision."
"I am standing in today for Mr Wuermeling, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, in which he says that it is important to make progress in relation to the recognition of final decisions in criminal matters."
"However, he also warns against overhasty and hurried centralism and considers that the Commission needs to define exactly what this means."
"Most importantly, the Commission should work out precisely what disadvantages have arisen so far because this system has not yet been developed to the extent called for in the Commission communication."
"We must admit that this is a very delicate subject."
"Because one thing we do not have in Europe is uniform criminal law."
"In my personal view, we never shall have uniform criminal law."
"That need not be a bad thing because even the United States of America, which are basically more centralistic than we imagine the European Union will ever be, even in the final stage of its development, have very different criminal laws."
"There are states which have the death penalty and there are other states which do not."
"In this respect, the EU is far more uniform."
"There is no place here for countries with the death penalty."
"Even England and Scotland have very different criminal laws and legal traditions."
"This means that not only must we be very careful in furthering unification and harmonisation while respecting diversity, we must also be very careful in how we recognise final decisions in criminal matters."
"We talk a great deal about a European community of values. And what complicates matters still further is that this European community of values is in fact drifting apart."
"One specific recent example is the euthanasia legislation in the Netherlands, with which the Netherlands have taken leave of the European legal culture hitherto, as has Great Britain on the question of cloning."
"So we are drifting apart in fundamental areas which are also relevant to criminal law."
"This will make mutual recognition more and more difficult."
"This too is a question which has to do with the different systems of values and with the different legal cultures."
"So we welcome progress in this area, but are very sceptical and simply see the problem of our drifting apart here, which is why we urgently call on the Commission to proceed carefully here, give precise definitions and simply say exactly what the need for unification consists of or what the disadvantages of the present system are."
"Of course we know that there are considerable problems today."
"However, the cases which I have quoted - and I could also have cited drugs policy as an example - show that, as far as criminal law is concerned, the European legal systems are drifting apart rather than moving together on particularly sensitive issues subject to intense public debate."
"This shows how important it is to continue our work on the area of freedom, security and justice, concentrating on the points which are really important to Europe and on the points where there is also real agreement between the Member States as regards standards in criminal law."
"Mr President, I would first like to stress that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, as this is a special report, because of the subject, because of its importance and because of something that the rapporteur highlights: it is a report to which there have been very few amendments in committee and none in the plenary sitting, which is by no means usual, particularly with reports from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and this, Mr President, is due to the rapporteur."
"It is your report, rapporteur, but all of us, and of course the Group of the European People' s Party, see ourselves in it, which is why I want to highlight two major issues."
"The first is that, if the European Union faces one challenge at the moment, if we really want to move from a market-centred Europe to a Europe of values and of citizens, that challenge is to build this area of justice."
"And if this is a big challenge, what can be more important, in this context, than for a rapporteur to take up the great tradition that has built Europe?"
"This great tradition that has led to men and women from different origins, different political ideologies and different parties, placing this general vision, this European vision, this constructive vision, above their individual interests, and combining their efforts in pursuit of a goal."
"We have before us one of those reports, and I think that this House should be proud to have produced a report which will be the point of reference over the months and years, for the work that awaits the institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"It is a report that, like all great reports, combines vision, realism and ambition."
"The rapporteur used the word 'vision' , and I am going to do nothing more than repeat what he said, but this is the essence of the report: it firmly backs mutual recognition."
"Mutual recognition, which is also based on the principle underpinning the European Union, namely mutual trust between States, which is in turn based on the Member States providing an equivalent level of protection of human rights, and in which they are seen to share the same procedures."
"Obviously, there are differences, and there are differences that need to be preserved; and that is where the rapporteur' s experience, realism and knowledge of the field come in."
"I could quote many examples."
"I have personally learnt a great deal from his thoughts on the scope of dual indictment, which he very rightly extends to dual criminality, and I hope that this will be a subject for discussion in the work that follows."
"In particular, the rapporteur mentioned the principle of ne bis in idem or double jeopardy and the solution that it offers to this considerable problem."
"I would also cite Paragraph 22, which refers to the need for common minimum standards for certain aspects of procedural law."
"As he said, we cannot expect them to be automatically recognised tomorrow without any controls or filters, but we need to move towards the recognition of some common minimum standards that will allow acceptance by means of a very rapid procedure."
"In other words, the rapporteur says 'no' to harmonisation, 'yes' to mutual trust and 'yes' to mutual recognition, but on some points there will have to be harmonisation, if not unification."
"I could also quote the comment made by Mr Posselt, that in Europe some conduct needs to be kept outside this context of mutual recognition, because it is based on very different cultural roots, such as euthanasia for example."
"I think that we have before us an important report."
"I am sure that it will receive overwhelming support in Parliament, and I hope that the two or three institutions take good note of this report, which without a shadow of a doubt, will be a milestone in this area in which we need to make progress."
"Mr President, I fully agree with Mrs Palacio."
"The excellent report by Mr Di Lello deals thoroughly with all the important aspects of a complex problem which, however, needs to be solved swiftly so that the European Union can become an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The problem of mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters arises of course from the irreducible - at least in the short term, and here I agree with Mr Posselt - diversity of the legal and judicial systems of the various countries in the European Union."
"It can therefore be solved only if on the one hand we start from precise, shared definitions of the notions of final decision and criminal matters, which can apply to all the various systems - thorough definitions that are fully satisfactory are given in both the Commission communication and the Di Lello Finuoli report - and on the other hand if mutual trust is created among the Member States regarding the adequacy of each other' s systems of laws and the correctness of their procedures."
"Now, this trust may be founded on the shared respect for fundamental rights, ensured by, amongst other things, the supervision by the European Court of Human Rights, which may be further guaranteed by common minimum standards that may be adopted on specific aspects of procedural law in matters of respect for the right to a defence or victims' rights."
"In addition, to overcome the irreconcilable nature of certain ideas of principle as regards the punishability of controversial acts - the examples of euthanasia or abortion have been given here - one simply needs to exclude mutual recognition in relation to a few limited and exceptional criminal acts."
"In this way we can overcome the traditional requirement of dual criminality and avoid the slowness and difficulties of having to decide on recognition for every decision in every country, which, I can personally assure Mr Posselt, is a slow process that really hinders the proper application of penalties, as my former experience as a magistrate can testify."
"Well, having thus properly set out the solution to the basic problem, the Di Lello Finuoli report then deals with technical and sensitive issues regarding the various ways of carrying out a sentence, the costs of carrying it out, and the system for calculating penalties in the event of multiple sentences, since they cannot always be simply added together when the crimes are connected, and suggests appropriate solutions, which can all be fully shared."
"I too therefore invite Parliament to approve this important and thoroughly well argued report without reservation."
"Mr President, in order to avoid repetition, I should like to start by referring and subscribing fully to everything that Mr Posselt has said."
"I understand the importance of the objective of the report, but am unwilling to join in the general rejoicing because I see a whole series of inconsistencies."
"This applies, for example, to the somewhat blurred use of the terms recognition, which has already been implemented in Europe to a considerable degree, and execution of final decisions."
"The discussion of certain definitions appears to be random rather than systematic, as far as I can see."
"I fail to understand why, when there are several decisions which violate the ne bis in idem principle because they deal with the same fact, the decision that is most favourable to the offender should be applied."
"I also fail to comprehend why the call for the dual criminality rule to be waived is, unfortunately, gaining ground."
"A criminal justice system which - hopefully - feels bound by the principle of legality, that is, the nullum crimen sine lege principle, cannot accept the consequences of deeds which are not punishable in its area of jurisdiction."
"Otherwise this principle would be broken and procedural convenience would take priority."
"And then it would be curtains for the rule of law!"
"I should like to add my voice to those of Ana Palacio Vallersundi and the speakers in general in their entirely justified praise for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli."
"As he knows, despite our political differences, we are pleased to point out the high quality of the work he has produced and the legal rigour of his proposals."
"In this debate, as in the one we had this morning, we are taking steps along the path traced out in Tampere to create the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In a Union where there is freedom of movement enjoyed by all the citizens, including those who act outside the law, it is important to prevent the possibility of there being penal countries."
"In relation to this legal framework on judicial decisions in criminal matters, the report deserves our applause and gives a very balanced view."
"Allow me to highlight the precision of the final judgment concept, the register of pending procedures, the idea that nobody can be judged twice for the same crime, but, on the other hand, the fact that a sentence in one Member State should be taken into consideration as a case of recidivism in another Member State, the solution in which the implementation of custodial penalties should be governed by the State that implements the sentence, whereas pardons, amnesties and declarations of the existence of the penalty or of the offence should derive from the law of the State which delivers the judgment."
"Mutual recognition, ladies and gentlemen, is only effective if it can be achieved without great administrative obstacles."
"A degree of mutual trust is therefore required between Member States concerning their judicial procedures."
"We also know that the recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters is a matter of great sensitivity that raises delicate questions and reaches to the core of values protected by law in our various societies."
"There are differences between our Member States, despite their extremely substantial, noteworthy common cultural and legal heritage."
"We must therefore recommend that the Commission should be cautious in this matter and adopt a policy of taking small steps."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by offering Mr Di Lello Finuoli my warmest thanks for and expressly welcoming this remarkable report."
"As the European Council in Tampere stressed, the concept of the mutual recognition of decisions by the courts and judicial authorities is an important cornerstone in the area of freedom, security and justice which we hope to create in Europe."
"The concept originates from the internal market."
"It is based on mutual trust in the various systems of the Member States and a number of common, underlying legal principles."
"Which is why it cannot be considered in isolation and must be complemented by other measures, such as greater harmonisation of substantive and procedural criminal law in the Member States, better mutual understanding and better training and further training."
"The Tampere conclusions called on the Council and the Commission to present a programme by the end of last year."
"The most important contribution by the Commission was last summer's communication on the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in which we set out the Commission's approach to this section of the more comprehensive area of mutual recognition."
"As this is a new and complicated issue, our communication does not aspire to find final, binding answers to the questions raised, it simply tries to point the way to possible solutions."
"What we tried to do was ask the right questions and offer possible options as to how to proceed."
"I was delighted that Mr Di Lello Finuoli's report basically shares the Commission's view and calls on the Commission to keep on the same track."
"Implementing the principle of mutual recognition in judicial cooperation on criminal matters is an ambitious task which entails a fundamental shift in perspective from traditional forms of cooperation to a cooperative division of tasks."
"This new attitude will result in a series of substantive and practical initiatives, as cited in the joint Council and Commission programme of November 2000."
"Some of the projects proposed in the programme have already been started."
"The Commission undertook in its programme of work to present proposals on facilitating extradition, including the idea of a European arrest warrant, before the summer recess."
"We are also considering whether joint standards could be implemented to protect individual rights in criminal proceedings."
"I cannot go into all thirty points of the motion for a resolution here and now."
"Although the Commission's attitude towards it is very positive overall, I should like to mention one point on which we have our doubts and which was also addressed during the debate."
"The resolution calls for full application of the ne bis in idem principle."
"The Commission supports this, especially as this principle is included in our new Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, the Commission entertains some doubt as to whether it makes sense, in cases in which there are in fact several decisions in various Member States, only ever to apply the decision that is most favourable to the offender."
"The European Council in Tampere adopted ambitions plans in the area of justice and home affairs."
"We must face the fact in our daily work that the devil is in the detail."
"Numerous details illustrate that mutual trust in the various judicial systems of the Member States has not yet developed to the point needed in order to exercise mutual recognition."
"Obviously it would be helpful to push this development forward."
"I am sure that we shall achieve the necessary political momentum if Parliament comes out clearly in favour of developing the principle of mutual recognition."
"This would perhaps add the political weight which we need, and which is lacking, in order to tip the balance in favour of more comprehensive recognition of decisions."
"It is time we put flesh on the bones of the theoretical concept of mutual recognition."
"Works councils and redundancies"
"The next item is the Commission statement on works councils and redundancies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The health and safety rules applicable to me are obviously not being applied today."
"I have hardly sat down."
"The recent persistent wave of redundancies by numerous large companies as the result of closures or restructuring measures has reached worrying proportions."
"Restructuring is often used as a euphemism for redundancies."
"These redundancies do not only affect the employees themselves, they also affect their families and sometimes, where they depend on one or two main employers, whole regions."
"As much of the recent restructuring announced has taken place at European level, there is urgent need for the Community to act."
"A comprehensive Community concept should possibly combine innovative measures with an examination of existing instruments."
"I intend at this point to confine myself to the legal aspects."
"First a word on quickly adopting new and updating existing legislation."
"In relation to the framework directive on informing and hearing workers, may I say that the Commission will complete its amended proposal on a general framework for informing and hearing workers in the next few days, so as to ensure that it can be quickly adopted in the Council."
"The Commission will press for the Council to adopt the directive on 11 June."
"We hope that a consensus will be reached."
"However, if necessary, we shall endeavour to reach political agreement by a qualified majority."
"We cannot wait for ever, especially in the present climate of insecurity created by the restructuring plans of numerous companies."
"I should like once again to emphasise a decisive aspect of the Commission proposal in this context, namely the question of sanctions."
"I know that Parliament emphatically supports this action and shares the Commission's satisfaction with the progress made recently in this sensitive area."
"With Parliament's support and the Council's strong political will, we can wrap this process up by the end of the year, which will be a decisive step forward."
"Now to the Statute for European Companies."
"We also achieved another important, long-awaited result at the end of last year: the Statute for European Companies with provisions for worker participation."
"One of the most excellent and positive aspects of the Statute is the fact that it contains joined up provisions on worker participation which reflect the progressive approach taken at national level in the proposal on informing and hearing workers."
"This will certainly help ensure that better account is taken of the social dimension when European companies are restructured."
"I am positive that the European Parliament will do everything to ensure that this legal act is adopted immediately after the summer recess."
"Finally, to the revision of the directive on European works councils."
"The Commission will revise the directive on European works councils in 2002 but will continue to examine the practical implementation of the directive in the run up to the revision."
"Globalisation and industrial change bring social problems in their wake."
"However, they can also be a source of prosperity for people and regions, if the change is designed and controlled appropriately."
"The main concern for governments and the Community is to strike a balance between promoting corporate innovation and growth, on the one hand, and preparing people for change and, possibly, the necessary protective measures, on the other."
"This was why my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, announced a check list for corporate restructuring last week."
"This check list includes political instruments already available, namely legislation, monitoring procedures, financial help and tried and tested procedures. governments and companies must make optimum use of these instruments or devise new instruments."
"Dialogue, transparency, suitable participation of workers, anticipation, risk prevention and developing employability are the key elements in a European response to this challenge."
"Let us do our very best to develop these legislative and other instruments which will help us to put our ideas into practice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission on behalf of the PPE-DE for its explanation and also for telling us that the framework directive will soon be ready, as will the Statute for European Companies."
"However, I should like first and foremost to refer to the European works council project, which our group has fully supported."
"I think the Commission is right to criticise how companies are behaving at present."
"The Commission report on European works councils, which we are currently debating in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - we have held a hearing on the subject - is most interesting."
"It proves that works councils have, as a rule, fulfilled their duties."
"We found out, interestingly, that restructuring, which may be necessary on occasions, can be implemented more efficiently if employees are informed and involved."
"In countries with more codetermination, such as Germany, there are fewer disputes and hardly any strikes in connection with structural changes to the economy."
"The spirit of cooperation and partnership which Parliament brought to bear at numerous points of the directive is such that closures and relocations cannot take place in the form of commando attacks but must be preceded by timely and comprehensive information for and consultation with the workers."
"This is often not the case."
"Ensuring there is timely information and consultation, before company decisions are taken, is a very important aspect and must be taken into account when the directive is revised."
"I hope that the Commission will introduce an initiative this year which at least ensures that the social partners are informed and involved."
"I agree with you, Commissioner, that the current rules must be tightened."
"It is not enough for sanctions to be imposed solely at national level; we also need measures at European level."
"As you rightly stressed, we need the framework directive, because in numerous cases restructuring takes place solely at national, rather than at transnational level."
"The directives on mass redundancies and safeguarding employee rights during takeovers also belong here."
"I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if there are any plans to revise these two directives as well?"
"I think that the Europe of the future is also a Europe of the workers."
"Information, consultation and codetermination rights are in keeping with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, a growing number of sudden decisions has been taken to make mass redundancies or to close down companies' sites."
"These decisions are usually taken without any consideration of alternative solutions for safeguarding jobs, and are sometimes taken by businesses making large profits, such as Danone, or they may even come about as a result of mergers, which have just been authorised by the Commission, as in the case of ABB Alstom Power."
"In several cases, employees learnt that they were to be made redundant on the radio, their representatives were only informed of the decision a few minutes before it was officially announced, and, in the case of Marks & Spencer, the decision was announced ten minutes before the opening of the Stock Exchange. I would like to welcome the Marks & Spencer employees' representatives, who are seated in the public gallery."
"These events, like those which happened at Renault-Vilvoorde, have again highlighted the shortcomings of Community legislation, when it exists, and the urgent need to adopt, at long last, a general framework to guarantee workers' rights to information, consultation and collective negotiation, in order to safeguard their rights and to enable solutions to be found, other than those that put their jobs and future at risk."
"Employees faced with these decisions must be able to count upon the European Union, on its legislation and on its institutions."
"The European Union cannot remain a framework within which the only restrictive rules are those of the internal market, competition and budgetary discipline, whilst social rules remain woolly, can be avoided and have no facility for imposing penalties if the rules are breached."
"I shall let Mrs Ghilardotti speak about the general framework on behalf of my group, and I shall focus on the two other aspects, which are the revision of the 1994 Directive on a European Work Council and procedures for mergers and acquisitions."
"The definitions of information and consultation given in the Directive on works councils are so vague that they provide no guarantee."
"To define consultation as 'the exchange of views and establishment of dialogue' is far too imprecise."
"We therefore need another guarantee to ensure that consultation does indeed take place at the right time, in other words, before decisions are taken, during the working-out phase, to ensure that the works council may give an opinion, propose other solutions, and that negotiation can be based not only on the management' s plan, but also on counter-proposals from workers' representatives."
"I believe that we must at last ensure the possibility of referral to a competent public authority on a national level, as already laid down in the 1998 directive on collective redundancies and, if required, on a European level, particularly in companies with a Europe-wide presence so that, if the procedure of information and prior consultation is disregarded, or if the decisions are blatantly unfounded and other solutions could be considered both on a social and an employment level, the competent public authority can declare the redundancy plan null and void."
"The 1994 Directive must therefore be revised - I share your view, Commissioner - otherwise this text, which was pioneering when it was adopted, will end up being obsolete in the light of the new drafts adopted by Council, on the European limited company, or by Parliament in 1999, at first reading, on the Directive on a general framework for informing and consulting employees."
"Genuine consultation obviously requires information to be readily available to workers' representatives and to be of practical value, such as the opportunity to hold meetings, to have access to experts, or to request support from unions."
"My second and final point relates to mergers."
"I do believe that we should really be able to take the dimension of employment into account, and that is possible without amending the Treaties, simply by adapting legislation, because the Treaties already set the Commission the task of monitoring the effects of these decisions on employment."
"I therefore believe that the proposed questionnaire is essential but also that workers' representatives must be able to refer to the Commission if, in their view, the merger plan is putting jobs or industrial plants at risk. I also believe that it is not only the Commissioner for Competition, but also the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs who must, if necessary, be able to question the conditions specified if they do not provide adequate guarantees for job security."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall present the ideas of my colleague, Hélène Flautre, who has had to leave in order to prepare for her visit to Algeria with our delegation."
"One year on from Lisbon, the outlook is bleak."
"The dream of a Europe in which the words 'new economy' are synonymous with growth and full employment is fading."
"The suddenness and the increase in redundancy programmes have made employees think seriously about the delays in building a social Europe."
"All companies are affected: market leaders who are long established in their fields and which act as windows onto society, such as Ericsson, Danone and Philips; players that have appeared in the wake of the liberalisation of transport, such as AOM and Air Liberté, who are making their employees pay for their failed merger and companies who carry off all the prizes for showing contempt for their employees, such as Marks & Spencer, whose employees are demonstrating today in London."
"According to the Commission, a total of over a quarter of a million redundancies have been announced across the world in the last few weeks."
"The Commission has just announced its plan to introduce a package to provide effective legal guarantees to workers regarding information and consultation."
"This is good news at a time when employees who are up in arms are joined by a public which disapproves of unilateral action by employers. We have the responsibility of setting this high-speed train in motion."
"At the same time, we must quickly adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers, in order to put an end to the scandalous practices of companies that challenge the social legislation of the Member States."
"We must revise the 1994 Works Councils Directive, give them real rights to receive advance notice of plans and to receive expert advice, and make them compulsory for all transnational companies of more than 500 employees. We must adopt the directive on worker involvement in the European company and ensure that their representatives participate in supervisory committees and boards of directors where the decisions are taken."
"Lastly, we need to reform our legislation on mergers and acquisitions, which takes no account of their social and geographical impact."
"The objective we need to pursue is a European social law that is comprehensible, workable, progressive and on a par with competition law."
"Our objective is to have a Europe that works on two fronts: economic dynamism and genuine social democracy."
"The Commission has demonstrated its will to make progress on this issue."
"All we need to do now is persuade the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I insisted that we should have the opportunity to hold this debate in light of the tidal wave of restructuring programmes announced in countries across the Union."
"It is particularly timely today because, following the recent mobilisation of employees from the Danone group in Calais, the employees of Marks & Spencer are now holding a large European demonstration in London."
"In the eyes of the public, Marks & Spencer, following its decision to close 38 shops and to make thousands of employees redundant has, like Danone, come to represent one of the most abhorrent symbols of the strategy known as 'shareholder value' , of shareholder law and of the social irresponsibility of major companies."
"This is the eighth time since the Michelin affair in October 1999 that I have spoken in Parliament to warn the Council and the Commission of the urgent need to confirm the social responsibility of companies and to establish meaningful rights for employees."
"Until now, we have merely received evasive answers extending the due date and the long-awaited revised directive on informing and consulting workers has been our Loch Ness monster: everyone has been talking about it but no one has seen hide nor hair of it."
"The European public is now demanding practical and meaningful measures."
"I feel that as far as the workers who are affected and many other people are concerned, the Union has staked part of its credibility on this issue."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I would like you to give clear answers to three questions."
"First of all, a draft, revised directive on informing and consulting workers has existed since 1998."
"You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind, quite inadequate."
"Nevertheless, the Council, to this day, refuses to review it."
"If I have understood you properly, Commissioner, you are going to push for the Council of 11 June to override the veto exercised by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and even Germany, whose Chancellor has just tried to pass himself off as a European visionary."
"You also intend, if I have understood correctly, to introduce a system of penalties for companies who breach the directive' s provisions."
"Have I understood correctly?"
"My second question is this: the directive on establishing a European works councils dates back to 1995."
"To this day, only a minority of companies concerned has implemented the directive."
"Incidentally, these bodies are basically talking shops without any real power."
"The Nice European Council stipulated that this directive should be revised, and I quote, 'by 2002' , which would require setting the procedure in motion immediately."
"I feel that the Commission' s working programme for 2001 ignores this problem."
"Why is this the case, Commissioner, and what do you intend to do now?"
"Do you plan to give this future works council real prerogatives, such as the right to suspend a restructuring plan and the time to examine an alternative project to the one laid down by the management?"
"Lastly, and with this point I shall conclude, the European Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of systematic verification that social and employment obligations are being met by every company that benefits from Community aid."
"Parliament has also requested that, each time the Commission makes a statement on a company merger plan, it makes its assent conditional on the employees' rights being respected."
"What are your plans on this matter?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I was pleased to hear that for the next Council the Commission intends to insist that the Council assume its responsibilities with regard to the directive on employees' rights to information and consultation."
"As several Members have already pointed out, it is now three years since Parliament gave it its first reading."
"In these three years we have several times in this House debated problems of redundancies, mergers and company relocations, but the Council has never assumed any responsibility, has never had the courage to face up to this subject and make a decision, adding something to the laws and other instruments that the Union has and can use to strengthen its own intervention regarding companies' social responsibilities."
"Now it seems that some countries have dropped their reservations, and so the conditions are right for the next Council to take up a position."
"The information and consultation problem is one that has something to do with the possibility of intervening in a preventive manner so that the consequences of unilateral company decisions are not such that they place jobs, working conditions or the living conditions of workers at risk."
"For this to happen, however, it is necessary to reach a precise agreement, and Parliament' s positions from this point of view were highly specific even at first reading on the methods, times and content of consultations and information."
"In addition - and I am pleased that the Commission has remembered this - there is a fundamental instrument which, paradoxically, is regarded as a fundamental element in all laws except those concerning workers, i.e. that of penalties."
"There is no law on any subject that does not lay down penalties for breach of the law."
"Only in the case of workers' rights does this still not happen in Europe."
"The directive on the right to information and consultation does lay down sanctions, and I am pleased that the Commission is maintaining this position."
"Parliament not only upholds the Commission' s position but supports the Commission in its position and I believe this matter of penalties will not only be confirmed in the Council' s positions on the directive but will extend to other legislation as well - works councils, mass redundancies - otherwise without a penalty instrument all these laws too will be less effective than we would like them to be."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this morning, the President of the European Parliament received employees from the Strasbourg branch of Marks & Spencer."
"They are seated in the gallery and I should like to welcome them."
"My fellow Members and I thought this morning that we would be able to reassure them that the dossier of the works councils and the information of workers was finally back under discussion."
"I hope that this evening' s debate clearly demonstrates our will to produce a piece of work that is consistent and which will lead to the directives in this field being updated."
"As you pointed out, Commissioner, we can no longer wait a new crisis to be announced to reassure ourselves that the legal instruments from which employees should benefit are at last appropriate, effective and provide for penalties in the event that European-level regulations are not respected."
"The Marks & Spencer employees, like those from the other companies mentioned by Harlem Désir, demand, as European citizens, that Europe establishes frameworks for protection and for organising collective action, which as we all know is the only guarantee of individual rights in the field of employment law."
"They are demanding that these frameworks be established, recognised and protected and they are placing great hope in your words, Commissioner."
"The Commission and Parliament should also, however, demonstrate their political will by making any further development of economic union and of any new regulations conditional on the implementation of social provisions that stipulate new forms of regulation such as those that we are expecting today with the revision of the directives that has been announced."
"The workers of the European Union, Commissioner, must not suffer as a result of European integration."
"They must instead be the main beneficiaries of it."
"Respect for workers' rights and the building of a social Europe are the pillars which, unless strengthened, could dash all our hopes for building democracy in our Union."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the members who took part in this debate."
"The Commission sees this debate as important support for its initiatives."
"I have the feeling that a real political tail wind is blowing and that we are in full agreement on the objectives."
"For which I also thank you."
"I should like to comment on the specific questions asked."
"First, Mr Menrad's question as to whether there are any plans to revise the directives on mass redundancies and takeovers as well."
"There are no plans to revise them, nor does the Commission consider it necessary, because the scope of the rules planned in the new directives on information and participation is such that the two directives which you mentioned will then be able to demonstrate their real worth."
"The requirements of the new directive relate to the subject of the two directives which you mentioned, and we therefore do not believe that these directives need to be revised."
"As far as Mr Wurtz's question is concerned, the honourable Member understood me perfectly correctly."
"The Commission is firmly resolved to do everything in its power now to advance acceptance of the directive on information and participation and to meet the deadline which I mentioned."
"I did indeed say that, if a consensus cannot be achieved, we shall work on getting the directive adopted by a qualified majority."
"You also understood correctly that the Commission takes the view that this directive must contain sanctions."
"You then asked if the directive on European works councils was to be revised."
"Yes, this is planned for 2002 and we have already begun to organise the preparations."
"As far as your third question on mergers is concerned, we still have to examine if and to what extent account must be taken of social aspects during mergers."
"The results of this examination are not yet ready."
"That brings us to the end of that item."
"Gas directive"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0170/01) by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure, on implementation by the Member States of the Gas Directive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU gas directive was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in June 1998, i.e. nearly three years ago, and entered into force on 10 August 1998."
"The Member States were required to transpose the directive by 10 August 2000."
"Since the directive entered into force, all the Member States have transposed it with the exception of France and Germany."
"Germany has transposed parts of the directive and is expected to complete transposition in the next few months."
"The Commission is currently examining the situation in Germany in order to ascertain if further measures are needed in this respect."
"On 17 May 2000, the French government tabled a bill to transpose the gas directive."
"However, this bill has yet to be passed by the French government."
"Until then no date for final acceptance has been set."
"According to the information received by the Commission from the French administration, no decision has been made to postpone the transposition of the directive until 2002."
"However, contrary to expectations, it was decided not to include the bill in the outstanding order of business of the French parliament for this spring."
"Even if, as we have been told, this is due to the huge workload of parliament, this delay represents a serious and regrettable development."
"The Commission therefore decided on 8 May 2001 to take France to court for failing to transpose the directive."
"Given the call by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000 for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets to be speeded up and, given the progress made in transposing the directive in the other Member States, it is regrettable that a legal basis for transposing the directive has yet to be created."
"This is seriously obstructing the development of an internal market and the creation of equal conditions of competition in the European Union."
"Even if the delays in the transposition of the gas directive in France are extremely regrettable, they are no reason to relax our efforts to speed up the liberalisation of energy in Europe or to delay the creation of an internal energy market. On the contrary, the delays demonstrate that further steps are needed and that these steps must be selected in a balanced manner in order to safeguard equal terms of competition."
"That is why it is especially important for France to get on and transpose the 1998 directive."
"The new Commission proposals are still important and urgent with respect to competitiveness, low prices for private consumers and employment."
"The Commission is therefore determined to continue to make decisive progress with this file."
"Mr President, it is a matter of great sorrow that we have to point the finger at one Member State - one of the founder Member States of this Union - for not fulfilling its solemn undertakings, for being prepared to act against the laws of the European Union and indeed for taking the law into its own hands."
"It is with real concern that we also have to point the finger yet again at the Council of Ministers: while it knows full well that Member States are not fulfilling their existing undertakings, it glibly goes on producing communiqués of fine words, which advocate even further moves to liberalisation, completion of the single market, increased cross-border trade and fair competition."
"Only this month, after the Energy Council of 14/15 May, the presidency concluded: ""There is broad consensus ..."" (does that consensus include France?) ""... that the market opening concerning both gas and electricity should be actively pursued and accelerated."""
"The presidency also declared, on behalf of the energy ministers - did that include the French energy minister? -: ""A fully integrated single market for gas and electricity cannot be achieved without efficient cross-border trade."""
"Regrettably, we hear the hollow echo of those fine but increasingly empty words at Lisbon about making Europe the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world."
"And yet in so many critical areas the will is just not there at Member State government level to implement the essentials which have been agreed through all the Union's checks and balances."
"Why should France expect the other Member States to fulfil their side of the bargain and let France take over their markets and companies, when it procrastinates repeatedly or refuses to pay its dues to the club?"
"Why should France, or any other Member State which acts in like manner, expect to reap the benefits of membership when it blatantly disregards its obligations?"
"The irony is that France is not only disadvantaging its fellow members; it is not just undermining the very essence of the European Union, the single market and fair, open competition, it is also disadvantaging its own energy-using industries."
"It is also disadvantaging its own people, especially the less affluent, who are being denied the price and the service benefits which would flow from allowing competition and liberalisation of the gas market."
"Worse even than this, however, is the cynicism of the Council's communiqué after the May Energy Council."
"It did not dare to mention this impasse caused by one of those members actually sitting at the table, but glibly committed itself, including, I assume, the French energy minister, to further, bigger and faster liberalisation of the energy markets."
"Can we believe a word it says?"
"Where stands the credibility of the Council and the whole European Union?"
"At the very least, it is the Commission's solemn duty to uphold Community legislation and not to be browbeaten in any way by powerful and intransigent Member States or arrogant political forces."
"If Member States cannot be trusted to fulfil their obligations, then, sadly, the only option is to bring to bear the full force of Community law and to exact substantial retribution."
"Will the Commissioner please assure us that such steps will be pursued assiduously without any grace or favour?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question that was asked directly concerns the French situation and the answers that have been given make this quite clear."
"Although it is quite true that the French government has not yet begun, even now, to incorporate the European directive on liberalising the gas sector, it is nonetheless true that in practice, the conditions for exercising free competition have been met."
"It is not quite accurate to say today that the French gas market is not open to competition."
"The French government has opted to incorporate this directive in a measured and gradual way, which provides a greater opening for the major eligible clients, including the chemical, electrolysis or steel industries, for example."
"This position is no different, however, from that of the German government, which expressed its views at the Stockholm European Council and thereby sought to demonstrate its concern to develop an alternative in Europe to what here we would call the British blueprint for totally liberalising the energy sectors."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us make no mistake about this."
"What is at stake here is maintaining a public service in its role as a tool for social and territorial cohesion."
"We take the view that incorporating the European directive must, therefore, be an opportunity to produce a precise, updated and ambitious definition of what we mean by 'public service' , which is a concept we have often debated in this House."
"I would also like to talk about energy policy, environmental protection, sustainable development, security, social and territorial solidarity and also about local development, about developing balance between geographical areas and about everyone' s right to energy."
"For all of these reasons, Commissioner, I ask the European Commission to quickly carry out a preliminary assessment, even before the second phase of liberalising the markets begins, so that we can preserve the European energy public service sector."
"I have also taken good note of the European lesson given on this matter by my British fellow Member."
"Where the dispossessed are concerned, however, Mr Purvis, those who would not benefit, as you say, from the gas sector being liberalised, I can reassure you today that, in my country, no one needs to suffer as a result of the situation in place there."
"Mr President, the Commission has decided to haul France up before the Court of Justice because of its delays in liberalising the gas market, as laid down in the 1998 directive."
"Opening up the energy sector to competition is indeed vehemently opposed by the unions, which reject the idea that the right to energy should be regulated by the dictates of money."
"In 1997 and 1998, our group opposed this directive."
"Because we refused to accept the creation of a system based on competition, we proposed guaranteeing a fair supply at the best price, the fair treatment of users and a standardised system of charges."
"Energy is of strategic importance to the Member States' economies and should not, therefore, be considered to be a commodity like any other."
"If we implement the directive suddenly, we risk putting all gas operations solely in the hands of huge multinational groups, and thereby seeing the conditions of public service deteriorate."
"Once again, it has to be said that the Commission appears to be in more of a hurry to see the principles of free competition applied than to worry about the fate of employees."
"Instead of contributing to speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation, should the Commission, when presented with any new proposal, not undertake a study of the consequences of plans for liberalisation on employment, on working conditions and regional planning?"
"I therefore call on the Commission to renounce its dogmatic position and to withdraw its charges at the Court of Justice."
"The debate is closed."
"The Commission has declined to respond to any of the questions that have been put."
"Therefore we will adjourn until the vote at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 6.20 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)"
"VOTE"
"The next item is the vote"
"Report (A5-0145/2001) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters (COM(2000) 495 - C5-0631/2000 - 2000/2295(COS))"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I am not sure whether it is too late to raise this point, but there is a point concerning translation, given that Italian is the original version of the Di Lello Finuoli report."
"Throughout the text, the word 'execution' is used, meaning, of course, execution simply in the sense of carrying out a penalty."
"However, in relation to criminal matters, in ordinary English 'execution' has a very particular meaning and one which attracts considerable hostility in this House and goes against our views on human rights."
"I think an equally good English translation of the Italian would be 'implementation' rather than 'execution' , and that it would be wise to use the word 'implementation' rather than 'execution' throughout."
"You make a very valid point."
"We will ask the services to have a look at the original Italian text to make sure there is no misunderstanding on that point."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, my youngest daughter, Cristina, who is studying law, phoned me and said, 'How will you vote on this Di Lello Finuoli report?"
"I hear it is a first step towards a European code of criminal procedure and a European code of civil procedure.'"
"'Cristina, I am a Europeanist!' I replied."
"'So I will vote for it, even though I know you are very lazy in sitting your exams and you will take another six years before you graduate in case law.'"
"'Great!"
"Now all the MEPs know that I am not keen on studying."
"What an impression you have given the other MEPs of me!'"
"'Don' t worry,' I told her."
"'You study hard for the next three years, and as soon as you graduate I will tell them so they can all give you a round of applause.'"
". (NL) Matters such as conscription, the use of soft drugs, the obligation to carry an identity card, abortion, euthanasia and the recognition of same-sex marriages are regulated very differently in the different Member States of the European Union."
"Something which may be against the law in one Member State, is not in another."
"This proposal does not alter that, with good reason ; even within the federation of the United States, the penalty for offences and crimes is very different because these matters are decided upon at a lower level."
"That does complicate things if judgments from one Member State are to be carried out in another Member States."
"Should people be locked up for an action which is not punishable in the relevant country, and should the indignation which inevitably ensues be broken up with police violence?"
"The proposal creates no problems if the action for which a ruling has taken place is punishable in both Member States and if the same penalty applies."
"I regret that precisely this principle of 'dual criminality' has been rejected in the report, even if I can appreciate that this gives major criminals less opportunity, by means of expensive lawyers, to sabotage and delay the course of justice."
"Only because recital EE provides for possibilities for exclusion due to differences in national legislation, am I prepared to give this proposal the benefit of the doubt."
"I said to you once before that by the end of this Parliament we all expect to know most of the issues that your family has to face."
"That concludes the vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 17 May 2001."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, on 24 May, Mr Santiago Oleaga, financial director of the Basque daily newspaper, El Diario Vasco, was killed in San Sebastian by seven bullet shots to the back."
"The day before, terrorists had again attempted to kill a security officer at the University of the Basque Country, by placing a bomb underneath his car, which fortunately failed to go off."
"When the news of Mr Oleaga' s death was announced, I immediately expressed, on my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament, my sincere condolences and our support to the victim's family and colleagues."
"Unfortunately, ETA has once again revealed its true colours, namely its preference for blind terrorism that rejects democracy and scorns all types of freedom, including one of the most fundamental, which is freedom of expression."
"I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Agenda"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The draft agenda has been distributed and the following changes have been proposed or made, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure."
"First of all, I have two pieces of information to give to you."
"Mr Busquin will present the Commission statement on the specific programme implementing the Framework Programmes 2000-2006 of the European Community, on the one hand, for research, technological development and demonstration activities, and of the European Atomic Energy Community, on the other hand, for research and training activities."
"I would also inform you that the report by Mr Hans-Peter Mayer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has been withdrawn from the agenda, because it has not yet been adopted by the competent committee."
"With regard to the joint debate on environment policy, the Council has informed us that the Swedish Minister for the Environment, Mr Larsson, wishes to attend the debate on the report by Mrs Hulthén."
"Therefore, with the agreement of the political groups, the joint debate will be brought forward in the agenda and will be dealt with before the report by Mrs Myller, also on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a Community Environment Action Programme."
"Lastly, I would like to inform you that the deadline for tabling requests for separate, split and roll-call votes has been brought forward to 4 p.m. today, which has also been done at the request of the political groups and with their full agreement."
"(The order of business was adopted thus amended)"
"Madam President, in the last few days an agreement has been reached on a European bill to combat paedophilia."
"I would point out that this agreement comes a little late considering the thousands of signatures we have had the honour of presenting to you on this issue, and considering the growth of this phenomenon which has struck down so many thousands of children, as it did recently in Italy."
"We want quicker justice and tougher legislation."
"In fact, all too frequently, economic interests and political connivance lie behind this filthy crime, which marks the lives of thousands of children forever."
"We want Parliament to urge the Commission and the Council of Ministers to mount a great campaign against paedophilia, including regulating the use of the Internet, too often the vehicle of paedophiles."
"Children all over the world, but especially in Europe, are calling on Parliament to make its voice heard."
"We cannot rely solely on late, restrictive documents. We must start to take effective action."
"Madam President, I wanted to bring up the issue of a very important meeting which took place yesterday with Justice and Home Affairs ministers, where agreement was made in relation to people' s privacy and their right to privacy, their fundamental rights in access to telecommunications."
"This is what is called ENFOPOL 29."
"It has never been discussed in this Parliament."
"There was a discussion on ENFOPOL 98 about re-writing international user requirements, but this is very different."
"It is interpreting the existing requirements and how they will be used within the EU."
"It is completely unacceptable that far-reaching decisions have been taken by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs ministers when there has been no debate in this Parliament on the subject."
"These decisions will affect us all and will affect everybody outside this Parliament: people will not have the right to privacy, and this is an issue that should be raised right across the board."
"It is a fundamental rights issue."
"(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)"
"Madam President, I should like to address the same issue."
"The bad thing about the renewal of these ENFOPOL plans is that they go much further than was planned three years ago."
"It will no longer only be traffic data and content data - that is the header of an e-mail and the content - that are monitored, but many, many more details down to credit card details, and IP-ports, which would enable everything on the computer to be monitored."
"In other words, there would be no part of the communication that was not monitored."
"That was not even mentioned in the documents before the Council."
"We have no way of getting hold of the information!"
"It appears that, because of a formal error, the actual decision has not yet been taken."
"It can be taken at any time, however, and no further meeting is required for the purpose."
"I should like to repeat the call. We need to debate this."
"We have just had a committee of inquiry into Echelon and we are angry that the NSA and other secret services are violating fundamental rights."
"What is happening is that something much worse is being planned in the EU and absolutely everything can be monitored!"
"(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)"
"Every time Madam President speaks on the Basque country, she brings to this House the picture of sadness and pain, which is very regrettable."
"This is why I systematically join this assembly in mourning the victims - all the victims - of our more than a century-old conflict."
"We ought to realise that it is not easy to find an exit to one of Europe' s darkest political tunnels, especially if we stick to the same paths."
"We must definitely try something new and we, Euskal Herritarrok are eager to give all the help we can."
"Madam President, with your permission I am going to read a paragraph from the editorial published in the Diario Vasco [Basque Daily], the financial director of which, Santiago Oleaga, was murdered by ETA."
"This paragraph says: 'There is no doubt about the purpose of Santiago' s murderers."
"They killed him with an indescribable sadism in order to spread unease and fear amongst the professionals who work in the different media which ETA has targeted."
"The terrorists, however, could not have chosen a more suitable victim to demonstrate the ultimate intention of its action: to silence the messages of those sections of the media in order thereby to silence a whole society to the point that it comes under the control of its abominable tyranny' ."
"Madam President, I believe that the greatest homage we can pay to Santiago Oleaga is to express our firm rejection of those people who wish to impose that abominable tyranny on us and also express our complete disdain for its spokespeople."
"Specific technological R & D programme"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the specific technological research and development programme."
"It is my pleasure to give the floor to Mr Busquin."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission approved its proposals for the specific programmes of the Research Framework Programme 2000-2006."
"A communication on the possible use of Article 169 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to implement the Framework Programme was also approved."
"The specific programmes are the instruments for implementation."
"Therefore, the Commission' s proposals contain nothing other than the proposal for the Framework Programme, which must be adopted under the co-decision procedure. The proposals do, however, provide some clarification."
"As you are aware, the Commission approved the Framework Programme on 21 February 2001, and this new Framework Programme is specifically designed to help create the European Research Area."
"I would like to reiterate the main principles."
"Within this context, we presented the Framework Programme with the determination, on the one hand, to focus efforts on a limited number of priorities where Community action would present the greatest added value."
"We are also endeavouring to give some structure to the research that is carried out in Europe, through greater interaction between national activities, in order to create a more consistent European Research Area."
"We also believe that the management of our Framework Programmes must be made more easy and simple in terms of the means of intervention in place."
"In order to implement the Framework Programme, we are proposing a structure based on five specific programmes."
"This structure is a faithful reflection of that of the Framework Programme and translates the political project into reality."
"This structure is as follows: a programme on 'Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area' which brings together all the activities involving research and coordination of research policies in Europe; a programme on 'Structuring the European Research Area' which covers activities involving the integration of research and innovation, the mobility of researchers and infrastructures and issues relating to science and society, and the links between science and the public - all increasingly burning issues within European society."
"We also have a programme covering Euratom research activities and then two programmes covering the activities of the Joint Research Centre, in the non-nuclear and nuclear fields respectively."
"The content of the proposals aims to provide clarification with regard to the scientific and technological content, which is presented in much more detail than in the Framework Programme."
"These proposals, however, also concern the new instruments of implementation, which are central to the philosophy of the Framework Programme 2002-2006, the creation of networks of excellence and integrated projects."
"Further details regarding the way this will operate will be provided in the rules for participation in and dissemination of the Framework Programme adopted under the co-decision procedure, the proposals for which the Commission will present at a later date."
"I also said that with regard to the communication on the implementation of Article 169 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has never truly been applied, we have put together some suggestions on practical ways in which the Community might participate in jointly implemented national programmes."
"This is the meaning of Article 169."
"Our aim is, therefore, to launch a political debate on this issue."
"On the basis of these initial results, the Commission intends to present a proposal at a later date, on a framework decision on the general conditions for Community support within the context of Article 169 and the possible areas where this could be used."
"Madam President, I think that it is true to say that this is the first time that the Commission has presented its proposals for specific programmes so quickly after having presented the proposal for a Framework Programme."
"We believe, therefore, that we are responding to a request by Parliament with the aim of facilitating political debate, by providing this further clarification."
"This information also includes accurate and clear details, since the new instruments require this, and we have also planned an information session with the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 5 June 2001."
"I believe, therefore, that we will have done everything possible to enable Parliament and the Council to approve, within the specified time frame, the new Framework Programme that is a tool for creating the European Research Area, which, in my opinion, is widely supported by the European Union."
"Thank you, Mr Busquin, for your statement."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner warmly for his explanation and particularly for the fact that he managed to adhere to the agreed deadlines."
"That is a major achievement."
"I should also like to ask him if he could answer the questions put to him by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as soon as possible."
"That will, in turn, enable us to adhere to the deadlines, which is very important in my opinion."
"I have two explicit questions to put to the Commissioner."
"Firstly, in the specific programme, the most important research, and thus the money, is earmarked for the human genome and biotechnology."
"This may be a major area of research, but the results will only become evident over a ten- to fifteen-year period."
"At present, many EU citizens still die, unfortunately, of the three well-known diseases, namely cancer, heart and vascular diseases, and signs of ageing, such as Alzheimer' s."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has expressed a growing need for a separate life-science programme within the context of the human genome and biotechnology."
"I should like to find out from the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to help us think about setting up a programme of this kind."
"My second question to the Commissioner is of a technical nature: the Commissioner delivered a comprehensive explanation with regard to Article 169 of the Treaty."
"Why does he not apply Article 168 of the Treaty?"
"Surely that would be a far more practical approach."
"Madam President, I would like to say to Mr Van Velzen that the questions were officially sent to us on Monday 28 May 2001 and that we shall do everything possible to answer them before the end of the week."
"You shall, therefore, have the answer at the beginning of next week, I assure you, and we will be able to continue the debate on these issues."
"With regard to the two more specific questions, Mr Van Velzen has quite rightly mentioned health problems, including both degenerative neurological diseases and cancer problems, and he will see that, if these specific programmes are approved, there is the prospect of carrying out European added-value research on this issue, within the context of genomics and health."
"For example, there are opportunities in the specific programme to undertake clinical trials for cancer and degenerative diseases, which are some of the new possibilities opened up by genomics."
"This does not mean, however, that they cannot be begun immediately, since there is an undeniable European added value."
"Regarding Article 169, as I mentioned, we have produced a document, which is launching the debate along these lines, and we shall explain why Article 168 is not used in the same way."
"Mr Van Velzen will be given a very clear answer to this in the answers to the questions."
"Madam President, I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on this proposal."
"If I understand you correctly, however, this Sixth Framework Research Programme contains far fewer specific programmes than the fifth and I should like to ask you why?"
"What are the reasons?"
"We therefore have fewer specific programmes for the sectoral themes."
"Up until now, we had one for biotechnology, one for energy, one for the environment, and so on. In future that is all going to be under one roof."
"Are you not afraid this will make the framework research programme less visible?"
"Is there not also a danger that the lobbies representing various professional groups and sectors will be less involved in the Sixth Framework Programme because they are not clear what area it falls under?"
"My question is: Can you give us the reasons why you have fewer specific programmes this time than last?"
"I would like to say to Mr Linkohr that the aim is to move towards a European Research Area, and, therefore, to give more structure to research at this level, and he is one of the first within Parliament to have said to me that we should avoid spreading research too thinly."
"The Framework Programme represents a considerable amount of money, but it only equates to 5% of public spending on research in Europe."
"We must not, therefore, expect the Framework Programme to fund all European research."
"What the programme can do is to contribute to acting as a catalyst for European research and to give it greater consistency."
"If the approach that we adopt is focused on too many sectors, we will then end up with many different measures and our efforts will be too dispersed."
"We have therefore attempted to tackle the problem by dealing with priority issues first."
"I have just mentioned the problem of genomics, which affects many subjects relating to health and biotechnology, but in the field of nanotechnology, with which Mr Linkohr is very familiar, which is, in other words, developing technologies using more intelligent processes and materials which waste less energy and matter, a large number of sectors will be affected, including the automotive and the aeronautics sectors."
"We are, therefore, aiming for consistency rather than to cover a whole range of problems."
"I do believe that this issue concerning the number of specific programmes should not prevent a dialogue on the content of the priorities."
"We will, obviously, be able to go into much more detail in the content of the priorities."
"You will see that we will make a further step forward by approving the specific programmes."
"I believe that the dialogue established with the Commission will enable us to further clarify this determination to create the European Research Area."
"I think that the current shortcomings are well known."
"We are spreading our resources too thinly and Europe does not have a critical mass to devote to the main research objectives, in contrast to other developed countries such as the United States and Japan, and so we must create this critical mass."
"The European programme can help to achieve this, with new provisions, such as improved networking of national programmes."
"We must encourage coherent action."
"It is, to some extent, because of this that there are not as many catalogues of specific programmes in each area."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation."
"Nevertheless, I should like to take the liberty of disagreeing with him as regards his last answer and to side with Mr Linkohr: whether a programme comprises twenty different topics or constitutes one specific programme, each programme must be assessed on its own merits, and must have its own scope and budget."
"It then appears less ambiguous to me for those who subscribe to these programmes if these programmes are kept more separate."
"That was not my question, however."
"Like Mr van Velzen, I would like to ask when we will be receiving a response to the questions we have put to you in writing."
"You, as no other, know how often I have asked the Commission on what basis certain priorities in the Framework Programme are, in fact, used and what criteria have been used in the process."
"I, nor anyone else who has asked similar questions, have ever received a response to that question."
"I hope that this will now change."
"As for answering the questions, I would simply like to point out that we received the questions on Monday."
"It is Wednesday today, and we shall, therefore, answer them before the end of the week."
"I think that such tight deadlines respect Parliament and the work that we are trying to do together."
"I am determined to ensure that replies are fully consistent with one another, so that dialogue becomes increasingly clear and accurate."
"With regard to the problem of choices, I believe I have told you that the main priorities, and I have already had the opportunity to answer Parliament on this issue, are, on the one hand, the work by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) and the debates held with the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES) with various representatives of the Member States' scientific councils, and, on the other hand, the general trends within the scientific and industrial community, be it genomics, nanotechnologies, the problem of the information society, food safety, sustainable development, and I agree with you on this that there should be more clarification on issues regarding transport, the environment and energy."
"The main lines were, I believe, defined in accordance with very objective criteria, and I have already had the opportunity to answer, but there has always been a choice."
"Ultimately, I am still asking the question - what else do you wish to add?"
"Let us discuss this."
"I believe that there is a degree of flexibility within the framework of the specific programmes, but only on the condition that we do not fall into the trap of following a scatter-gun approach which would compromise the coherence of the Framework Programme."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Commissioner, both for his statement and for the ongoing debate with us which he puts himself through, as we ask him a great deal of questions, but gradually we have what is needed in order to do our work, and I believe that the seminar due to take place on 5 June 2001 will provide us with further information."
"I would also like to emphasise the need to create a European Research Area, and the need for the innovation that this represents, to make the Sixth Framework Programme more flexible and easier to access."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the European added value, which we will find if there is more interaction between the countries of the European Union, namely through grants provided to young people so that they can go and carry out research and work in other Member States and discover more about themselves."
"We must also be able to maintain the values and the knowledge that we have in Europe and not just watch these go elsewhere."
"Lastly, with regard to the specific programmes, I would like to emphasise innovation, this time in the area of sustainable development."
"This is an important subject, which we discuss a great deal, but it is an area in which still too little is done."
"I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the fact that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is organising a meeting on this issue in Parliament, in Brussels and this will take place next week on 6 June."
"We would like to invite all Members to come and share their views on sustainable development, energy, renewable energy, the environment and ecology in particular, so that we can take these into account and make some proposals in this area which is of great interest to us."
"Mobility is extremely important for providing research with a truly European dimension."
"There are two aspects to this issue; firstly, obstacles preventing researchers and teachers and others from moving around at present."
"A High Level Working Group met with experts from all the Member States and submitted a report to us, which will also be discussed at the Research Council on 26 June, and will be communicated to Parliament to present all the difficulties regarding mobility encountered by the scientific community."
"As I often say, it is more difficult for a researcher who has qualified in Europe to go to another European country than to go, for instance, to the United States."
"There are, therefore, obstacles that we must try to face and to remove."
"The second aspect to this issue concerns the mobility of young researchers."
"You are aware that we have the Marie Curie programme, which is a success, but we would like to double the resources in the proposals allocated to assisting the mobility of young researchers, and also to create grants to attract researchers to Europe, so that Europe once again becomes an attractive option for the best researchers in the world including third countries."
"You will see that there are very specific proposals on the issues of mobility in the programme."
"Lastly, I believe that my final point, which is the problem of how to put into practice the elements of sustainable development, is included in the policy that Parliament, the Commission and the Council will discuss at Gothenburg."
"I believe that there is research to be done in these areas, particularly on the specific examples, in order to support the policies of sustainable development."
"Furthermore, Mr Piétrasanta, you have put forward the idea of having some specific ecosites, for example, in a specific area, which, I believe, is a good example of how sustainable development can be achieved on a local level and I think that creating a network of ecosites is something that is feasible in Europe."
"Madam President, I hope you will not rule me out of order, but I have a very specific question to the Commissioner on research."
"I rather sympathise with my colleagues who think that the way in which the new programmes are going to be organised makes it difficult to see what is actually happening."
"My specific question is this: one of the things on which research is urgently needed is the efficacy of vaccination in outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease."
"I do not know - and I conducted some research into this - what is happening as regards such research within the Framework Programme, either the present one or the one which is planned."
"It would be extremely useful for many people in Europe to know what is being done."
"I fear very much on the basis of the experience in the United Kingdom that foot-and-mouth disease is not going away and that we may be dealing with it over a long period."
"European research is therefore absolutely urgent."
"Madam President, regarding the problems of research into foot-and-mouth disease, the issue of food safety has become a priority in the new Framework Programme, as has food quality."
"We are, moreover, planning to allocate EUR 600 million to this section of the programme."
"I believe, therefore, that we will then have a greater opportunity to adapt the programmes to new problems."
"The point that we must stress is that we are able to retain a degree of flexibility and adaptability for urgent situations, which means that we will not be committed today if we adopt a new Framework Programme lasting until 2005, without being able to predict what could happen at that time."
"In the specific programmes, therefore, we are presenting what, in our opinion, must be put aside on an annual basis in order to deal with possible urgent and specific programmes."
"With regard to research that has been carried out into foot-and-mouth disease in the past and within the Framework Programme, I would like to send you details of the research to which the Commission has access, and I shall specifically ask the Commission services to let you know about these as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for attending this session and for observing the deadlines which are set by both parties when we have our debates."
"I would also like to confirm that we support the general structure of the project."
"However, having listened to what he has said on the five specific programmes, I would like to remind the Commissioner that Parliament is concerned that the number is too low and I would like to ask the Commissioner about how he intends to monitor the specific programmes, both in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers."
"My second question concerns the instruments."
"I hope that the Commissioner will talk about the flexibility that is needed and which, in our opinion, seems crucial, between the proposed new instruments and the old instruments that have been retained, at least on a temporary basis."
"My third and final question is this: what guarantees can the Commissioner give that the Council will keep back the proposed EUR 17.5 billion?"
"I also have a tie-breaker question. Is the Commissioner personally in favour of continuing the work of the Joint Research Centre in the best possible circumstances?"
"Thank you, Mr Caudron."
"Naturally, all these questions would benefit from a lengthy discussion, but I would like to attempt to provide you with some initial answers, in the telegraphic style that we are using today."
"With regard to the programme for monitoring priorities, this applies as much to the Council as to Parliament because the Framework Programme is subject to the co-decision procedure, and the obvious advantage of having a specific programme covering all the priorities is the single committee, which is a committee that can be sub-divided, if you like, according to different areas of interest."
"I think that, in the discussion, the problem is not necessarily the number but is rather being able to hold an in-depth debate on a specific number of priorities."
"I think, therefore, that we can discuss working arrangements and the way the programme will be applied to see how we can deal with this objection."
"To take the problem of new instruments versus old instruments, we have to be clear on this point. We believe that the new Framework Programme must be the cornerstone for the creation of Brussels' European Research Area."
"Assessments that have been carried out on previous programmes show that they can be useful, because they enable contacts to be made at European level, but that they do not provide enough structure."
"This is quite clear and that is why we need new instruments."
"I understand the concerns felt every time the word 'new' is mentioned."
"It is difficult to adapt to change and this is to be expected."
"This reaction is, therefore, extremely understandable and I sympathise with some of the concerns, hence the need to explain things carefully."
"I would, however, like to say that calls for proposals are still applicable in the so-called Category 8, which brings together support for policies with emerging policies."
"So, over EUR 1.6 billion is available for the calls for proposals in the original meaning of the word."
"The proposal is, therefore, understood."
"As for the general budget, in my opinion, I think that although it appears to have a degree of approval from the Council, I believe I am right in saying that the Swedish Presidency proposes to hold an initial informal discussion on the budget at the Research Council on 26 June."
"I hope that our proposal will be adopted."
"This is a sensible proposal, which is also part of the financial perspectives that were drawn up in Berlin on the various policies of the Commission."
"I believe, therefore, that this could be done."
"My last point relates to the Joint Research Centre."
"As you are aware, we have made an effort to focus the tasks of the Joint Research Centre on areas to which it is best suited. In other words, tasks involving joint monitoring, joint tests and scientific expertise in problems relating to the environment, health, some aspects of the nuclear industry and security in terms of the information society."
"These are useful tools, and, of course, we have a programme for the Joint Research Centre, which, in budgetary terms, is, admittedly, unlikely to increase, but which allows the role of the Joint Research Centre to be more targeted."
"I believe, therefore, that the Centre will always have a future provided that it is given tasks, which will be of benefit to the whole of the European Union."
"Madam President, I should like to revisit briefly the problems which have typified the animal products sector for the past couple of months and years."
"We are faced with two problems: BSE, for which better tests can be developed, and foot-and-mouth disease, for which a marker vaccine can be developed."
"I should like to find out from the Commissioner what specific contingency measures he intends to put in place in this connection."
"I believe that public opinion can no longer accept the massive slaughtering of healthy animals."
"We, in Europe, will need to do something about this as soon as possible, and I would like a clear response from the Commissioner to the question when the European Union intends to contribute to developments in that area."
"(no microphone) ...problems relating to research, since I am speaking about research."
"As for diseases, 48 research projects on diseases, including BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, were set out in the previous programme following the drawing up of the process."
"We have a document, therefore, which includes all the research projects that have been carried out and a decision was taken at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers for Research - which was a first - to organise a meeting of all researchers at European level - and I do not mean veterinarians or colleges specialising in veterinary studies - I mean researchers working on issues relating to mad cow disease and on issues relating to Creuzfelt Jacob disease, which also has particularly worrying and perturbing implications for human health."
"It is a pleasure for me to inform Members of Parliament that we have recently completed this task, which has been acknowledged as unique, of drawing up a list of every single research project in Europe."
"It is an interesting project in itself because researchers in many countries were surprised to find out that there were other researchers in other countries undertaking similar research as them."
"This document will be available at the meeting of the Council of Research Ministers on 26 June 2001 and it will be published - I have already had the opportunity to hold a press conference to announce this and explain the main points, but I think that this is much more practical."
"As for the policies on whether or not to slaughter animals, I think that you must speak to my colleagues, Mr Byrne or Mr Fischler, as these policies are defined according to either health and consumer protection or the common agricultural policy."
"Madam President, we are now discussing animal diseases, but Commissioner, humans too still face tragic diseases."
"For example, the spreading of apparently inexplicable diseases in people can be traced back to explainable causes, such as uranium, which is depleted or not, as the case may be, and diseases of the immune system which are said to be caused by substances in the environment."
"Could you give us a reassurance that you will be devoting the necessary attention to research in this field?"
"I should like to ask you in more general terms whether Europe' s shortfall, compared to the United States, will ever take an end?"
"Europe is lagging behind in areas such as spending of resources."
"Could the Commissioner assure us that more resources will be made available, both by the Community and by the Member States?"
"The Commissioner has told us time and again that it is not so relevant to keep alluding to the discrepancy between fundamental and applied research."
"Could we, despite this, assume that fundamental research in Europe will not lag behind?"
"In response to the first question, it is clearly evident that, in the specific programmes that the Commission adopted this morning, you will see, Mrs Maes, that there are some very clear headings on the effects of the environment on health, as well as, for example, the effects of chemical products."
"Studies of this type are planned."
"Some have already been carried out, but you are right to say that issues of prevention do exist."
"Health risks related to the environment - you will see in the document - are dealt with on the page on the priority entitled 'Food safety and health risks' ."
"With regard to the resources that the European Union is making available for research, I think that I tell everyone that it is essential that we make a greater overall effort."
"This was the message in the statement on the European Research Area - we are only spending 1.9% of our GNP whereas the United States spend 2.7% and Japan 3.1%."
"Since the Lisbon and the Stockholm Summits, a considerable number of people have become aware of this, and the Heads of Government often discuss the European Research Area."
"I was also pleased to read that Mr Jospin spoke of the need for a European Research Area in his speech on the European Union, but said that Member States' determination was crucial."
"They must step up their efforts."
"That is why the issue of benchmarking, which we are implementing, of comparisons between research efforts, and of raising the resources to catalyse this research by creating integrated projects through bringing about the European Research Area, by providing support from the Commission to make national programmes consistent, must create a dynamic to help this research."
"Similarly, you are quite right to highlight a crucial problem at European level, which is the problem of young researchers."
"We do not stress often enough that the average age of researchers in Europe is higher than the average age of the European population."
"This means that there is a problem, that there has not been any recruitment or development of scientific research in our Member States."
"Generally, there has been a specific problem for the last 20 years and there is currently a need, therefore, to attract young people to careers in research and to develop them in this career."
"Clearly, in many Member States - and perhaps this is putting it very bluntly - there is something almost scandalous about the status of young researchers in terms of their social and financial standing."
"This is, therefore, a problem that must be tackled throughout Europe, and I believe that we can provide various comparisons so that all Member States properly address this problem, and I can say that people are becoming aware of this now."
"Everyone knows that the knowledge-based society is the driving force of the economy of the future."
"At the Lisbon Summit, it was acknowledged that 25 to 50% of the economy is related to knowledge and therefore to research and innovation."
"This is a positive aspect that we are indeed attempting to make known as far and wide as possible."
"The Framework Programme must play a part in increasing awareness of this issue."
"Madam President, Commissioner Busquin, you are calling for greater integration of research activities at European level on the one hand and at national, regional and international level on the other."
"There is a very typical example in my region, namely the cooperation between the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg and the Transuran Institute in Karlsruhe."
"The question arises: should we not in future bring in a European integration week highlighting good examples, and will integration not also require financial assistance from the European Union, which could be used to support particularly promising joint research ventures?"
"I fully support what Mr Schwaiger has said as that is exactly what we want to do."
"I can tell him that, with regard to the large research centres in Europe which do not fall within the competence of the European Union, like CERN in Geneva and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, we have made initial contacts with them."
"For the first time, we are attempting to establish links between them."
"They came here to Brussels to meet independently with the Commission, but in doing so created a critical mass."
"I would like to give the same example of INSERM in France that you give of Heidelberg and of the Cancer Research Centre, as you know that there is an INSERM team from France working at Heidelberg with the German Cancer Research Centre."
"It is vital that we help to create these national links, through either Article 169 or through supporting cooperation in the national programmes."
"However, your idea of showing this networking in a practical manner is an excellent idea, which perhaps, if I may, I can use to show what already exists and that we must build on this."
"The Commission' s role will be to enable everyone to take part, depending on their interests in a number of areas, but it is obvious that there are initiatives that have been taken."
"The dynamic potential of the European Research Area is already being felt in some national institutions that have taken this dynamic spirit to heart."
"Madam President, I welcome the Commissioner' s statement that he is in listening mode."
"I wonder if he would listen in particular to those people who are working in the field of public health and their concerns that what has been a very good programme on public health care, health promotion and illness prevention seems to be disappearing."
"As I understand it, within the first seven categories of research programmes, when health comes in, it is confined to highly scientific biomedical research programmes."
"When people ask what is happening to public health care research, they are told that it has gone into the all-embracing Category 8, which is rather a jumble sale of a programme with a very small amount of money attached."
"They are told that directorates-general of the Commission are already being invited to submit bids, so it is Agriculture bidding against Environment bidding against Health, and so on. This area of public health looks like missing out, just at the time when the Treaty of Amsterdam is putting it up the agenda for the European Union."
"Will he have a look at that, because if we are going to get the research programme right, we need to have research into that research programme, and to listen to the people in the field."
"I fully understand this question."
"I believe that this is the type of discussion that we are going to have."
"First of all, let me take the content of the priorities."
"As part of genomics research, it is obvious that there are health policies within this as well."
"I have already answered Mr Van Velzen with regard to the problem of cancer and the problem of Alzheimer' s disease, which will continue to be investigated."
"I recently attended a meeting of the leading European cancer specialists."
"They all know that genomics research represents a potential solution for this disease, as we are advancing towards developing increasingly individually-tailored types of treatment, taking into account aspects of genomics research."
"This is not theoretical genomics dating back 10 or 15 years - these are elements of application that can be highlighted."
"One of our objectives is, therefore, to create a network of the leading cancer researchers."
"There is no contradiction whatsoever."
"Having said this, you are right to highlight that public health research, which appears to have less of a genuine scientific dimension, but which focuses instead on epidemiology, should also be carried out."
"It is true that this has not been planned in Category 8."
"It is planned in another category that perhaps has not been emphasised enough, namely the cooperation of national programmes."
"We could, therefore, put 'co-operate' on, for example, all epidemiological data."
"EUR 400 million has been set aside to strengthen the European Research Area."
"There are several angles of attack."
"You are quite right to say that we should do everything to help to give the problem a European dimension."
"These aspects must always be taken into consideration."
"Madam President, I would like first of all to highlight the excellent cooperation which exists between Commissioner Busquin and the European Parliament, by means of the committee which I chair, on issues of research."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to communicate to you the double concern of the scientific community, which is practically unanimous, in relation to two questions."
"The first is that the scientific community unreservedly supports the idea of a common area of research."
"However, on the other hand, it has serious doubts that the effect of synergy and added value at a European level may be lost by means of a concentration of the different research projects; that is to say, the smaller the nucleus, the more concentrated those projects are, the more difficult it is for these synergies to be produced at a European level."
"The second question relates to the instruments."
"The three instruments planned: the networks of excellence, on the one hand, the integrated projects and the recourse to Article 169."
"The scientific community is concerned about the fact that these three instruments are new and that they are the only ones being used."
"It fears that others which were being used will be lost despite the fact that the scientific community had become accustomed to them."
"It also fears that a whole series of research teams which had been created could be lost, all of a sudden, as a result of the exclusive application of these three instruments."
"I would therefore like the Commissioner to respond to this double concern."
"Mr Westendorp y Cabeza has asked a fundamental question."
"We will try to answer it point by point."
"I think that we must consider the dynamic that we wanted to create, in other words, greater concentration, a European added value in the projects, a dynamic of giving structure to the European Research Area."
"I have already mentioned this."
"What, then, is the meaning of the question?"
"It is the fact that there are obstacles to creating this structure, because the proposals are too dispersed."
"The risks of dispersion will increase with new countries joining the EU and with enlargement."
"We will then have projects that are too small in size, creating problems that the scientific community has itself seen as well; problems involving deadlines, bureaucracy and the fact that the projects are not sufficiently ambitious."
"This is the negative aspect."
"We must, therefore, find the right balance, with ambitious, more integrated projects, which involve the whole scientific community."
"These projects are, moreover, more geared towards the scientific community, because they have a European added value and they are projects for the longer term."
"The networks of excellence, for example, are a long-term venture and they affect the scientific community more than the current system."
"I am aware of the need to find a balance between the desire to create this European space, the dimension of projects, and the fact that everyone should feel involved."
"Our task, therefore, is to provide information, to refine things, all the more so because the three instruments are tools for the priority areas, but are not so within the context of the 8th Category, where there are projects which remain linked to the support for the European Union' s policy, and therefore with traditional proposals."
"I believe, however, that the whole debate that we will hold will actually be to find the right balance between change and a certain conformity, which has posed several problems in managing all the projects."
"We are managing 14 000 projects."
"I would like to say once again that the European Research Area is not simply the European Framework Programme."
"The European Framework Programme is an aspect of the European Research Area."
"The European Research Area will also be created through the determination of Member States to increase their collaboration with one another in terms of their research tools."
"We must, therefore, play a part in this."
"That is our aim."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner, for I think that this is one of the most important areas of all that we are discussing here today."
"We are, of course, concerned here with the creation of those values which will ensure prosperity in Europe for many years to come."
"Unfortunately, responsibility for research lies, in particular, with governments which, in all European countries - almost without exception - have merely been cutting back. Nor am I sure that our Swedish brethren are in any way doing anything to encourage support for the national basic research programmes which generate the new knowledge."
"If, in the Sixth Framework Programme, we are to achieve a situation in which innovative small companies have access to programmes without their intellectual rights being destroyed, we must have mechanisms which enable companies to have access from outside to the major research programmes and which make it possible for contracts to be concluded without subsequent unnecessary bureaucracy."
"One fundamental question is therefore the following: has the Council finally got around to giving the research department a mandate to conclude contracts without the need for umpteen signatures?"
"If it has not done so, then your power to act is very limited, Commissioner."
"It is frustrating for a small enterprise or university department to be obliged, at the diktat of the Council, to wait for heaven knows how many signatures. Have we taken account of this important issue in connection with the restructuring of the Commission's procedures?"
"I am delighted that the Council is there for once, and I am looking forward to hearing the Commission' s answer."
"I fully support what Mr Rovsing has said."
"The new instruments aim to provide greater responsibility and increased flexibility."
"We would like to avoid having such restrictive and off-putting rules for participation - these have no place in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"The rules for participation must, therefore, offer more to small and medium-sized businesses and the scientific community than they currently do."
"This is absolutely clear."
"Because of this, the integrated projects will be more adaptable and more flexible and will prevent rules being so restrictive that they are out of the reach of small and medium-sized businesses."
"Madam President, I want to use my speech to thank Commissioner Busquin for the exceptional opportunities he affords us by maintaining a continuous relationship with the European Parliament."
"We certainly think the programme as a whole is going well, but it does need improvement."
"That is the task we must undertake together. Improvement is needed, for example, in the general approach, which is still too bureaucratic."
"The components of the programme need to be clarified, and so, in my opinion, does the redistribution of the financial architecture."
"In my opinion, the extremely urgent, serious, emergency issues relating to human health must certainly be considered priorities."
"When we debate networks and centres of excellence, then, I am sure the Commissioner will also see the need for dialogue with Parliament."
"As far as our parliamentary committee is concerned, we have an idea for a whole series of centres of excellence to be active in Europe."
"I therefore believe this continuous relationship can enhance the whole programme and make it possible to find the answers to urgent questions like those raised by Mrs Jackson and Mr Bowis, for example."
"In other words, we should not be working in our own little sealed compartments. We have put together a European public health programme which can certainly be extremely useful to the Commissioner, and I am sure he has largely taken it into account already."
"Thank you, Mr Nisticò."
"I think that the expression that he used to say the programmes must not be too compartmentalised is the answer but phrased differently, to which I say that we must attempt to avoid excessively strict systems that are too compartmentalised, and therefore take up the broad themes, such as, of course, anything related to neurology, genomics, which are problems that will affect health and which affect various areas, and therefore, we will have greater interaction, create networks of excellence taking into account these various elements - this is the idea behind it."
"This idea must go forward, however, with, of course, a dialogue between the various scientific communities."
"In this respect, Members of Parliament are obviously well-placed to bring, first of all, the questions from the scientific communities that I am seeing surface, but also proposals for creating networks of excellence on the themes that are of interest to the European Union and which have an undeniable European added value."
"This is one of the fundamental criteria."
"I believe, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, that on 5 June, which is next Tuesday, we have an afternoon of work, during which we will attempt to find practical aspects based on the specific programmes as have been set out, but also based on legitimate questions on the new instruments."
"Thank you, Mr Busquin."
"I would also like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"Can I make a suggestion for the future."
"At the beginning of this session, I waved my hands repeatedly for a long time."
"I may or may not have got on the list, but I had no idea whether or not this was the case."
"Would perhaps one of your assistants acknowledge our wavings so that we would know we can stop and whether we are on the list or not."
"It might help us."
"Certainly, Mr Purvis."
"Your suggestion has my support."
"Treaty of Nice and the future of the EU"
"The next item is the report (A5-0168/2001) by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, four years ago, when I had the honour of presenting the statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this Parliament, together with my friend Dimitri Tsatsos, I ended that speech by recalling the words of Miguel de Cervantes who, when old and tired and weary of life, said that there were times when one had to chose between the road or the inn, between moving forward and staying put, and I said: 'we must chose the road, we must move ahead' ."
"Amsterdam is one more step in that direction."
"I remember that the Commissioner, our good friend Marcelino Oreja, replied to me with more words from Miguel de Cervantes, telling us of the sorcerers, who can deprive us of everything, but never of our hope."
"Does the Treaty of Nice, therefore, represent that hope which the European Parliament had put its faith in?"
"The answer is clear: no, it is not what the European Parliament was asking for, because the European Parliament wanted a thoroughgoing reform of the institutions; because the European Parliament wanted to prepare the Union for enlargement; because the European Parliament wanted to deal with the problems of concern to the citizens."
"The truth, however, is that the governments, which control the agenda at an Intergovernmental Conference, took a different decision and the agenda was, therefore, not the one the European Parliament wanted."
"The Treaty of Nice has not resolved many of these issues."
"It has only resolved some of them, satisfactorily in some cases and insufficiently in others."
"I believe that the merit of this resolution - if it has any - and of this report that Antonio Seguro and myself are presenting, is that it is a balanced document, which reflects that nature of a Parliament which is no longer merely there to provide impetus but is now a co-decision maker."
"A co-decision-making Parliament means a responsible Parliament and, therefore, a Parliament which has to do things in a balanced way."
"I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs who have worked extremely hard to reach a consensus, starting with its Chairman, Giorgio Napoletano, and also my good friend, Antonio Seguro, who has not only been a solid and intelligent contributor, but also an honest one."
"We are, therefore, talking about a balanced document, in which we explain what we do not like and what we want to see modified in the future, because agreements, and the Treaty of Nice is an agreement, do not last forever - forever is no more than an adverb of time - and are liable to be reformed."
"The Treaty of Nice itself contains the seed of such a reform."
"I believe that this resolution looks to the future, towards that Declaration No 23, which lays down the basis for reform."
"In this constructive spirit, we wanted to help the Swedish Presidency, with which we have had much contact over the last few months, so that this European Council in Gothenburg may show us the future of the European Union through the responses of its institutions."
"Madam President, we want to see national committees set up in all the Member States so that the people may hold a genuine debate, not a phoney one, and in that way we will discover what the citizens want of Europe in the future."
"This Parliament also wishes to see the Intergovernmental Conferences prepared by means of a democratic method."
"We believe that the convention that drafted the Charter on Fundamental Rights should provide the model for this democratic method."
"Today, when we are seeing so many proposals from different people, all on the convention - which is a positive start - I would say that what the European Parliament wants is a convention based on the model of the convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights: on that one and none other; because that model was shown to be successful and it brought together various authorities in order to achieve the desired result."
"On the basis of the convention model, we want the result of that convention also to be the role played by the governments in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We are going to make constitutional proposals, and we must not be afraid of the term 'constitutional' because, when we talk of competences or institutional structure, we are talking about constitutional issues."
"The result we are seeking is a European Constitution, and I wish to make this completely clear, a European Constitution which makes everybody' s competences absolutely clear and, above all, makes it clear what each institution does within the institutional structure."
"We want this to be ready before 2004, before the European Parliament elections, so that the political groups in this House can go into these elections defending our choices."
"Madam President, I believe - and I recall my initial comments - that this is a path of hope."
"We are facing the Europe of the euro, the Europe of enlargement, and it is up to us whether this is a path of hope or a path which leads us to a situation of stalemate in the European Union, which none of us want to see."
"I therefore want this resolution to make a constructive contribution to this road of hope becoming ever broader and our becoming ever more European."
"Thank you, Mr Seguro."
"The sticker matches the Mrs Lindh' s suit perfectly."
"That is a good sign!"
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I shall now give you the floor."
", Council."
"(SV) Madam President, honourable Members, the future of Europe is now being forged as the European Union composes itself ahead of its enlargement."
"We are concerned with the historical task of uniting Europe and welcoming the applicant states back into the European family."
"In the western Balkans, the Union is doing everything to prevent new wars in Europe, a new Srebrenica or further ethnic cleansing."
"So far, we have been able to help prevent full-scale conflicts in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in southern Serbia."
"The EU' s future lies in coordinating foreign policy so that we can prevent armed conflicts."
"The Union is also currently working on developing its cooperation with Africa."
"An EU troika is visiting West Africa at this moment."
"The responsibility and future of the EU also encompass a global responsibility."
"Cooperation is now being deepened in a number of areas in Europe."
"Europe must mean more than a market."
"Full employment, equality and social and economic balance are aims for the EU of the future."
"The Union' s ways of working are now being developed with the legislation on public access to documents and with the reform work within the institutions."
"The future of the EU lies in an open and democratic union."
"At the same time, we know that there is a lot left to do in respect of justice and free trade, the fight for human rights and work on environmental issues."
"The debate on the future is about how we can succeed in these issues of the future and how we can create institutions that make us successful."
"Through the Treaty of Nice we prepared the Union for new members joining and, at the same time, made clear our commitment to continued deeper cooperation."
"We succeeded in moving from unanimity to majority decisions in respect of a further thirty-five or so provisions."
"However, I myself - and many others like me - had hoped that we would have got further in respect of social matters and the third pillar."
"We also succeeded in extending the codecision-making procedure to encompass new areas in which the European Parliament, together with the national governments, can ensure that the decision-making process is democratically rooted."
"These were important decisions, and we succeeded in getting further than just the three matters that were selected in Amsterdam."
"At the same time, most people are agreed - and I am convinced that we will have many examples here today - that the next Intergovernmental Conference needs to go significantly further than Nice and that we therefore need this broad debate on the future of Europe."
"An important aim must be to make citizens more active participants in the European project."
"The Swedish Presidency which, together with the coming Belgian Presidency, has been given the task of getting this debate going has taken it very seriously."
"The common website that the Commission is running went live back in early March."
"It already contains contributions from many heads of state and government and plenty of comments from European citizens."
"The website will be expanded to encompass all eleven EU languages, and I hope that it will live on in the debate which will continue up to and in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The institutions are also planning a number of common seminars and conferences."
"In addition, there are all the national initiatives that have been started, both in Member States and in applicant countries."
"We are now turning for the first time directly to the citizens of Europe in our preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference."
"Their hopes and expectations will undoubtedly extend further than the four institutional issues pointed out in Nice."
"I think this is a good thing."
"I believe that the debate on the future is primarily about policy, and secondarily about institutions."
"Before we attempt to define our tools, we must know what the tools are to be used for."
"At the same time, we must, of course, also conduct the arguments of principle concerning the nature and being of the Union."
"That is why, as President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the more long-term visions that we are now beginning to see in the debate."
"It may be tempting to simplify the debate by looking too much at the terms themselves and too little at what the terms actually represent."
"For example, we see many people wanting to draw a clear dividing line between the radical 'federalists' and those who have more modest ambitions in respect of the institutional issues."
"However, each country has its own history and its own reference frameworks that help decide how the terms are viewed in that country."
"The very term 'federalism' is interpreted positively and as decentralisation in some countries, whilst it can be like a red rag to a bull and seen as centralisation in other countries."
"The same applies to the debate concerning a 'constitution' ."
"As quite a few people have said, the existing Treaties already form a kind of constitution."
"They contain provisions concerning the tasks that we are to have, the distribution of responsibility between different institutions and the rules of procedure."
"What is of interest is what the fundamental rules contain, not what we decide to call them."
"Similarly, a contradiction is often painted between those who believe that democratic legitimacy emanates from representatives elected by the populace in their own country and those who believe that it must be sought in a new political model of European cooperation."
"I believe that we must try to find different ways of strengthening the link between European policy and national policy."
"Democracy is not a zero sum game."
"I am convinced that we can do a lot to strengthen European democracy without rebuilding the Union from scratch."
"When the interaction between the European and the national level develops, then democracy is the winner and the influence of citizens is strengthened."
"We must get away from the artificial division between what is European and what is national."
"Both national and European parliamentarians have a direct mandate from the people."
"What is to prevent national parliamentarians appearing more regularly in the European Parliament and European parliamentarians more regularly in the national parliaments?"
"The requirements for grassroots support and the extensive agenda will make special demands of the preparations for the next Intergovernmental Conference, and many people have said that we must find a more open way than previously."
"Some think that a small group of so-called wise men should table proposals."
"Such a group can work quickly, but at the same time this would mean that not all the countries could be represented."
"Many people, especially here in Parliament, have proposed that we should use an open forum similar to the convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year."
"However, quite a few countries have stressed that an open forum, a convention, must not restrict or forestall the debate with the citizens."
"Once an open forum has completed its work, the result must be subject to debate and comments, and grassroots support must be sought for it."
"If I may take a moment to speak as a Swedish President and Swedish Foreign Minister and not just as President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that I would wish us to be able to set up an open forum early in 2002."
"Such a forum should be given around a year to complete its work and have the task of submitting recommendations for matters to be included on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and also of putting forward various suggestions in respect of the responses to, and viewpoints on, these issues."
"At the same time, it is important that the broad debate continues and that we also take on board what is happening in the national debates."
"One way of ensuring this may be to summarise the national debates and to report to the European Council every six months."
"It will also surely be necessary to have technical investigations carried out, since the matters addressed in Nice are fairly complicated."
"In summary, I believe - based on the discussions I have had with Member States and applicant countries - that it will be difficult to find an individual form of preparation that is appropriate to all issues."
"We need a combination."
"I believe that we need a convention, that we need technical preparations and that we need to report the national debates."
"The Swedish Presidency will continue the discussions with the European Parliament alongside the deliberations in the Council."
"The resolution that you are adopting today - I would really like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro - will be a very important contribution to that debate."
"This will naturally also form an important basis for the presidency when we present a report in Gothenburg."
"These issues will be given a prominent place there and hopefully contribute new impulses to the continued discussion."
"I now look forward to your viewpoints."
"Madam President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets is in a way summed up in paragraphs 2, 3 and 40 of the motion for a resolution; but you will understand that I will not give in to the temptation to end my argument here."
"Please allow me therefore to illustrate and expand on it a little."
"We totally agree with the phrase in paragraph 2, which says 'profoundly regrets the fact that the Treaty of Nice has only given a timid response' ."
"This is one of the great frustrations of the Committee on Budgets: that we have not been able, at this time, to deal with and resolve the budgetary issues before entering into the effective process of enlargement."
"In paragraph 3 of the proposal of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs it says that the Conference makes 'the decision-making process within the Union more confused and less transparent' ."
"In this regard, and from the point of view of the budget, I will just say that if you look at the budgetary payments and compare them with the votes of the Member States in the Council, the voting procedure will perhaps not appear so confused."
"Turning to certain budgetary aspects, we, as I said, expected more ambition from the Member States, we hoped that they would now deal frankly with the issue of the budgetary procedure and that they would even choose, if you like, a model such as that in the German constitution, which has a 'financial constitution' section, which provides for financial compensation (Finanzausgleich) between the Member States, the lander of the German Federation."
"This was the right time to do it without waiting any longer."
"There is still complete ambiguity with regard to the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement, to the point where there are 5 articles in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline which provide for majorities not laid down in the Treaty."
"This legal problem has not been resolved in Nice."
"This frankly causes frustration in Parliament."
"We would have liked to have seen the financial perspectives set and defined, knowing that it was going to be a particular advantage to the European Union but not to Parliament."
"This time, the financial perspectives are mentioned in the Treaty but not defined, which means that we are not progressing much."
"New activities and new spending are proposed, and it is presupposed that the European Parliament will agree, but the financial means for it are not provided for."
"Because time is at a premium, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because I have pointed out our different cultures, policies and traditions, but there is one thing that unites us all: Parliaments were born in Europe to represent the citizens by controlling public spending and approving the spending of the sovereign."
"The budget is at the centre of representative democracy and if we want a representative democracy in Europe we must make much more progress on the budgetary procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the field of foreign and security policy shows in exemplary manner the shortcomings of the results of Nice and of the Treaty as a whole."
"The European Union is strong wherever the Monnet method is used."
"The European Union is weak wherever the intergovernmental method is used."
"We see it in the area of foreign and security policy with the twin structures that hamper our freedom of action."
"We also see it, for example, in the fact that closer cooperation is used everywhere where it is not necessarily needed; but where it is needed most urgently - in defence - it is not used."
"We need to remind ourselves why the Nice Conference took place."
"It was meant to strengthen the European Union' s ability to act for enlargement and at the same time to reduce the democratic deficit."
"In neither area were the desired results achieved, and as far as the decision-making structures are concerned, they were actually made worse."
"We therefore have to recognise that the present method is no longer working."
"I have twice had the honour of representing Parliament - in Amsterdam and in Nice - and I know that this method of preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference does not bring us the necessary progress."
"Only the convention can do that, with the national parliaments and the European Parliament, too, suitably involved alongside the Commission and the governments."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the open forum is no alternative to the convention."
"It may be helpful in making preparations, but the convention - consisting of parliamentarians - can channel that open forum, the public debate, so as to present to you as heads of state and government an outcome that will form the basis for your negotiations."
"It therefore builds on the public process, but it is not an alternative to the public process."
"We have to see to it that the citizens of this Europe enjoy their rights."
"That is why the Charter must be made binding."
"We must therefore ensure that where this European Union has powers it is able to take decisions, so that its decision-making ability gains it acceptance."
"We must make this European Union democratic."
"There must therefore be codecision in all matters of legislation, including agricultural policy."
"We must make it transparent so that citizens know who is responsible for a bad decision."
"That is why the Council as legislator must meet openly."
"These are the decisive measures that we must get accepted at this Intergovernmental Conference!"
"At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the national parliaments."
"It is not enough, as Mr Jospin has suggested, to bring a Chinese People' s Congress to Europe for major debates once a year."
"No, we must strengthen the national parliaments at home so that they can control their national governments as members of the Council!"
"That must be the starting point!"
"(Applause)"
"We are now in a situation where the next two and a half years will shape the face and the size of Europe."
"We shall shape its face by conducting this constitutional debate in a reasonable manner and bringing it to a conclusion and by bringing about enlargement - both things together."
"I hope we shall have the strength and not the vanity of many governments who think their job is to sit around where they are and stand in the way of progress!"
"That is why we should give the convention a chance, so that Europe' s elected representatives, the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a part in shaping that face!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just one point will suffice to make clear to you my committee' s disappointment."
"I represent fisheries policy."
"This is one of the few European policies, however, that lie in the sole competence of the Community."
"As a result, all the legislation coming out of Brussels in this sector affects the Union' s citizens directly."
"The democratic deficit of which we rightly complain is all the more obvious to all concerned."
"We, Parliament, the only institution legitimised by popular vote, continue to be denied any real involvement in making those laws."
"I am referring to the codecision procedure, which, despite our demands, has still not been opened up for fisheries policy."
"The future of Europe' s fisheries from 2003 is being rewritten at this very moment."
"I therefore particularly want to reiterate, indeed to emphasise, our pre-Nice position today in the post-Nice era."
"A mere consultation of Parliament is not enough."
"We want to be really involved in defining the most important themes."
"We therefore emphatically call for the codecision rules to be taken into Articles 32 to 38 of the EC Treaty and ask for your support!"
"I find there continues to be a further deficit in Parliament' s involvement in fisheries matters when it comes to concluding international agreements."
"We demand that the European Parliament' s assent be made mandatory for international agreements negotiated by the Commission, which do after all have an impact on the budget."
"Finally, we want our own title in the EC Treaty, all that, dear Elmar, in addition to agricultural policy."
"It is only logical."
"Only then will we be able to keep up with all the rules and regulations of that now highly developed European policy!"
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regrets that the Treaty of Nice made far fewer specific changes in the area of employment and social policy than those that it had sought."
"It hopes that these issues will be addressed by the second report from the Constitutional Affairs Committee and by the next IGC."
"On the broader institutional issues, presently under discussion, we welcome the report's call for a convention to prepare for the next IGC and for a debate involving the active participation of the European citizenry as a whole."
"We would ask that the convention engage closely in the course of its discussions with the social partners and with civil society."
"In particular, we would seek consultation, both within the Member States and with the applicant countries on the issue of the provision of a legal base for the involvement of civil society in the decision-making processes of the European Union."
"We would also like to see Member States being encouraged to establish fora where citizens can interact with their own Parliament's on the future of Europe."
"We believe too that up to and beyond the next IGC, there would be merit in joint annual meetings of delegations of committees on employment and social affairs from the European Parliament, from within Member States and the applicant countries and from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. We hope that a means will be found for supporting such meetings."
"Finally, we trust that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be incorporated in the Treaties in a legally binding manner and we look forward in future to wide and active participation in the discussion on the future of the Union."
"Mr President, I believe that the motion for a resolution on which we are going to vote on the future of the European Union and the assessment of Nice is a positive and balanced text which maintains the European Parliament' s important role in the construction of Europe."
"It therefore deserves full support in this House, I hope by a majority."
"As Chairman of the Industry Committee, I have presented an opinion which I would sum up by means of four points."
"The first refers to paragraph 3 of Article 157 on support measures for industry."
"The second is the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002."
"The third relates to Article 181 A on relations with third countries, above all in the field of financial and technical cooperation."
"Finally, the fourth aspect relates to the unsatisfactory amendments of Article 133 on the common trade policy."
"All of them have the same defect, and that is that they do not resolve the clear democratic deficit which exists in these areas, where the role of the European Parliament, in some cases, is completely absent and, in others, is restricted to a mere consultation when it should have gone further."
"I trust that this opinion which is appended to the motion for a resolution will soon be included in a new European Parliament document, and I also trust that these issues will be included in the agenda for the coming convention which will lead to an Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro sincerely for their excellent report."
"Our group believes it is important that we should also reach agreement between the groups in fundamental questions because we, the European Parliament, must be the guarantor of Europe as a community."
"We therefore have a joint responsibility."
"It was therefore also good that our two fellow MEPs presented a joint report."
"This contribution by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro is also a contribution to a neighbourly relationship, because partners who are very close together geographically often find it hard to work with each other."
"So this was a good Spanish-Portuguese contribution to the development of Europe, another positive effect."
"I naturally welcome the fact that the President-in-Office is present here today."
"So far as the Commission is concerned, we always have the pleasure of its presence."
"Madam President-in-Office, we appreciate that."
"It is true that we were rather critical earlier."
"I hope that your positive example in being here today will also be an example for future presidencies."
"We hope that the presence of the Council of Ministers here in the European Parliament will improve decisively and that we will also come to an agreement on that."
"Turning now to Nice, as many have said, we are not satisfied with Nice."
"The Council' s decision-making procedure is more complex than before."
"There has been no significant extension of majority decision-making in the Council."
"Above all - and this is very critical for us - there is no significant extension of codecision between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"We are actually rather surprised that in his speech, which of course also has positive aspects, the French Prime Minister says nothing about extending the powers of the European Parliament, but only says, and I quote: ""The competences of the Strasbourg Assembly should be more clearly defined."""
"We expect the Prime Minister of a great country to speak out for greater democracy in Europe, for more powers for the European Parliament."
"What we need - as Mr Brok has already mentioned - are clear competences of parliamentary responsibility."
"The European Parliament is the Commission' s parliamentary watchdog at European level and in matters of legislation is of equal standing with the Council of Ministers."
"It is the duty of national parliaments to exercise more control over their own governments."
"We do not want a congress of national MPs, but we want the European Parliament to discharge its responsibility in Europe and our national colleagues to do so at national level!"
"(Applause)"
"The second and third pillars remain in place after Nice."
"We must correct that."
"That is intergovernmental cooperation, if we now look to the future."
"Intergovernmental cooperation does not simply mean that we are incapable of action, but intergovernmental cooperation also means that there is no democratic parliamentary control and no review by the European Court of Justice."
"Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore not only an expression of a lack of ability to act, but it is also in contradiction with our values of democracy and the rule of law."
"We must therefore change it for the future!"
"(Applause)"
"Madam President-in-Office, let me conclude by saying that you have achieved something in your presidency."
"There will come another time when we shall have to assess matters of, for example, transparency and similar questions."
"For our group, however, the crucial thing is how the future will go on to be shaped."
"We are not expecting Gothenburg to bring any obstacles that will prevent a decision in Laeken about a convention, but we expect Gothenburg to show the way for good decisions in Laeken so that we can proceed into the European future on the basis of a convention."
"Madam President-in-Office, I am not giving you a present, but not because I have anything against red as a colour."
"It is a nice colour."
"The content, when it is used politically, is sometimes not so acceptable."
"You spoke yourself of a red scarf, which is not always such a good example."
"However, we wish you much success for Gothenburg!"
"If you are successful, it will be our joint success."
"So best wishes for Gothenburg!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to say on behalf of the Socialist Group that we support, and are going to vote in favour of, the report jointly produced by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, which has been produced seriously and elegantly and in a spirit of not only Iberian but also European cooperation."
"I believe that that spirit of cooperation could be extended to other fields because I notice that, in this post-Nice debate which we have started, the illustrious leaders of the PPE-DE are criticising the proposals made by the leaders of my political family: Mr Jospin (Prime Minister of France) and Mr Schröder."
"I only have one thing to say: we impatiently await the contributions of Mr Aznar and Mr Berlusconi."
"We all remember (protests and applause) the contributions of Mr Berlusconi in this House in favour of Europe."
"Having said this, Mr President, I am not going to enter into a critical analysis of the Treaty, which has been the job of our two colleagues."
"I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because she has said some important things."
"Firstly, she has said that she has launched a virtual forum."
"This forum is already on the Internet; it is a forum and I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council that the European Parliament has finally entered the forum, in the latest edition."
"We could also seek formulae so that we can connect to our own debates."
"The forum now exists."
"It is a tribute to the Swedish Presidency that this forum is open and democratic in the best Swedish tradition."
"She has indicated that it might be appropriate to create a committee of wise men."
"I am in favour of the idea that experienced political leaders should not go on the dole."
"We could look for some political leaders to advise us."
"However, in any event, no forum can replace the convention, because - and I would like to remind you that it is an invention of the Council, not Parliament, at Cologne - it is a method by which we do not make recommendations but rather we debate the issues and make proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In this respect, I believe that we have to be clear: it is not only a request of the European Parliament at this point."
"If am not mistaken, after a lively debate in Stockholm, the COSAC last week expressed its support for the convention."
"This clearly means that the representatives of the European people, elected on both European and national levels, agree that this convention should exist, in order to produce something which we consider to be essential, Mr President - and with this I will end - that is, an open, public and transparent debate, which will allow us to create treaties which are constitutional and, above all, comprehensible to our co-citizens."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, my group shall support the work of the rapporteurs and I congratulate them on its elegant balance."
"It is entirely appropriate at this stage that the European Parliament does not express a definitive view on the qualities of the Treaty of Nice, because we recognise - as the Treaty itself does - that more needs to be done."
"We want to be active persuaders and influencers in doing more, hence our commitment to the convention idea."
"I am very pleased to hear the President-in-Office's positive remarks in that regard."
"You have talked also about factoring in both the national dimension and the wider public debate."
"I hope I am not listening to the creation of a convention, which will be a sort of pub with no beer."
"We would actually like to see these things incorporated in a way that it would be vigorous and representative of a wider opinion."
"In my country, the Republic of Ireland, in eight days time, there is a referendum on the Treaty of Nice, unique among the 15 Member States."
"In the run-up there has been a very active anti-campaign on three broad themes: Anti to say that it is not necessary to say ""yes"" to Nice for enlargement; anti to say that the reforms with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states go too far; and anti regarding the so-called militarisation of the EU."
"Normally I do not engage in national politics, but today it is for a European reason that I want to state clearly for the record of the House that to vote ""yes"" to Nice in Ireland is to vote to remove the last formal obstacle to a significant enlargement."
"In good conscience, I ask people to vote yes and I myself, in good conscience, shall vote yes."
"It is a ""yes"" to make sure that we meet the political conditions agreed in Helsinki that we in the EU should be ready, no later than the end of 2002, for this historic journey towards enlargement."
"A ""yes"" vote is a vote to reunite Europe."
"I urge my fellow citizens in Ireland to take that into account."
"There are plenty of criticisms to make of Nice with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states, but for people who are fair-minded and rational, none of the criticisms should be that it went too far."
"The problem with Nice is how much more was left to be done."
"Anyone who argues the opposite is playing to the gallery of populism, rather than dealing with substance and fact."
"Finally, on the argument about militarisation: as a Irishman it makes me sick in the pit of my stomach to listen to lectures from Mr Adams and other people in Sinn Féin who today still maintain an armed ceasefire in Northern Ireland, who refuse to decommission weapons, and who, prior to their entry into a peace process, sullied the name of Irishmen through a campaign of murder and terror for three decades."
"It is a travesty for these people to describe the one great peace movement of Europe, which is the European integration process, as heading towards militarisation."
"These people are themselves still incomplete democrats."
"We should not accept lectures from them on this topic."
"General Morillon, here this afternoon, served at Srebrenica and other places with dignity, despite having a very difficult and effectively impossible UN mandate."
"We know that NATO and the US would not act and did not act."
"We, the EU, could not act."
"If not NATO there was nothing."
"We have a moral and ethical duty to ensure we are prepared for such missions in future with the likes of the Rapid Reaction Force."
"This represents responsibility and maturity in Europe, not militarisation."
"Again people in Ireland should not listen to those who preach about militarism, for this is a false premise."
"I have been very generous with time for the three political group leaders."
"I will not be so tolerant from now on, but I am sure you had a lot of support in the House, Pat Cox."
"Mr President, what kind of generosity would it be that confined itself to the large groups?"
"It would be a power-based generosity that I would not like to think you capable of!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we are to resolve the crisis of European integration it is time to speak openly."
"We are witnessing and involved in a struggle for power in Europe."
"It is not a matter of federal state versus confederation or about a superstate versus subsidiarity."
"It is about democracy versus the national executives' desire for power, versus a Europe of clandestine cooperation between governments and de facto legislation by governments."
"It is about transforming the European project from a thing of administrative elites into a res publica."
"The Intergovernmental Conference in Nice was a failure."
"The EU has become neither more democratic nor more capable of action nor ready for enlargement."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has proved to be an unsuitable instrument."
"The heads of state and government are making Europe into a bazaar of national interests."
"At half past three in the morning between their calvados and the fireplace they exchange fish quotas for basic rights, agreement on enlargement for farm subsidies."
"After Nice they called for a celebration not for what they had done for Europe but for what they had deprived Europe of."
"Instead of doing their duty under the Treaty of moving Europe forward, they turned out to be advocates of national identity while expressing surprise about the likes of Haider and Berlusconi."
"The same people who failed in Nice now want to be not only government and legislator and lords of the Treaties, but also the creators of Europe' s constitution!"
"Honourable Members, it is time for Europe' s parliaments to remember why they are really there, that it is for them and them alone to create a constitution."
"It is time to show Europe' s princes that there is another Europe, a European democracy and a Europe that is a social area."
"It is the hour of the parliaments."
"It is the duty of the parliaments and I am glad that this Parliament is forging an alliance of parliaments for a European democracy!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am terribly bored with the debate about a federal state or a confederation!"
"We can confidently leave that to the next generation, but not the question of European democracy."
"That is the challenge if we are one day to be able to say: Vive la République d'Europe!"
"Long live the European Republic!"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner Barnier, many MEPs in this House are critical of the Treaty of Nice."
"I and my group, too, are deeply worried about the future of the European Union, because many of the questions affecting people' s everyday concerns and needs have still not been resolved or are addressed only half-heartedly."
"Nice has weakened the Community."
"Nice was a step backwards in terms of integration."
"There is no trace of a strengthened democracy, more transparency, more freedom of action and ability to take decisions!"
"As the report says, the Treaty has rightly removed the obstacles to enlargement in the most formal way possible."
"From this point of view, I should like to thank my two colleagues, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, for their commitment to their work as rapporteurs because their report reflects the predominantly critical view of the Treaty taken by this House."
"The Nice Council revealed that the governments are in the end fighting only to preserve their national rights of veto."
"The Union itself is facing the greatest challenge in its history, but instead of energetically tackling the pressing problems, the governments dissipated their energies behind closed doors."
"In my opinion, the time after Nice must therefore be used to rescue the Union from Nice."
"I want to take up a few points here that I consider important."
"It is absolutely essential that the number of seats for the Czech Republic and Hungary in the European Parliament is corrected immediately."
"There can be no discrimination against these two countries in their parliamentary representation in this House."
"Post-Nice must tackle an ambitious, really far-reaching reform, a reform that must achieve two things."
"Firstly, the progress made towards integration must not be reversed, and I should like at this point emphatically to stress that I do not share the German federal government' s position on the renationalisation of agricultural policy and of the Structural Funds in particular because it amounts to calling into question one of the Union' s central pillars, the principle of economic and social cohesion and solidarity between Member States."
"Secondly, we need a reform that will actually make the Union viable for the future."
"A constitutional process must therefore be initiated the outcome of which will be the formation of a united Europe by the will of its citizens."
"This naturally involves a Europe-wide, broad and open public debate, that is essential, but I should also like to stress that Nice has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference method is out of date."
"It is no longer the appropriate way of carrying Europe substantially forwards."
"We need a method, the convention method that many here have already mentioned."
"Important and essential as decisions about the future institutional structure of Europe are, we must not forget to question the contents of European policy."
"Europe' s future cannot remain confined to the market and common currency."
"I welcome the fact that French Prime Minister Jospin put the objectives of Union policy at the centre of his latest speech and did not, like Germany' s Chancellor Schröder and Foreign Minister Fischer, largely confine himself to questions of EU institutional reform."
"The debate over the content of European Union policy is in fact at present more urgent than the discussion about its final institutional shape and I welcome the fact, Madam President-in-Office, that you also raised the matter today."
"Justice, solidarity and social policy must be central values and tasks of the Community."
"Jospin' s proposals for a closer coordination of economic policies and the formation of an EU economic government as well as for setting up an EU economic fund to assist EU Member States in times of crisis are therefore extremely topical."
"Social dumping must no longer be commonplace in the European Union, harmonisation of corporate taxation is in fact urgent."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission, the European Union leaders when they met in Nice last December to review existing treaties had one single objective in mind: they sought to change the internal decision-making procedures within the institutions of the Union to guarantee that enlargement of the European Union could take place."
"I believe the Treaty of Nice is a balanced agreement which guarantees the go-ahead to the enlargement process whilst at the same time protecting and promoting the entries of the smaller Member States."
"The Treaty of Nice does not build a two-tier European Union whereby larger Member States can dictate the pace of change within the Union at the expense of the smaller states."
"There will not be a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Union as a result of the enactment of the provisions of the Treaty."
"The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states."
"All Member States within the Union will retain the right to appoint one member to the Commission until 27 countries become full members of the Union, and even at that stage, positions in the Commission will be distributed between all Members on a rotation basis."
"Decisions concerning key national entries will remain the exclusive domain of individual Member State governments, and any changes concerning taxation policies or social security matters will be left to individual countries to decide on."
"The unanimity requirement for tax changes remains the order of the day within the Union."
"This is very important, because I believe that issues of taxation should be addressed by national parliaments and not decided centrally by the European Union."
"Enlargement of the Union will promote and consolidate democratic structures in Eastern and Central Europe."
"It will help to strengthen new free-market economies of these countries, and it will contribute to making these countries more competitive."
"The enlargement process provides the basis for a truly historic reconciliation on a continent which has been divided over the past century by wars and ideologies."
"It is incumbent on all of us to grasp the opportunities which are before us to help build a more stable European continent at peace with itself."
"We are all aware in this House that a constitutional referendum on the Treaty of Nice is being held in Ireland next week."
"The Treaty is certainly a good deal for countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but equally for existing Member States of the Union."
"There is no doubt that the operation of the internal market has been a success, particularly over the last ten years, and from an Irish perspective economic success in our country could simply not have been achieved if we were not a Member of the Union."
"Mr President, what the Treaty of Nice essentially boils down to is more Union and less democracy."
"The Treaty of Nice increases the distance between the EU élites and the people of the EU countries, who are being taken hostage as part of what might be described, at its mildest, as a warped understanding of democracy which also finds expression in this Assembly."
"What really was the background to the Treaty of Nice?"
"All right, it had to do with the enlargement and integration of the European continent."
"There are only two remarks to be made about this."
"Firstly, that what is necessary for securing enlargement is not to be found in the Treaty and that what is to be found in the Treaty is unnecessary for the sake of enlargement."
"The crucial element of this Treaty and of the refrain that forms the basis of this report is to be found in the ambition expressed in recital F and in what follows on from this."
"It is a question of developing the EU' s institutions and, in particular of course, this Parliament as a surrogate for the national democracies."
"The majority of our group can essentially concur with the minority opinion, expressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, to the effect that what we have here is a warped view of democracy."
"We can see this in the curious provision whereby the EU élites are to supervise the democracies."
"What kind of talk is that?"
"Is it not the people who supervise their democracies?"
"No, it has to be the EU élites."
"We can see this in the curious proposal tabled in the last part-session, a foretaste of the new Article 191, 'European political parties' . These are to be financed by the European Union because they cannot acquire money in any other way, partly because they do not have any members."
"What kind of view of democracy is that?"
"Finally: are the various populations being asked about this Treaty?"
"The Danish people are not being asked."
"The only people who are being asked are the Irish people, and I sincerely hope that, on behalf of all the populations of Europe, the Irish people will tell these élites that their conception of democracy is a misunderstanding and then vote against the Treaty on 7 June."
"Mr President, with all due respect, because this debate is about institutions and democracy, if you are going to be strict, you should be strict with all the groups."
"If you are going to be tolerant, you should be tolerant with all the groups, at least in the first round."
"I think that then we would all stand to benefit."
"Mr Alavanos, I will try and keep the time because if Parliament gets behind schedule, it is extremely complicated for some of the people who come later in the debate, not just the ones who are at the front."
"As far as your group' s spokesman was concerned, I have to tell you she had exactly the same amount of time as Hans-Gert Poettering for instance, and Mr Barón Crespo."
"Mr Cox went over a little bit but he was giving one of the most impassioned speeches that have been made in this Parliament for a long time and I think the House was enjoying listening to it."
"Mr President, we have had an almost permanent Intergovernmental Conference for 10 years, we have had endless debates on the nature of the European Union and even on its raison d'être. The European Union increasingly resembles one of these useless machines seen in contemporary art, where the only important thing is the complexity of its workings."
"The whole thing has spiralled so far out of control - I actually heard the word 'extravagant' being used earlier - that some of the social democrats are beginning to openly call for a new type of nationalism, but, this time, one with a European edge, whereas even they are proving to be unable to shoulder their rightful responsibilities on behalf of their own countries."
"Since the Treaty of Nice was a failure, let us move swiftly on to a fifth European Treaty, which will surely be better than the previous ones with their countless directives and regulations."
"Of course, however, European integration is something that is so distinctive, paradoxical and uncertain that it is untouchable."
"The gestures made by the institutions favouring a 'federation of nation States' or a 'United Europe of Nations' , as in the slogan used during a certain election campaign, cannot hide the reality that today' s Europe is merely a trading post that has one or two environmental concerns and is dominated by media finance."
"Everyone is well aware that the common agricultural policy is on its last legs."
"Guaranteed prices have been widely replaced by grants and a policy of high productivity has driven most farmers from their land."
"In this respect, the recent proposal by Chancellor Schröder, to exchange maintaining the common agricultural policy in return for a step towards European federalism, should remain unanswered, as, in actual fact, in order to save the last farmers, we must move towards phasing out the common agricultural policy."
"With regard to the Structural Funds, the grants of which gave rise to countless cases of irregularities, it is utterly unrealistic to claim that it will be possible to maintain the Fund beyond 2006."
"Let us keep the money that is still available for the candidate countries, in the shape of an increased Cohesion Fund, in the hope, of course, that these countries do not become disillusioned too quickly about the actual advantages that they will gain from European utopia."
"We oppose any form of European nationalism."
"Mr President, I should also like to applaud the rapporteurs in particular because they did not give way to the temptation, perhaps even the pressure from a largish number of parliamentarians, to demonise the outcome of Nice as a knee-jerk reaction, but rather endeavoured to make an objective critique."
"Almost everything has already been said about Nice."
"I should like, however, to take up one thing that Mr Poettering touched upon but did not really emphasise."
"I consider the call for the Intergovernmental Conference proposed in Nice for 2004 to be brought forward to 2003 to be mistaken."
"The arguments put forward for that are not convincing."
"For one thing we also have important elections in Europe in 2003."
"Secondly - and there is extensive agreement about this despite differing ideas about the run-up to it - the next Intergovernmental Conference is to be of short duration."
"It can therefore easily be accommodated after the elections to the European Parliament."
"Above all, however, the best way to meet the desire for a broadly-based discussion about the future of the Union would be to make it a subject of the election campaign."
"Bringing the meeting forward looks like evading the electorate and the electorate will see it that way."
"Be warned!"
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the honourable Members Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro and point out that the Spanish contribution to the future of Europe is, first and foremost, the result of dialogue and proper political compromise."
"It is true that the Nice Summit and the Treaty of Nice contain numerous contradictions and a great many lacunae, especially as regards the role of the European Parliament within both the future of Europe and the institutional framework on the basis of which Europe is to move forward from now on."
"However, the questions which we need to address from now on, as Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro have clearly stressed in their report, are important questions such as the separation of powers, the role of the European parliaments, the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and the future of the common foreign policy; questions which we shall be addressing between now and the Summit in Laeken and beyond, questions which will link future summits with the outcome of Nice."
"I listened very closely to the President-in-Office and I have to say that I am not bothered about fora or websites one way or the other."
"They are all extremely useful."
"What I am bothered about, however, is the fact that we have not yet said 'yes' to the need for a convention at which all the political forces in Europe can express their official, coordinated views and can conduct an official, coordinated dialogue on its future."
"Mr President, I hope Parliament will pass this resolution by a large majority. It is the fruit of long, thorough discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro making decisive contributions."
"It is a resolution which combines effectively severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice and serious concern about the risks arising from its immediate application at this new stage of European integration which is now in progress."
"The resolution contains precise guidelines for preparing adequate responses to the fundamental questions on the future of the Union in constitutional terms."
"We set great store - I want to stress this point particularly - by the role of the national parliaments and our cooperation with them in every possible way."
"We do not pretend to give instructions to the national parliaments on what they should do as regards ratification of the Treaty of Nice."
"What we do hope for is convergence on the proposal for a convention. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the convention is not meant to be a mere discussion forum producing, at best, polite recommendations, but a working body that can draw up documents to be submitted, eventually, to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"When we talk about a convention, we are not claiming a role for the European Parliament alone, but a shared role for all the parliaments, all the institutions directly representing the citizens at national level and Union level, which is the only way to guarantee openness, transparency and democracy - as you have said, Mrs Lindh - in the preparation of the future conference."
"None of the governments, whatever their political persuasion, are hesitating over the choice of a convention."
"Ultimately, they should also be concerned about not finding themselves back in a cul-de-sac, back in the cage, back in the nightmare of that last night at Nice!"
"My group is determined that the specific legitimacy of the European Parliament to play a part in the constitutional development of the Union should be recognised inside the convention."
"Parliament will bring wisdom and commitment to the process and focus upon common European solutions."
"However, we also require the Member States to play a full part inside the convention and there are currently certain signals that some prime ministers are preparing to concede us the convention but then to withdraw their own representatives from it."
"This would subvert the convention and it would be an insult to this Parliament."
"It would also ruin the pretence that the European Council respected the role of national parliaments."
"For the governments to absent themselves would leave us with a grandiose talking shop, it would be insufferable for this Parliament to be fobbed off in this way."
"I would request the Commission and Council to pledge that the convention will have four parties inside it, and that the IGC will use the work of the convention as the basis for the IGC."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, it is a great pleasure at this time - when in the United Kingdom I fear a rather negative tone has been taken about Europe - to be able to say how much one welcomes this development of a constitutionalisation of Europe in circumstances of enlarged and expanding democracy bringing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in."
"As the President-in-Office has said, it is an odd view that the European Union does not already have a constitution."
"Of course it does."
"It has an implicit and not very intelligible one, and the task is to make it explicit and intelligible and properly adopted."
"That does not necessarily imply a full-scale federation along the lines of Mr Schroeder."
"Those of us who believe in a confederal Europe believe just as much that it must be marked by respect for human rights, by clarity of democratic principle and by interaction of pluralistic constitutions, rather than a strictly hierarchical model."
"Too often in this House we hear the term ""nation"" used as though it were purely co-extensive with the term ""Member State"" ."
"It is a well-known fact, to those who reflect upon it, that there are more nations in Europe than there are states."
"One of the interesting features of our time has been, partly under the guidance of the growth of democracy in Europe, the re-emergence of internal democracies in small ancient nations of Europe like Catalonia, the Basque country, Scotland, Galicia and Flanders."
"We in the European Free Alliance hope that the process which we start today will be marked by a respect for subsidiarity in a generous and extensive sense: Amendments No 5 and 18 from the Liberals and Amendment 28 from my own group are for us keystones of this process."
"Surely indeed, this Union must recognise subsidiarity in a generous and broad sense, it must acknowledge the political and national diversity of the European Union and the debate on the future must take full account of the powers of the internal political units of the Member States, not only of the Member States themselves."
"In this election in Scotland, there is a debate going about whether there should be full fiscal autonomy for the Scottish parliament: autonomy is growing in all these small countries and it is vital that it be recognised."
"I was delighted that the recent statement by the Commission on tax harmonisation made it perfectly clear that there can be wide subsidiarity in these matters."
"Mr MacCormick, I am sorry I did not recognise that yesterday was one your special birthdays."
"Congratulations."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Nice tends to be marketed as an enlargement treaty."
"I do not believe that this is correct."
"This is because the institutional issues involved in the enlargement are not resolved by the Treaty of Nice."
"Moreover, most of what was decided in Nice has nothing to do with enlargement."
"As pointed out in the report, the seats in the European Parliament must be redistributed since there is direct discrimination against Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"This can be changed in the accession Treaties, just as these matters can be regulated in general in the accession Treaties as they were, for example, in the cases of Sweden, Austria and Finland when we joined the European Union."
"The Treaty of Nice is actually in the main about something else."
"It is about the power of the large EU countries being strengthened at the expense of the small countries."
"All the candidate countries except Poland are therefore also losers, because they will be small countries in the European Union."
"The decision-making process in the Council of Ministers will become more complicated, not simpler."
"The second main feature of the Treaty of Nice is the increasing move towards a superstate and the disappearance of the right of veto in more areas."
"There are also some clearly federalist elements, for example, as regards the support of European political parties and a new process for appointing the European Commission, which will mean that the Commission will increasingly resemble a government with a prime minister."
"The real significance of the Treaty of Nice is thus that an enlarged Union will be dominated by the same large countries as dominate today' s European Union and that the march towards the formation of a federal state in the EU is continuing, even if this development is not progressing as quickly as some in this assembly would like."
"It is therefore not difficult for my party and for me to vote against both the Treaty of Nice and the report that we are to vote on tomorrow."
"However, it is important to point out that the report does contain some positive elements."
"It calls for open meetings of the Council of Ministers."
"It would have been reasonable for such a decision to have been taken in Nice, that is, to open up the legislative assembly to inspection."
"Moreover, it calls for a redistribution of seats in the European Parliament, which is an essential democratic requirement."
"However, we do not believe in the convention method."
"We cannot really see the point of having a convention in order to draw up the next treaty amendment."
"However, if in the end we are to have a convention then we believe that it must be a convention for those who decide on the treaty, namely the national parliaments."
"We hope that the Swedish Presidency and the Swedish government will not move an inch from the idea that it is the national parliaments that must have decision-making rights over the treaties and that it is they who must control developments when the treaties are produced."
"So what should have been done in Nice instead?"
"Well, we would have liked to have seen a democratisation of the EU, a reduction in the power of civil servants and the Commission, an increase in the power of the national parliaments, increased openness and inspection in the Council of Ministers, a change in the dominance of the free market over environmental aspects and social aspects and a re-examination of the dogmatic monetarism which forms the basis of monetary union."
"Now we are instead seeing the social democrat governments starting to fall around the EU."
"There has been no actual change in the foundation of the EU during the time that we have had a 'red-green' dominance in the EU."
"The opportunity is about to be lost and the EU' s basis has not changed in either a 'red' or a 'green' direction, which we find regrettable."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to make nine brief points."
"This report does not concern the Treaty of Nice; it is about the post-Nice process, the start of the political circus at the Laeken Summit, which will be held at the end of the year."
"Nice is no longer an issue - it has galloped off into the sunset."
"The so-called crisis facing the European Union is a result of this federalist obsession."
"We could concentrate on reforming the institutions so that they function more effectively."
"We could begin here in Parliament, where democratic representation is so lacking in authenticity and so mediocre."
"But no!"
"Instead, you want to reform everything else."
"You spend all your time discussing changing the balance between the institutions and this is the source of the fight for power that you are so ready to criticise; the struggle between the Member States and the struggle between the institutions."
"This has opened up the fight for power."
"The federalists like invoking the founding fathers, but they would do better to read what they said."
"In his famous speech of 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman, said: ""Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"This should suffice for us to disregard this report, which is full of attacks and plans, completely ignoring the practical actions that have been taken to achieve a lasting, de facto solidarity."
"Where is the real cohesion?"
"By the same token, I must thank Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for having debunked one of the myths of federalism once and for all, which is the erroneous idea that it serves the smallest and the weakest States."
"This is a proposal to centralise power, to wipe out Member States, and to destroy social and economic cohesion."
"Exactly the opposite."
"We do not want to see a United States of Europe, but a Community."
"We do not want a federation of nation states, but a Union made up of the nation states that we are."
"Nothing more and nothing less."
"Who is abandoning ship here?"
"Who is actually destroying the Europe that has been successfully achieved?"
"Drafting a European constitution is another perverse fantasy."
"If there is no single European people, there can be no legitimate constituent European power."
"If there is no constituent European power, there can be no European constitution."
"Treaties can only be reformed by Treaties."
"There is an Arabic proverb that says, 'words are man' s invention for concealing his thoughts' ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, slightly less of Brussels, which I welcome, and slightly more of Germany - this is how, in my mind, we can sum up the disastrous Treaty of Nice that we are being asked to adopt."
"To think that two French people joined forces to undermine the European edifice, the cornerstone of which, for fifty years, has been parity between France and Germany. Everything tells us to respect this parity - geography and history, the head as well as the heart."
"Unfortunately since Nice, the Franco-German twosome looks like one of the couples made popular by the French artist Albert Dubout, and we now know who is wearing the trousers."
"This is primarily why, whether or not you are in favour of European integration as has been pursued for fifty years, no French citizen should ratify the Treaty which spells disaster for the interests of France as well as for the future of the European Union itself."
"I believe, if I may say so, that no one in Germany should vote for this Treaty either, since it seems obvious that the unexpected advantage gained at Nice by Germany is only due to the desire of our two national politicians, who behave much like Edouard Daladier, to come to an agreement, come what may."
"Mr President, this Treaty is not only worthless, which is what we are hearing from the whole of this House, but it is also dangerous, and Parliament would do itself credit if everyone of every political hue sent back their copy to those who, at Nice, made such a poor prediction about the future of Europe."
"Mr President, we shall not be voting in support of the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, which is, of course, far too indulgent towards the Treaty of Nice."
"In the very first Article, the report claims to believe that this text could remove the final obstacle to enlargement."
"That is not our view."
"This Treaty will not facilitate enlargement - on the contrary, it will complicate the issue."
"The protocol, which is supposed to prepare the institutions for this important deadline, is not at all convincing."
"The reform of the Commission will only take place after enlargement, and even then its content is extremely vague."
"The only clear issue, which is putting an end to the second Member of the Commission for the larger States, seems to hold little interest for us."
"As for the redistribution of seats in the European Parliament and re-weighting of votes in the Council, this makes the Community veer from an approach centred on States towards an approach centred on populations, which might help to lay the foundations of a superstate, but does nothing to help enlargement."
"In actual fact, the pursuit of a superstate justifies almost all the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are devoted to strengthening the institutions and the supranational procedures by extending majority voting to the crucial issues of sovereignty."
"One of these, which is the appointment of the Commission by qualified majority voting, would eventually transform the college into a government of Europe and would thus cause a radical upheaval of the philosophy of the European institutions that we know."
"The move towards the superstate relies on the belief, which the federalists hold dear, that we must react to the growing diversity within Europe by stepping up centralisation."
"In our view, this belief will make enlargement more difficult and, at the same time, it will increase the democratic deficit within today' s European Union."
"In order to explain this position, the Movement for France delegation to the European Parliament has just published a counter-report to the Treaty of Nice which, Mr President, I shall send to you and which is, sadly, our preference over the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro."
"Mr President, Nice was simply not a successful Summit."
"Very rarely has a European Summit taken place which has had such ill after-effects, as is mostly the case in very problematic births."
"Presidents, a Chancellor, Prime Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers are falling over each other with articles in prominent newspapers, with speeches for prestigious institutes and statements on what Nice should have been like and what should be Europe' s future."
"It would have been much better if that work had been delivered before and not after Nice."
"Maybe we would not be facing this debacle now."
"A great deal went wrong at Nice, but the most serious mistakes have been the complicated decision-making processes that have been created, which are even more complex and opaque than before, and the fact that on a number of scores, a qualified majority vote was taken without approval from the European Parliament."
"If this were to happen in a developing country, we would say, it was high time a good governance programme were drafted."
"It is therefore best not to look back any more, but to look to the future instead and to improve on Nice."
"In this connection, I welcome Chancellor Schröder' s initiative to adopt the PPE-DE ideas of the 70s and 80s and to give them a new lease of life."
"Mr Barón Crespo wondered what had happened to the proposals by the PPE-DE Presidents and Prime Ministers: reinforcement of the European Commission, a European Parliament with proper powers, and a Council which has to hold public meetings in the form of a Senate or a Bundesrat."
"Our PPE-DE - both group and party - have stood for those ideas since the 70s and 80s."
"The question is now how to ensure that these proposals actually take shape."
"We are no great fans of wise men - we have had 20 such committees since 1979 - or of a forum which can be convened at any time."
"Quite simply, a convention should be set up of national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"When national ministers meet in the European Summit, they would then at least be covered by national parliaments."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it would be better if you were to adopt this idea."
"I wish you good luck in Gothenburg, and I hope that a convention will ensue."
"That appears to be the best solution to me."
"Mr President, when the rapporteur started work on this report, there was a real danger that this Parliament would end up rejecting the Treaty of Nice through an unholy alliance of those who felt it went too far and those who felt it did not go far enough, so it is a tribute to their work that they have steered Parliament to a very sensible analysis of the Treaty and a strategy for moving forward from here."
"Some indeed, as we heard just now in the debate, still seem to have the fanciful idea that this Treaty is setting up a centralised superstate: I find it astonishing that they can read the Treaty of Nice and genuinely believe that."
"Also outside this House, the British Conservative Party is campaigning in the UK election saying it would not ratify the Treaty of Nice if it were to come to power."
"This is not the case with their Members here, or at least not all of their Members here - I noticed that the two British Conservative Members in the committee voted for the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report and I pay tribute to them for having done so."
"Conservatives back home, however, are coming up with this idea that this Treaty sets up a superstate."
"That really is nonsense and it does not seem to be doing them much good in the opinion polls."
"The public can see through this particular fanciful idea."
"If you were to look behind you, you would see in the bouquet of flags that the Irish Flag has been placed where the European Flag usually is, in the middle of the bouquet, presumably because Ireland is the only Member State holding a referendum on the Treaty of Nice."
"Why is only Ireland holding a referendum?"
"Why not Denmark and others?"
"Precisely because in this Treaty of Nice there is no further transfer of competence to the European Union."
"It is not a centralising treaty and the critics, of course, know that."
"Others have been disappointed with the Treaty of Nice, because it did not go far enough and because of some of the questionable compromises it contains, such as the voting system in the Council and the extra seats in the European Parliament."
"As work went on in our committee, however, we realised that Nice also had a lot of positive points."
"In any case if you feel that it had shortcomings, the best way to improve it is to use the process of 2004."
"Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion."
"2004 offers us opportunities to improve what our President of the Council refers to as the existing European constitution, the Treaties."
"Yes, it needs improvement, but so does our method for working on it."
"That needs to start with our preparation for an IGC: Not the usual group of foreign ministry officials, with all due respect to Mr Gunnar Lund, but a wider more representative body."
"Hence Parliament's demand for a convention of the Council, not just a forum."
"The forum is the wide debate that is taking place with civil society."
"We need something to channel that debate into a set of conclusions that the IGC can work on. That is what we need, an IGC at the end remains something that can distil the debate..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the Treaty of Nice is obviously open to a wide range of interpretations."
"It is positive that the informal barriers to enlargement have been cleared away and that the Union is now constitutionally ready for its important task of uniting Europe."
"Now we hope for a clearer timetable and preferably a date at the summit in Gothenburg in a couple of weeks' time."
"There are, of course, major problems with the Treaty: it makes the decision-making process no simpler, no more efficient and scarcely any more comprehensible to our citizens."
"It also leaves much to be desired in democratic respects."
"Far too many decisions will continue to be made behind closed doors in the Council - without the democratic control, inspection or participation of Parliament."
"The method for the Intergovernmental Conference is rather reminiscent of that for choosing a new pope."
"The delegates are locked away in negotiations for several days whilst the world outside waits impatiently for the white smoke, a sign that a compromise has been reached."
"During that time nobody knows what is happening."
"However, now the next treaty is to be prepared differently - together with the citizens."
"It is important to remember these fine speeches when the plans are being made for Laeken."
"Perhaps it will be a convention after all."
"After all, it is no secret that the majority in this chamber advocate that in any case."
"It is the most open and democratic way of preparing proposals."
"However, now there are rumours that it will be a convention without government representatives."
"So what will it be?"
"A talking shop, an alibi that the ministers then ride roughshod over?"
"It is not a good solution!"
"It is also time to turn away from Nice and look to the future."
"We are doing this in the European Parliament as well, possibly not so much today, but we shall do so."
"Some Heads of Government are also doing so."
"Moreover, I hope that more Heads of Government and ministers will participate in the debate on the future of Europe."
"The Foreign Minister spoke of 'the term federalism' and the different feelings that it invokes."
"This is true, and the substance is of course more important than the term itself."
"Federalism - with the different interpretations that it may be given - is, however, a vision of a more democratic Europe."
"Different visions of the European project are essential to the European debate, so that citizens gradually find out what issues they are to take a position on."
"Mr President, we support this resolution reaffirming the full right of the European Parliament to take part in decisions on the future of the Union, which many government ministers still believe to be their exclusive prerogative."
"To obtain that right, we call on the Commission, the national parliaments and those governments which recognise that genuine democracy at European level is in the interests of their citizens - perhaps not in the interest of their administrations, but certainly in the interests of their citizens. Those are the governments which no longer believe the nonsense about the mystical omnipotence of the sovereign state and which were embarrassed at Nice by the haggling that went on there."
"We want them to become our allies in obtaining two things: a constitution and a convention."
"We expect their support on these two matters."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Nice was a coup on the part of the large countries."
"They gained more votes at the expense of small countries."
"Large countries were also given a new right of veto based on their population."
"The Treaty of Nice was justified by the needs of enlargement."
"The leaders of small countries have approved the principle according to which the number of votes of large countries grows, even if the EU is not enlarged."
"This misjudgement on the part of the leaders of small countries alone is sufficient grounds to reject the Treaty of Nice."
"Declaration 23 adopted in Nice will increase federalist pressure for the EU to adopt a superstate constitution and use the convention method in its preparation."
"This is an unparliamentary and undemocratic method."
"The Treaty of Nice supports a federal republic along the lines of the German model and does not recognise the demand of the French Prime Minister for a Europe of independent states."
"This report supports the development of a federal state and must be rejected, and national parliaments should reject the Treaty of Nice."
"I wish every success to the democrats in Ireland, whose referendum offers the opportunity to reject the treaty through direct democracy."
"Other countries do not dare to ask their citizens, who are the sole subjects of democracy."
"Mr President, there are those in this Parliament who take a very negative view of the Nice Conference and I am one of them. I have signed a written resolution - and I hope it will collect as many signatures as possible - stating that Parliament considers the Treaty of Nice a backward step for the European institutions."
"However, the deed is done and, at this point, we need to look forwards and try to ensure that Parliament and the European institutions march towards the goal of a constitution, no longer handed down from on high but built from below."
"I believe in that, and I also believe that it is a great goal, which does not eliminate the nation states but unites the peoples of Europe, as it is and as it will be, in a greater dream."
"That seemed to be the path before us, but there is no point in ignoring new developments. The French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, has, in recent days, been making statements to the contrary."
"The French government' s statements make no reference or allusion to progress via a European convention towards a European constitution."
"If I have understood them correctly, those statements - but that is how they have been interpreted - are saying the exact opposite. This is a huge new political fact which cannot be disregarded."
"I hope France is not going to maintain this position in the future."
"I also hope the President of the Republic, who has the power to intervene, will correct this approach, but if the Seguro resolution is passed tomorrow - and I would have liked to make it even stronger - we have to recognise that it is a proposal contradicting the recent statements by Mr Jospin and the French government."
"I hope Parliament and the Commission will be true to the outcome of tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, allow me, by way of parallel process, to give you a brief, historical account. In the seventeenth century, the Netherlands consisted of seven provinces which were each independent and sovereign."
"Only certain matters were regulated by a common authority."
"How did they deal with decision-making in those days?"
"Every province used to have veto right in all decisions."
"Furthermore, the representatives were not authorised to render decisions binding upon their provinces."
"That was only possible following approval from the province."
"You can imagine that in an era of coaches, tow barges and carrier pigeons, this caused quite a bit of delay."
"Despite this, the Netherlands was in those days a prosperous world power and had, relatively speaking, a great deal of freedom."
"The complex political system evidently did not cause any obstacles."
"Many in this Parliament do not spell a bright future for Europe."
"The European Union is said to head for a deadlock, unless more far-reaching and in-depth centralisation takes place."
"I would call that into question."
"Decision-making will mainly depend on consensus among governments."
"The past has shown that this can also be reached unanimously."
"More important, however, is the EU' s future stability."
"That will depend largely on the extent to which its decisions are experienced as being legitimate."
"The EU' s legitimacy is a far greater problem than its complex political structure."
"However, the legitimacy of decision-making cannot be enhanced by centralisation."
"It is distressing to see a lack of attention for this point in the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report."
"That is why I shall be voting against it."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this objective, interesting report."
"The success of Nice is perhaps the fact that this paper exists and it is now up to those responsible to take things forward on the basis of it."
"The following areas are important for us: the division of competences between the EU and the Member States that could stand at the start of a constitutional process, the simplification of the Treaties to make them easier to communicate to the population and easier for those affected to understand, the inclusion of national parliaments in a future united Europe in order to involve the citizens and make them more enthusiastic for a united Europe, and of course the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If my colleague Mr Voggenhuber spoke so despairingly about the behaviour of electors in Italy and Austria, perhaps he needs to remember that the European democracy he is so keen on means above all else respect for the wishes of the electorate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two rapporteurs, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo and António José Seguro, took on the difficult task of evaluating the results of the Nice Government Summit in December 2000 without hurting anyone while at the same time setting our sights for the future and expressing the hopes and demands of the European Parliament."
"They deserve our sincere thanks."
"Political closeness to the governments in the home countries obviously plays some part in the evaluation of the results of Nice."
"Whether the practice of appointing two rapporteurs from different groups will still be meaningful for the European Parliament in the future needs to be looked at carefully."
"As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should have liked the language to have been clearer."
"I know that large parts of the PPE-DE Group and not only my German colleagues agree with me."
"In our view, the results of Nice are not sufficient to create the institutional conditions for enlargement."
"We regret that precisely because we want enlargement and want it as quickly as possible."
"We have reservations in particular about the complicated voting procedure in the Council of Ministers, but also about the number of MPs and the composition of the European Parliament; that this should not be settled until 2009 is completely unsatisfactory, will create legal problems in the meantime, create injustices for some candidate countries and also cement the continuing democratic deficit because it fails to link the codecision process to majority voting in the Council of Ministers."
"Nice set out four topics for the new Intergovernmental Conference, of which the definition of competences is of the utmost importance for us and must be settled before the first accessions."
"Unfortunately, the draft repeatedly speaks of a constitution."
"I want to argue here for the clear legal concept of a constitutional treaty."
"Lastly and most important of all: the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must not only be prepared for more carefully, it must be over by the end of 2003, and that means that the way must be definitively paved in the form of the convention, timetable and content by the time of the European Council in Laeken at the end of 2001 at the latest."
"Mr President, despite the limited speaking time that I have, I do not wish to miss the opportunity to give some deserved praise to the two rapporteurs."
"They have taken up the challenge of winning over a broad majority of Members, given a project, which, at the outset, seemed to be impossible to defend."
"Nice was the summit of interests, not to mention the summit of national egoism."
"In reality, no major European project, no exciting inspiration could come out of an agenda which was confined to the leftovers from Amsterdam."
"The post-Nice process now gives us the opportunity to reassert the importance of politics."
"Before we start another rush-job on the institutions, let us clearly establish why we want more of Europe, to protect and consolidate our fundamental values and our social model, in order to give more weight to the European Union, and occasionally to give it more balance, in international politics, to say loudly and clearly that internal and external solidarity must take precedence over any prevailing egoism."
"We do not need any new institutions."
"Let us strengthen the existing institutional triangle."
"First and foremost, let us find a better way to involve citizens in the preparation of the future of the Union."
"The new method of the convention that our two rapporteurs have been hoping and praying for gives us the opportunity to do this."
"Some new inspiration, some groundswell, must reinvigorate the old method of intergovernmental negotiation."
"In order to unveil this new round of European integration, let us allow our imagination to run free, and let us begin by saying 'yes' to the convention."
"Mr President, this report does not reflect the political reality of the sub-state situation."
"That is why we have presented amendments: because the sub-state situation does not appear in this report and it is important that they, the constitutional regions, participate in this preliminary debate and participate in the convention."
"This is the desire of many people in Europe."
"For this reason, not only are we presenting these amendments, but also the highest representatives of the important European regions - Catalonia, Bavaria, Scotland, Rhineland North Westphalia, Salzburg, Wallonia and Flanders - met on Monday with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, in order to raise exactly the same issue with him."
"If these amendments are approved, it will show that the reality has been positively recognised and that the principle of subsidiarity is functioning properly."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo, this report gives hope to many of us."
"Let us hope that it represents a road and not an inn."
"I congratulate you and Mr Seguro on the work you have done."
"Mr President, there has been severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice, not just here in this House, but throughout Europe."
"The kind of late-night dealing and smoke-filled rooms that finalised the treaty was the unacceptable face of the EU and it is not worthy of a Union of 350 million people."
"The focus should be accountability and democracy, but Nice was a shambles with the outcome for Ireland that we lose our automatic right to a Commissioner."
"I believe Ireland will vote ""no"" on 7 June in spite of the sneers of some elites here and elsewhere and that result will be welcomed all over Europe."
"The Treaty of Nice allows a core group of Member States to form an elite inner circle."
"They have hijacked the EU institutions and this will mean that some states become second class members including the new applicant countries."
"We need an accountable Europe that makes human rights a core value and brings progress on social and environmental rights also."
"The EU, which brought former enemies together for peaceful cooperation, is now being militarised."
"The Treaty of Nice could mean that a number of Member States could decide to go ahead with a nuclear-armed force even though other states do not agree."
"That should be unthinkable."
"Mr President, I disagree with this report for three basic reasons."
"The first concerns its view of the Treaty of Nice' s content. It adopts an uncompromising approach in its criticism of the positions that were adopted there, considering them to be timid and inadequate, when what it should have done was criticise the steps towards federalism, which threaten the fundamental interests of some current and future Member States, since the applicant countries could not take part in a process of decision making on changes that will affect them."
"It is also unacceptable for the European Parliament to criticise the position taken in Nice on increasing the number of MEPs in order to ensure a more pluralist composition following enlargement, although it then tries to achieve some fairness with regard to the number of representatives from Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"The lowest possible number!"
"My second point of disagreement concerns speeding up the process of preparing the new Treaty when the Treaty of Nice has not even been ratified by the Member States' national Parliaments."
"It is unacceptable to insist on a proposal that seeks to make rapid progress on revising the Treaty in order to conclude it by the end of 2003 without even guaranteeing participation on an equal footing for the applicant countries."
"My third point of disagreement concerns the method that has been laid down for following up the proposal to draft the Charter."
"This method excludes the participation of parties with different political views, which threatens the pluralism and the genuinely independent and democratic participation of national parliaments."
"Mr President, we note with interest that the governments are starting a dialogue on the future of the Union."
"After proposals from Mr Fischer and Chancellor Schröder, this week it is Mr Jospin' s stance that augurs a European future based on nation states."
"I listened to the news with approval, both because I belong to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and because, since I was elected to this Parliament twelve years ago, I have supported achieving political union without sidelining the nation states."
"A confederation of states, respecting the principle of subsidiarity and respecting differences, would enrich a united Europe and its peoples."
"I do not agree with the emphasis placed on the convention model as the body to prepare for the coming umpteenth Intergovernmental Conference, because a Parliament which cannot change a comma in the text drafted by the convention becomes a democratic fiction."
"We have already endured that situation."
"We do not want the bill on the future of the Union submitted to us for consent as well, because that is the same as being told that we can debate as long as we like but we cannot amend the text."
"The future of Europe cannot be entrusted just to a convention, however enlightened and elite, but it must remain a prerogative of the representatives of the institutions and of the people's elected representatives."
"We are also puzzled by the fact that there is talk of the role to be played by the national parliaments before our own Parliament has finally been granted the prerogatives proper to an institution elected by direct universal suffrage."
"We are beginning to eliminate the democratic deficit Altiero Spinelli spoke of long ago, but it still exists and we fail to eradicate it because we talk too much and do too little."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Seguro on their joint report and the work involved, and the Constitutional Committee and the other committees who worked towards this debate."
"We have had the work in committee and now we have to make a choice in plenary."
"Conservative MEPs will be opposing this report, not as a verdict on the Treaty of Nice, but rather to initiate a change of procedure in preparations for the next IGC and to raise the subject of galvanising public awareness and participation in the post-Nice debate."
"The hallmark of the report is its proposal for the formation of a convention to prepare for the next Intergovernmental Conference This convention would consist of representatives from the Commission, national governments, the European Parliament and national parliaments and it would prepare the agenda and the proposals for the next IGC."
"We are not convinced this is the right course."
"Moreover there are a number of clauses that we Conservatives are unable to support in this report, such as the inclusion in the Treaty of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights or the extension of QMV to cover taxation."
"However, despite the connotations surrounding the subject of this report, there is no explicit ""yes"" or ""no"" given to the Treaty of Nice itself."
"It raises however the important points of increased democracy and transparency for the next IGC."
"We believe that there should be an early IGC."
"I agree with that part of the report, which calls for this, because this would place the main choices before the European public, including I hope by then some enlargement countries, so that they could make their choices at the next European election."
"I look forward to the debate at that time."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Nice represents both a failure and an opportunity."
"It is a failure because it does not contain the necessary reforms for the Union to appropriately confront all its present and future challenges."
"For example, it does not include either co-decision as standard or the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Nice is also an opportunity, however, because the announcement of the next IGC leaves the door open to a new phase in European integration, whose objectives are to respond to the demands of the citizens, to put an end to the democratic deficit, to implement the European social model, to intervene, with our own ideas, in globalisation, in order to regulate it, and to complete enlargement without turning the EU into a mere free trade area."
"Today more than ever it is essential that we opt for a bigger and better Europe, for a more political Europe with more European policies, for an enlarged federal political Union which is more democratic and efficient."
"Because our present situation must not be weakened in the future, by renationalising policies such as cohesion. On the contrary, we must complement the euro with an economic government for the Union, build a social Europe and provide a realistic budget which is sufficient and progressive."
"The key to this new cycle must be to adopt a European constitution by means of a radically democratic process which goes way beyond Nice and is led by a convention, made up equally of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament - whose final composition will have to be set within this framework - and national parliaments, which produces a constitutional proposal which will have to be formally adopted before the European elections."
"Tomorrow, on voting by a majority for this magnificent report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro - who I congratulate on their work - the European Parliament, as we hope also national parliaments will do, will demand of governments that they accept this option and understand its message; Constitution and convention - not more Treaties or more intergovernmental deviation - and that they do not once again respond timidly to the great challenges facing us."
"Mr President, an unbecoming process and a still worse result, is what many here in Parliament are saying for a variety of reasons."
"All right, perhaps that is the case, but democracy is a human creation after all, and only a human creation."
"One thing is quite clear, however."
"Those who vote against the Treaty of Nice are voting against solving the EU' s most important problem right now, namely that of enlargement."
"That is how simple it is, irrespective of the reasons given for voting against."
"Those who establish the ground rules have defined the Treaty of Nice as the turning point for enlargement of the Union, and that is the case, irrespective of the fact that others want to see different ground rules."
"We could therefore try to find new ground rules for the future, but ones which do not affect ourselves alone but, above all, involve the people."
"Moreover, I must appeal to the media to participate in this process and, it might also be said, perhaps to take their public service remit seriously for once."
"Mr President, I find it pleasing that is that there are so many participants in this debate that it is going on longer than planned."
"However, I regret that since it has gone on longer I must leave the debate in order not to miss the last flight to Sweden."
"To return to the beginning of the debate and the contributions that were made then, I do not know whether I can promise Mr Cox an Irish pub with beer, or whether I can promise Mr Voggenhuber a European bazaar, but as I said in my introductory statement, as Swedish Foreign Minister I believe in a genuinely open forum - a convention."
"I can agree with what Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, Mrs Kaufmann and others have said, that a convention is an important part of the preparations."
"However, at the same time we must remain open to other preparations as regards national committees and debates, as regards technical preparatory groups and the like."
"I would like to come back to Mr Cox' s comparison with the Irish pub, where no doubt the beer represented the convention."
"I have also been to Irish pubs and I agree that the beer plays the most important role, but there has also been the possibility of having a mineral water, a fruit juice or a glass of wine, so we can no doubt show the same generosity when it comes to preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The decision on whether or not to have a convention will be taken in Laeken, but it is my hope that we will move in the right direction in Gothenburg."
"I would also like briefly to touch on the criticism of Nice."
"I believe that it is over-hasty to say that the decision-making process is worse following the Treaty of Nice, as some speakers have done."
"After all, we know the problems that we see arising when decisions have to be taken unanimously."
"Now we are making decisions by qualified majority in many more areas."
"At the same time, in practice it is often the case that where we have the right to take decisions by qualified majority compromises and decisions are forced through, and it is very unusual for there to be a formal vote."
"When we evaluate the Treaty of Nice I believe that we will see that in practice the decision-making process has actually been improved."
"Moreover, I would like to agree with the speakers who said that Nice was decisive for being able to continue with the enlargement and that Nice has therefore played an important part in ensuring that what is the most important matter for the Union today, namely enlargement, will continue to be important."
"As far as that is concerned, as President-in-Office of the Council I also think that it is pleasing to be able to state that we now have an agreement between the Member States concerning free movement of labour, which also allows us to move on in the enlargement negotiations."
"Finally I would like to thank you for today' s debate."
"Mr President, for some unknown reason I have not been able to speak amongst the draftspeople of the opinions of the different committees, but I am now going to give the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believes that the non-introduction of co-decision is one of the main issues left undealt with at Nice."
"Therefore, agriculture is still receiving discriminatory treatment in comparison with fields connected to it such as public health, consumer protection or the internal market."
"We believe that the Nice Summit has left the public with the image of States which are excessively concerned about the distribution of internal power within the institutions and has led to serious doubts over the Council' s capacity and political will to reach the necessary agreements required by agricultural policy."
"These reforms must respond to the increasing demands of the European citizens, to the challenges of enlargement and to our commitments within the World Trade Organisation."
"Furthermore, we believe that following Nice the complex process of decision-making is becoming even more complicated, if that is possible, and this may paralyse the coming reforms of the CAP."
"We do not want this situation to endanger the guarantee of the European farm model which - we must not forget - is a fundamental element of the European social model."
"For all these reasons, we ask that the next Intergovernmental Conference consider the modification of the agricultural chapters of the Treaties in order to introduce co-decision."
"We sincerely believe that the new agricultural policy, based on the principles of multi-functionality and sustainability, requires and demands co-decision in order to achieve greater democratic legitimacy, greater transparency and also - of course - greater coherence in the agricultural policy which European society is demanding."
"Mr President, the basic philosophy behind the Treaty of Nice is how to strengthen the unifying policy of integration and do more for European monopolies."
"This endeavour is still encountering problems, including among the very people who inspired it, as to who will have the upper hand in Europe following enlargement."
"The pitiful bartering on qualified majority voting which took place in Nice, and which almost blew the Summit apart, confirms this and anyone who talks of a European family is guilty of hypocrisy."
"The report under discussion today applauds the anti-democratic and reactionary provisions of the Treaty of Nice and lobbies for even more anti-democratic arrangements, such as the abolition of the veto and various other issues, the integration of foreign policy and defence and security policy, the inclusion of fundamental anti-grass roots rights in the Treaty and the facility to circumvent national parliaments by creating a special convention to table a proposal for a constitution."
"This is an unacceptable proposal; the people of Europe are already fighting against the thrust of it and will continue to do so."
"Mr President, I approve of the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report, which represents an excellent summary of the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The reunification of Europe is indeed a historic turning point, but a turning point which calls for a far-reaching reform of the institutions of the Union."
"The Nice Summit exhausted the intergovernmental method which necessarily involves difficult mediation between national interests."
"What is needed now is a constituent convention to define, before the European elections, a model capable of guaranteeing democracy and efficiency in Union action."
"The report avoids exacerbating the argument about the Treaty of Nice, but clearly condemns its limitations."
"However, we cannot remain silent, waiting for Laeken, at a time when influential spokesmen of national governments are addressing issues fundamental to the future of the Union."
"Chancellor Schröder has spoken of a European federation, Prime Minister Jospin of a Europe of nations."
"I do not know what Aznar and Berlusconi will say, but I do know that the specific problems of the Community and the reform of the institutions are two sides of the same coin, and I do know that Europe must become a political area with a democratic soul."
"Parliament cannot stand on the sidelines of this debate."
"The future of Europe cannot be left entirely to market forces and confrontation between national governments."
"Parliament must promote a debate going beyond the pragmatism that ties the hands of the national governments."
"Because of the things we have heard, that debate also tells us we must be braver and more forward-looking if we claim to be realists."
"Mr President, I also want to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro for this excellent report, which reflects the opinion of the vast majority here in the European Parliament."
"I am sure we will find that tomorrow in the vote."
"I should also like to note, however, that this is the first time the European Parliament is not saying a clear yes to a European treaty."
"This is something new and different from Maastricht and Amsterdam."
"I think it should sound an alarm to the governments that negotiated this treaty."
"We are not saying a clear yes because we are not satisfied with the results and because we believe neither freedom of action nor, of course, democratic control are guaranteed in a Union that is now being extended to 20 or 25 states."
"The formal obstacles have been removed, but there are still material problems of efficiency and transparency."
"This is a cause for concern."
"It is why we cannot say a clear yes."
"We want something to be done about what happened in Nice."
"I can only agree that there must now be a convention to prepare for the next European treaty."
"It must have a clear mandate to produce a treaty that the citizens, too, can read and understand."
"It must be a mandate for a constitutional treaty, a document that will create the basis for this enlarged Union."
"I should like to confine myself to a core subject for this convention, namely removing the democratic deficit in the Union."
"We all talk about it, but we still have different ideas about how it should be done."
"I believe the most important institution for the citizens is the European Parliament, not the Council of Ministers."
"This Parliament must therefore be strengthened."
"We unite people, not states."
"We therefore need the Europe of citizens and not just a Europe of governments!"
"Mr President, five arguments. First, yes to the constituent convention, but it also needs to represent the regional level."
"Secondly, we need a federalist constitution based on subsidiarity from Union to Member State and from Member State to regional community."
"The third argument is the trickiest: we need a sort of pyramid-shaped constitution of European citizens with us, the powers and institutions of the Union, at the top, the logic of the states, at least those that remain, at the second level and the regional constitutions taking up the most space."
"That brings me to the fourth argument, which is that the Treaty of Nice will only be swallowed if we have already done this groundwork."
"Finally, the constitution must offer an international guarantee to the minority populations of Europe."
"Mr President, basically, my views have been covered in the initial position taken by Mr Kaufmann and my other fellow Members on behalf of our group."
"I should just like to say briefly that the Nice Summit was held against a background of total indifference on the part of the citizens of Europe, despite the fact that it has serious repercussions for them, and total indifference on the part of the governments towards the citizens of Europe."
"This is clear from both the content and the fate of the Charter of Human Rights."
"Yet again we witnessed the crudest form of bartering, in contrast to the grand declarations being made by the German chancellor, the French Prime Minister and so on."
"The point is, where was this attitude, where were Mr Schröder's and Mr Fischler's dreams when negotiations were taking place in Nice?"
"Having said which, here we are, post Nice, and I think that the European Parliament can help take us in a new direction; one step could be making up the huge democratic deficit and taking part in constitutional procedures and another could be moving towards certain policies to benefit the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, this is the first time in fifty years, if you look back on fifty years of European history, that those responsible for Europe have had to judge a treaty which puts Europe back."
"Until now, all the treaties, each in their turn, have been treaties which push Europe forward to a greater or lesser degree."
"This is the first treaty which puts Europe back."
"For a long time, there have, in fact, been two stakes on the table and two historic stakes at that: the first is to build up European power and the second is to give those in charge of this power, those in charge of this European power, democratic credentials."
"Power on the one hand, democracy on the other."
"Then along comes the Treaty of Nice establishing European impotence for a long time to come; it brings impotence to the heart of the European institutions and it brings a lack of transparency, which is the opposite of European democracy."
"These were the two stakes, and both have been lost."
"Which is why the Europe of Nice will not work."
"What we are, in fact, offering the countries which we have invited to join us and which are joining us, and some enthusiastically so, is a fools' bargain."
"They are entering a house in which European impotence and a lack of transparency are the main features."
"That is why I fear, even though I hear what is being said about post Nice, that post Nice will fail to come up to our expectations."
"In Nice, we bought a one-way ticket, which is why the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro resolution is a critical resolution."
"I would like it to be even more critical, however, which is why I shall abstain."
"Mr President. I would like to join in the praise that many Members have given to Mr Seguro and Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"I share Mr Corbett' s view that if the rapporteurs had not done such a good job then Parliament would in all probability have recommended voting against Nice."
"Despite the fact that I share the criticism that has been advanced, I believe that a no vote would have been much worse than a yes."
"The reason for this is that the important enlargement process would then have been delayed, which is not something that I want to see happen."
"I agree with much of the criticism."
"The major critical viewpoints concern the fact that following Nice the Treaty is more difficult to understand, which also affects our citizens' ability to participate in the Europe debate."
"It is a difficult treaty that is difficult to understand."
"Moreover, it risks becoming ineffective through the fact that we have made it more difficult to make decisions by qualified majority."
"It is true that more areas are covered by qualified majority voting, but these are not that important."
"The really important areas were not brought into this form of decision-making, which is unfortunate now that the Union is being enlarged."
"This is something that we must change."
"We need more decisions by qualified majority and codetermination rights for Parliament."
"The second form of criticism concerns openness and the way in which the Treaty was negotiated."
"I have heard that some have likened the negotiations to the choice of a pope, with people having shut themselves away in a room and then come out with a compromise."
"No outsiders were allowed to participate in the process."
"Let us not do this again."
"Let us start the convention, and let it become the starting point for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"After all, it does not mean that we must not carry on national debate with organisations and others."
"In this connection I also think that it is important that we accept our responsibility as politicians."
"We must not make the institutional debate the main issue; we must start from the objective questions: What do we actually want to do with the EU?"
"How is this to be done?"
"What tools shall we use?"
"We must start with the objective debate."
"Mr President, the key question remains: has Nice prepared the European Union for the pending historical enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe?"
"The answer is clearly no!"
"Nice is too restricted as a step forward."
"We should not, however, throw away the baby with the bath water."
"The new Treaty also contains upbeat points, and it would be a serious political mistake simply to wipe this new Treaty off the table."
"What matters now is to look to the future, to a wider and, at the same time, deeper debate on the EU' s future."
"Everything seems to be focusing on the Belgian Presidency and the Declaration of Laeken."
"However, we should not create any false hope: Laeken will not bring a new treaty and cannot provide a solution for the shortcomings which Nice has left behind."
"Laeken must, however, outline a roadmap, the agenda, the method and timing, to reach a new Intergovernmental Conference which will need to rectify Nice."
"Let us hope that both the present and candidate Member Sates will then be ready for an unmitigated deepening of the European integration process."
"Mr President, President of the Council, the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice will make possible the enlargement of the EU."
"This was also its main task."
"All fifteen national parliaments in the Member States will ratify the Treaty during 2001, irrespective of how dissatisfied and critical the majority here in the European Parliament are."
"Consequently, we Swedish Christian Democrats feel that item 42 concerning the consent of the European Parliament to the accession Treaties for the candidate countries could be worded so as to be considerably more positive and welcoming."
"How will item 42 be received in Estonia, in Poland or Cyprus?"
"Neither can my party approve item 25, which opens the way for the introduction of a common European level of taxation - and with decision rules based on a qualified majority."
"All our historical experience shows that new tax levels and new decision levels for tax deductions lead to higher taxes and less money left for the citizens."
"Another core issue for the decision-making competence of every national parliament and national government concerns defence policy."
"Sweden' s Christian Democrat party therefore cannot approve item 34 either, which calls for defence policy to be included in the so-called closer cooperation."
"At the same time my party wishes to welcome two historical improvements that are proposed in the report."
"Firstly, it is time to improve citizens' and the national parliaments' insight and control of the Council' s work and to make the Council' s meetings open when the Council acts as legislator."
"We must have this openness if we are to be able to talk about democracy and not just about diplomacy within the EU. In other words, we are in favour of item 11 and Amendment No 68."
"Finally, the principle of subsidiarity needs to be clarified. We are consequently in favour of the PPE-DE' s Amendment No 77 concerning definition of the EU' s powers."
"Mr President, the enlargement process is the bridge from the old Europe to the new."
"The debate that we are having today and the report that we are discussing is a first step in that process."
"It is important, however, that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas."
"Despite our misgivings about one aspect or the other of this report, we should be brave enough to give the leadership that the people of Europe expect from this Parliament, the elected representatives of the people of Europe."
"This report does not close off any options."
"It does not seek to give a view on the ratification of Nice."
"That is being left to the Member States whose responsibility it is."
"I happen to be campaigning in Ireland for a ""yes"" vote but it is a critical ""yes""."
"I have my criticisms of the Treaty of Nice, but it is important that we be brave enough to say, ""Of course, we have problems, but it is important that the enlargement process gets under way""."
"Most importantly in the debate about the future of Europe is the kind of Europe we want: do we want a democratically participative Europe, do we want a socially inclusive Europe?"
"If we do, it will not happen by accident."
"We must get involved in the debate, we have to persuade people here and in our own Member States."
"We must provide not only a forum at European level through a convention, but also ensure that there are fora in every Member State, so that people in each Member State can talk and debate with each other with other people in Europe."
"Mr President, the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice is taking place at a defining moment in our relationship with the European Union."
"Before the end of this decade, instead of being a major beneficiary of EU funding, we will become a net contributor to the EU budget."
"Fortunately, this is not having any significant impact on the attitude of Irish voters to the Treaty of Nice."
"Unlike the Spanish and Italian governments, Irish citizens are not being selfish about the effects of enlargement on our future share of structural and cohesion funding."
"Instead there is the positive recognition that we have an obligation to assist the fledgling democracies in the former communist countries."
"Nevertheless, they have real fears about aspects of the Treaty."
"They are particularly concerned that the traditional, consensual, decision-making process of the EU is being abandoned in favour of a system whereby larger Member States will exercise power at the expense of smaller countries."
"They are also worried that enhanced cooperation could create a first and second-class citizenship within the EU."
"Furthermore, the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force under the Amsterdam Treaty has worried some people that it will bring to an end Ireland's military neutrality."
"I do not share these concerns, but Irish citizens need assurance in these points, not only in the context of this debate, but also with regard to long-term Irish interests within the EU."
"If they want to maintain Irish influence in Europe, and especially the respected reputation that we have painstakingly built up over the years, the best way of achieving this is to ratify the Treaty of Nice: to reject it is to reject enlargement and unravel the process."
"However, no one can afford to be complacent about the outcome of the Irish referendum."
"Bearing in mind that voters will be going to the polls in both Britain and Ireland next Thursday, it would be somewhat ironic, indeed tragic, if we were to witness a massive rejection of euro-scepticism in Britain while at the same time it gained significant ground in Ireland."
"In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, for their excellent report."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro."
"Nice was in many ways a failure and, in my view, the IGC method is obsolete."
"Nevertheless, we will be voting in favour of the resolution, for Nice has created the minimum conditions for enlargement."
"Those who have suffered under that dictatorship for too long should not suffer under our lack of sufficient internal reforms."
"Another reason for casting a positive vote is because what seemed inconceivable until six months ago, even in this House, is now increasingly becoming a possibility in Laeken, namely a true convention of the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the governments, the European Commission, together with the social organisations and the citizens."
"The citizen' s input is crucial to ensure that the convention does not degenerate into a technical debate for experts which is unintelligible to the citizen."
"Mr President, that convention may not turn into a no-strings-attached talk shop: practical compromises must be reached which only in the final stage are rounded off formally by the IGC."
"Prior to that convention, we, as European Parliament, will this autumn have to put our own specific ideas about Europe' s future on the table, and the resolution is right to point this out."
"I would like the following: a European government whose prime minister is elected with a mandate on all matters which are best dealt with jointly, for example agriculture."
"This would lead to more political integration and a new European federation."
"I also want more subsidiarity, however, for that means that we will be better able to meet the local and regional needs."
"More than anything, I want more democracy."
"A valuable, powerful, democratic European Parliament, elected by the European citizens, with codecision in all areas of policy, and with a European constitution founded on the Fundamental Rights Charter."
"Mr President, we have a fine future ahead of us, and I believe that we did some sterling work in this resolution."
"I therefore hope that we as a group will be achieving a decent majority for a better approach."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mr President-in-Office, the Treaty of Nice fails to go far enough not only in institutional matters but in a number of important spheres."
"Take the very topical example of the common European trade policy."
"It is based on common principles and there is in principle majority voting."
"The small extension now being made in Article 113, Services and Intellectual Property, is counteracted by six exceptions and three proposals to the Council itself not to go beyond the spheres assigned to it."
"At the same time, the consultation of the European Parliament provided for up until now is eliminated with the result that today, unlike in the USA, there is no possibility for Parliament to play a formal part in Europe, either at national or European level, in broad areas of trade policy."
"We therefore demand, as clearly formulated in item 27 of the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report, that the European Parliament be fully involved in the common trade and external economic relations policy, both in the framing of policy and in the negotiation and conclusion of agreements - and here with codecision - because if the national parliaments no longer have any powers over common trade policy it is urgently necessary for the European Parliament to take their place as an element of democratic control and that formal provision be made for it to do so."
"Otherwise, when it comes to negotiations with the World Trade Organisation we as the European Parliament will be faced with an American Congress with full powers to act and able to give guidance to its administration whereas the European Parliament still has no formal powers in this respect."
"I therefore call on the Swedish Presidency to show the way forward so that the Belgian Presidency can get an effective revision of Article 133 adopted by the Council in Laeken when it comes to rectifying the Treaty of Nice."
"Mr President, honourable Members, may I say a few words on behalf of the Commission at the close of this long debate, starting by reiterating how much I personally, who am in charge of the reform of the institutions for the Commission, have appreciated the quality and efficiency of the parliamentary debates held here or in your Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the chairmanship of Mr Napolitano over the ten months leading up to Nice."
"I should like, therefore, to thank you for that and to thank the pairs of MEPs who have addressed these questions in turn, be it Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos during the IGC or Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, whom I should like to thank today."
"We, the Commission and the European Parliament, have worked well together so it is hardly surprising that we have the same take on the contents of the Treaty of Nice."
"I have already had occasion to say, and I shall repeat today, that this treaty is, in my view, a useful, short-term treaty."
"It is useful because of the advances which it makes: Article 7, the reform of the jurisdictional system, which certainly needed reforming, more flexible reinforced cooperation, which we certainly need and the legal basis which you wanted for a clear and transparent statute for the political parties."
"It is useful, above all, as many of you have emphasised, because it changes the light from amber to green as far as enlargement is concerned."
"It is a useful treaty, but it is a short-term treaty."
"What I mean by that, ladies and gentlemen, is that, in my view, the answers which it provides to the institutional challenge of creating a Union of thirty members which functions properly will not stand up in the long run to the problems which this Union of thirty members will encounter in the medium and long term."
"There are too many unanimous votes and too many rights of veto."
"We know full well that, with thirty members, this right of veto will be a source of impotence or collective weakness."
"Codecision does not apply generally to all Community legislation, as we wanted, and it is a pity that the European Parliament plays no part in commercial policy."
"Finally, to say that the voting system will remain or become more complex is an understatement."
"At this stage, and before you return your verdict in all good conscience and responsibility, I should like to repeat that this treaty is useful, that it is a short-term treaty, that we need to take note of it, that we need to use it and that we then need to move on."
"Its main merit is that it paves the way for proceeding smoothly and quite quickly towards enlargement."
"Another of its merits is contained in the annex, as if the heads of state and government realised, at five o'clock in the morning once they had signed the text, that they could not leave it at that and they decided to start a new exercise there and then, as if they too had a bad conscience."
"Well, both the European Parliament and, more importantly, the Commission, will have to commit to this new exercise, which takes us up to 2004 and for which a new method has been authorised, proving that the intergovernmental method alone has had its day."
"So now we have time to start a real public debate."
"As I said to the ministers of foreign affairs the other day we must find a way, in Gothenburg first of all, and perhaps in Laeken, but mainly in Gothenburg, of making an overall assessment of the national debates which are held, rather than holding a series of juxtaposed debates, a way of exchanging practices and information, of sort of cross-fertilising these national debates."
"The Commission, like the European Parliament, will be standing by at the Council's side, ready to turn these national debates into a European debate when the time is right."
"This public debate should enable us to make a sweeping examination of the weaknesses of the institutions and, over and above institutional questions, to start discussing the European project once again."
"What is our common objective?"
"Do we want to remain a large market which functions well with a single currency or do we want to go beyond that?"
"How can we reinforce the community of values, the community of solidarity which has existed between us for the past fifty years?"
"To prove that this European project obviously needs to evolve, but that it has borne fruit, especially with the Community model, which has functioned well, and with Community policies, which have been so useful."
"I should like in particular to remind you of the fruits of the policy for which I am responsible, the policy of cohesion."
"This is what is so important about the major debate to which we are committed."
"Then, in 2002 and 2003, we will need to find a way of structuring this debate, of structuring our work so that we can prepare the final Intergovernmental Conference properly."
"That is why, in 2002 and 2003, as President Prodi said, we too are in favour of setting up a convention of all four institutional partners, along the lines of the model which worked so well for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the national governments and the Commission."
"Having said which, I have not replied to all the questions raised, especially concerning the association of the candidate countries because we hope, in 2004, to carry out a major reform which will affect them directly, just as if affects us, today, in the Union."
"I think they too should have a place at the convention table."
"We shall also have to decide how best to organise the work of this convention."
"We know full well, ladies and gentlemen, that this convention - and I say this to reassure the Member States which have concerns on this count - will not take any decisions; it will make proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, which will then have to take the final decisions quickly and at the highest level."
"This convention, however, from my point of view and in the light of the different experiences which we have had and which I personally had in Amsterdam, Nice and in the fundamental rights convention, this convention is, I think, the best way of ensuring that the next IGC is a success."
"It is the best way of achieving greater transparency, of having a real debate, because the four institutional partners involved in this preparatory work and in these proposals have the means, just as you have the means, of going beyond these doors and explaining what is happening to the elected representatives and citizens of our countries."
"This therefore is the sine qua non to transparency and it is the sine qua non to proper democratic explanation."
"I should therefore like to say, on behalf of the Commission, that we are in favour of this convention in 2002 and 2003, because it is instrumental to the success of the exercise started in Nice and to real reform - this time in 2004."
"In all events, as far as the European Commission is concerned, it will participate fully, you may be sure, in preparing the various stages which will take us towards major reform between now and 2004."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Council and Commission mission to Korea"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on the results of the Council and Commission Mission to Korea."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has requested that the Council provide information on the visit to the Korean peninsular made by Prime Minister Göran Persson on 2-4 May in his capacity as President of the EU."
"Talks were held in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader, Chairman Kim Chung-il, and the number two in the North Korean power hierarchy Kim Chong-nam, and in Seoul with President Kim Dae-jung."
"The High Representative Javier Solana and Commissioner Chris Patten participated."
"The initiative for the mission was taken in December last year when President Kim Dae-jung visited Stockholm, in connection with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, for talks with the Swedish Prime Minister Mr Persson."
"President Kim Dae-jung emphasised that Sweden' s long-established contacts with the countries on the Korean peninsula could play a valuable role during the Swedish Presidency."
"Following discussions between the EU Member States and also with representatives of both North and South Korea a decision on the mission was made at the EU Summit in Stockholm on 23-24 March 2001."
"The visit was based on the Council' s conclusions and guidelines from October and November 2000."
"During its visit to Pyongyang on 2-3 May the EU delegation had long talks with substantial content with Kim Chung-il, and thereafter this was presented to President Kim Dae-jung in South Korea."
"In summary, the results were good."
"Firstly, an assurance was given that North Korea will stand by the common declaration made at the inter-Korean Summit in Pyongyang in June 2000."
"An assurance was also given that Chairman Kim Chung-il wishes to see a second summit, but that the time must be right for this."
"Chairman Kim Chung-il emphasised secondly the importance of relations between the USA and North Korea and inter-Korean relations developing in parallel."
"Thirdly, he confirmed that North Korea would stand by the 1994 framework agreement between North Korea and the USA, as well as by the missile moratorium until 2003."
"However, missile exports would not cease until North Korea received promises of compensation for any lost export revenues."
"The exports were a purely commercial issue."
"Fourthly, North Korea also acknowledged the need for economic reforms and agreed to send a North Korean delegation to Europe to learn more about the market economy."
"Fifthly, Chairman Kim Chung-il confirmed that North Korea was willing to start a discussion on human rights with the EU."
"From the EU side it was emphasised that the issue of human rights is of central importance for the EU' s policy."
"I hope that a first meeting will be able to take place during the Swedish Presidency."
"Sixthly, the need for better working conditions and inspection of aid projects by the UN and non-governmental organisations in North Korea was discussed."
"Finally, I would like to say that the South Korean side was very positive towards the results of the meeting, particularly the assurances concerning a second summit and missile defence."
"The EU' s visit was a fruitful one."
"However, the results of our efforts cannot be finally assessed for a couple of years yet."
"The USA will naturally play an important part in the continued process, but the EU' s efforts are not unimportant."
"Mr President, the European Union strongly supports President Kim Dae-jung's sunshine policy and it was on this basis that the mission led by Göran Persson, in which my colleague Chris Patten participated, took place."
"The Union's role in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is complementary to that of the three main players: South Korea, United States of America and Japan."
"Contrary to some press speculation, this mission was not intended as an attempt to supplant the American role: the US was briefed in advance and fully supported the initiative."
"Thus press reports of an EU-diplomatic challenge to the United States were way off the mark."
"The timing, however, was influenced by our desire to help maintain momentum in the reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula while the United States is finalising its policy review."
"The visit obtained, as we have already heard, significant results and the European Union team had some five hours of interesting discussion with President Kim Chung-il during which it was able to address its concerns in full."
"We are now following up in five areas: first, existing assistance is being continued."
"A maximum allocation of EUR 7 million is foreseen for humanitarian assistance and EUR 20 million for food aid and food security under the 2001 budget."
"The most appropriate projects to support and the conditions to be applied will be discussed with North Korea in the coming weeks."
"Secondly, preparations to launch our technical assistance are moving ahead and a project identification mission to North Korea is expected shortly in order to agree the design of two pilot projects with the North Korean authorities: these will each be close to EUR 1 million and will aim particularly at training officials in key ministries and at basic institution building."
"Third, preparations are going ahead to organise discussions with North Korea on human rights in Brussels on 13 June."
"Fourthly, we are exploring ways to develop a dialogue with North Korea on economic reform by organising study visits to the Union."
"Fifth and finally, we are studying options for diplomatic accreditation arrangements with North Korea following the decision to establish diplomatic relations on 14 May."
"Since this will require negotiations, I do not wish to speculate at this point on the detail."
"Meanwhile, we await with interest the completion of the US policy review on North Korea and hope that this will lead to progress in the inter-Korea reconciliation process."
"Mr President, I should like to start by offering my very sincere thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission for the information which they have given us about the Union mission to North Korea."
"The European Union must, indeed, be aware of its own stake in the future of the Korean peninsular."
"Last January, the European Parliament asked both the Council and the Commission, following a visit from an ad hoc delegation, to take the measures needed to consolidate the policy of rapprochement between North and South Korea and open up North Korea to the international community."
"In calling for the normalisation of relations between the European Union and North Korea, we did not mean to imply that we recognised a political regime which is a far cry from the fundamental values which we preach; we meant to imply that we support the so-called sunshine policy which President Kim Du-Yung has inaugurated with much courage and determination, because we realised that, without the active support of the international community, this policy would be doomed to failure in the long term and would quickly run out of steam in the short term."
"That is why we appreciate the efforts being made by the Council and the Commission to achieve normalisation with a view to laying down coherent lines of action as regards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"I was interested to note that the European Union insisted on extending the rapprochement initiated with South Korea and the commitments made to it to Pyongyang."
"We have always insisted that the entire nation should have access to foreign aid and that NGOs should be able to work in satisfactory conditions."
"Other measures, such as granting visas and working facilities to European journalists would help to create the trust needed to put this rapprochement on a more stable footing."
"I should like to close simply by saying that we must not overlook the fact that the process initiated will be long and gradual but that it is important in order to maintain the peace in this part of the world on which our own stability and security also depend."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes very much the official visit to North Korea and to Seoul by the Council, Commission and the High Representative of the CFSP."
"Commissioner Patten, when he reported back to the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, said that the visit had gone ahead with modest aims, but those modest aims have been achieved and we welcome that."
"As a parliamentarian, I am rather disappointed that the delegation managed to fit in 75 journalists but could not manage any parliamentarians on the grounds that the delegation was a small one."
"I hope on future occasions the Commission and the Council might consider taking some parliamentarians along, particularly in the light of the fact that relations between North Korea and the European Union were pioneered by the European Parliament, over two years ago, when we sent our first official delegation."
"I welcome the fact that there were good talks with Kim Chong-il."
"Clearly North Korea is a state of concern."
"We welcome the fact that they are continuing their moratorium on missile tests until 2004."
"I recognise that at the moment they have very little option but to export military equipment."
"They produce hardly any goods that anyone wants to buy apart from military equipment."
"So it is hardly surprising that the No-dong I and No-dong II weapons which have a range of 1 300 kilometres have been sold to Iran, Syria and Pakistan or that the North Koreans are giving military aid to the Congo, Iran, Ethiopia and Syria."
"The problem will be if they continue to test the Taepodong, which will have a range of something between 4 000 and 6 000 kilometres."
"Obviously we welcome the moratorium."
"We welcome the further aid that is going to given in the form of food aid."
"We need improved access for European Union monitors to make sure that the aid is being distributed properly."
"We welcome the increased assistance in the agricultural sector, particularly in the life of what we have been told that there is now some recognition that reform has to take place."
"It is important to train North Koreans in modern industrial and clerical skills and we need to give aid in a non-nuclear energy sector as well as raising the textile quotas."
"It is important that we have a human rights dialogue and I welcome the fact that on 13 June that dialogue is going to take place."
"No one has mentioned KADO; the European Union is participating in the KADO programme for building two nuclear power stations in North Korea."
"Unfortunately, we have cut the budget this time compared to the last time and if we are serious about assisting Kim Dae-jung with his sunshine policy that sends exactly the wrong signals."
"We are very keen that diplomatic relations be established and I urge the Commission and the Council to consider placing an office in Pyongyang rather than making the Beijing office responsible for North Korea."
"There will be no day-to-day contact if that is the case."
"There is a distinction at the moment between the EU and the US and we hope we can move forward together, but if we cannot we will have to move forward separately, because the direction we are going is the right one."
"Mr President, even those of us who have been lucky enough to have been to North Korea more than once find it hard to understand what that regime wants and where it is going."
"After a surge of optimism last year, North Korea' s apparent process of opening up towards the outside world and developing relations with its southern neighbours has entered a period of stagnation."
"Some would even say it was going backwards."
"Well, personally, I wonder whether the visit by the European delegation last month was not a little premature."
"Commissioner Patten told us yesterday - and it was repeated today - that human rights were also discussed during the talks, and they are systematically violated in this last of the communist dictatorships."
"He did not tell us what the outcome was though, which suggests to me that not much was achieved."
"Would it not have been better to obtain concessions in this delicate area first and then grant the reward of a visit to Pyongyang?"
"We hold cards that can induce the North Korean regime to treat its citizens decently and we are morally obliged to use them."
"Another aspect of this visit that worries me is the relationship with the United States, which has a dominant position in that region and responsibilities far greater than Europe' s."
"Commissioner Patten has told us that, even in this case, Washington was consulted about the visit."
"However, as the Commission mentioned, influential American commentators - including former Secretary of State, Mr Kissinger - were quite astonished at this mission, which gives the impression of wanting to fill and profit from a void temporarily left by the United States where, as we know, a review of policy on North Korea is in progress."
"I would like reassurances from the Commission and the Council on these two points."
"Mr President, I just thought I could make a few comments and reply to some of the questions."
"Mr Santer, we can agree with everything you said and I also understand that working conditions for NGOs was one of the issues raised during the visit: the delegation understood that things have improved in the last year although there is probably very much more to be done."
"To Mr Ford, maybe we are sometimes rigid in how we set up our delegations."
"This was in the troika formation and journalists come anyway."
"They were not part of the delegation, but they come."
"Sometimes, of course, one could invite MEPs, but I understand that on this issue there is a good cooperation between the European Parliament, Commission and Council and I hope that can continue."
"I do not have the right to say that in future there should be participation of MEPs, but we have noted your comment on this."
"As regards the modalities of establishing diplomatic relations, this will soon be discussed with the North Koreans and I understand that no decision has yet been taken on the opening of a delegation, where it should be and how it should be done."
"I hope I have covered the most important issues raised."
"Thank you for your contributions."
"Thank you for this additional response."
"At the end of this debate, I received six motions for resolutions on Korea, in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Environmental policy"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0172/2001) by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on bringing our needs and responsibilities together - integrating environmental issues with economic policy (COM(2000) 576 - C5-0012/2001 - 2001/2004(COS))"
"(A5-0171/2001) by Mrs Hulthén, on behalf of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on environment policy and sustainable development: preparing for the Gothenburg European Council (2000/2322(INI))"
"Ladies and gentlemen, on a point of order: Mr Blokland, you have made generous use of your time."
"I grant you this with pleasure, as I do the next rapporteur, of course, but I would point out that we are now desperately running behind schedule."
"I will have to try to monitor your speaking times more closely."
"Mr President, I can overlook the fact that the previous speaker spoke a little too long on this subject."
"Five minutes to debate sustainable development in a 25-year perspective is not much, and it is an art to be able to keep to the time margin exactly to the second."
"The question is what we mean by a 'sustainability strategy' ?"
"Is it a new political buzzword that we are attempting to invent here in Parliament?"
"No, it is not."
"It is an inheritance that goes back further in time."
"We have had this task ever since it was decided in Rio nearly ten years ago that each nation was to establish a sustainability strategy."
"So what is sustainability?"
"What are we actually talking about when we discuss sustainability?"
"Well, we are discussing the future of coming generations."
"We are discussing what development, what life we want future generations to have - in other words, how their lives are to be managed as regards social issues, ecological development and the economy."
"However, we must bear in mind that it is easy for us who live in a fairly small, rich part of the world to say that we want to leave behind us, for others to inherit, a situation that is just as good as that which we have."
"For an overwhelming majority in the world, the desire must be for their children to have a better life than they had."
"The process in Parliament for producing this document, which is still to form some kind of basis or contribution to the Gothenburg Summit, leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Parliament has had to rush to keep up with the Commission in order to be able to produce it or be given any opportunity at all to get its viewpoints across concerning the form this development should take."
"This is not satisfactory."
"It is possible that the Commission itself had plenty of time, but Parliament should still be given a real opportunity to discuss these matters - not just from an environmental perspective."
"The whole of Parliament, the committees working on social and economic issues and all the other committees that are actually concerned should be involved."
"Otherwise, we restrict the issue and make it just an environmental issue, which it is not."
"As far as which areas of policy it would be desirable to look at in such a document, including in the light of the direction that the treatment of the issue is to take in Gothenburg, I believe that we must primarily start from the ecological perspective."
"Both the social and the economic perspectives are, of course, important, and we know that they rule our lives."
"However, if we do not have a well-functioning planet in ecological respects, it will be very difficult to discuss social and economic issues."
"It is quite simply a prerequisite that our ecology is in equilibrium."
"The Commission' s text, which we feel despite everything takes the current economic systems as its starting point, is then perhaps not entirely satisfactory."
"The point has somehow been missed."
"It is about utilising the economy that exists."
"It is about trying to set the limits we want to have on the market."
"It is about finding the management tools that we can use ourselves in our own budget and our own purchasing."
"If we want to create a sustainability strategy for the European Union, we must certainly observe the problems that exist within the Union, but it is completely impossible to isolate the Union from the outside world."
"We must see ourselves as part of the planet, in the global context."
"What we do in the Union affects the world around us."
"We must not export that which we do not want to have ourselves."
"We must review our trade relations and our agricultural policy, as well as the negative effects that the latter is having on the opportunities for other countries to develop."
"We also have a responsibility in international trade relations."
"Moreover, without the local perspective, there will not be any sustainability strategy."
"The point of the Agenda 21 work was that it provided, and is providing, opportunities for voluntary organisations, players at local level, municipalities and citizens to participate in the process and understand what it is about."
"In the final analysis, it is about the responsibility of the individual and about the fact that it is actually necessary to change our behaviour in every area."
"The Commission, but naturally also the Council, must think about how we can encourage people to feel involved, and ensure that this is the case, so that it does not just become a message from on high."
"Finally, I would like to say something about political leadership."
"It is essential that the message that will be given in Gothenburg is clear in order for it to be effective."
"It cannot be simply an empty manifesto."
"There must also be evidence that the Commission and the Council really want to move from words to actions."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am very happy to have this opportunity to be present during this debate today."
"The debate is addressing the strategy for sustainable development and integration of environmental issues in economic policy."
"The fact that these issues are high on the agenda is an expression of political will regarding change and renewal."
"When sustainable development was written into the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were criticised for it not being sufficient and for implementation not being compulsory."
"Distrust was expressed regarding our common policy and the abilities of the European Union."
"This criticism can no longer be levelled at us."
"Now we must take a stand on concrete proposals, goals and funds, based on the Commission' s well-formulated proposal for a strategy for sustainable development and the reports presented by Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland."
"An effective policy on sustainable development requires direct and clear social criticism."
"Biodiversity is under threat, acidification continues, eutrophication is increasing, chemicals are building up in our bodies, air pollution is becoming deadly, climate change is accelerating - and all this is happening at this very moment."
"We must not, however, forget the great opportunities we have: research is expanding, we have an increasing focus on education and lifelong learning, skills are growing and being passed on, new technology is being developed, efficient solutions are becoming more common, the problems within agriculture and fishing are breeding new ideas and new solutions and political will is strengthening."
"We must now adopt a holistic approach in which various political areas cooperate."
"The economic, social and ecological perspectives must be interwoven and given equal weight in all political areas."
"We must propose concrete measures, changes in principles and clear goals."
"Now is the time to formulate a vision for the future."
"The goal for Europe is to be the world' s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy."
"That goal must be coupled with the ecological aspect in Gothenburg if we are to be the region taking the greatest responsibility for nature and the environment."
"It is also important for the policies to be based on the everyday lives of citizens."
"Research, education, democracy and participation are all preconditions for taking joint responsibility."
"In the continued work on a strategy of sustainability, dialogue with civil society and between the institutions of the European Union must be strengthened."
"The aim for the Presidency ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg is to adopt a strategy which will link the Lisbon Process with the strategy for sustainable development, establishing the ecological dimension by setting a number of clear, monitorable targets in order to reverse the negative trends we see today."
"It will require all future decisions in the EU being tested from the perspective of sustainability."
"It will clearly show Europe' s aim of reducing our impact on the climate and actively taking part in global cooperation."
"It will mean discarding unsustainable subsidies."
"It will lead to the adverse impacts of chemicals on health and the environment being minimised and it will ensure that sustainable development continues to be discussed at the highest political level."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of having the political courage to establish concrete, timetabled targets for achieving sustainable development."
"As such I am happy to see that the report from Mrs Hulthén, which the European Parliament is examining today, expresses the same view."
"I would particularly like to mention the requirements in this report for a climate change programme and targets for renewable energy, the requirement for changes to transport policy, the requirement for a new chemicals policy based on the precautionary principle, the requirement for a sustainability analysis of all decisions, and the requirement for a strengthening of the sustainability perspective in the European Union' s global work."
"As the report says, it is important that Parliament continues to push the issue forward and to critically review new legislation within the EU."
"When it comes to global responsibility, I would particularly emphasise what Mrs Hulthén brought up in her report."
"Sustainable development cannot be achieved unless the global perspective is addressed."
"This is therefore the vital task for us."
"The European Union must take a leading role in the work towards global sustainability."
"We must be clear in our work to ensure that next year' s World Summit for Sustainable Development in South Africa achieves the necessary results."
"As part of the preparations for the European Council in Gothenburg and for the summit in Johannesburg, last weekend I received 250 young people aged 20-25 from 110 different countries around the world."
"The meeting recognised no borders between countries or between people."
"So what do these young people have?"
"They have involvement, they have enthusiasm."
"What do they lack?"
"They lack patience, they lack fear of tackling difficult and complex problems."
"What do we owe them?"
"I believe what we owe them is to lay the foundation for their faith in the future by being clear, by establishing concrete, political measures, by showing that we have the political courage and the political will to reverse the dangerous trends in the world."
"What do they demand of the EU, particularly following the US action on climate policy?"
"They demand that the EU takes a clear lead in the global work towards sustainable development, against poverty and against the environmental destruction now taking place."
"To summarise: sustainability on one continent is unsustainable sustainability."
"As Mrs Hulthén said, we can never assume that one part of the earth can live sustainably while the rest of the earth suffers poverty and environmental destruction."
"In his report, Mr Blokland highlights the correlation between depletion of our natural resources and the impact on the environment on the one hand and economic policy on the other."
"The conclusion is that the absence of price tags on scarce resources and environmental impact leads to insufficient integration of environmental considerations and economics."
"To me it seems clear that a vital element of future sustainability policy is to better internalise environmental costs into the costs of goods and services in the economy."
"The proposals presented in the report are important instruments for further development of the strategy for sustainable development and sectoral integration."
"The Presidency' s view is that it is important for environmental integration to be included in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines."
"In this respect, market-based financial controls must also be used to a greater extent to put a price on scarce resources and to assess whether subsidies and tax exemptions have an adverse impact on the environment."
"Development of a strategy for environmental integration must include targets, timetables and follow-up mechanisms in the BEPG."
"I would like to end by referring to the conclusion in Mr Blokland' s report."
"Measures are needed now to avoid the need for more expensive measures later."
"I can also add to this a report from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, which shows that it generally takes considerable time for nature and the environment to recover from the environmental destruction we have caused and continue to cause."
"I believe this conclusion complements that of Mr Blokland."
"In other words we cannot afford to wait."
"We must act now, and the reports before us today are an important step forward ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg and the summit in Johannesburg next year."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, even though that was a very last-minute edition which I think exemplifies a lot of what is wrong at the moment with the way we think about sustainability within this institution."
"We are not integrating our social, economic and environmental policies."
"They should be pulling in the same direction, and they certainly do not at present."
"It is also exemplified by the fact that the one Commissioner we have with us this evening is the Environment Commissioner."
"I welcome her here, but when we are discussing sustainability I would very much like to see in future the Commissioners from my own committee, and also at least from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"If we are to have long-term sustainability and develop a truly green economy, we have to take care to foster environmental-friendly businesses and use resources efficiently, and that includes the way in which we use our workforces."
"Hence my committee' s call for rapid progress in enabling people to work efficiently through effective consultation and participation, because democracy is also part of sustainability, as are reduced working hours and good quality work in safe working conditions supported by an effective system of social security."
"If we are demanding that businesses provide social and environmental audits, as we quite rightly do, we need the accountants and other professionals than can do that."
"If we want builders who can construct energy-efficient buildings, we need to train them."
"Hence my committee' s call for all European Union funded training initiatives to take the environmental dimension fully into account, if we are really preparing people for the future."
"Social inclusion, as has already been said, is a key component of a sustainable society, hence the need for a guaranteed minimum income to provide for basic needs."
"We must combat discrimination and poverty."
"At present the dispossessed feel they have no stake in the future and that, under anybody' s reasoning, is a wicked waste."
"Sustainable development is about creating a world in which there are no losers."
"We cannot achieve this goal if we continue with policies that pull in different directions and even undermine each other."
"Our common future depends on finding an effective way to ensure integration and sustainability."
"Mr President, the compatibility of ecology and economics has been much talked about for many years."
"The problem is that while there is in theory no internal contradiction between economic growth and preserving the environment, up until now economic growth has in practice normally been detrimental to the quality of the environment."
"However, on the other hand, economic decline combined with rising unemployment and poverty have also always resulted in a loss of environmental quality."
"So it is a very complex subject and one particularly difficult to grasp because we still have no universal indicators for putting a monetary value on environmental assets."
"We need yardsticks that are valid for all the EU and we can conceive of them only for the EU. The Commission must put its communication on a statistically secure footing if we are not to continue building castles in the air."
"Even assuming that we have such a secure footing, the question remains as to what conclusions should be drawn."
"Many things have been considered."
"Subsidies, tradable emission rights or the so-called eco-taxes, that is environment-related taxes or levies."
"Models for these exist."
"It is important, however, that such models should be introduced in all EU Member States in the same way and at the same time, so as to offer fair opportunities to all involved."
"Only fair competition will ensure that environmental measures, of whatever kind, find acceptance. Subsidies must be examined for their effectiveness and changed or replaced by other measures if necessary."
"Trade in environmental assets must be fair."
"Environmental taxes and levies are worthwhile and effective only if related to emissions and imposed in such a way as to be neutral in their effect on the amount of tax paid by the citizen."
"In no case must such taxes and levies be misappropriated and spent on other areas than the environment."
"That is the only way we shall actually meet the justified demands of our citizens and of people outside the EU for a healthy environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sustainable development is our key challenge for the next 20 years."
"Sustainable development is a beautiful concept which articulates the belief that economic growth can go hand-in-hand with improving the environment."
"Until now, this has rarely been the case, as economic growth has been at the expense of the environment."
"We now need to improve our production methods so that they take the environment more - or even more - into account. We also need to change our thoughts and actions, and to consider environmental costs, so that environmental protection starts to pay off."
"The Gothenburg European Council needs to take an emphatic first step in this connection."
"I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report."
"His realistic approach has in any event generated a few specific building blocks to develop further."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Hulthén for the conviction and tenacity with which she has presented her vision on sustainable development."
"The concept of sustainable development must be translated into concrete proposals and decisions."
"I should like to home in on three points in this connection: production standards, bio-diversity and compliance."
"Sustainable development must be given a practical dimension."
"We want to focus on the development of concrete product standards, standards which curb the use of energy, standards which restrict, or ban as much as possible, the use of dangerous substances, and rules to enable the environmental cost to be reflected in the price of the product."
"Such standards are important in the food sector, as well as the building materials, clothing, paint and natural packaging sectors."
"In my opinion, we stand to gain a great deal on an environmental plane."
"The standards must also aim to prevent waste: less throw-away packaging, less wear-and-tear, more sustainability and more sustained quality."
"If products do reach the end of their useful lives, re-use and recycling should be the obvious choice."
"The major challenge is then to create markets for all the product waste and all waste substances."
"Moreover, such markets also yield new employment."
"Passing on environmental costs to the consumer is important, but not everything can be expressed in money."
"The protection of nature and bio-diversity is also a value in its own right without having an immediate economic value."
"The protection of bio-diversity is a theme which must recur in many policy areas."
"Needless to say, we must also adhere to the Bird and Habitat Directive."
"Which brings us to the third point: compliance."
"There is a great deal of sound European legislation."
"It is therefore necessary to comply with these laws."
"However, that is often a problem."
"Not all Member States enjoy the same good reputation in this connection."
"Mrs Hulthén and Mr Bowe asked in Strasbourg how the Commission intends to deal with this problem."
"The replies which the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, gave, were disappointing to say the least."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission once again in what way it intends to address the Member States on the issue of inadequate compliance with European rules."
"I should also like to underline that Parliament could be far more involved in compliance."
"I should like to be issued with half-yearly reports on the state of affairs in terms of compliance with legislation."
"Mr President, honourable Minister, Commissioner, sustainable development involves many factors."
"It is terribly easy to write about wonderful dreams and to use fine words."
"I would like to see those attending the European Council in Gothenburg dare to point the way forward."
"I would also like the courageous step to be taken of examining the EU' s own accounts, its own system of subsidies."
"Mr Blokland addresses this in item 5 and Mrs Hulthén in item 33 of her report, that is, that we need to revise the agricultural subsidies."
"I am happy to see that the Commission' s declaration is a little more stringent in stating that, when the common agricultural policy is reviewed in 2002, greater emphasis should be placed on quality than on quantity."
"Agriculture is still Europe' s main industry, with agriculture and forestry being responsible for our cultural heritage, our recreation and biodiversity."
"The issues are chemicals and nutrients in the water, air quality and public health."
"So the question must be: How sustainable is the EU' s own subsidy system for agriculture?"
"Is it not time to use some of this money for sustainable development, rural development, protecting biodiversity, removing chemicals and growing food which we can eat happily and safely?"
"If only the EU would dare to take such an initiative, indicate the direction to be followed and declare 'we will go that way' !"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the paradox with the European Union is that its environmental legislation has played a pioneering role for many countries in the Union, including my own, and will certainly play a pioneering role for the candidate countries, and yet many of the European Union's sectoral policies do in fact contradict criteria for sustainable development."
"I refer mainly to the agricultural policy and, general speaking, to the emphasis placed on economic growth with too little thought for sustainable development. This is stressed in a recent OECD report which I should like to bring to the attention of the Commission and the Council and which is far more critical than usual of the Commission's texts."
"I think that what we urgently need, and this is the gist of our support for the two European Parliament reports and the Myller report attached to them, is to change direction."
"Politically, we have three demands of Gothenburg."
"First, the European Council needs to endorse the Commission text without watering down the guidelines proposed by the Commission."
"Secondly, the Environment Council to be held a week after Gothenburg needs to take account of the demands of the European Parliament for the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Thirdly, the Belgian Presidency must be instructed in Gothenburg to take specific action on the guidelines decided in Gothenburg."
"As far as economic aspects per se are concerned, the ECOFIN Council needs to revise the agenda."
"Subsidies for environmentally damaging production methods should be abolished and replaced by incentives for more environmentally-friendly production methods."
"We need environmental and social criteria for public procurement."
"On the question of indicators, the fact that the restricted list of indicators does not contain a single environmental criterion is intolerable."
"We also need to think about national accounts which integrate environmental data."
"These are a few of the things we want to think about."
"We need the means to do so, however."
"We shall be watching to see, under the Belgian Presidency, if the European Council in Barcelona really will be the first European Council to integrate an environmental, social and economic strategy."
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the Commission' s proposal on sustainable development."
"It is clear that it could have gone a lot further in many areas, but even so I must say that it was tougher than expected and that it contains several proposals which, if carried out, will really make a difference compared with today' s policy on the environment."
"Above all, I would like to highlight the requirements to limit road transport, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, remove harmful subsidies, change procurement regulations in favour of the environment and adapt the common agricultural policy."
"If this is carried out, it will prove an important step in achieving change."
"The question now is whether these concrete proposals will survive the European Council in Gothenburg."
"I hope that they will, and that these proposals are not removed from the final document, but remain. Perhaps the general comments could be shortened instead."
"I believe it can make a real contribution to changing this policy."
"I wish the Swedish Presidency luck with this."
"However, the proposal is inadequate in one area, that of international cooperation and links with the World Trade Organisation and environmental regulations."
"Mr President, we need to apply a real environmental policy in Europe in order to respect the environment - our environment - in recognition of the fact that we have a duty to pass the natural universal heritage on to future generations intact."
"In doing so, we must ensure that environmental policy in Europe is based not on ideology but on the concept of responsibility."
"Let us apply the principle of subsidiarity to the management of pollution problems."
"For example, local authorities should have carte blanche to deal with air pollution in our cities."
"Polluted rivers are a matter for the countries along their banks."
"They should be free to decide what to do - as long as they are efficient."
"Changes to the climate of the planet, on the other hand, are a global issue."
"Europe should take a common stand at international environmental fora and should set the Member States objectives in framework directives, leaving them to decide how to achieve them."
"To conclude, we should not regulate everything from Brussels or Strasbourg."
"Decisions taken closer to the ground will be more suitable and, by definition, better understood."
"Surely the ambition of the European Union is to be better understood by the people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Hulthén for presenting her report on sustainable development, which she produced under great pressure of time and difficult circumstances."
"The PPE-DE will support the report."
"It contains important emphases for environmental policy."
"We are not, however, really in agreement with the wording on every point."
"In the matter of what it says about economic and social policy, in particular, it would have been good if we had had more time also to discuss them with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"If, for example, in item 32 we are calling for a minimum income and talking about access to essential services, that should not have its place in a report on environmental policy that has actually been prepared only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but only after intensive discussion with the Social and Economic Committees."
"I also regret - and it was no doubt also due to pressure of time - that we have taken up only one point on the development policy aspects of sustainable development, because anyone who has looked into sustainable development and the Rio process knows that development policy is a key part of the entire issue."
"I think more could have been said about that."
"That is not, however, a recrimination, because it was simply difficult for Parliament to cover everything properly under such pressure of time."
"One point in the report and in what Commission President Prodi said about sustainable development has caused quite a stir in Germany."
"It is found here in items 21 and 22 of this report."
"It concerns the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, especially on coal."
"I personally believe that it must indeed be our aim in the long term to completely abolish environmentally harmful subsidies."
"However, I think we must be very cautious about specifying a date in the very near future."
"If the PSE Group is calling for an end to them before 2005 in its forthcoming report on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, that will lead to mass redundancies and then we will certainly not achieve the objective sustainably."
"I therefore believe we should clearly state the objective, there is no dissent about that, but we should also give thought to alternative employment..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent reports."
"It is vital that this issue of sustainable development is placed high on the political agenda."
"It is a question partly of solidarity, that is, solidarity with coming generations and EU solidarity with poor regions and poor people, and partly of a global responsibility, of how the EU interacts with the rest of the world with regard to trade and development policy."
"Sustainable development concerns all policy areas."
"It is well known that it concerns transport policy, agricultural policy and energy policy, but it also concerns social policy."
"In this regard I do not share the views of the previous speaker."
"Social policy is also naturally part of sustainable development."
"Good social policy and fair economic policy are vital."
"Sustainable development is also about a whole range of methods."
"It is not the case that the current methods of legislation are poor."
"The legislation must continue."
"The legislation we have in the EU must be implemented better."
"We must use tax instruments, which have often been emphasised by Parliament."
"The new approach is that we must integrate the ecological aspects of the Lisbon Process."
"The next time the Council gathers in the spring in Barcelona it is not only economic issues, social issues, issues of lifelong learning, issues of investment policy and industrial policy which must be addressed. The Council must also be a 'Sustainability Council' by ensuring that the ecological aspects are integrated into policy."
"The new strategy which is being developed, and which we in Parliament warmly support, is crucial."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland, on two important reports, not only for us here now but for generations to come."
"Naturally, my group supports these two reports wholeheartedly."
"Both show the necessity of integrating environmental policy, social policy and economic policy, if we are really to achieve sustainable development."
"However, this must happen now and not simply be a goal for the future."
"The Cardiff Process is good, but it is proceeding far too slowly."
"It is also very clear that a break in current trends is vital, to put it mildly."
"As Swedish Minister for the Environment Kjell Larsson says, what is needed now is political courage within all the institutions and in all areas."
"The Commission' s document on integrating environmental policy into economic policy states that there is no contradiction between economic growth and environmental protection."
"If this is the case, how can we explain the fact that increased production and increased consumption have eaten up all the environmental initiatives which we have so far carried out and are carrying out?"
"Such a view does not fit in with the times."
"Therefore, economic development must be adapted to ecological requirements, otherwise there will be no sustainable development."
"We must all realise this."
"The proposal from the Verts/ALE adopted by the committee states that the adverse environmental impact resulting from some EU subsidies must be examined, particularly with regard to the current energy policy and common agricultural policy."
"They must simply be phased out."
"We cannot afford to keep them in place."
"Mrs Hulthén also mentions, as other people have also said, that the strategy must not only be for the EU but must also constitute a global starting point."
"Ten years after Rio, this really must be addressed..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, how can we preserve our resources and improve environmental health and social well-being in a balanced manner, without affecting any of the three pillars of sustainable development?"
"The Gothenburg Summit will try to provide an answer to these questions and will demonstrate the maturity and political capacity of our governments to deal with the challenge of a new order of peace and prosperity for the twenty-first century."
"The first step consists of severing the link between economic growth and the intense use of resources and unwanted effects such as pollution."
"In this context, I believe that we should welcome the reports by Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland."
"To turn the European economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy, based on knowledge and not on the intensive use of resources, will require a better and greater use of market instruments in order to achieve greater levels of efficiency for our procedures and products, but will also require other factors to be taken into account simultaneously."
"If we want to eliminate forever the spectre of the loss of competitiveness or the threat of industrial conflict in Europe, we need more than ever, and urgently, to move ahead in a way which is uniform and coherent between all the Member States."
"It is even more important that we do so from a global point of view, by means of international agreements which resolve the legal and practical difficulties which face many of our legislative actions."
"We also need to establish realistic timetables which allow companies and society in general to adapt to the new market conditions and introduce the necessary reforms, thereby reducing the possibilities of unwanted effects if they are dealt with within too narrow a margin for manoeuvre."
"Lastly, I think it is essential, in order to successfully bring the process of change to a conclusion, to enjoy a broad social consensus which includes commitments with social operators and the gradual but firm replacement - of course - of the social values of the old order - based on the possession and accumulation of goods - with other values of a society which is ethically and civically more advanced, based on the enjoyment of the less materialistic aspects of life."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, it is not and can never be a choice between employment or the environment."
"Wealth, growth, enterprise and development need not, and do not, consume the environments of mature societies."
"On the contrary, it may be observed that there is a clear relationship between the quality of the environment and the wealth of a nation."
"Throughout the EU and North America recent years have seen dramatic reversals in the pollution of air and water due to technological improvements driven by legislation and societal expectations."
"In the same period there have been profound increases in the extent and quantity of habitats and natural resources that are formally recognised and protected."
"The infrastructure, organisation and technology that are needed for a cleaner environment are all achievable because of the wealth and surpluses of the local economies."
"Significant environmental pollution of air and water and the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources have become characteristic of the early stages of developing industrial economies, as they were once with us."
"Environmental protection requires surpluses, education and vision together with institutional maturity and stability."
"A strong lobby in favour of environmental protection is a good and necessary part of any mature democratic society."
"We must be committed to ensuring the widest range of opinions and values, and that they are nurtured, expressed and considered because debate can only increase knowledge and improve the quality of decisions."
"Likewise, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective."
"Environmental scaremongering hampers open debate by inflating a stateable risk, for example the presence of a toxin, so that it becomes an inaccurately perceived threat, for example by failing to acknowledge that the quantity of the toxin falls significantly below any threatening dose."
"I believe that great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed whenever it is proposed to employ the environmental standards of a developed economy to the economies and environments of emerging economies."
"The EU' s history has shown that localised overloading of environmental carrying capacity can be a temporary phase of an emerging economy."
"We need to acknowledge ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, thank you for the various constructive contributions which we have heard."
"I would, of course, also like to join in congratulating Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland on their reports."
"It is right to discuss these two reports at the same time, as they definitely belong together."
"It is remarkable to think that the concept of 'sustainable development' has been around for 15 years now and has been kept alive despite so many people criticising it over the years for being woolly, difficult to achieve in practice, difficult to establish practical results for, etc. However, it still no doubt offers us an opportunity to link together economic policy, environmental policy and social policy and not just to see the problems, but also the opportunities inherent in this concept."
"Therefore, it is important to develop indicators, as pointed out in the debate, and to follow this up in a sensible way."
"I believe we are just starting to develop effective indicators which, in the long term, may lead to new economic concepts in general, a sort of new definition, including a new economic definition."
"At the same time, we must of course continue to work on developing effective indicators and effective monitoring of developments."
"It has felt as if we have been pressed for time, but I would like to say that we have received more than 100 written comments, all in plenty of time."
"Almost all environmental organisations, social organisations and even major business organisations have formulated their proposals and sent them to the Commission."
"We also looked extremely carefully at the proposal contained in the report by Mrs Hulthén."
"In our proposal, we at the Commission have said that we naturally wish to ensure that this is a proposal owned jointly by many different stakeholders in society and that we will follow it up in such a way that we also consult various groups in society."
"In this context, Parliament will naturally also have an active role."
"It could be said that the Commission' s proposal for a strategy for sustainable development has remained the same during negotiations for this proposal."
"The priorities we established from the start have remained throughout, and the proposals along the way have reflected this."
"I would also like to comment on what has been said about the international perspective, for this is incredibly important."
"The Commission has said that we must continue to become still more practical and to follow up our views on how to act internationally."
"As such, it is important for us to set our own house in order, show how we will be addressing these issues and show leadership before we start telling the rest of the world what they should be doing."
"Of course, the global perspective must be present in everything we do."
"At the same time, our strategy for sustainable development also emphasises, as Mrs Paulsen pointed out, that we must ensure that we rid ourselves of inconsistent policies and subsidies which are actually not good for the environment and which are not favourable to sustainable development."
"I think this is clear in the programme."
"The next step is to address this at the European Council in Gothenburg."
"It is important to ensure that it is not watered down during this Summit, but that we can actually stick to a plan as ambitious as the Commission' s strategy and get all Member States to work to achieve it."
"I believe it is a good aim for the Belgian Presidency to follow up matters in the way described by Mr Jonckheer during the debate."
"As has also been mentioned in the debate, I think too that it makes sense to review the way the European Parliament and our own institutions must be changed so that we can live up to the ideal of sustainable development and create these links between economic and social issues and environmental issues."
"To this end, we in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council will probably have to review our way of working so that it can become effective and so that we have a way of tackling cross-border issues rather than just looking narrowly at limited areas."
"It will be exciting when we now review policy in areas such as agriculture and fishing, transport and equal opportunities."
"This will be the moment of truth for us and for the EU as a whole."
"These were the most important comments, with the exception of the issue brought up by Mrs Corbey of the way implementation will be carried out."
"I would say that I have been clear from the beginning that we have good legislation, solid legislation, which was also the conclusion of the report on the Fifth Environment Action Programme."
"At the same time, we must also ensure that we implement this legislation."
"Therefore, it is important that we monitor implementation in this area too."
"It is no doubt possible to find further measures to strengthen the monitoring procedure, but the means already in place to ensure that Member States meet their obligations in line with the legislation must be strengthened."
"In addition, we must make it clearer for citizens of the EU how well Member States are doing."
"I believe this can help to put pressure on countries."
"Finally, I would like to comment on how we define sustainable development, as this was brought up in Mr Blokland' s report."
"The Commission' s strategy for sustainable development starts with a quotation from the Brundtland Commission report which contains a definition of sustainable development."
"The section containing this definition also addresses ways of combating poverty."
"This is naturally vital."
"I emphasise once again the significance of a global perspective, but if you have read the Brundtland Commission report carefully, you will see that our definition is correct."
"I believe it is important for us to keep to this definition as it is excellent and spells out our responsibility towards future generations, which is what it is all about."
"Thank you for this debate."
"Let us ensure that we can put these issues into practice."
"Council. (SV) Mr President, I would like to comment on what has been said in this debate."
"Several speakers have mentioned economic growth and its impact on the environment."
"There is a rather outdated view that economic growth always has an adverse impact on the environment."
"However, it has also been pointed out that poor economic development creates a major risk of damaging the environment."
"The term 'decoupling' , that is, the importance of being able to separate the trends for economic development and those for environmental impact, is becoming increasingly central to environmental policy discussions."
"This is actually nothing new."
"We have been working on this for many decades without perhaps using this particular term."
"I would put growth in the EU at around 30 percent over the past 10 years."
"At the same time emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen by 4 percent."
"This means that for every one million euros of production, emissions of greenhouse gases are approximately 55 percent lower."
"This shows that decoupling is already taking place."
"At the same time we must become even more successful and ensure that we achieve more than a marginal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"Emissions of NOx in Sweden per EUR 1 million of production is now down by approximately 60 percent."
"The equivalent figure for emissions of SOx is around 80 percent."
"These are two further examples of decoupling."
"Now we must redouble our efforts, including in areas where we currently see no reduction in environmental impact and where economic growth has been a contributory factor to this."
"The issue of subsidies and international costs has also been brought up by several speakers."
"As I said in my introduction, I regard this as a key issue with regard to environmental policy, now and in the future."
"At a global level, it is actually quite amazing that we currently have subsidies which, according to some, amount to 200 billion dollars a year for non-sustainable energy, that is, fossil fuel."
"This is an incredibly large amount, which shows that instead of internalising the environmental costs, we are actually externalising them and redirecting them."
"Removing this type of subsidy and focusing on proper internalisation of environmental costs in prices must be a key element of EU and global development."
"Biodiversity has also been mentioned here, and this is something close to my heart."
"I would like to point out that we have major problems with biodiversity here in Europe, something which far too few people are aware of."
"Something in the order of 55 percent of all species of bird are endangered, as are no less than 45 percent of butterfly species, to mention just two examples."
"Our targets cannot simply be met by introducing Natura 2000 areas, although this is an important part of our nature conservation policy."
"We also need environmental issues to be integrated into the common agricultural policy."
"Many of the endangered species are dependent on a small-scale agricultural landscape which is currently disappearing."
"It is vital that we prevent this from being repeated in the new countries which we hope will become members of the EU."
"However, it is not just a matter of integrating this approach into the common agricultural policy. The same must be done with the common fisheries policy."
"The condition of marine biodiversity is in fact much worse than that of biodiversity on land."
"The marine ecosystem around our coasts is in crisis."
"If EU citizens could see what we are actually doing to our seabed and sea water and the effects this has on biodiversity, there would probably be an environmental revolution in the EU."
"It is therefore also important to integrate the environment into the common fisheries policy and to see marine ecosystems as vital elements of the biodiversity we must work to preserve."
"Mr Jonckheer also pointed out that the sectoral approach directly opposes environmental policy in the EU."
"It is exactly this which we will be putting right through sectoral integration."
"I also agree with Mrs Schörling that this is proceeding too slowly."
"I therefore hope that, based on the Presidency' s synthesis report, the European Council in Gothenburg will be able to draw up clear guidelines for continued work on sectoral integration."
"I believe, Mr President, that these comments will suffice."
"Thank you, Mr Larsson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on both reports will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Community Environment Action Programme (2001-2010)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0175/2001) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision laying down the Community Environment Action Programme 2001-2010 (COM(2001) 31 - C5-0032/2001 - 2001/0029(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, representatives of the presidency, to begin with I would like to thank my colleagues on the Environment Committee."
"It is thanks to your flexibility that we are now approving Parliament' s opinion on the sixth Community environment action programme."
"Criticism has quite justifiably been directed at the fact that the reading of the programme in Parliament has been given far too short a deadline considering the importance and extent of the issue."
"As you know, this is due to the programme being delayed in the Commission."
"However, as we wanted to make our own contribution to the Gothenburg Summit, the first summit to be devoted to environmental issues, it has not been possible to avoid this rush, nor the Committee having to vote so late in the day."
"I would like to thank the chair of the Committee, the Committee and group secretariats and the assistants to the Members for organising the voting."
"I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency and the Commission for excellent teamwork."
"During the preparatory work we achieved successful cooperation with the Commission, although opinions on the nature of the programme have not always been unanimous."
"During the period spent preparing the environment action programme we have been able to reach reasonable unanimity on the areas of emphasis suggested by the Commission being the right ones."
"As far as the environment is concerned, the greatest worries are climate change, the loss of biodiversity, threats to health caused by environmental problems, the sustainablity of natural resources and sustainable waste management."
"Differences of opinion have been caused by the way problems requiring a decision have been addressed in the programme."
"The Commission wanted a more descriptive programme and as the rapporteur for the Environment Committee I have chosen a policy whereby we have sought, wherever possible, concrete targets in terms of quantity and quality as well as clear timetables for the priority areas chosen."
"Although the environment action programme is drawn up for a ten-year period, I have also proposed targets for a period exceeding this."
"For example, preventing climate change will require a time perspective of decades."
"Sufficiently ambitious intermediate targets must be laid down to ensure that the long-term targets are met."
"When instructing the Commission on drawing up the programme in March a year ago, the Environment Committee also demanded that concrete targets and timetables be set."
"How far the environment ministers get in reaching a united opinion in one week' s time, remains to be seen."
"I wish them every success."
"It would send a really strong message to the citizens of Europe regarding the EU' s environmental commitment were Parliament and the Council to take to the Gothenburg Summit a common opinion on what we wish to achieve."
"In my view it is vital that the EU' s environment programme contain clear targets and timetables for achieving them because this is the only way of ensuring that the programme and its realisation can be evaluated sufficiently unambiguously."
"The evaluation halfway through the programme must be based on verifiable progress on the basis of which we must be able to make the necessary corrections in order to achieve the targets."
"Achieving environmental targets requires cooperation."
"Environmental issues must be included in all Community policies and decisions."
"We will not prevent climate change or enable healthy air for our citizens to breathe unless we reduce emissions from energy production, transport and industry."
"Decisions on what is to be done in various policy areas and how we can enable environmental issues to be linked to principles, will, however, be made within these different sectors."
"Therefore, these also require greater environmental expertise."
"Environmental assessments must also be included in economic decisions."
"The Commission and the Council must change the way they work so that environmental issues can be integrated with all Community decision-making."
"The Commission has proposed an interesting idea of creating new thematic strategies, thematic programmes for the problems causing the greatest concern."
"I see this as particularly welcome."
"Parliament and the Council must, however, be included in decision-making via the normal co-decision procedure."
"Enlargement is both a challenge and an opportunity for the European environment."
"The programme should present ways in which enlargement will become a major opportunity to improve our environment."
"We must also boldly take the lead in international environment policy, as well as trade policy and development cooperation policy."
"We must also ensure the major participation of citizens."
"This requires the provision of clear and visible information on environmental issues."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I congratulate Mrs Riitta Myller on her work and also for the attention she gave to some of the proposals that we have adopted, although, of course, she could have gone a little further."
"I would highlight as particularly important the fact that she has welcomed the proposals that we advocated on the need to reform the common agricultural policy, on the premise that we must foster and support the development and implementation of strategies for incorporating environmental issues into the relevant sectoral policies and that we also need to protect agricultural production, taking account of food safety, the precautionary principle and the sovereignty of food, promoting the specific characteristics of the regions and more natural production methods."
"Furthermore, as you all know, the importance of renewable raw materials will increase with the efforts made to achieve a more sustainable economic system, in which forests and cultivated land are of particular importance."
"In order, however, to enable sustainable development and economic and social cohesion to take place, the procedures for internal support must give special consideration to the situation of farmers and family-based farming and to the legitimacy of specific aid for public interest goods and services in the framework of a multifunctional system of agriculture."
"The procedures must, of course, also take account of the differing degrees of agricultural development in the various Member States of the European Union and in the applicant countries."
"Mr President, we agree with the rapporteur and the Commission on the priority objectives of this programme and we agree that it is very important and that it will mark out the European Union' s environmental policy over the next ten years."
"These priority objectives are in the spotlight every day and the press refers to them on a daily basis: climate change, the promotion and preservation of biodiversity, the sustainable management of resources and the protection of health and the natural environment."
"Those are the priority objectives and it is therefore essential to take measures more energetically than has been the case up till now."
"Firstly, it is necessary to apply the legislation."
"As the rapporteur said, it is necessary to integrate environmental policies and other policies: agriculture, transport, energy."
"This has still not been done properly."
"We need more sustainable models of production and consumption."
"I believe that we need to change the model of production and consumption; otherwise, we will not be able to achieve the objectives marked out by both the Commission and the rapporteur."
"The interest in this programme is clear."
"It is demonstrated by the fact that we have spent hours voting on more than 350 amendments and that today, despite many amendments presented by the different draftspeople having been taken up, almost 300 amendments are still to be submitted to the House for its approval."
"I believe that, in the view of the Committee on Petitions - and I am referring to the specific experience of this committee - there are two fundamental issues, which the rapporteur has taken up."
"The first is the application of Community law."
"The Member States do not apply it and this is demonstrated by the fact that the European Commission has had to take several Member States to the courts for various reasons (nitrate pollution, for example)."
"Spain is currently being prosecuted over the existence of more than seven illegal dumping sites."
"The first fundamental issue is therefore compliance with environmental legislation."
"The second is the promotion of citizen participation."
"We have noted in the Committee on Petitions that of the 1100 or 1200 petitions registered each year in this committee, 40% relate to the natural environment."
"This demonstrates that not only ecologist groups but also platforms of everyday citizens have an enormous interest in preserving the environment in which they live and that it is they who are complaining."
"They take care to study Community law and they make complaints to us and then have the patience to await the result of procedures which sometimes take too long."
"That is another problem: when a complaint or a petition is presented, there are so many delays in the responses of the governments and the procedures are so long that, sometimes, the damage is done irreversibly and, on other occasions, the citizens who complain about these irregularities lose patience."
"In the view of the Committee on Petitions, these are the fundamental issues: the participation of the citizens, speeding up the procedures and, above all, compliance with Community law."
"A few months ago we held a debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the fact that, although the environmental legislation in the European Union is extraordinary, it is not complied with."
"We must find a method for complying with it."
"We are proposing certain amendments aimed at penalising those countries which do not use the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund in projects for preserving the environment."
"This is unfortunately the only thing the governments understand."
"We also have to find other mechanisms to speed up the procedures so that the citizens do not lose patience."
"Mr President, I believe that this is an extraordinary programme."
"I hope that tomorrow most of the amendments presented by the rapporteur and some of the groups will be approved and I believe that what we have to achieve is for the programme to be implemented properly over the next ten years."
"Mr President, we regret the little time available to us because this project has not been able to lead to a democratic and open debate, as we would have liked, and this would have contributed to making the population and civil society more aware of what we are dealing with in Parliament."
"We as a group have always supported the Commission because we have believed that this was a great project."
"It has been criticised for being too light, but I believe that not everybody has understood that the Commission' s proposal consisted of transferring specific policies into thematic strategies; and this is because the thematic strategies are a new way of working, a more scientific way, where the details are going to be studied in greater depth: the technical levels and the technical solutions, the viability of projects, the situations of the countries and the type of legislation which would be suitable."
"We have therefore largely supported the project in the form in which it was drawn up by the Commission."
"We believed that our margin for presenting amendments had to be limited and narrow, in order not to completely change the system of the project."
"We wanted this balanced academic nature of the Commission' s project to be respected."
"Furthermore, we firmly believe that one of the best policies in the history of Europe is the environmental policy: it has fantastic teams of officials and, at the same time, teams of experts to advise them, and it seemed to us that it was not a question of creating another parallel project."
"Now that the situation has taken a new turn towards numerous amendments, we have introduced some priorities to supplement the project, not to correct it, because there are already many approved directives and it seemed to us that it was not a question of looking backwards."
"We have therefore introduced initiatives, for example, on the urban environment, on the countryside, on a sustainable culture, on the issue of animal feed and the control of the food chain, an issue which we would have put much more stress on if the document had been produced before now."
"Therefore, we have wanted to strengthen and extend it, thereby showing that our group has a great interest in this policy."
"However, I must say that certain amendments have been introduced which, if approved, will oblige us to reject the general project."
"Because we cannot allow a project of this type to talk about, for example, the indiscriminate civil liability of all persons who have companies or initiatives."
"For example, Amendment No 68, if applied directly, would oblige any mountain farmer with cattle which causes problems for the environment, to take out civil liability insurance."
"This is absurd."
"Some of the amendments are excessively tough and are going to have repercussions for the citizens."
"The same must be said of an indiscriminate rate on hydrocarbons and on energy which may penalise the weaker sections of the population who take two hours to get to work because they live in the outskirts of the cities."
"To sum up, we have believed in the project and we are supporting it."
"We support the Commission."
"We support the idea as a whole and most of the ideas within it."
"We do not, however, believe this is a Christmas tree, as one Member says, which any old thing can be hung on."
"Neither is it a project for Gothenburg."
"It is a project for Johannesburg, which we want to present proudly in 2002, supporting the Commission and European policy."
"Mr President, it is very significant that Parliament is devoting a large part of its agenda today to a debate on the future of the Union with three reports - the Hulthén, Blokland and Myller reports - dealing with three complementary aspects of the same strategy."
"The Hulthén report is a contribution to a more definite strategy for sustainable development, the Blokland report explores the relationships between economic policy and environmental issues in greater depth and, finally, the Myller report seeks to provide a series of consistent objectives and effective instruments for pursuing those objectives in terms of environmental policy."
"Tomorrow' s vote on the sixth programme only represents a stage in this important project we have undertaken, but it is no less important for that."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has sought to strengthen the text and make it more binding as a crystal clear demonstration of our determination to take concrete steps to safeguard and improve the environment around us, especially in view of the limited achievements of the fifth action programme."
"In that context, I would like to thank our rapporteur and briefly comment on two points which seem to me particularly important."
"The first relates to the need to consolidate the involvement of local authorities in the action programme."
"While it is indeed important to set objectives at continent level, we must not forget that only committed, continuous action on the ground can actually secure a profound change in habits and customs, instilling a new culture of eco-compatible planning into every level of our local institutions."
"In that connection, I venture to draw your attention to Amendments Nos 52 and 53, already endorsed by the Committee on the Environment."
"We must succeed in ensuring that all the instruments provided by the programme - legislative, fiscal, financial, scientific, cultural and informative - can actually be used."
"For this - and here I come to my second point - it is fundamentally important to strengthen training in environmental policy for all the players operating on the ground."
"I am not just talking about administrators, but also about economic and social players and individual citizens, whom we must succeed in involving in this collective effort so that we can indeed make a qualitative leap in the protection of our environment, hence putting on greater pressure for the achievement of ambitious objectives at global level."
"Mr President, I remember that at a very early stage, even before the Action Programme was before us, we had a talk with the Commissioner, during which we made it clear that the sixth environment action programme should be a brief document, taking the form of a pamphlet, with clear priorities and objectives."
"I remember that the Commissioner shared our view."
"Unfortunately, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I have to say that we are disappointed with the ultimate outcome."
"It is a document which may provide an excellent analysis, but which is far too long and which does not contain any clear priorities and, in actual fact, which does not set out a clear policy, except for wanting to make the environment cleaner."
"Other than that, however, the document offers little in the way of transparency."
"That is, by the way, not a personal criticism of the Commissioner: we are very satisfied with her work in other areas."
"Despite this, the Commission saw an opportunity to produce something which we did not actually want."
"Allow me to move on to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We have a great deal of appreciation for the work which the rapporteur has done. In many ways, she re-wrote the document."
"Ultimately, however, the result of the work of the Environmental Committee is not really what we had hoped for either."
"It is increasingly resembling a hotchpotch: everyone has a say and makes proposals, which leaves us ultimately with a kind of wish list."
"I cannot shake off the impression that if someone had at some stage proposed to clean up the moon while we were at it, the Commission would have adopted that too."
"That is not the right way to go about things, of course."
"We may produce whole reams of fine words and give the impression that we are doing something worthwhile, but that is not strictly speaking the case."
"It is also perhaps questionable whether a ten-year programme is really what we need in this day and age."
"Too much chat, which, in fact, fits into the Dutch political culture perfectly: we too talk endlessly about all kinds of things - the infamous Dutch culture of consultation and deliberation, referred to as the 'poldermodel' being a case in point - but it subsequently takes an incredibly long time before something actually gets done."
"Perhaps we need an entirely different approach, for example by establishing very clear issue programmes in the short term, alongside regular legislative programmes, in respect of which the Commission is doing a sterling job."
"Allow me also to make a constructive comment and indicate which, in our view, should be the minimum priorities: climate change, energy, waste and bio-diversity."
"We should have placed the emphasis on these aspects, instead of producing a document which indicates how beautiful the world should become on all scores."
"We do not welcome many amendments because we then cannot see the wood for the trees."
"Strictly speaking, we are not against the proposed details in the legislation, but we are of the opinion that it is unnecessary to include those in the Action Programme now and to regulate those matters from Brussels and Strasbourg. It would be far preferable to implement this at national and perhaps even at regional or local level."
"Mr President, transparency and details are two different things in our view."
"We will therefore vote against a good number of amendments, not necessarily because we are opposed to them, but because we believe that those points should not be laid down by the European Parliament at this stage."
"We therefore offer our hesitant support to this process."
"Finally, I should like to propose the following: next time a document of this kind is drafted, we must ask the Commission officials to go back to using typewriters instead of word-processors."
"In that way, it might be easier to keep to the point, because then there would not be the constant temptation to copy sections from existing documents into the new document."
"It is also true that short documents save trees."
"I cannot therefore but support the honourable Member."
"Mr President, the Sixth Environment Action Programme is perhaps the most important policy document which we need to address during this mandate period, as it will guide environmental legislation and environmental policy in the EU for a long time to come."
"It also forms a vital cornerstone of the strategy for sustainable development."
"I would like to pay homage to Mrs Myller, who has worked excellently together with the shadow rapporteurs."
"She also involved us all at a very early stage by allowing us to put forward proposals which she then took into account."
"I believe we have raised the ambitions of the Commission document to a higher level, particularly with regard to the scope, aims and timetable of the programme."
"The Commission and Commissioner Wallström received a great deal of criticism that the proposal was far too tame and was aiming too low."
"The criticism came from all sides, including from the two institutions, the Council and Parliament."
"However I would like to thank Margot Wallström for the fact that we have a Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"We have perhaps forgotten that the Commission initially did not want the Sixth Environment Action Programme at all."
"Only during questioning by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in conjunction with Mrs Wallström being put forward as a candidate for Commissioner, was the promise of a Sixth Action Programme given."
"I am convinced that it not only required political courage but also a great deal of stubbornness and energy to carry out this promise, which is important to remember."
"There are many important points which I will not have time to address now, but I would like to point out that the Committee has done a good job in deciding that the relevant strategies as well as the targets, funds and timetable should be drawn up as a framework directive, so that the matter can be handled in a democratic manner in Parliament and by the Council and so that we can enter the decision-making process and influence it."
"I also believe it is good that the wording on public procurement, biodiversity, the precautionary principle and the substitution principle with regard to the chemicals strategy has been included."
"Mr President, now that the fifth environment action programme has failed and political terms such as sustainability, waste reduction, cutting greenhouse gases and the much-vaunted international conferences and ecological organisations are politically bankrupt, the European Union's sixth environment action programme has taken exclusive and open recourse to the private sector in order to manage the environmental crisis, culminating in morally and environmentally perverse practices and tools such as trading in greenhouse gases."
"Of the five strategic avenues, the two most basic are, first, finding new ways of working more closely with the market via businesses and consumers and, secondly, empowering people as private citizens."
"This is the simple, crude and cynical way in which acute environmental problems are dealt with by the European Union which, with its bombing of Yugoslavia and its depleted uranium bombs, has inflicted incalculable damage on valuable natural resources, not to mention all the other disasters."
"One last but illustrative point. In Greece, there is no water on the plain of Thessaly, with the result that about a million people have nothing to drink and the plain is drying up and turning into a Sahara desert."
"The diversion of the upper reaches of the River Acheloos, which is a major environmental project with hydroelectric energy and some irrigation functions, is on hold because the Community Support Frameworks, the famous packages, do not fund this sort of project."
"Does the House not think that the European Union, which claims to be fighting for the environment, should review its position on and fund these projects?"
"Mr President, during the assessment of the fifth environment action programme, clear and challenging observations were made about the different environmental issues nearly two years ago."
"Despite all fresh environmental legislation, an increase in the activity in terms of transport, energy and agriculture has put more pressure on the environment."
"This is partly caused by the fact that many Member States fail to implement environmental legislation."
"The conclusion of the assessment was that the objectives of the fifth environment action programme were not met."
"Consequently, implementation and compliance, including the necessary inspections, of current EU legislation must be granted absolute top priority."
"In addition, the remaining part of the present Environment Action Programme is yet to be carried out."
"In the light of the enlargement, every effort must be made to achieve this also in the candidate countries in the shortest possible time."
"The solving of environmental issues in those countries is very high on the list of priorities."
"In addition, the environmental gain is potentially at its highest in those countries."
"Finally, Mr President - and that is not a criticism of Commissioner Wallström or the rapporteur, Mrs Myller - there is a risk that this proposal will not have more impact than a paper tiger."
"I can support many objectives, but these can only be obtained once the objectives of the fifth Environment Action Programme have been met."
"It is therefore not a bad thing if the sixth Environment Action programme can only be laid down at a later stage."
"In the meantime, all efforts can be focused on the implementation of the present legislation of the fifth Environment Action Programme, and the Council will also have the time to assess the profusion of amendments tabled by Parliament."
"Mr President, evaluating an extensive and not always specifically formulated ten year programme for EU environmental policy is a difficult enough task in itself."
"What the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult."
"I think that what the Commission laid before us was a very good starting point."
"I really feel sorry for the Commission officials who presented a very good report because their good work was changed so much."
"I am unable to congratulate the rapporteur."
"In the discussion on the evaluation of the Fifth Environment Action Programme with a view to the sixth, three essential concerns were repeatedly formulated in the fundamentals, and thankfully I find them here again: streamlined EU legislation, a voluntary approach to implementation - so far as possible - and greater involvement of the consumer, whose behaviour we want to influence, after all."
"Because it is no longer the 'What' that is at the forefront of environmental policy today."
"We are agreed on that - industry is, too - but how we get there, that is where the controversy lies!"
"As I see it, the EU way is often twin-track, contradictory, difficult to implement, bureaucratic and costly out of all proportion to the ecological purpose."
"Such legal errors are then multiplied fifteen fold in the implementation."
"If, as I very much hope, we are to have enlargement very soon, there will be twice as many, because in the end with all these mistakes the dogs always bite the last one in the chain."
"That is not industry, it is the consumer."
"The implementation of existing EU environmental legislation addressed in the Environment Action Programme and rightly called for repeatedly by Commissioner Wallström makes good sense and is also consistent with our repeated call for streamlined legislation."
"I find there is a lot missing from this environment programme."
"I am sure we could have included it."
"Only what the rapporteur has made of it does not improve matters."
"I feel sorry for the Commission officials!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, when I read the Commission proposal, at first I said: 'Splendid!'"
"That was when I read the communication."
"Then I looked at the articles and found that something had happened between communication and articles."
"There is always something missing."
"If you look at it closely, you can see precisely what it is."
"In the communication, the strategic objectives - and the related measures - are set out quite clearly."
"In the articles there are only vague allusions."
"Sometimes something has been lost altogether, in the case of noise, for example, which in my opinion is a key environmental factor for human health."
"The communication describes the types of pollution and lists the measures."
"Then you come to the articles; in Article 2 you still find the objective of reducing pollution, especially long-term pollution, from noise."
"Then when you come to the measures concerning health in Article 6, however hard you look, Commissioner, I can find not one specific measure about noise."
"I therefore think it is right that we should now bring the things that you listed quite rightly and very well at the beginning of the communication back into the articles, thereby making them binding for the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"Either list of examples can be used."
"If we are to set about using an instrument of this kind, we need a degree of strategic orientation."
"In connection with water, for example, we read: ""phasing out the discharge of hazardous substances"" ."
"I don' t think there is even one person in the European Union who says he wants more hazardous substances to be discharged into water."
"The questions of when such a thing happens, however, and what hazardous substances are, need to be rather more closely defined!"
"There is nothing about that at all."
"The next bullet point is ""Revising the bathing water directive"" ."
"What does ""revising"" mean?"
"Does it mean raising the standards?"
"Does it mean the same standards as in the drinking water directive, or does it mean protecting human health?"
"So we need greater clarity here."
"Now a word to the PPE-DE: I admit we have a few motions here about whose content we can discuss."
"We must do that, but we must do it in the second reading because that is when things get polished up."
"I really must ask you at the first reading to give us a mandate to negotiate and back the report."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Myller on her very sound report."
"Since 1972, we have had Environment Action Programmes one, two, three, four and five."
"A few years ago, key officials in the Directorate-General for the Environment said that they had done enough, and that there was no need for a sixth environment action programme."
"If the Member States implement what has already been decided, then all will be well in the environment."
"We as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance protested loudly against this, and we asked candidate-Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, to issue a sixth environment action programme anyway, which she did; she has kept her promise."
"We have to say that we, along with Mr Lange, believe that the legislative component is rather flimsy."
"The extensive explanatory note was much better."
"That is why we as majority in Parliament wanted to include this extensive explanatory note in the legislation."
"Hence the many amendments."
"We have now also received the Prodi paper for the Gothenburg Summit."
"It has to be said that this paper contains a number of interesting ideas which go even further, such as the abolition of subsidies for fossil fuels until 2010, and 7% bio-fuels for cars and lorries, also in 2010."
"We as the Group of the Greens have tabled amendments of that ilk."
"We hope that the Socialists and Liberals will support them, so that they can be incorporated in the legislation."
"If that is the case, Parliament will be supporting an ambitious programme for the next ten years."
"According to the Liberals, climate, waste and bio-diversity had to be included."
"Without the sixth environment action programme, the whole issue of bio-diversity would have been overlooked."
"It would not have been given priority in the current policy."
"That is why I welcome this fresh initiative."
"Mr President, on the eve of the Gothenburg Summit, we needed to find a way of reconciling the environment and economic growth, that is, of combating the deterioration in the environment while giving companies the means to develop."
"The sixth action programme makes a more or less felicitous attempt to do this."
"It suggests that Kyoto needs to be ratified if we are to combat the greenhouse effect efficiently and calls for greater protection for our cultural and natural heritage, as the honourable Member Mrs De Veyrac stresses in her report - and on this we agree."
"There are also issues which give us cause for concern, however. For example, we are moving on to the sixth programme without any real evaluation of the results of the fifth programme, which is completely irregular."
"We also feel that programming over a ten-year period is much too long, to the point at which theory has prevailed over practice in the Commission communication, a document of 90 pages no less."
"As for transparency of decisions and access to documents, I trust that these will not go unheeded, as recommended in the Korhola report."
"Finally, the objectives of enhanced protection for biodiversity through the Natura 2000 network are proving troublesome."
"Almost every Member State is having implementation problems due to the lack of clarity in the texts and their restrictive interpretation by the European Court of Justice."
"Article 225a of the Treaty of Nice provides for the facility to create judicial panels to hear at first instance certain classes of action brought in specific areas."
"There is good reason to bet that the environment sector will be one of the first to set them up, given the context."
"Is this the best way of protecting the environment?"
"I very much doubt it and I call for a sixth programme which is rational, realistic and humanist in its application."
"Mr President, this is one of the most important documents we will be debating in the field of the environment in this parliamentary cycle."
"Given its enhanced legal status, this document will be of greater significance than any of the other environmental action plans I have seen going through Parliament in the last 10 or so years."
"I am, therefore, concerned at the speed with which it has been considered by Parliament, driven at least in part by an ambitious presidency that will be here today and gone tomorrow."
"Mrs Myller is in no way to be criticised as she has striven very hard to begin the discussion on the substance of this debate very early on, but that has not stopped some of her colleagues from coming forward with a long last-minute shopping list of demands stretching far into the future."
"However, we should not despair."
"The proposals are still there at the centre of the document in the amendments."
"The Commission can still rescue it at second reading."
"The rapporteur will have the chance of getting a core of sensible amendments together at second reading that will have the support of the clear majority of Members of this House."
"I, like many others tomorrow, will vote for this report and the bulk of the amendments, knowing that by going forward to the second reading we are taking steps in the long process of developing an environment policy for the European Union which will outlast all the presidencies and all the ministers that this Parliament will see, and which will probably also outlast most of the Members of this House."
"In that sense, we all have to recognise how small a part we play in the bigger overall process."
"Mr President, the Environment Action Programme has galvanised Parliament into a high level of activity."
"It has stirred up contradictory reactions, reactions of disappointment and satisfaction."
"I am one of those who are actually quite pleased: a great deal of thought has gone into selecting the topics, and I welcome the emphasis on climate, health, bio-diversity and waste."
"In my view, however, we could have been more specific, more to the point, and more precise."
"Rapporteur, Mrs Rita Myller, has compiled an excellent report, which I back entirely."
"Her report contributes towards a better and more specific Environment Action Programme."
"The sixth environment action programme must become the mainstay of European strategy for sustainable development."
"That too receives my unqualified support."
"Two matters are of key importance to me."
"First of all, compliance."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner has placed so much emphasis on proper compliance."
"She has also confirmed this in the previous debate."
"I am of the view that Parliament could play a more significant role in that compliance."
"One of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy states that Parliament should be issued with half-yearly reports on the state of affairs, which affords an overview of compliance by the Member States and instances of encouragement by the Commission, and, if possible, the effectiveness of the legislation."
"Such a report can be hugely beneficial to national parliaments: they can be the first ones to point out the governments' non-compliance with European obligations."
"In that way, various parties can join forces and can turn the sixth environment action programme into a success."
"Commissioner, I should like to have your opinion on the possibility of these half-yearly reports."
"My second point concerns international cooperation."
"Sustainable development should not remain within European borders."
"That is why the Environmental Committee is calling for protection of the hot spots in tropical regions."
"International agreements are important."
"Unfortunately, Parliament has insufficient authority in this respect, and international negotiations are not public."
"One of the amendments is asking the Commission to consult Parliament before and after the event."
"That does happen, but does it also happen in the case of conferences of the international airline organisations, for example?"
"I would welcome this greatly."
"I should like to echo the hope which has been expressed in favour of broad support for this report during tomorrow' s vote."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion."
"I am perhaps slightly disappointed by the view of the PPE-DE."
"The objectives of the programme which have been raised in this report originate predominantly from the Commission's notification section, but also include many of the same objectives which President of the Commission Romano Prodi raised in his own presentation of sustainable development at the last sitting in Strasbourg."
"I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs; in my opinion the work was carried out well."
"I would also like to thank you for your observations; I personally aim to start discussions at as early a stage as possible and maintain contact with the various bodies during the work."
"I hope that I have succeeded in this."
"I also hope that the PPE-DE is able to support this report because I have taken their proposals very broadly into account in proceedings in the committee."
"Possibly for this reason, this final proposal now coming for its first reading has become something of a mixture of combined hopes, but Bernd Lange and David Bowe gave a very clear idea of how we can work further on this programme document."
"Thank you once again."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, thank you for your interventions and, of course, first of all I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her excellent work in preparing the report in a very short time."
"There were actually two choices after I decided to say 'yes' to the question in the hearing about whether I wanted to present a sixth Environment Action Programme: either the choice of being criticised for being too ambitious and thus unrealistic, or being too detailed and thus not visionary enough."
"I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about whether it was a good answer to say 'yes, we should make a sixth Environment Action Programme' since it has been heavily criticised."
"On the other hand, I expected that, because there was a global assessment of the fifth programme, and what did it teach us?"
"We learned from that programme that implementation was not good enough."
"We have a solid base of more than 200 legal acts in the environment."
"We already have ambitious targets and deadlines in programmes, but they have not all been met."
"There is a lack of understanding from different institutions and from Member States in actually wanting to carry out the necessary work for the environment."
"This is what we learned."
"I wanted to make a short programme: it should have been shorter, but guess what would have happened then?"
"We would have added, and Parliament and Council would have added a number of details and included even more issues in the environmental programme."
"That is always the risk if you want to make a short."
"My collaborator said that it was not possible to bring in all the important issues and make the programme shorter."
"There is the risk of making it a shopping list, and I wanted to avoid that."
"I wanted to make it an action programme."
"I wanted to point out what is necessary to mobilise, on a very broad scale, all different stake-holders in society, and to mention the actions necessary to meet the objectives set in this programme to show that, during a period of ten years, these kinds of actions are necessary."
"Of course, I am not against targets, timetables or deadlines."
"We need them, but they must be based on sound science, on the latest facts from these different sectors and policy areas."
"I appreciate that we have broad support for the priorities and the structure of this programme."
"We have the problem that this is a codecision procedure, so we have a difference between the first and second part and I do not know how to deal with that."
"It is a pity that it exists, because you need to see the full text to understand the way we think about these issues: so that is partly an explanation of the problems we experience."
"It has to come in the right order, however: the targets and deadlines should, of course, come in the automatic strategies, in the follow-up."
"However, I wanted the programme to describe the priorities and stick to the priorities, not to make it a shopping list, not to add everything about bathing water quality or the noise problem, etc., instead to stick to these priorities."
"We have so many good amendments that actually enhance this programme and we welcome those amendments that clarify the text and add some precision to the actions being proposed: I include Amendment No 77 on allowing environmental criteria to be taken into account in public purchasing."
"This is what we are working on at the moment."
"I appreciate the reference to giving priority to young people in the provision of information, emphasised in Amendment No 88."
"We have not been able to say 'yes' to all the excellent amendments about information and education to young people."
"We do not have the competence, or the resources - it has to be up to the Member States to carry this out - but it is a very important issue and I want to underline that."
"The setting of targets should be seen as part of the process, getting results by involving stake-holders, because we do not have many specific proposals for these targets and timetables."
"It was the same in the Council when we asked what kind of targets do you mean?"
"Give us some examples - I got two, of which one was very general and the other already known to us. Of course, we could have used concepts such as 'ecological footprint' or 'factor 4' or 'factor 10', but then the programme would have been slightly different."
"It must be based on sound science and facts and it must be achievable and viable."
"I would like to say something about thematic strategies."
"We have proposed the use of thematic strategies for defining the set of measures that will be needed to tackle six complex and multi-dimensional problems."
"The Commission fully understands and we strongly support the wish of Parliament to be fully involved and consulted on the content of the thematic strategies."
"That has been our objective all the time."
"I welcome the inclusion of an Article that defines thematic strategies and I can support the spirit, if not the letter, of Amendment No 66, because a thematic strategy may be a framework directive, but it could also be a combination of a directive and other actions."
"We should not specify that in every case there should be a framework directive."
"We have to keep it open, to have a strategy which includes the possibility of proposing a framework directive."
"There is also this question about timetables and again we must remember that this is a strategic programme that lays down the priorities for the next 10 years, not a comprehensive work programme."
"There is no link made between new actions proposed and the resources available to do the job."
"The Commission will produce the necessary proposals, but they need to be of good quality and it is also important to underline that."
"We cannot accept those amendments that seek to bind the Commission to producing proposals by set dates, for example, Amendments Nos 49, 76, 85, 123, 189, 198."
"It is always the Commission's intention to use the mid-term review of the programme as the point at which the implementing measures for the programme should be prepared."
"There are annual reports about implementation, but so far we have not made a big case out of these, although we have started to have these name, fame and shame seminars, to do more to make it public, and we warmly welcome Parliament's intention to take part and to know more: we are willing to do everything possible to help in this."
"I will not comment on all the amendments, because we have already left a note with our comments, but urban areas need to be stressed more and we welcome the spirit of Amendment No 207."
"Of the 297 amendments being proposed, the Commission actually supports more than half in full, or in part, or in principle, but we cannot accept 145."
"Finally, we welcome this opinion."
"We feel that it will be an invaluable contribution to creating an operational, dynamic and ultimately successful sixth Environment Action Programme."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Environmental impact of certain plans and programmes"
"The next item is the report (A5-0177/2001) by Mrs Schörling, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (C5-0118/01 - 1996/0304(COD))."
". (SV) Mr President, it has been very exciting to be part of the process leading up to the decision we are to take on strategic environmental impact assessments."
"The idea behind environmental impact assessments for plans and programmes is an old one."
"The original draft directive appeared in the 1970s, at which time it covered policy areas, plans, programmes and projects."
"However, the Commission changed its mind and decided to propose a directive which only covered environmental impact assessments for projects."
"The next step was not taken until 1991, when the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive on environmental impact statements which took in policy areas, plans and programmes."
"However, the proposal was presented at a time of lively debate on the balance of power in what was then the European Community, and the proposal encountered so much opposition that it was withdrawn in 1992."
"The Commission did not give up, stating in the Fifth Environment Action Programme that an impact statement for policy areas, plans and programmes is necessary to achieve sustainable development."
"This can be seen in the context of the debate held earlier today."
"At the same time Member States were urged to expand the Directive on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private Projects on the Environment to encompass plans and programmes."
"In 1997 the Commission put forward a new, amended proposal which no longer covered policy areas. This was a shame as the policy areas should naturally have been included."
"I tried to reintroduce policy areas into the text, but this amendment unfortunately received no support during the second reading."
"I hope it will at least be included some time in the future."
"The aim of the directive is to ensure that an environmental impact assessment is carried out on certain plans and programmes and that the result of these impact assessments will be taken into consideration during the planning and approval of plans and programmes which may have an environmental impact."
"The fact that the environmental assessment comes early on in the planning process, so that there is time to make adjustments or changes or draw up alternative plans, is naturally an excellent instrument for all decision makers."
"The directive must also naturally be seen as a complement to the environmental impact statements on projects, but these come much later in the decision-making process."
"Conciliation on this matter started in October 2000 and ended in Strasbourg on 14 March 2001."
"Although the negotiations have been tough, I am happy with the end result, which can be summarised as follows."
"Parliament has pushed through a requirement for monitoring environmental impact which was not included in the Council Common Position."
"This ensures that corrective measures can be taken if the monitoring shows that initiatives are insufficient."
"It will also be possible to identify hazardous effects and corrective measures, if possible at an early stage."
"A hard battle was also fought on whether Structural Funds, agricultural funds and funds for the applicant countries should be included in the directive."
"We eventually obtained political agreement that this would happen and that exceptions currently in force will only apply for the period of the programme, which ends in 2006/2007."
"I was not entirely satisfied with this solution."
"Therefore, an information note has been included, drawn up by Commission civil servants, which confirms that this will naturally also apply to the EU' s own plans and programmes."
"Another important and well-formulated point was that on transboundary consultations with third countries and public consultation."
"I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this work: the Swedish Presidency for its tough negotiations, the Commission for all its expertise and my colleagues who have taken part in the committee and delegation work, as well as everyone else who has taken part in the delegation."
"Thank you all."
"Mr President, we are essentially satisfied with the agreement reached in conciliation."
"All the main demands advanced by Parliament at the two previous readings have been incorporated by the Council."
"The obligation to carry out an environmental impact study at an extremely early stage of town and country planning means that environmental issues can actually be integrated fully into land management plans and programmes at the very start of the drafting process."
"The Union has finally understood that we must no longer restrict ourselves to dealing with the damage caused by short-sighted planning only after it has been done."
"In this connection, extending the scope of the directive to a whole raft of plans and programmes co-financed by the Union represents a great step forwards. In practice, these represent all the programmes carried out, particularly in the less favoured regions."
"Without going into detail, Article 3 of the text that has been approved clearly confirms the principle that all plans and programmes with possible significant effects on the environment are subject to an environmental assessment."
"Thanks to the climate of cooperation established within the committee, to which the rapporteur contributed decisively, other important results have also been achieved, such as a more precise definition of what is meant by 'public consultation' and a more specific hierarchical structuring of the various processes, in such a way as to avoid any risk of unnecessary overload for local administrations."
"Overall, this is an extremely useful legislative instrument which will obviate the temptation - always present in the Member States, as demonstrated again by the recent statements by future ministers of the Italian government currently being formed - to accelerate the launch of massive infrastructure projects, skipping, at least partly, the processes laid down by Community legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today has again proved that the European Union' s environmental policy has in recent years become a key aspect of European policy."
"There can be no doubt that the wide-ranging efforts to protect the environment and human health and the careful and rational use of natural resources are necessary and important."
"The compromise now arrived at in the Conciliation Committee concerning the assessment of the environmental impact of certain Parliamentary programmes is therefore also an important building block in the European Union' s environmental policy."
"I am glad that many of the uncertainties and imponderables from the first and second readings are no longer part of this directive."
"I particularly welcome the fact that many terms - and I will only mention the term public again here - are now clearly defined."
"The extension of the directive to support out of EU funds, that is to support from the Structural Funds, must certainly be viewed positively by and large."
"It should be pointed out here, however, that applications for money from the Structural Funds are already being delayed by bureaucratic hurdles and by what seem to me in some cases to be highly unreasonable demands."
"If we are now looking for further conditions to be met for support from the Structural Funds, the necessary second step must be to reduce bureaucracy in other fields."
"I would emphatically point out that the impression should not be given here that inclusion of the environmental impact assessment will put support in jeopardy."
"Allow me to draw your attention to another weakness."
"It is doubtful whether the environmental impact assessment referred to in the present text will be applied in a comparable manner in all Member States."
"Too often the application and implementation of important rules is left to the discretion of the Member States."
"This no doubt satisfies the regionalists in the EU, but it is hardly conducive to achieving comparable situations in the European Union."
"There is also the fear that distortions of competition might result."
"I see this as the crucial weakness of the compromise arrived at in the Conciliation Committee."
"If environmental impact assessments serve only to highlight possible dangers in one country but the same results of the assessment may result in the measures in question being banned in another, we can hardly speak of the arrangement as being appropriate for an internal market."
"We should watch and critically examine developments in the next few years and take action accordingly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad that this directive is now entering its final stage of adoption."
"It is indeed an important new instrument that will strengthen the integration of the environmental considerations into decision-making and I particularly welcome the agreement of the Consultation Committee on a joint text confirmed on 21 March."
"Some significant improvements have been made from the common position to the final directive, some have entered the directive, such as the introduction of monitoring or the strengthening of provisions on the quality of the environmental report."
"This was possible due to the quality of Parliament's proposals and the agreement of the Council to take these on board in the framework of the codecision procedure."
"I would like to particularly congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Schörling, as well as all members of the Conciliation Committee."
"The international importance of this directive is also shown by the fact that it already serves as an example of an SCA protocol currently being developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe."
"This is proof of the contribution to environmental improvement that the European Community can and should continue to make."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0178/2001) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting (C5-0130/2001 - 1997/0348(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, noise is one of the key environmental issues."
"It is one of the few environmental problems which is affecting a great number of citizens and which actually falls within their frame of reference."
"This was noticed as early on as during the fifth environment action programme, when the Commission promised proposals then, but nearly ten years have passed and not a great deal has been done about it."
"Of all noise sources, the noise generated by cars and lorries is the most crucial one."
"The noise of cars which exceed 40 to 50 km/hour does not so much originate in the engine as it does from the tyres, and particularly from the contact between the tyres and the road surface."
"The Council of Ministers of the Internal Market have neglected the noise aspect enormously."
"They hardly considered the environmental aspect at all."
"That is why the European Parliament decided at second reading to try to reduce the noise of car tyres by two decibels."
"Two decibels may not appear much, but three decibels represents nearly a cut of the noise by half."
"The common position was so weak that 70% of the cars already comply with the new noise standards, at least in northern Europe."
"The gravity of the negotiations did not move the Council of Ministers a great deal."
"Even the compromise on the part of Parliament simply to halve the requested reduction of two decibels down to only one decibel was viewed unfavourably by the Ministers."
"We reached a compromise ultimately, however."
"In the compromise, we passed the ball back to the Commission, which is now under heavy pressure to prepare more far-reaching proposals on noise production in tyres in future."
"Noise-reducing tyres are already available."
"They have to become the norm in future, and the EC' s industry must opt for these rather than side with the people lagging behind."
"It is also important to review legislation regarding the rolling resistance of tyres."
"This could particularly benefit the CO2-problem, also known as the greenhouse problem."
"A reduction of five to ten percent is certainly within the realms of possibility."
"Here too, we are waiting for the European Commission' s next move."
"The Conciliation Committee has finally managed to reach a reasonable compromise, and that is why I recommend the entire European Parliament to back this achieved result."
"I should like to make a brief reference to the future."
"A hefty noise reduction cannot only be achieved by including noise-reducing tyres in a European standard, but also by using noise-reducing asphalt."
"This being the case, the noise generated by road traffic can then be reduced by five decibels."
"Even in my own country, the Netherlands, where 40% of the population complain about traffic noise, a pilot project is running, involving noise-reducing asphalt, which produces a reduction by ten decibels."
"I hope that in its new proposals, the European Commission will not only consider noise-reducing tyres, but will also look into noise-reducing asphalt, for the noise of traffic is a thorn in the side of an increasing number of people."
"Mr President, my favourite Commissioner, when I bought new tyres for my car six months ago I decided to buy tyres with a 71 decibel noise rating."
"That is 3 decibels less than we are to adopt for the year 2005 tomorrow."
"Mr Commissioner, I am at a loss to explain to anyone why there are already tyres on the market that are 3 decibels below the standard we are to adopt for 2005."
"Some say the tyre may be quiet, but it is unsafe and also uses more fuel."
"That is not true!"
"The tyre I bought has a rolling resistance far below the average and it also has grip values and aquaplaning values that are much better than the average."
"It is therefore a quiet, low consumption and, at the same time, safe tyre."
"It is also advertised on the tyre itself - I think rightly so: reducing CO2."
"So more can be done than proposed."
"To that extent I find the compromise just about acceptable."
"You and the Commission really ought to go and look at what is available on the market."
"Then you should put forward as soon as possible a fresh proposal for a further reduction in noise - while maintaining the standard of safety - and I think Parliament will then happily go that way with you."
"Thank you, Mr Lange."
"I am sure that, like me, many of the honourable Members would be most interested in knowing which brand of tyre you have just described."
"I would like to congratulate the European Parliament, the delegation chaired by Mr Provan, and the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, on their success in reaching an agreement with the Council on this directive."
"I would like to stress that with this directive, the European Community will set the pace for the industry to produce 'quieter' tyres for the benefit of all European citizens."
"This directive is just a first but major step toward significant progress towards better control of road transport nuisance."
"Other steps will follow to further improve the protection of the environment and the road safety aspects of tyres."
"This will place the European tyre industry at the leading edge of the technology world-wide."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Financial Regulation applicable to the EC general budget"
"The next item is the report (A5-0176/2001) by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) on the financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (COM(2000) 462 - C5-0627/2000 - 2000/0203(CNS))."
"Mr President, it is an honour to have ten minutes in which to address such a full House on a report which is, after all, quite important and even quite passionate about the subjects which it raises and which relate to it."
"It deals with the financial regulation of the European Union, the reworking of the financial agreement and obviously accompanies the reform proper of our Union and of our Commission, following the resignation of the Commission, following the report by the Wise Men, following the recommendations which the Committee of Wise Men made and which the European Parliament and our relevant parliamentary committees, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control, accepted in good faith."
"As you will all recall, the Committee on Budgetary Control made a point of highlighting the importance of the work of the Committee of Wise Men."
"One of the most important reforms recommended by the Wise Men and endorsed by the European Parliament and the famous van Hulten report relates first and foremost to a key reform recommended by the financial regulation, that is, that we abolish financial control in its present form, with all its practical difficulties, and introduce an ex post audit, change the formula without changing the system - on the contrary - in order to extend and make controls more efficient, to quote the Wise Men."
"So it is in the wake of this recommendation that our committees, both the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets subscribed to the thinking of the European Commission and this is one of the points which I want to stress because I shall concentrate in the second part of my speech on the proposed amendments which appear to me to have no bearing whatsoever on the subject."
"In the five minutes available to me, as rapporteur, in which to present my report, I wish to address the reform by saying that we have taken a very close look at your proposal, Commissioner, and have proposed 260 amendments, proof positive that we have done a proper job."
"The two Hughes procedure committees with Mr van Hulten, which I thank for working together so closely in order to make progress and keep to the timetable which we thought the Council was going to impose on us because it wanted to address this issue at the ECOFIN Council on 5 June."
"We asked in vain for the Council to be present - it is too late, the Council is not present, no matter - but we asked it and we pass on the message that we were asked to work quickly and we have worked quickly."
"We wrapped it up in a few months and I can assure you that it was no easy job."
"So, Commissioner, we followed your lead."
"We proposed a great many amendments."
"I think that in certain areas we have, without doubt, tried to be diligent, to foster transparency, to foster greater budgetary prudence, a more efficient system, clearer, more transparent, faster application of standards for the beneficiaries of our aid, for those who implement some of our budgets, wherever there were shortcomings, and there are shortcomings, it must be said."
"In certain specific areas we noted a fair backlog in the implementation of projects committed but not spent."
"We tackled the problem of supporting staff and tried to improve the definition of the concept of supporting staff and I trust that you will find that we have done so efficiently, Commissioner."
"We retained the specific rule in the financial regulation in toto with a quarrel which we settled thus."
"We think it is better to keep it in the financial regulation as a legislative instrument."
"We introduced the notion of financial statements, that is, source law, which we tried to turn into real legislation."
"We stressed the independence of OLAF."
"We tried to improve a text which, all said and done, grosso modo, we felt had the right idea."
"So that finishes my five minutes as rapporteur."
"Now, in my own name and on behalf of my political group of Italian radicals, I should like to address the amendments proposed because, as you know, Mr President, something strange is afoot in this debate, in which 230 amendments have been tabled by the Committee on Budgets and by the Committee on Budgetary Control and in which we have a committee chair who has also tabled amendments, on behalf of her group of course."
"It is the law, it is the regulation which so requires, with her name against that of her own committee, of which I am a member."
"I am sure you will understand that this is rather strange."
"Imagine, Mrs Schreyer, you make a proposal, the Commission approves it and the following day Mr Prodi attacks you or amends the proposal which has just been voted by your colleague as such."
"It is, after all, rather strange."
"A committee which has already examined a great many of these amendments and rejected them."
"Then re-tables them on behalf of its chair."
"Its Kramer versus Kramer."
"I remember a very well-known French minister saying, ""a minister shuts up or gets out""."
"So I think, Mr President, I do not know what you would do in my position if Mrs Fontaine amended a text on Nice, Mr Méndez de Vigo, a text already voted by Parliament."
"What would you do?"
"Personally, as rapporteur I would vote against but, as a Member, I feel that there is food for thought here."
"Is it that either you are the guarantors of a body or you cannot go against the body which you represent?"
"It seems a bit bizarre to me."
"Many of the amendments were, as I have said, rejected by the committee."
"So, inevitably, as rapporteur, I was obliged to say that I was against."
"It is embarrassing because it puts you in an awkward position."
"There was a consensus in committee to withdraw other amendments and here they are back on the table."
"It is embarrassing when you know that a committee has already given the thumbs down."
"Others have come in from the Court of Auditors."
"The Court of Auditors, however, is not a legislative body; we are all very fond of the Court of Auditors, but we are not here to act as messenger boys, we are here to legislate."
"So this is want I wanted to highlight - and I have taken several minutes to do so - because there is something unhealthy here, although some of the amendments are, shall we say, more than honourable and a group of 233 members could have represented the amendments on someone else's behalf."
"When I see my chair presenting amendments against my report, in her own name, and against her committee, then I think that there are lessons to be learned."
"If you do not agree with your committee, you have to draw your own conclusions and perhaps - why not - think about resigning from a position if that position does not suit a man or women in politics who wants to more power, which is all well and good but then they should resign their position (you cannot umpire and play in the match)."
"That is why I am against the series of amendments seeking to reintroduce the concept of financial controller."
"We are not here to give the Commission discharge."
"We shall take great care to ensure that the system introduced and thought up by the Committee of Wise Men, recommended by the Wise Men, this committee which we honoured, is a viable system which works and can be controlled and, if it does not work, we shall be the first to condemn it."
"The system is up and running, however, and Parliament has endorsed it several times."
"So I urgently recommend that we follow the line taken in my report and by Mr van Hulten and reject this attempt to backtrack, which has no place in our debate, although we shall still have a great deal to discuss."
"I will stop there, Mr President, because we are not happy at the moment with the Council's attitude and, if it is alright with you, we shall advise what Parliament's attitude will be tomorrow after the vote."
"I wonder - but we shall wait for the Commission - if we need to postpone the final vote."
"However, we shall see tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, I will speak on behalf of the Budgetary Control Committee and also on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"Luckily the two positions are the same on this report."
"I would like to begin by thanking Mr Dell'Alba for the excellent cooperation we have had on the Financial Regulation and all the colleagues that have worked with us in the different groups."
"Most groups showed a great willingness to compromise."
"I would like to thank, in particular, the Liberal, Green, and EDD Groups for their active support in drawing up a package of amendments that was acceptable to a majority of the Budgetary Control Committee."
"I was surprised, like my colleague Mr Dell'Alba, that most amendments to this report were tabled by the chair of the Budgetary Control Committee."
"I agree with Mr Dell'Alba that, of course every Member is entitled to put down amendments to a report, also on behalf of their group."
"In the case of a committee chair, however, you have to wonder whether they are mixing up roles to the detriment of the standing of their committee."
"These proposals today are the most sweeping changes to the Community's financial rules in 21 years."
"For the Budgetary Control Committee, the reform of financial control is the key aspect of this proposal."
"Under the Commission's proposal, the ex ante visa issued by a Central Financial Controller will be abolished and instead Directorates-General will be made fully responsible for the lifecycle of expenditure for programmes carried out under their authority."
"This is one of the key reforms called for by the Committee of Independent Experts in 1999, when it issued its reports."
"The CIE concluded, at the time, that most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stemmed from decisions to which financial control gave its approval - the committee also stated that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the visa is a myth."
"It gave two strong arguments for changing the system and I quote, ""First, ex ante checking, whether it be universal or on the basis of sampling is unlikely to be a cost-effective process."
"The efforts put into checking all transactions is clearly disproportionate while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient dissuasive effect."
"The second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control runs up against a crucial objection that de facto if not de jure, it displaces responsibility for financial irregularity from the person actually managing expenditure onto the person approving it."
"This displacement of responsibility means, in effect, that no one is ultimately responsible."""
"The Court of Auditors also discussed changes to the financial control regime in its Opinion No 4 of 1997."
"With respect to the abolition of the ex ante visa it concluded as follows and I quote again, ""As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval, this would not be any more acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could involve financial officials other than the Financial Controller."""
"Has this test been met?"
"Broadly speaking, yes, at least according to Court Opinion No 2 of this year which commented on the Commission's proposal as follows: The provisions governing the financial actors and therefore the structure of the Community internal control system would represent an important step towards meeting the Court's recommendations."
"The case for reform is overwhelming, that much is clear, but it is also to an extent a leap in the dark and it can only work if a number of conditions are met: first authorising officers must be held fully accountable; failure must be recognised and dealt with, not covered up."
"(The President urged the speaker to speak more slowly to assist the interpreters)"
"The same interpreters refuse to translate into Dutch when I speak English, but I am happy to oblige."
"Second, the disciplinary procedure must be strengthened."
"There has been too little action in the past."
"A financial regularities committee would strengthen the procedure as would other amendments we have introduced."
"Third, the independence of internal auditors must be guaranteed and so must the professional independence of those that carry out internal audit within the Directorates-General."
"Finally, minimum standards of financial controls must be adhered to."
"Amendment No 72 sets this out."
"In order for this provision to be effective, there is a need for a central official under the responsibility of the DG Budget to set minimum standards without undermining the responsibility of spending DGs."
"We will have to negotiate with the Council on this proposal."
"The only possibility of doing so effectively is to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution under our rules of procedures."
"Discussion on Article 24 showed that the Council does not pay the slightest attention to Parliament's views, even though the President of the Budgets Committee is here today, and that is particularly surprising coming from the Swedish Presidency."
"I have been approached in recent weeks by a number of national governments asking us to proceed with our vote without delay."
"The sad fact in today's institutional set-up is that if Parliament wants its voice to be heard it must resort to unusual tactics."
"I support the case for speedy reform, but on an issue as important as this - financial rules which could with us for the next 21 years - we must refuse to let Parliament's legitimate expectations to negotiate be ignored by an arrogant Council."
"Thank you, Mr van Hulten."
"I can assure you that your speech has been translated into perfect Dutch."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to follow Mr Dell'Alba and particularly Mr van Hulten; while I do not share his political aspirations, I recognise his ability as a young person who one day will probably lead the European Union to great heights."
"I also recognise that budgetary discipline is based on certain principles: unity, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, and specification."
"However the external budget also requires transparency, because our external budget is constantly exposed to corruption."
"There are many practical problems which we have to look at in the external budget."
"First, development cooperation is better served by multi-annual programmes rather annual programmes but in the EU this is not so."
"We have an annual programme which does not work consistently in terms of output targets."
"Second, output targets are not measured in terms of external budgets so that we do not finally know what we have done with our taxpayers' money."
"We can never come back to Parliament and report on what has happened with our taxpayers' money."
"Third, the external budget is constantly underspent while those in need suffer poverty, malnutrition, hunger, disease, underdevelopment and loss of education and life-quality opportunities."
"Yet, rather than return the funds which are predicted at the beginning of the budget to be unspent - which could then be returned back to Member States who could spend that money more effectively - we keep this money for more than three years and then overspend it."
"I want to be proud of what we do."
"I want the world to recognise that we make a substantial contribution."
"I want our development assistance programme to be the best in the world."
"We have a long way to go before we achieve that."
"Mr President, I should like to expressly thank you for pointing out that the rapporteur' s speaking time must not be used to express personal opinions - let alone in such a sharp way that is almost defamatory!"
"I should like to protest that I as an MP, which is what I am - I shall be speaking on behalf of my group later - get what amounts to a ban on speaking for expressing an opinion on the subject that I have never concealed."
"I also have the right to sign for the group amendments that my group supports."
"Please also note that a rapporteur also has to maintain a certain neutrality and represent the opinion of the committee."
"I am speaking here as a Member of Parliament and not as the chair, and I have not signed anywhere as chair."
"I must ask that these be kept separate and that the work not be confused in this way."
"We actually have quite a good climate in the committee."
"I am rather shaken by the way things are proceeding here this evening!"
"Mr President, perhaps I can change the prevailing mood and introduce a positive note."
"I should like to start by thanking everyone who helped to draft this important report."
"It was a stubborn, time-consuming and difficult report due to its sheer size and the number of specialist topics which it covers."
"The report which results from the amendments to be voted on tomorrow will, I think, represent a balanced compromise between numerous views and a considerable improvement on the original proposal."
"First, it includes the basic priorities put forward by the European Parliament and, secondly, it includes many of the comments and proposals made by the Court of Auditors."
"At the same time, it endorses the need for the European Commission to be flexible in implementing the budget, especially given its new activity-based presentation."
"It proposes ways of improving expenditure commitments, useful and necessary addenda, simplifications designed to make the provisions of the new regulation clear and transparent and, finally, it strengthens the responsibility of financial agents without touching their independence or autonomy."
"I think the proposed addenda are a step in the right direction and will certainly help to enhance the efficiency of the financial provisions, not that other improvements are not needed."
"I do not want to expound on this further but, before closing my speech, I too should like to highlight an unfortunate inconsistency."
"I refer to the fact that, although the European Parliament is one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, when it comes to the financial regulation, it does not, unfortunately, have the same degree of responsibility, which is basically limited to consultation with the Council."
"I think that it is our duty to insist on a proper dialogue on mutual terms and on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council within the conciliation procedure."
"That is why I too agree that Parliament should only vote on the amendments tomorrow."
"Mr President, recasting the Financial Regulation is a necessarily ponderous process."
"This regulation is not just a budgetary framework but is also a framework for the provision and financial supervision of accounts and for the duties and responsibilities of the main budgetary players."
"All of these issues were addressed in the same article of the Treaty, which stipulates the same procedures for all of them, but this does not mean that they should necessarily be dealt with in the same regulatory texts."
"The fact that their approval requires unanimity in the Council makes changing them even more difficult."
"Perhaps these reasons explain why this process has been dragging on since July 1996, when the Commission presented its first proposal for recasting the Financial Regulation. All the signs indicate that we are still to see a further stage added."
"The concern to give fresh coherence to a text that has become a tangle of loosely defined rules and provisions therefore appears, of course, to be the most important one in the current round of redrafting."
"It is neither possible nor desirable, in this round of budgetary framing, to forget the relevant sectoral regulation, which concerns agricultural expenditure, the Structural Funds, research and development and external actions. Nor should we forget the important Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline."
"In this field, because it is neither politically nor legally acceptable to bulldoze existing regulations and agreements by adopting provisions that run counter to the Financial Regulation, we must reduce the specific rules in the sectoral regulations to the absolute minimum. We also need these to be properly linked with those of the Financial Regulation."
"Furthermore, we need to make the Interinstitutional Agreement compatible and bring it into line with the Financial Regulation and consider the need to include the Financial Regulation in any future revision of this agreement."
"The second major issue concerns the Community budget system, organised into authorisations and payments, and the timeframes needed to implement them."
"The current system demonstrates weaknesses and problems with which we are all familiar, but there is no guarantee that the innovations proposed by the Commission - and even less those suggested by other institutions - will do anything to improve the situation."
"This is an issue on which a more thorough discussion is needed, based on a full and rigorous study of the workings of the current system."
"We hope that the Commission will devote the necessary attention to this in its future proposals."
"Another extremely important point concerns delays in payments."
"Recently, the European institutions approved, at the proposal of the Commission, a directive that imposes harsh penalties on both public and private authorities that do not comply with the maximum payment delay of thirty days."
"How can the European institutions then seek to exempt themselves from the rules that they have approved for all of the Union' s other institutions, be they public or private?"
"In this regard, I wish to point out that the Commission communication on this matter is far from satisfactory."
"Only a commitment by the Commission to lead by example in applying to itself the rules that it is proposing for others would be acceptable."
"By the same token, we Socialists consider it to be a point of honour that this Parliament' s political groups fully comply with all of the procedures that we approve in this Chamber for the Community expenditure of other institutions."
"We shall pay very close attention to the way in which each group approaches this matter in tomorrow' s vote."
"Lastly, I must comment on the Council' s failure to reply to our repeated invitations to discuss the amendments to the Financial Regulation."
"It would be both absurd and unacceptable for the European Parliament, which is ultimately responsible for discharging the budget, to lose any power to act as a result of the rules governing this regulation."
"In these circumstances, all we can do is postpone delivering Parliament' s final statement on its position."
"I wish to conclude by congratulating our rapporteurs, Gianfranco Dell'Alba and Michiel van Hulten, who have produced an excellent piece of work, and we wish to see this work continue in the same climate of cooperation in which it has been undertaken until now."
"Mr President, to start with I would like to thank the rapporteur, Gianfranco Dell'Alba, for his excellent report."
"Drawing it up, analysing the proposed amendments and presenting compromises was an enormous task."
"In that respect, this report and its preparation are in a class of their own."
"At the same time I would like to thank Michiel van Hulten for excellent teamwork."
"Renewing the Financial Regulation is the most important step in modernising the administration of the Commission and the whole of the EU."
"Its most important objective is to improve the efficiency of administration, clarify personal responsibility and speed up the movement of funds."
"The EU has a poor reputation as a payer of bills as payments are made many times more slowly than would be acceptable in the world of business and when making payments in Member States."
"However, the greatest reason for reform is to clarify personal responsibility and financial accountability."
"This can only be achieved once both administrative and financial responsibility are clearly united under the same people as is now being done."
"Renewing the Financial Regulation is essential to improving the efficiency of administration."
"It opens up the opportunity to develop results-based management and activity-based budgeting."
"In this way the work of offices and bodies can be managed more on the basis of goals and results rather than on the basis of supervision and detailed instructions."
"Bureaucracy will be reduced and at the same time the bodies will be given the opportunity to improve their own working methods themselves."
"This would also increase their own responsibility for their work."
"However, achieving reform means reforming personnel regulations, which would require good cooperation with employee organisations, among others."
"However, change is absolutely essential."
"Finally, I would like to present some details that are important to my group."
"A three-year ceiling must be set for the use of funds granted, after which the funds unused would be cancelled."
"Transferring funds to the following year is an important tool in flexible budgeting policy."
"In principle we support the proposals of the rapporteur."
"Mr President, the present Financial Regulation is out of date."
"It no longer meets the requirements of modern financial management."
"The Commission has put forward a proposal for a new Financial Regulation based on the principles of decentralised responsibility and transparency."
"The two rapporteurs, Mr Dell' Alba and Mr van Hulten, have worked through the proposal in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control and tabled amendments."
"They deserve praise and recognition for this."
"However, my group finds a number of points still open."
"Firstly, the Commission' s most recent report on combating fraud in the year 2000 showed a massive increase in fraud and irregularities compared to the previous year."
"Around EUR 2 billion were lost."
"Experience shows that at best 15% to 20% of the losses can be recovered."
"In such circumstances, is there any sense in abolishing preventive ex ante checks by independent financial control?"
"We do not want a return to schematic centralised preliminary controls that took away responsibility and created a false sense of security."
"Rather, on the basis of efficient risk analyses and random checks, independent financial controllers should in future help to ensure decentrally that taxpayers' money is not spent illegally from the outset."
"Secondly: with more responsibility at all levels, it will in future be possible to hold financial actors liable for negligence or deliberate breaches of the financial regulations."
"Our motion here is designed to create a fair procedure by means of an independent body for all institutions."
"On the matter of independence: we are astonished to note that the Commission in its proposal for the new Financial Regulation has quietly deleted the independent right of action for internal auditors that is enshrined in the present Financial Regulation."
"We should like to restore this again through a motion."
"The final point: the Advisory Committee on Procurements and Contracts."
"This is the advisory body that must be consulted before contracts are awarded."
"At the last session in Strasbourg, this House resolved to reform this procedure."
"I think we will lose credibility if we now call for the body to be abolished 14 days later."
"Mr President, I too have read the report recently published by the European Commission on the fight against fraud."
"EUR two billion in tax money disappeared in the year 2000 as a result of fraud and irregularities."
"That is an extremely worrying phenomenon."
"Europe has a bad reputation as it is in this area, and we need to pull out all the stops to fight this phenomenon."
"This evening, we are discussing the review of the Financial Regulation."
"Against this backdrop, I should like to make a few observations."
"It will not come as a surprise to you that I too advocate effective and modern control."
"The Commission and rapporteurs want to abandon centralised, independent ex ante control."
"That must be replaced by decentralised ex post control."
"We debated this very issue at an earlier occasion."
"I then noted that I welcomed the introduction of an independent ex post audit, but that that should not be at the expense of the opportunity of independent ex ante control."
"If we are to introduce this across the board, I fear that we will turn this fine dream into a nightmare."
"I am in favour of a system in which independent ex post audits are the rule."
"The option of independent ex ante control must continue to exist."
"I can think of many situations in which a systematic or random ex ante control is necessary in the event of proven irregularities."
"If we remove this option from the Financial Regulation, we will surrender an important weapon in the fight against fraud, and that would be irresponsible at a time when we have not gained any experience of decentralised ex post control."
"I would therefore call on my fellow MEPs to support our amendments in this connection, so as to avoid the abolition of ex ante control."
"Thank you, Mr President, for your reactions and your keen-sighted ability to notice that I am present in the House."
"I would like to remind the illustrious rapporteur, Mr Dell'Alba, that above and beyond differences of opinion, which are always legitimate, there must be parliamentary courtesy and the individual right of Members to carry out their work, which includes the presentation of amendments should they deem it necessary."
"In any event, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we should be pleased, firstly because we are dealing with the first broad legislative proposal on the financial regulation of the Union, which runs in partnership with the administrative reform of management and human resources procedures and which must be the undeniable political objectives of Parliament and the Commission."
"It was decided - correctly, in my view - not to correct the defects in the legislative framework employed until now and, instead, to implement a new administrative culture on control and spending efficiency in the quest for the common objective of the better and more transparent management of public money."
"The rules on decision-making in this field, however, show very little political logic."
"We should therefore be pleased with the strategy which the rapporteur is suggesting: to vote for amendments which reflect good work and a good departure point for the discussion of the more delicate aspects of the proposal, and to force the Council to take account of the opinion of the European Parliament when the Commission presents its amended proposal."
"During the desirable and possible interinstitutional dialogue, we must try to negotiate a financial regulation which is intended to be permanent, which substantially takes account of this Parliament' s often repeated priorities in this field."
"In order to achieve this permanence there are some very controversial aspects, such as the removal of ex ante control, which may distract us from other deficiencies with broader repercussions."
"I am referring to the regulation of the public markets and to subsidies."
"The current situation is not only bad, but chaotic."
"Throughout these recent years, we have not been able to harmonise the multi-coloured situation of public contracts."
"With regard to the information which Parliament requires for the purposes of the discharge of the budget - and I would ask you to be benevolent, Mr President - I believe that the Commission' s position is coherent insofar as it respects the basic elements of the framework Interinstitutional Agreement on the application of Article 206 of the Treaty."
"I believe that in this field we can and must agree a text based on a consensus in the future, safeguarding the principles which are essential to this Parliament, such as human rights, fundamental freedoms and non-interference in sub judice procedures."
"Mr President, for an organisation with an expenditure in excess of EUR 92 billion the Financial Regulation is almost the most important legal basis for ensuring careful use of European money and preventing abuse so far as possible."
"It is more necessary than ever to stress this aspect because the Commission itself informed us two weeks ago that the sum of money lost as a result of fraud and irregularities in the year 2000 amounts to an impressive EUR 2028 million."
"That really is nothing for Europe to be proud of!"
"Remedial action is more than necessary."
"The only question is how the Commission proposes to rectify the situation."
"As part of its reform programme it wants to abolish the independent financial controller, the very institution that experience shows to have been the most successful in combating fraud - I only have to mention the Fléchard case."
"That is like the police ordering all guard dogs to be put down after the number of burglaries in a residential area has doubled."
"Parliament has argued for decentralised independent financial control, in fact it has voted for it several times, most recently on 4 April 2001 in the preliminary report for discharge for 1998."
"The financial controller is also anchored in the Treaty."
"An internal auditor is not a financial controller in new clothing but a dummy package that for my group at any rate is unacceptable."
"A necessary counterpart to independent financial control is the clear assignment of responsibility, of liability for deliberate contraventions or neglect of duty by officials such as is, incidentally, found in the national laws of all the Fifteen."
"It seems to me that the Commission' s reform efforts will in this instance result in financial responsibility being passed to and fro like in a marshalling yard until in the end nobody knows what track it is on."
"The Financial Regulation should make for clarity, transparency and comprehensibility in the implementation of the budget."
"That is the only way we shall get the citizens to accept it!"
"Mr President, as the Council is present today, I wonder if you would like to ask the President-in-Office to comment on the observations made by Members."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for creating a quadrilogue for us."
"Rule 121(5) of the Rules of Procedure allows the Council to be heard if it so wishes."
"Do you wish to be heard?"
"You have the floor."
". (SV) Mr President, it is an unexpected but welcome honour to be able to speak to you here this evening."
"I have been listening very carefully to what has been said."
"Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the substance of the views put forward, as the Council has not yet adopted a position."
"This will happen at the ECOFIN meeting next week."
"I am completely convinced that as soon as Parliament has made its decision, the Council will look at it very carefully."
"Despite being unable to comment on the substance, I would venture to refer to what the Council said earlier, namely that we are extremely keen for a decision on the new Financial Regulation to be made as quickly as possible."
"Hopefully, Parliament will be able to make a decision tomorrow, so that the Commission can proceed with revising the proposal."
"In this case, we would be able to present it in September and hopefully achieve a decision on the Final Regulation as quickly as possible."
"I have, of course, also noted what Mrs Schreyer said about her bringing the issue up at the ECOFIN meeting and I look forward to this discussion."
"Thank you."
"Mr Dell'Alba has asked to speak."
"At this stage of the debate it can only be on a point of order."
"Mr President, it is 11.20."
"I just wanted to clarify something for Mrs Schreyer."
"I would like to thank her for what she has told us, and for her criticism of our report, which also goes a little way towards substantiating why we want to keep this strategy."
"When you spoke of negative expenditure and negative revenue, you criticised our proposal by saying that our amendments were going to create a sort of generalised revenue, but I think that you are mistaken."
"What we wanted was for this idea of allocated revenue to include the old principle of budgetary unit and a compensation mechanism which would stop us from overshooting the financial perspectives."
"As for the Council, I would like to thank it."
"I am sorry if, at the beginning of this point, it is a point of order, I said that the Council was not there, because it was not represented at ministerial level."
"That you intervened is a first."
"Allow me to say that Mr van Hulten, who is watching what I say, has already clarified what our idea is and you said you would wait for our opinion tomorrow, which is precisely what we are not going to do; we are going to wait for the Council to make a move, as the Commissioner said, and we shall give our opinion after that. This is the only way of dealing with the Council - through the procedure which we intend to follow tomorrow."
"Mr President, the Council is often asked to intervene during debates in Parliament."
"It rarely does so and I would like to thank the Council for intervening on this occasion."
"I withdraw my comment about the arrogance of the Council and I hope that this is the beginning of a fruitful discussion."
"Thank you, Mr van Hulten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Compulsory safety belts"
"The next item is the report (A5-0141/2001) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/671/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes (COM(2000) 815 - C5-0684/2000 - 2000/0315(COD))."
". (SV) Mr President, at this very late hour I, as rapporteur, would like to say a few words about the report."
"Firstly, I would like to thank all my colleagues for such excellent teamwork on the committee."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for an excellent proposal for a directive regarding safety belts and child restraint systems in vehicles."
"This is an important issue."
"I would like once again to repeat that a very large number of people die in road traffic accidents in EU Member States."
"We are talking about around 42,000 people a year."
"We would never accept such a high death rate in any other form of transport, so we must act."
"One such action is the proposal now being tabled by the Commission."
"We must also remember that children are at great risk on the roads."
"The most common cause of death among children and young people is traffic accidents."
"The question is whether the EU should legislate on safety belts and child safety in cars."
"My answer is yes."
"I think it is very important."
"Firstly, it has a legal basis in the Treaty of Rome."
"Secondly there is already legislation, a directive, which must now be strengthened, due to a need for such action."
"We know that safety belts save lives."
"This is particularly the case regarding children."
"Accident research shows that the risk of serious injury is seven times higher for children who do not use a restraint system than for children who do use such a system."
"There is therefore a need for such a system."
"In addition, traffic in Europe today is, to a very large extent, transboundary."
"People travel in private cars, but also in commercial vehicles."
"Private and commercial motoring is increasing across borders, as we have seen in a report today."
"We also have rapidly increasing numbers of tourists, which creates a need for common regulations with regard to fundamental safety measures on our roads."
"It is therefore important that we have a high level of safety in all EU countries, so that we know what regulations apply to private drivers or occupational drivers, and also to car manufacturers."
"It is important for them to have common safety requirements so that the regulations are clear."
"At the same time, it is also important to consumers that safety systems become cheaper, which will be the case if the regulations are common throughout the EU."
"The Commission' s proposal is a strengthening of a previous directive, which states that all passengers in a vehicle equipped with safety belts must use them, that all children must, without exception, be restrained in approved child car seats, that children under three may not travel in cars without suitable child car seats, with the exception of taxis, and that the use of rear-facing child car seats is forbidden if the air bag has not been de-activated."
"All these are good proposals."
"The committee agrees that these should also be put forward as Parliament' s proposals."
"However, we propose six amendments."
"Briefly, the first amendment is that the Commission, along with the Member States and road safety organisations, should promote an information campaign."
"Our second amendment is that the height of the child should determine when a child can use an adult seat belt."
"In Amendment 4, we want manufacturers to state which child car seats fit which car models."
"We also propose that rural buses used in city traffic - not particularly common, but it happens - should not be covered by the requirement for compulsory use."
"We also want the Commission, in partnership with the automotive industry, to develop safer and more user-friendly systems for air bags."
"In addition, a report on this should be incorporated into the report to be presented no later than 1 August 2004 on the implementation of the directive."
"The Council will discuss the Commission' s proposals at the Transport Council at the end of June."
"I look forward to our being able to reach a common decision in the EU and to our being able to implement this vital measure which is fundamental to road safety in the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people die on our roads in Europe every year."
"As MEPs we therefore have a great responsibility to work for greater safety on the roads."
"We also know, however, that traffic is increasing from year to year and one of the consequences of this is that it becomes a greater source of danger."
"In my opinion, the question of the compulsory wearing of safety belts has a crucial part to play."
"In general, I am very much in agreement with the Commission' s proposal for improving the safety of drivers and passengers."
"I also agree in principle that it should be compulsory for safety belts to be fastened at all times in all seats that are fitted with them or with the basic requirement that seats fitted with safety belts or child restraint systems should be used."
"I also see it as a fundamental obligation that restraint systems should be used for children under 12."
"I should like to note, however, that Member States need to be given some leeway for the national transposition of the directive on certain points."
"I am thinking of the use of restraint systems for very small children."
"I am also thinking of medical reasons and of quite specific situations such as the requirements for minibuses and coaches which the rapporteur has also mentioned."
"More details would be taking us too far here."
"Harmonisation of legislation at European level will make for transparency and clarity and improve the various national regulations."
"All in all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on this report, which I think is also a very balanced one, and I can already assure you today that my group will agree to this report."
"I should like to point out, however, that the detailed transposition of the directive must now be undertaken by the Member States and in the end it is the Member States who are responsible for safety on Europe' s roads."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the latest findings in accident research show that 50% of fatally injured vehicle occupants do not have their seatbelts fastened."
"Tremendous progress has been made in road traffic safety."
"I come from part of a country where there were no child seats or child restraint systems at all ten years ago and retractable seat belts were a luxury."
"Then in 1991 I had the opportunity of being involved with devising the compulsory seat belt directive."
"Today we are already talking about the need to adapt that directive to scientific and technical progress."
"The wide-ranging findings of accident research and the modern safety restraint systems developed by the industry make the present-day situation unacceptable."
"It is irresponsible to allow children under three years of age to be carried on the back seats of cars without anything to hold them or in child seats on the passenger seat without switching off the airbag."
"It must no longer be permissible for larger children to be secured using the belt intended for adults."
"Exceptions from the general compulsory safety belt rule for lorry drivers, for example, must in future also be things of the past."
"The proposal embodied in six amendments tabled by the European Parliament to amend the directive in question will, among other things, make for technically safer solutions and above all ones that are easier for the consumer to use."
"The latter point in particular makes it more likely that the restraint systems fitted will actually be used."
"More than 50% of children still travel without using a seat belt, even where restraints are present in the vehicle."
"Parents seem to be unaware that the risk of their children suffering a serious or even fatal injury as a result of an accident is seven times greater if they are not wearing a seat belt."
"Development work is continuing."
"Present-day child restraint systems are evaluated on the basis of frontal crash test results and almost always get good marks."
"However, 70% of all fatal accidents involving children in cars are the result of side crashes."
"That is where these systems fail."
"I recommend acceptance of the amendments before us today for adapting the directive."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Hedkvist Petersen very sincerely on the report she has presented."
"It demonstrates her personal sensitivity, and that of the whole committee, to an issue as important as road safety, in an attempt to reduce this unacceptable figure of 42 000 deaths per year, which is the number of people killed as a result of traffic accidents in the European Union. As she says in her report, this figure is too high."
"In December 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal making the use of safety belts provided for that purpose compulsory for all road-vehicle users and, in the case of small children, child restraint systems in cars. I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that if you visit any retailer you will see that practically all child restraint systems currently on the market already comply with the legislation in force."
"The proposed directive therefore eliminates the exceptions which appeared in the original directive, since they were conceived of in different circumstances and allowed the use of adult safety belts in the absence of a child restraint system."
"We now believe that to be unnecessary."
"The proposed directive, as well as protecting children in cars, will help to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries resulting from accidents in coaches, minibuses and lorries, by making the use of safety belts compulsory for drivers and passengers when those safety belts are supplied."
"The correct use of safety belts and child restraint systems is one of the most important measures being proposed by the Commission in the field of road safety."
"Both you in Parliament and the Council have supported this proposal by firmly backing the Commission' s working programme on road safety priorities in the Union, which include reporting on, detailing and classifying the measures to be adopted, making the use of safety belts and child restraint systems one of the fundamental priorities for road safety."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will now refer to specific amendments."
"Only one, Amendment No 4, is unacceptable to the Commission."
"Our reason for not accepting it is that it would require manufacturers of vehicles to indicate which child restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles and can be easily installed in them."
"While the Commission acknowledges that there have been problems with installing some systems in certain vehicles, the fact is that the amendment would breach the rules on the internal market and establishment as well as the directive proposed in the latest international standard on child restraint systems."
"Nevertheless, non-legislative measures are being adopted, particularly by means of the Euro-NCAP programme, with which, as you know, car manufactures are associated, to persuade those manufacturers to indicate which restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles."
"I imagine that this initiative will reduce the problem, together with the fact that the restraint systems governed by Regulation 44/03 are easier to install and safer than the systems previously available."
"Lastly, there are two amendments which would force the Commission to adopt measures which it has already planned to take."
"One is Amendment No 1, which would oblige the Commission to launch an awareness-raising campaign in parallel with the implementation of the directive."
"Amendment No 6(2), according to which the Commission should, in conjunction with the car industry, study the possibilities of using more user-friendly airbags, especially where rear-facing restraint systems are being used."
"The Commission would suggest that these two amendments do not appear in the legislative text, but that they be included in the preamble, since we accept that they are of interest and importance for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have summed up the Commission' s position in relation to the report."
"I repeat that, with the exception of Amendment No 4, which we must reject, we accept all the others, bearing in mind the comments I have made on Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 6(2), which instead of appearing in the legislative articles, would simply appear in the preamble to the final text."
"Thank you very much. It only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, once again, and also Mrs Schierhuber, for her speech, and to express my agreement with her."
"We will now have to see how the different Member States apply the legislation we are approving here."
"Precisely for this reason, and not only on this specific issue, but taking account of all the requirements of road safety, we are going to make a proposal on which we are working with Commissioner Vitorino to try to harmonise the effective application by the different Member States of the controls and also the penalties in this field."
"Parliament thanks the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Equal treatment for men and women"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0173/2001) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions [COM(2000) 334 - C5-0369/2000 - 2000/0142(COD)]"
"Mr President, the European Union already has a quarter of a century of legislative tradition which obliges it to take equality between women and men in working life seriously."
"The directive under discussion today took on its original form as early as 1976."
"We can state that in over a quarter of a century our societies have developed considerably in many respects and it is time to revise our view of equality between women and men at work to meet the requirements of today."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam also obliges us to do so, as it lays down that equality between women and men must be broadly taken into account in all the work of the Community."
"We are now facing entirely new challenges which we must tackle through legislation."
"In this directive the European Union presents for the first time actions binding on Member States to prevent sexual harassment which is prevalent in the workplace."
"In this respect, I can also state that research shows that one in two women in the European Union has suffered sexual harassment at work."
"It is quite clear that from time to time this can also affect men; men can also be the victims of sexual harassment but as a rule, however, still today the victims are mainly women."
"In this respect, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities suggests that we go a little further than the Commission originally intended."
"The Committee would like the Member States to start preventive work to prevent sexual harassment and for employers to be obliged to create working conditions in which sexual harassment is unlikely."
"I have also emphasised the fact that this may improve the position of the employer, since if employers can show that they have initiated such preventive work, they will surely be in a stronger position should conflict arise."
"Maternity protection also needs strengthening."
"I myself am from Finland and it is often thought that Finland is a model country in terms of equal opportunities."
"However, I can say that in our country too women around the age of thirty, for example, are having abortions more often than should be the case."
"Research carried out into the reasons behind this found that this may be due to there being so much competition in the workplace."
"Employers discriminate against women who are at an age where they are likely to have children."
"We would like to put a stop to this once and for all."
"This is sexual discrimination, which is banned."
"This directive also gives the victims of sexual discrimination stronger legal protection and also requires that victims of sexual discrimination are still able to take legal action even once a working relationship has been terminated."
"Here they can receive support from an independent body, which this directive requires be set up."
"I am sure that such independent bodies for equal opportunities already exist in most Member States but I would like to emphasise the importance of this issue when considering candidate countries."
"In another context the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has focused considerable attention on the fact that issues concerning equality between women and men in candidate countries have not been as strongly emphasised in accession negotiations as they should have been."
"This can also be strengthened by creating sufficient institutions whose task, according to the law, is to ensure that equality is achieved and even promoted."
"I would like to emphasise that social development has brought with it new types of equality issues."
"There was a great deal of discussion within the Committee on whether young men and fathers need stronger protection against sexual discrimination."
"I believe that we have reached a good compromise in including fathers and their rights in this directive."
"In my opinion, this is highly appropriate at a time when the equal opportunities discussion has largely moved towards looking at how men can take part in realising their family responsibilities."
"In this way, we will be able to head towards real equality."
"Mr President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs felt that, despite the progress that has been made in legislation, discrimination remains in pay and the labour market is still segmented, with salaries remaining low in the traditional sectors and tending to persist in services and in the so-called 'new economy' . Forty per cent of the growth in women' s employment is due to part-time and independent work, which receives minimal wages."
"Although this is an alternative to unemployment and may help reconcile work and family life, it nevertheless creates a new form of discrimination, which is not sufficiently described by the statistics. One example of this is the recruitment of over-qualified people for less high-powered jobs."
"The Structural Funds must provide an incentive to the social partners to adopt agreements on equality."
"The Lisbon Council decisions, the broad employment guidelines for 2001, the Social Agenda and the new provisions of the Treaty all define the importance of increasing employment amongst women, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, not simply to comply with a law, but mainly for the sake of economic balance and to ensure that pensions are sustainable."
"What is important is to get the overall picture correct, even if we achieve this in a roundabout way."
"The texts submitted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs propose new formulae for the concepts of positive action, of indirect discrimination, which victimises one or more individuals and of harassment as a phenomenon of domination and humiliation with or without direct sexual abuse."
"I would put it like this: we are opting for an approach that we consider to be more wide-ranging and more appropriate."
"The members of this committee were unanimous in extending protection for maternity and paternity leave, for adoption and during pregnancy and, once again, we recommend, as Parliament has done, that Directive 92/85/EC be revised."
"The right to return to work laid down in Directive 76/207/EEC - and on this point we disagree with Mrs Hautala' s report - must enable women, in order to protect their job following maternity leave, to take up an equivalent position in the event that their job changes or becomes defunct."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her thorough work and for her willingness to take into account all the contributions and suggestions that all the political groups made on such a delicate matter."
"The last speech showed how intense the discussion within the Committee on Women' s Rights was, because it is quite true that the 1976 directive played a remarkable role, but 25 years have passed and both social behaviour and the role of women have changed."
"Behind us we have numerous decisions of the Court of Justice but, most importantly, we have the Treaty of Amsterdam which, from the legal standpoint, gives us the opportunity to consolidate and make more effective the legal instruments which, as we are quite aware, are instruments, but vital instruments for implementing active policies and for putting the principle of equal opportunities into practice, even as regards access to employment."
"The temptation to try to use this amendment to the directive to tackle many of the problems facing women has been great - in this respect Mrs Lulling is right - but I believe that the result of our labours is, from a legal standpoint, absolutely consistent with the proposals and objectives of the draft amendment that the Commission presented to us."
"I believe the definitions of 'direct discrimination' and 'indirect discrimination' which we have taken from the Commission proposal and improved upon are such as to make the use of this instrument clear at a legal level."
"The inclusion of harassment and sexual harassment as elements of discrimination is, without a shadow of a doubt, equally clear, as is also the clarification that the right to maternity, like the right to paternity, cannot be used as an instrument for enforcing discrimination."
"The possibility of putting into practice positive actions like, indeed, the possibility given to us by Article 141(4) of the Treaty, is, I believe, an equally clear instrument, so that the directive - which I hope will be operational by the end of this year and will be an instrument at the service of all the Member States, all women, all organisations - may truly become one more instrument added to those that the European Union has for all these years placed at the service of so many Member States."
"Somebody raised the point that the European Union might interfere more than it should do under the principle of subsidiarity."
"Well, in my opinion, not even this could ever be used as an excuse by anybody, because the legal instruments that can be adopted are specified here and in some cases there are obligations associated with them and in others opportunities, depending on the laws of the Member States."
"But I believe and hope that, today, the House will, by a large majority, approve Mrs Hautala' s proposal, which has the consensus of the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Women' s Rights, because I feel that this, too, will be a step forwards in making one of the basic principles of our Community - the principle of equal opportunities - become a reality."
"Mr President, I should like to add my voice to the congratulations being offered to Mrs Heidi Hautala: she has sought compromises, she has come halfway to meet our various concerns."
"Consequently, I hope that her efforts will be rewarded at eleven o' clock, since a report in which so much hard work has been invested and about which there should be a large measure of agreement, must be assured of a sizeable majority in this Parliament."
"You can count on my group at any rate."
"When people ask me what the value added of Europe is, it is always very easy simply to give the examples of what Europe has done to promote equal rights for men and women."
"A great deal has already changed, including in my own country, the Netherlands."
"We sometimes think that we are in the vanguard, but the truth is far from that and a great deal still needs to change."
"This revision is very important in that respect and accordingly I am glad that this is now going ahead in Europe."
"Mr President, sexual harassment at work must be outlawed."
"It is terribly difficult to combat."
"Victims feel they are alone."
"It really is a major step forward that this will now be regarded as discrimination, because that allows us to deal with the problem better."
"But of course the saying ""prevention is better than cure"" applies here too."
"And if companies are now obliged to take preventive measures, that simply means that this problem, if things go well, will be banished."
"Motherhood will be better protected by this legislation, since it is unfortunately still the case that with applications or career decisions, employers still weigh up whether they will be ""losing"" a woman for a time, because that is how they still see it, to maternity leave."
"The only way of ensuring that such weighing up no longer takes place and that that form of discrimination disappears is to ensure a much better distribution of care responsibilities between men and women."
"That is also the reason why our group feels it is important that paternity leave can be claimed by men, and that if that option does not exist, this is simply another case of discrimination."
"Hence our amendment."
"I must say that I was surprised that Christian Democrats in the women' s committee tried to remove it."
"My understanding was that there is now a pact on the matter."
"I hope that this is indeed the case, and that at eleven o' clock it will prove so and that at eleven o' clock we shall all be here and we will be able to give a very clear signal that fathers should be entitled to leave too."
"In conclusion, Mr President, a few words about the exemplary role that European institutions could play in this."
"I mean the intended amendment of the terms of employment of employees of institutions like, for example this Parliament, and also the Commission."
"If we look at opportunities for maternity leave in the European institutions, we see that the situation is depressing."
"I hope that the Commissioner will be able to point out to her colleagues that they have an important function in showing that we, at any rate, do things in a certain way in these institutions and can use this to give an important signal to Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the eleventh annual report on the Structural Funds, which for the first time examines Community measures in favour of equality between men and women, indicates that although the active participation of women in the labour market has been continuously increasing in the last three decades, there are still considerable differences between the two sexes."
"In almost all the Member States, unemployment rates are higher for women than for men."
"The difference in employment rates between the sexes is an average of around 20% in the Member States."
"Employment among women decreases according to the number of children that they have."
"Women do the majority of non-paid work in the home, including caring for children and other dependants."
"Even in countries that have high employment rates, women are over represented in part-time jobs, in many cases not out of choice."
"Moreover, the differences in salary between men and women are still considerable: 28% for medium term at Community level."
"In short, it says that here in Europe, the champion of human rights, women do not have the same rights in practice as men, they are still less represented in public institutions and in decision-making positions in private entities, and they are still the prime victims of ill treatment within couples and of sexual violence."
"I am convinced that women cannot be truly free and equal to men until they have the same opportunities to get a job, are paid the same salary and gain true financial independence."
"Once the day comes when these objectives have been achieved, the other inequalities will also have disappeared."
"It is true that the Lisbon European Council has stated an objective of increasing the Community average rate of employment among women from the current level of 51% to above 60% by 2010."
"But when I think that, for example, in Spain the level of women in employment currently scarcely reaches 35%, I think that it is not going to be 10 but 20 years before we can talk about real equality between the sexes, especially if the shortages of jobs in general continue to be so great."
"Perhaps it is time that we took ourselves more seriously, for example, the proposals from Orio Giarini and Patrick Liedtke, and their Report to the Club of Rome, entitled ""The employment dilemma: the future of employment"" -where they advocate the division of the working day, or the proposals of Peter Hall that focus taxation on business consumption and remove the burdens from the cost of labour factor."
"The challenge of equality is above all the challenge of employment."
"I therefore welcome the initiative to modify Directive 76/207/EEC, from 25 years ago, on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women."
"I also congratulate Mrs Hautala, chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on her excellent report."
"Mr President, I would also like to give my support for all the praise of Mrs Hautala, who has worked very hard on this matter."
"I imagine it has not been easy, as rapporteur, to reconcile all views, although the majority of people taking part in the work were women."
"I would like to point out that reality is often ahead of legislation."
"I would also like to emphasise that legislation is often not sufficient, but must be supplemented once we have a law."
"I would therefore highlight the need for plans regarding equal opportunities and for employer responsibility in a modern society."
"Mrs Ghilardotti said that women' s role has changed in the last 25 years, but so has that of men and consequently also working life."
"I believe the last remaining bastions will soon be employers and their organisations."
"We have talked a great deal about sexual harassment."
"This concept is difficult to define, but Swedish lawyers are currently trying to come up with a definition of undesirable, unwelcome behaviour in the workplace by one person towards another."
"It is exciting to define phenomena which, though they are old, are only now being highlighted."
"We have also talked about paternity leave."
"I would like to point out that one does not choose to be a parent - a parent is something you are once you have become one."
"When employing new staff, employers ask applicants whether they will become or plan to become parents."
"Working life is part of life, not all of it."
"This is true for both women and men, as well as for children."
"I hope that the vast majority will back Mrs Hautala' s proposal."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members of the Bonino List, I announce that we will not be supporting the Hautala report, not, of course, because we are against the principles expounded and the objectives to be attained but because we believe that, increasingly often in the European Institutions, the wrong methods are used to attain fair, acceptable aims and objectives."
"It is often done in a bureaucratic way, always in an attempt to draw up a law, a directive or a new imposition."
"The 1976 directive played a fundamental role - and I do not want to dwell on this - but the attempt being made today with this report, with this directive, to enhance the implementation of equal opportunities through legal instruments may, I feel, take us down the wrong road, where the benefits run the risk of being more than counterbalanced by the harm done."
"The reversal of the burden of proof, for instance, goes against the liberal principles of the rule of law for the sake of the cause to be attained."
"The legitimisation of positive actions, for instance, must be tied to an assessment of their duration and of proportionality."
"The creation of independent national bodies - this is true in this case but, in my view, it is true in all other cases too - that deal with pre- or para-judicial tasks, would incomprehensibly duplicate traditional means of judicial redress."
"With regard to access to the labour market, then, I believe that, first of all (this is true for the Italian situation) some measures must be considered that are wholly conventional - flexibility of the labour market, reviews of social spending, wholly absorbed, for example, by social security spending - measures that would address, and to a great extent are already addressing the issue of equal opportunities in the labour market, but without any need for new laws or new bureaucracies."
"Mr President, Mrs Hautala, no one can be against equality between men and women."
"However, it is essential that we should know what we are talking about, because it is very difficult to form a clear opinion on your report, since it contains so many statements that are vague, contradictory, or even absurd, like Amendment No 69, according to which it would be better to talk about 'parental leave' for mothers or fathers."
"How can we dare talk about equality if we tolerate exceptions such as Amendment No 10 or Amendment No 24?"
"When we talk about equality, we are recognising the equal dignity of every human being, whether man or woman."
"When we talk about equality, we are recognising the special nature of men and women in the organisation of society."
"This special nature leads to a complementary relationship between men and women, rather than rivalry."
"I can only express my astonishment that this report, at the committee stage, was voted for by women only."
"So much for equality!"
"I should also like to congratulate the men who have had the courage to stand up and speak this morning."
"I am also amazed that Amendment No 40 gives associations the right to go to court without making it compulsory to have the consent of the victim in a case of discrimination."
"Who are these associations?"
"Surely it is the role of the state to see that the law is applied, and that it is not distorted?"
"What exactly are we envisaging for the future?"
"We must break away from this dialectic which promised us women' s liberation but did not propose anything other than competition with our male partners so that we become superwomen."
"We are not clones of men, we are not merely cogs in the production system."
"We cannot separate women' s rights from the recognition of woman' s special nature."
"Our society is aspiring towards a new feminism."
"We are women, wives and mothers."
"As women, we want to develop according to our own model, our sensitivity, our intuition and our intelligence."
"Man can never be the sole reference for the development of the human being."
"As wives, the complementary role of men and women implies the need for cooperation in professional life, in social life and in family life."
"As mothers, we hold the future of humanity in our hands, and you are right, Mrs Hautala, when you stress that nothing must be allowed to prevent a woman from giving the gift of life."
"So I say yes to equality between men and women, but at the same time, we must respect the special nature and the dignity of both."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have here today a proposal to amend the directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion and working conditions."
"The modifications are presented taking into account the Treaty of Amsterdam and the rulings of the Court of Justice in recent years."
"The basic idea is to adapt the directive to social reality and to take up the demands of women to solve the problems of different treatment in the workplace."
"For the first time it is considered that sexual harassment in the workplace is discrimination on the grounds of sex."
"We request preventive measures and measures to help women whose working lives and professional careers are damaged due to sexual harassment."
"It should be highlighted that the amendments introduced give support to women regarding pregnancy and maternity, guaranteeing that they can return to their jobs and benefit from any improvements that may have taken place during their absence."
"The positive action measures to balance out their representation in the different employment sectors will also be effective."
"Women, especially younger women, now have a high level of professional qualifications, but this is not reflected throughout their working lives, as in general they are in lower-qualified posts that do not enable them to fully achieve their professional expectations."
"The directive will help solve these problems, but it is the Member States, through their national legislation, which ultimately need to ensure that women can work full-time without their personal or family lives being badly affected as a result."
"Those of us who think that we need to support the family know that it is essential to start by supporting women in order to enable them to reconcile family and working life as a principle of Community legislation."
"I have to say that it has genuinely been difficult working on this proposal, but we have made an effort to highlight the points of agreement and the objectives of the directive over and above the logical differences between different political groups."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I welcome this reform of the 1996 Equal Treatment Directive and congratulate Mrs Hautala on her truly immense work to achieve a consensus in this House."
"The amendment of the directive comes at the right time now that we finally have a sound legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and it contains more detailed provisions to protect women from discrimination in their professions and in the workplace."
"In my view, this is a genuine building block and a contribution to the overall strategy of gender mainstreaming."
"With our amendments to the text proposed by the Commission, the directive's scope of application becomes broader and more specific."
"We put forward practical definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in the workplace."
"For the first time, sexual harassment in the workplace is recognised as discrimination on grounds of sex, and our amendments offer women workers various ways of defending themselves, including recourse to an independent body."
"We have also introduced a woman's right to return to her own job or an equivalent job under terms and conditions which are not less favourable to her after maternity leave."
"We are again tabling an amendment to protect fathers who apply for parental leave as well."
"They are still few in number."
"Europe-wide, just 2% of fathers claim this right, and these progressive fathers must not be excluded from our efforts."
"I hope that this proposed amendment will be widely supported by this House."
"In my view, this too is an essential building block for the gender mainstreaming process."
"We Social Democrats want to break open old and entrenched structures and ensure that role stereotypes are no longer perpetuated."
"The directive imposes an obligation on Member States to take action against discrimination. It is thus a move away from voluntary, non-binding provisions."
"I think that this too will encourage debate about this particular issue in Germany."
"The text also calls for the extension of the Equal Treatment Directive to the private sector."
"After the cases which we have witnessed, I hope that together, we can now finally make progress for women."
"Mr President, in Nordic fashion I am not one to offer undeserved praise, but this time I am happy to read a progressive report with the exact ingredients mentioned by Mrs Gröner, i.e. the rights of young men and women to return to working life after parental leave."
"I think this is excellent."
"One of the key issues is the new regulations on discrimination against women, namely the right to return to work after parental leave."
"According to the proposal, an employee or public sector worker is entitled to have their old job back after parental leave, or an equivalent job on terms which are at least as good."
"At the same time, any conduct which treats a woman unfairly and which is linked directly or indirectly to pregnancy, motherhood or reconciling family and working life should be forbidden and should constitute direct discrimination."
"I have an example from the municipality of Oravais, where I spend the summer. Here, a permanent employee was forced to resign so that the employment of the person standing in for them could be terminated."
"Is this not forbidden, as it is a case of direct discrimination and also a breach of the provision concerning the right to return to work?"
"The conduct of this municipality is certainly a breach of the future provisions."
"The example shows the need for the new directives."
"It is important that we have regulations which prevent conduct that discriminates against young women in leading positions in the private or public sectors."
"I believe this is one of the key issues, particularly considering how many young women are currently employed in temporary posts."
"The legislation would provide protection for them."
"There is one point which I hope we can consider further, namely the issue of organisations whose members belong to a particular profession."
"Where this issue is concerned, I believe we must look at the link between the two fundamental rights which we find in the legislation of many countries, namely freedom of association and the right to protection against discrimination, that is to say the right to equal opportunities."
"I am thinking, for example, of associations of female lawyers, which are close to my heart and which we must ensure we can maintain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment on the extent to which we in this House are still, even today, not entirely in agreement, which is quite a positive point."
"To answer the question from the honourable Member of the TDI Group, however, it really is a shame that he can imagine that equality between the sexes should not be subject to legislation."
"How can we achieve equality without laws?"
"I have never known that to happen throughout the entire history of the human race."
"I do not see why women should be outside the scope of legislation on equality."
"Laws are therefore necessary, and I should like to thank Mrs Hautala most warmly for the work that she has done, by herself and with us, consistently over several weeks, if not months."
"I have to say that this work has produced some important results."
"Why are they important?"
"Because in the history of Europe this directive is the most well-known of all the directives on equality between the sexes."
"It is the most well-known in all our Member States."
"It is therefore extremely important, and I believe that its revision is equally important."
"This is why I should have liked to vote in favour of the Amendment No 42 proposed by Mrs Hautala, asking the Commission to make plans for an overall legislative system on the subject of women."
"It is time that the various directives were combined, and restructured together."
"Besides, there has been a lot of talk about the Treaty of Amsterdam, but one could also mention the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 23 of which stipulates equality between the sexes in all areas, which is a major advance on equality in professional and economic spheres alone."
"However, to come back to the subject, as far as this overall approach is concerned, I was anxious that it should include a reference to equal pay, as in the 1975 Directive, and I am pleased to see that it does in fact do so, because it seems to me to be extremely important in the context of equal treatment."
"Why is this directive so important?"
"It is also important for those countries which are candidates for EU enlargement."
"We know that working conditions for women in some of the candidate countries have, if anything, become worse since the Berlin Wall came down."
"I should like, if possible, to see the revision that we are currently undertaking serve as the basis for discussions with candidate countries from the point of view of enlargement."
"However, we can also spread the word in our own Member States as well."
"In France we have just adopted a law on equality at work which falls well short of what we are proposing here today."
"I hope that our Member States will also be equal to the task that we are proposing here today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal brings some improvements."
"It enhances the protection for employees who file complaints about discrimination."
"For the first time, it defines sexual harassment in the workplace as discrimination on grounds of sex, and it recognises the special protection granted to women due to their biological condition."
"One thing is clear, and with all our good intentions we must take this into account: all the rights conferred by the directive must be open to scrutiny by the courts, and therefore the employer can also only be held to account if he was informed, for example, about incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace."
"There must be scope to include the existing agencies, such as equal opportunities officers or works councils, in the delivery of equal opportunities."
"They must be able to act within the terms of the amended directive so that there is no need to set up new bodies at substantial staffing and financial cost."
"Monitoring and building on the results achieved is important, but here too, effective record-keeping can be expanded at national level in line with the directive so that the Commission is able to draw up European statistics."
"The call for annual equal opportunities reports would impose a disproportionately heavy financial burden on small and medium-sized undertakings."
"Women who bear children enjoy special protection in law."
"In this respect, a great deal has been achieved in the Member States of the European Union over the years."
"The European directive on maternity protection contains clear provisions here."
"I do not oppose the inclusion of fathers, quite the contrary."
"However, I do oppose the sloppiness of the approach here, and the fact that maternity rights and paternity rights are treated as identical."
"There is one minor difference."
"Children are born to mothers, not fathers."
"By the very nature of things, we must therefore be able to differentiate."
"In this respect, the proposal is not very well thought out."
"We want equal treatment; we want equal opportunities in society, work and employment."
"Those are our stated goals. However, we must be very careful to achieve a balance so that women's jobs remain attractive now and in future."
"Mr President, the 1976 directive has proved a powerful weapon in combating discrimination against women in the labour market in Europe."
"Today we are dealing with the necessary revision of this directive."
"It has turned out, as others have already said, to be a complicated operation, of which the end is not yet in sight, and not everything that has crossed the table is a model of elegant legislation in this respect, but I am hopeful of a successful outcome."
"In my view the following three principles should guide us in future and consequently I have three questions to the Commissioner."
"Firstly: the legislation on sexual equality, at present scattered over eight directives, should demonstrate legal clarity and coherence and be easier for citizens to understand."
"It is doubtful whether the present revision operation will be able to contribute to this aim."
"For this reason I should like to ask the Commissioner what she thinks about a codification of existing European legislation on equal treatment of men and women."
"Secondly: European legislation on equal treatment should offer an equal level of protection, with as far as possible identical definitions of the concept of discrimination, exceptional provisions, sanctions, etc."
"Deviations from this principle should be based on the nature of the case itself, for example in relation to pregnancy, or the provisions of the Treaty, as in the case of positive measures."
"In the complicated process of legislation this principle is sometimes under pressure, but I assume that the Commissioner shares this view."
"I should therefore like to know from her what she can and is prepared to do about this."
"Could she, for example, ask her network of legal experts for a comparative study of the legislation as regards the various grounds of discrimination?"
"My third question to the Commissioner relates to the area in which the equal-treatment legislation will be applied."
"This also cries out for further equality."
"When can we expect to see legislation already announced several times by the Commissioner, on equal treatment for men and women outside the labour market, and when will she put forward legislative proposals for the various grounds of discrimination?"
"Sometimes, one may well be surprised that, in the year 2001, we are still forced to discuss equality, for who is actually against equality?"
"When you then hear certain speakers here, it is obvious that the debate is still all too necessary."
"It may well be that there is no-one who wants to speak out against the word equality, but in truth there are many people who are against the introduction of equality in practice, which is, after all, what we are attempting to do with this legislation."
"I would like to thank Mrs Hautala for the considerable work that she has put into this legislation, since this is, in fact, an example of how necessary it is to have legislation we can support, if we are to implement equality in practice."
"This is, after all, what all the judgements have shown."
"I think it is great that Mrs Hautala has been able to draw up a progressive report whilst at the same time succeeding in achieving a broad majority for it."
"That is necessary because, after all, 314 people have to vote in favour in order for the report to be adopted."
"After all, equality is one of the areas in which the EU still leads the field."
"That is something that we women should perhaps point out somewhat more in the public debate when we are discussing the EU in other contexts, and at any rate in contexts in which we face very strong opponents who believe that the EU does nothing whatsoever for its citizens."
"This is, of course, an outstanding example of the EU actually doing something for its citizens and being way ahead of the field, even compared with the Scandinavian countries."
"We can really describe it as a case of a very positive synergy effect between the Member States and the Commission."
"The proposal deals, of course, with various matters, including sexual harassment and matters related to childbirth, but also with opportunities for fathers."
"I think it is very good that we have managed to bring fathers more into focus, for if we are really to have equality then it is crucial for men also to become involved to a greater extent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, achieving genuine equality for women and men is one of the most important social and political tasks."
"Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market."
"Women still earn less than men."
"Women are under-represented in senior management."
"Throughout Europe, unemployment is higher among women than men."
"Mrs Hautala's report is an important contribution to equal opportunities."
"However, I believe that the directive should take more aspects of women's working lives into account."
"The proposed reform does not go far enough."
"For example, it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women."
"Women must have equal pay for work of equal value!"
"We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks."
"I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society."
"I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives."
"Mr President, the directive at present under discussion aims to adapt the existing 1976 directive to the social and economic developments of recent years."
"I congratulate the Commission on its initiative in adapting the legislation in this area to these developments at European level and also in giving new impetus."
"The directive must be seen in combination with the recommendation on child care, the directive on parental leave and the directive that lays down minimum conditions for the improvement of the safety and health of pregnant women at work, and with the directive that we discussed last year on the basis of Article 13 and on which we approved a report."
"Mr President, in many countries and situations women are still disadvantaged and discriminated against."
"The combination of work and care still presents problems in many cases, not only for women but also for men wishing to combine work and care."
"As yet few men, by the way, take parental leave: according to the most recent data in Denmark, for example, the figure is seven men to one hundred women, in France one to one hundred, and in Germany two to a hundred."
"I therefore welcome the amendments focusing on these measures to protect pregnancy and motherhood to be supplemented with measures relating to fatherhood."
"Mrs Van der Laan, my sentiments are shared by many other women in the Christian-Democrat group."
"Another problem, Mr President, is sexual harassment."
"This occurs more frequently than we would like in work situations."
"The report makes proposals on combating and preventing such intimidation."
"Last year I was draftsperson of my committee' s opinion on the directive on Article 13."
"This has close points of contact with the directive at present before us."
"I pointed out at that time the important role of confidants."
"That need not be a person specially assigned for the purpose - anyway, that is infeasible in smaller organisations - but someone in the organisation who enjoys wide trust and acts as a someone to whom staff can talk."
"I also argued for an independent body to deal with complaints."
"I support the amendments that would facilitate this."
"The report also has an inescapable impact for employers, for example report writing and returning to the same job."
"I believe that we can provide a good impetus and at the same time make acceptable demands on employers."
"Mr President, in my brief contribution I should like to concentrate on one important novelty in the directive and in Mrs Hautala' s excellent report, namely intimidation on the basis of sex."
"Various surveys have shown that many hundreds of thousands of employees, predominantly women, encounter this, with all the adverse consequences for their health and their career."
"I should like to remind honourable Members that for that reason three years ago the ETUC was already advocating collective negotiations in order to tackle this problem, but sadly the employers' organisation persistently refused."
"It is therefore necessary and useful that legislators should now act."
"I am therefore glad, Commissioner, that in the proposal sexual harassment is seen as a form of discrimination based on sex."
"I believe that the sanctioning approach of the European Commission is good, but perhaps insufficient."
"For that reason the European Parliament would be well advised to provide an efficient prevention policy, as was provided for at the time in the code of conduct accompanying the recommendation of 1991 on the protection of the dignity of men and women at work."
"We believe that employers too should take responsibility for ensuring that no sexual harassment occurs in the work environment."
"In Belgium Minister Onkelinx recently presented a bill, under which each company must draw up a prevention plan and appoint a prevention consultant."
"I consider that a good approach that can be safely followed in Europe."
"Accordingly I hope that this directive, in its present form, with the amendments made by our committee, can be approved under the Belgian presidency."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hautala on this report."
"Europe has a long tradition of fighting for equal rights for men and women."
"The position of women particularly was very important: equal pay for equal work, equal treatment by social security, independent rights in pensions and social security and a number of regulations relating to the combination of work and care."
"Today' s legislation sets a new milestone."
"The proposal gives a new content to the principal of discrimination, which issues from the Treaty of Amsterdam, but certainly also from the judgements of the Court of Justice, which has always been a fighter for women' s rights."
"For the first time at European level the concept of sexual harassment has been given a clear content."
"Sexual harassment is a violation of the principle of equality between men and women and also violates the dignity of men and women."
"It is better to tackle this problem now."
"With regard to the content given to the principle of discrimination I am grateful to the rapporteur that my amendment, which was intended to broaden the concept by including alongside the workplace admission to work and to a profession, as well as the training and education which lead to a position, was immediately accepted."
"I should like to express my annoyance at the fuss just made by Mrs Van der Laan."
"She devoted a part of her allotted speaking time to saying: It was my idea."
"Mrs Van der Laan, if you had paid better attention, you would have known that that idea would at any rate have obtained a majority in our group."
"So I think that in that respect voting behaviour will show that there is no great opposition."
"In conclusion, discrimination is often connected with gender."
"The only problem I still have concerns the concept of foster-parenthood, for which there is there is no legal basis."
"I wonder if we should not provide one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today we are extending the borders of equal treatment to all aspects of women' s working life, which means not only employment, but also the whole training and career cycle and working conditions."
"Insofar as equality between men and women is an objective and also a mission for the European Union, we need to adapt, update and also think up new strategies, new legislative texts that will enable us to complete this task effectively."
"The article on sexual harassment should be highlighted, and I will not expand on this point as it has already been sufficiently highlighted."
"It is also important, in my opinion, to define direct and indirect discrimination, and to establish positive action as a tool for balancing out inequalities, a transitory tool until equality is achieved."
"From the start, the European Community has aimed to eradicate unequal treatment, but unfortunately today there are still blatant inequalities in this area on which I will not expand either."
"An international organisation has said that, at the pace things are moving, we could achieve equality in four or five centuries, and I do not think that any of us here are prepared to wait such a long time."
"We need to intervene with positive measures such as this in order to change an order that is profoundly unfair and that is contrary to the development of our societies."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has done a rigorous and comprehensive job, which substantially improves the Commission' s proposal."
"I congratulate everyone on this, especially Mrs Hautala."
"Mr President, my congratulations to the Commission and to the rapporteur."
"I agree with what many honourable Members have said and so will limit myself to a few points."
"When I look at my own country - since I believe everyone is exploring what the impact will be on their own country - I see three crucial points."
"Firstly, the annual report on the equal treatment of men and women that is required from companies in this directive."
"I introduced that in my own country."
"It is encountering huge resistance and has never been complied with, although it is compulsory."
"Secondly, positive action. That also remains a very difficult matter, even with women."
"Thirdly, equal pay."
"Numerous ways have been found of getting round equal pay."
"What I am actually trying to say with these three examples is that if we want to succeed in implementation in the area of this directive, which I think is a good one, we may perhaps have to talk more with the social partners than we have done in the past."
"Only if they support things on the ground and cooperate in trying to carry them out, will anything change at grass-roots level."
"Take the example of equal pay."
"At a time of recession, the response is: 'We can' t have completely equal pay, that' s too expensive' ."
"But it does not happen in boom times either."
"I believe that more pressure should be applied on them, particularly since we all accept they are primarily responsible for the labour market."
"Then I would like to say something briefly about sexual harassment."
"Some fifteen years ago, I launched a campaign in Belgium under the title ""Sex colleague, ex-colleague"" ."
"Since then legislation has been devised, confidants have been assigned, a network of confidants has been set up, and those confidants have been trained."
"I must say that it actually works quite well and is also supported by the social partners."
"Mr President, Mrs Hautala, Commissioner, I am very pleased to see that so many members have referred to the amendments relating to the position of parents - particularly young parents."
"Motherhood, pregnancy and fatherhood must not prevent progress in working life."
"I find Amendment No 25 to be particularly welcome and well-justified."
"Reference has already been made here to the fact that childbearing tends to be postponed in periods of economic prosperity, and this is particularly worrying as far as young women are concerned."
"I also think that Amendment No 42 is good, i.e. referring to this problem of equal pay, which in my opinion is still the worst problem in Europe in terms of gender equality."
"It is completely intolerable that even today in many sectors, even in the public sector, the average earnings of women are lower than those of men with equivalent education and experience."
"Our society and our economy cannot afford not to exploit to the full the skills of its entire population."
"Our society must offer all its members equal and unlimited opportunities for self-development along their chosen path."
"Old-fashioned and artificial structures must not be allowed to impede an individual' s professional, educational or career development or personal growth, irrespective of their gender."
"Sexual harassment is a repugnant phenomenon."
"I would like to emphasis that the natural human dignity and integrity of the individual are inviolable basic values, particularly to us conservatives."
"Sexual harassment, this subject on which silence has reigned for so long, must be efficiently tackled."
"However, there is cause to take action at European Union level only where we are unable to create sufficient legislation at national level."
"On this issue I am of the opinion that healthy social structures and efficient national legislation are the best means of preventing sexual harassment."
"European Union legislation must also comply with the general legal requirements for legislation."
"A text worded clearly, accurately and in detail is one of these."
"When bringing their own case in court people must be able to base their demands on a clear legal text."
"In this respect I support Ms Lulling' s opinion that this report is not sufficiently legally precise throughout."
"Furthermore, I would like to say that I absolutely oppose Amendment No 40, which refers to collective action being adopted in this sector."
"While I am not of the opinion that this would be a bad thing in this sector in particular, I do object in general to the collective action mechanism being brought into the European legal system."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala and all the members of the committee involved in this very complicated operation."
"First, the European Union has proposed a combination of political tools to add value in line with the policy of equal opportunities, such as its legislation, the Fifth Programme, employment strategy, the guidelines, the mainstreaming policies, the social funds, and so on."
"Legislation is one of the most important and effective political tools and there is no need to continually propose new legislation."
"We must modernise the existing legislation and adapt and adjust it to a world of change."
"This is what we have attempted to do, taking into account new models of production, the family and society."
"We have taken into account the new treaty and the new legal basis and, of course, we have taken into account the case law of the Court of Justice."
"I would like to briefly answer some of the questions put."
"First, on codification: Yes, we are going to present our work on codification of legislation on the same legal basis."
"Second, there is an expert group which meets three times per year and they examine the problems of compatibility between European and national legislation."
"Thirdly, I was asked whether we are going to continue with new directives going beyond the employment field."
"We are committed to doing that and proposals will be made next year."
"As far as sexual harassment is concerned, we have accepted as many of the proposals as possible."
"There was excellent cooperation between the committee and the Commission and I really believe that agreement can be reached on this proposal at the Employment and Social Affairs Council on 11 June."
"It is very important to reach this agreement at this Council so that we can move to final adoption during the Belgian presidency."
"I am obliged to refer to each amendment and to explain why they are rejected or accepted, so allow me to read out exactly what the Commission's position is."
"It is very important to say that the Commission can accept 49 of the 69 amendments, although we would prefer a different wording for 17 of them and can only accept 17 of these amendments in part."
"I support Amendments Nos 7 and 21, which provide for definitions of direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment in one article."
"The Commission can also accept, in principle, part of Amendments Nos 39 and 68, which extend the powers of independent bodies to cover all directives in the area of equality of treatment between women and men."
"However, the Commission cannot accept the part of Amendment No 39, which provides for funding and human resources for these bodies."
"Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept that these bodies could examine and pursue complaints for individuals and organisations without the consent of these individuals or groups."
"Amendments Nos 15 and 40 in part would allow law organisations and associations to take cases on behalf of a complainant."
"The Commission can only accept this in cases of approval or consent of the complainant."
"The spirit of Amendment No 10 and part of Amendments Nos 25, 46 and 69 stress the importance of the reconciliation of family and working life and call for complementary action on paternity leave."
"We can accept Amendments Nos 12 and 38 on the protection of victims of discrimination, including employees and trade union delegates against any adverse treatment."
"Amendment No 33 clarifies that the application of the principle of equal treatment concerning membership of, and involvement in, an organisation should not ban organisations of a single sex."
"The Commission never intended such a ban."
"We also accept: Amendments Nos 14 and 42 urging Member States to encourage employers to establish annual equality plans in order to promote equal treatment;"
"The Commission cannot accept part of Amendments Nos 11, 27 nor Amendment No 55 insofar as they introduce a definition of positive action into the text of the directive itself."
"This definition of positive action is already contained in the text of treaty and therefore should not be part of the directive."
"However, the Commission could agree to a reference to Declaration 28 of the Treaty, which provides for priority for women in positive action measures in the recitals and in the text of the directive."
"The Commission can accept part of the rest of Amendments Nos 11 and 27, the establishment of reports on positive action every two years but not annual reports and not linked to the employment process."
"This would be unrealistic and over-complicated."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 1 and parts of various other amendments, which replace ""equal treatment between women and men"" with ""equality for women and men""."
"This would be incompatible with the wording of the Treaty."
"This is the major issue; it is not a question of political differences or an ideological problem."
"We must use the wording of the Treaty and the wording of the Treaty is ""equality of treatment for men and women""."
"The Commission can accept the latter wording."
"Other amendments that the Commission rejects are part of Amendments No 9 and 59 as a matter of principle since they refer to the need to amend another Community directive on equal treatment relating to maternity."
"A directive cannot provide for future modification of another directive which concerns health and safety at the workplace."
"Nor can it accept Amendment No 4, which refers to the necessity for the Commission to make proposals on the basis of Article 13 to cover areas beyond employment, occupational and vocational training."
"Such a provision cannot be contained in a directive, which does not go beyond these fields."
"But as I have already said, we are going to propose measures in 2002."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 36 and 61 which extend judicial protection to all cases where discrimination takes place after termination of the employment relationship."
"This goes beyond the scope of the directive."
"Amendment No 44 which provides for contractual compliance with respect to equal treatment, particularly in the public procurement context, goes beyond the scope of the directive, but we have discussed it with the committee in the past and I have explained to you that there is cooperation between me and Mr Bolkestein."
"We are going to issue a communication and support and encourage Member States to take this into account."
"Finally, as you can see, the Commission can accept most of Parliament's amendments."
"I would highlight our acceptance of Amendments Nos 7 and 21, definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment and Amendment No 39 in part, scope of powers of independent bodies."
"I accept in spirit Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 20, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 51 and 60 and partially Amendments Nos 5 and 9, first part in spirit, Amendment No 11, first part, Amendment Nos 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 30, 39, 40, 43 (second part), 46 (second part), 50 (second part) and 69 (second part)."
"Many amendments could be accepted in full such as Amendments Nos 13, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 41, 42, 45, 47, 60, 66 and 68."
"However, I reject Amendments Nos 1, 4, 36, 43 (first part) and Amendments Nos 44, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 and 67."
"This was the first time that the Women's Committee had participated in the codecision procedure. It was a first experience and a very successful one, because such complicated work has had excellent results."
"I would like to congratulate you. I would like to thank you for your cooperation so that we can have this directive in place as soon as possible."
"Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Integrated European labour market 1998-1999"
"The next item is the report (A5-0169/2001) by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's EURES activity report 1998-1999 entitled 'Towards an integrated European labour market: the contribution of EURES' [COM(2000) 607 - C5-0104/2001 - 2001/2053(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although EURES was created in 1993, as the successor to the old SEDOC, few people are even aware that it exists."
"Few people know what EURES does, which is to help people looking for work in another Union country or employers to recruit applicants in another country."
"Few people understand what EURES could mean for the future."
"Our first recommendation, therefore, seeks to publicise EURES and its database more intensively, which must be reflected in its budget, in its activity plan and in the implementation of its budget and also in the various Member States, where it should be monitored and followed up appropriately by their public employment services, which are now linked by means of EURES."
"EURES is a network of networks, consisting of around 500 'Euroadvisers' , public and private organisations and partners and provides a valuable opportunity for direct consultation via the Internet in an open network."
"It seeks to promote the transparency of the European market by providing information, advice and placement help."
"EURES covers not only the Union, but also the European Economic Area and currently includes 17 countries."
"In short, it seeks to promote the effective exercise of the right to free movement of workers and encourage mobility, which we consider not to be a political end in itself, but rather the need to respond to people' s spontaneous requests."
"All of this makes little sense, however, if people are fundamentally unaware of its existence."
"The first priority is, therefore, to promote and to publicise this programme."
"As a matter of fact, as a result of growing Internet use, the efficiency of EURES will increasingly depend on the widespread knowledge of the general public and much less on simple improvements to the workings of the bureaucratic network of services and organisations."
"One specific sector of EURES deserves a special mention, which is the area dedicated to cross-border cooperation in the field of employment and labour mobility, and which clearly generates a higher level of response: the cross-border EURES."
"Today, there are already twenty specific structures in this field, but a great deal remains to be done."
"I would remind you, in particular, of the case of my country' s border with Spain, which is largely 'bare' , and I am also thinking of the new challenges and opportunities that the forthcoming enlargement will bring to this field."
"As a result of the considerable potential that these EURES cross-border structures offer in terms of local development, decentralised social dialogue and specific development of cross-border mobility, being able to work in another country without changing residence is clearly another priority for the future."
"If we look at the 1998-1999 period, which the Commission' s report covers, we see positive data that we have highlighted. The report also contains some negative aspects to bear in mind, which we must correct straightaway."
"These include the considerable lack of public awareness, to which I have already referred, the low take-up in relative terms by employers' organisations, the very high national imbalance in the participation of the various Member States, a fact which is disturbing and unacceptable, some shortcomings that have been noticed with regard to the web site, specifically in terms of its multilingual nature, which serves to provide an equal basis for all European citizens, and the absence of any mention of the outermost regions. We therefore also request that particular attention be paid in future to these regions' specific problems in this field."
"In our opinion, the Commission' s report itself contains some shortcomings, which we have highlighted. These are the absence of any diagnosis and a lack of assessment of the crux of the matter, in terms both of the development of the service itself and of the true state of labour mobility in the Union and the European Economic Area."
"The future reports by EURES will be much more useful and will make much more political sense if they present their critical vision of the successes and failures that have been notched up, if they include information which is more relevant, both in terms of statistics and of quality, if they better enable us to make a more accurate assessment of the definition of priorities of future goals and targets and if they also enable us to undertake a proper parliamentary assessment of the reasons underpinning the choices that are made."
"This revamping of the future biennial reports from EURES and their content is, as a matter of fact, specifically called for in the conclusions of the last Spring Summit, in Stockholm, particularly those that were adopted following the Commission' s communication to the Council entitled 'New European Labour Markets, Open to All, with Access for All' , which we are closely watching, which we welcome and which we warmly recommend should be followed up in this context."
"We also propose a programme geared towards enlargement, a programme of preparatory action, which we would like to be accessible and appropriate."
"Furthermore, once a new legal basis for the organisation of EURES is announced, probably in 2002, Parliament will only need to say one simple thing, and that is: Parliament wishes to participate in this redefinition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the free movement of workers - a cornerstone of the Treaties of Rome, and the most important of the four fundamental freedoms in our internal market - can only operate effectively if the employment services also do not end at national borders."
"This is the role of EURES, a network which is intended to provide information, advice and employment services across national borders."
"We agree with all the key points contained in Mr Ribeiro e Castro's report."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his competent work."
"In particular, we share his critical views - which he has just repeated during this debate - under Recital A, which sets out a clear set of conditions for the Commission as regards the provision of objective reasons and statistical information."
"This will also make our job easier."
"However, the report - like so many others - succumbs to a common temptation: it adds a lengthy list of new demands for future improvements to those already put forward by the Commission."
"In my view, the repetition of what is self-evident, and this House's often over-zealous efforts to list every conceivable demand, simply detract from the impact of a report and the credibility of our joint endeavours."
"I often have the impression that if the Commission puts forward five demands, for example, this House feels compelled to add at least another five. I cannot support this approach."
"What is important is not the number of demands we put forward in a specific case but their practical implementation."
"I think it is excessive, for example, to devise and implement permanent information systems, in particular within youth organisations, universities and the media, as demanded in Article 15 of the report."
"I think this is something which we can safely leave to the EURES units at local level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"I also have great reservations about the creation of additional operational units, as set forth in Article 16, because they lack substance and are often used as a fig leaf in order to conceal the failures of existing bodies."
"The growing importance of EURES' role in the light of the forthcoming EU enlargement must be clearly underlined, as in this report. Sound career advice and employment services can undoubtedly help to channel potential widespread interest in migration."
"Nonetheless, the goal of further integration of the labour market within the Fifteen must not slip into the background."
"What is absolutely essential is the restructuring of EURES' finances and the reform of its legal basis, as demanded in Article 27."
"This is borne out by the problems at local level and the enquiries directed to us as parliamentarians."
"As the representation of citizens at local level, Parliament must be given a key role in this area."
"Mr President, to begin with I should like to congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro most warmly on his brilliant report and thank him for the excellent cooperation we enjoyed in the committee."
"Unlike Mr Stauner I am convinced that he has produced very creative work with the report of the European Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union wants to make the creation of an integrated labour market a priority and that is a good thing."
"But we should be aware that people who want to make use of this opportunity are not always wrapped in cotton wool."
"It is not at all easy to be mobile in a cross-border way in the European labour market."
"If we really want a European labour market, we must work at removing the obstacles, and EURES has certainly won its spurs in this field."
"The 450 EURES consultants who have day-to-day contact with people who are mobile, can testify to the difficulties they experience."
"But even in their own organisations, whether it be job centres or trade unions, they do not always receive the attention they really deserve."
"I believe that policy-makers should make more use of their know-how and expertise."
"I am therefore particularly happy that the Commission has agreed to my suggestion that a public hearing should be organised with the EURES consultants and I hope, Commissioner, that the results of that hearing will be of use to the Commission in preparing the new programme."
"The Commission has formulated a number of proposals and the honourable Member has supplemented these in a useful way."
"I believe, for example, that it is a very good idea to use EURES more effectively as part of our employment strategy and for that to happen the legal basis of EURES must change."
"I also think it is important that there is better coordination with other Community initiatives."
"But I should like to put special emphasis on two additional elements."
"Firstly: I believe that it is definitely necessary to start expanding EURES activities in the future, especially in the context of enlargement to include new candidate countries which we are now experiencing."
"Secondly: anyone who talks about the enlargement and enhancement of EURES must also have the courage to talk about additional financial resources and preferably, Commissioner, as part of a long-term plan, since the annual 'carve up' is very difficult to operate for EURES."
"I should like to take advantage of this debate to raise two additional issues regarding cross-border mobility, issues about which we are constantly asked by people in border regions."
"That is first and foremost, Commissioner, the question of Parliament that has been on the table for years in relation to the introduction of a Europe test, a test which could monitor internationally the possible consequences of social and fiscal legislation in other countries."
"The Netherlands recently used that test voluntarily as part of a bilateral tax agreement and in the social agenda we have occasionally asked for such a test to be created at European level."
"I should like to ask you again to give this serious consideration."
"The second issue concerns the draft for the simplification and modification of the coordination of social security entitlements of migrating employees."
"This issue has been on the table for years, and we know that the Belgian presidency intends to, and will try to, achieve a political breakthrough in this connection."
"That will not be easy while decisions on this issue must be made unanimously."
"Accordingly, I should like to express the hope that Member States that are at present dragging their feet will begin paying more attention to the problems of cross-border mobility, and hence be prepared to make some compromises as part of the regulation."
"The European Commission promised us that at the end of this year, during the Belgian Presidency, a conference on border work would be organised."
"We very much hope, Commissioner, that that conference will contribute, not only to greater understanding and insight into the problems of border regions, but specifically to the removal of the obstacles to cross-border mobility in the European labour market."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his serious and very painstaking approach to this work and would support many of his introductory remarks and also many of those made by my colleague, Mrs Van Lancker."
"There is no doubt that working abroad is increasingly popular for young people, in particular, and businesses are also looking to recruit from a wider field, but for this to be possible, people need to feel that they can have accurate, up-to-date information about what working in another Member State may entail, because that information provides them with a real choice as to whether they work elsewhere or not."
"At the moment we have a very confusing set of different rules and regulations and it is clear from complaints to many of us and to Parliament's Petitions Committee that clear advice is not always forthcoming from the appropriate authorities, even in Member States themselves."
"The apparent anomalies have not helped either in social security coordination and entitlements, even different definitions as to what constitutes self-employment."
"The EURES network provides a very valuable resource for potential mobile workers."
"It also provides a valuable, if underused, resource for employers."
"Many small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity or experience to carry out their cross-border recruitment."
"EURES has an important role for them and it is a great pity that employment and employers' organisations are not more involved in the development of these services."
"Up to now, it has been particularly important in border regions, but EURES still does not cover all such areas, which is regrettable."
"It is obvious, as others have said, that EURES needs to be adequately resourced, expanded and promoted if it is to meet its full potential and respond to the needs of individuals."
"We must also recognise that enlargement will bring additional and quite legitimate demands in terms of information."
"We support the request for more detailed information to be provided and agree that multi-annual funding is essential to the smooth development of this services."
"However, its task would be made much easier if Member States adopted a more determined and coherent approach to making free movement a reality rather than an ideal that they keep banging on about, but seem incapable of delivering."
"There has to be positive action by governments in favour of enabling people to experience working elsewhere: Mrs Van Lancker has already refereed to the coordination of social security systems within this."
"There is also the question about dealing with tax problems for frontier workers."
"We still have enormous problems with adequate recognition of qualifications, particularly vocational qualifications."
"Members States must recognise that free movement is not a threat to them, it is not an inconvenience, it is a valuable way to increase understanding and to develop cooperation within the Union."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro for an excellent report."
"I agree with most of what has been brought up in the discussion, especially by the speakers immediately preceding me."
"I would like to add two comments. Firstly, I would like to say how glad I am that the report so clearly emphasises that the free movement we want in Europe must be based on the principle of voluntary mobility."
"I highlight this particularly in view of the fact that, in my own and other countries, employment services have often been used as a kind of instrument with which to force population movements between different parts of the country through economic means."
"I hope that it will never be possible to implement any such measure at European level."
"I would also like to emphasise that I am surprised that no-one in this discussion has pointed out that we are now discussing technical and practical obstacles to free movement across borders, at the same time as major Member States are setting up huge practical and political obstacles to free movement between the labour markets of the candidate countries and those of the current Member States."
"This suggests, of course, that we are concerned with a political rather than a solely practical problem when we talk about free movement in Europe."
"Mr President, the report presented to us today by my colleague, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, is comprehensive in its analysis of the activities of EURES over the period 1998 to 1999 and constructive in relation to the proposal he makes for the future activities of this network."
"I commend him for the extensive work he has put into the preparation and completion of this report and I share his view that we need to stress the important role of EURES network, as a means of implementing European employment strategy."
"EURES job offers went from 43 000 at the start of 1998 to 166 000 at the beginning of 2000."
"The number of placements obtained to EURES, rose from 26 449 in 1998 to 44 460 in 1999: that is an increase of more than 68% in one year and the potential for more placement is much greater."
"This is just another example of the many qualitative examples of the EU at work for citizens."
"Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland."
"The fact that we have come close to full employment is a practical example of what is achievable."
"I am confident our people will give practical recognition to this fact when they vote next week on the Nice Treaty."
"We want to share the benefits of EU membership with our neighbours from central and eastern Europe: to do otherwise would be to reject the concept and spirit of the Rome Treaty."
"Let us not forget their courage and sacrifice in safeguarding freedom and democracy."
"This objective surely outweighs other minor or contrived objections to Nice."
"One of the key functions of EURES is to make information available on current job vacancies in the Member States."
"Yesterday evening, I logged on to the website and there were 7 197 vacancies listed."
"Looking at the first 200 vacancies, the range of jobs is extensive."
"Vacancies in Ireland, for example, include: accounts assistants, building administrators and sales and reservations."
"So for all of the reasons, it is very obvious that this EURES programme has enormous potential."
"Again, I compliment and congratulate my colleague, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on his very extensive and constructive approach to this important report."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Ribeiro e Castro gives a clear and thorough exposition of the Commission document and its shortcomings."
"Firstly, the rapporteur requires more information on the results of the EURES network."
"I fully support that, since it definitely remains obscure how the results of EURES relate to the state of affairs in European labour markets."
"Secondly, the Commission document shows clearly that Member States could make fuller use of the potential of the EURES network, in view of the differences between Member States in the number of vacancies in the network: international recruitment will not be realistic for all vacancies."
"In the same way the call to encourage all border regions to enter into a EURES partnership has not been supported with arguments based on the need for community support expressed by the regions themselves."
"The obstacles are not found in the first place between adjacent regions, but concern mobility over greater distances, that is, they are 'transnational' rather than 'cross-border' in nature."
"EU enlargement implies that a shift in emphasis from cross-border to transnational mobility will become more likely."
"My third point concerns the necessary subsidiarity."
"Both the Commission and the rapporteur raise the point that local familiarity with the network leaves much to be desired."
"However, local information is the responsibility of the local players."
"For that reason, reserving a substantial portion of the budget for promotion is undesirable."
"On the other hand, I can fully support the call for decentralisation."
"The term of the budget is also a discussion point."
"The Commission wants a budget extending over several years as this facilitates planning."
"I have no problems with long-term budgets as such, but I do with the scope and nature of the community package of responsibilities proposed by the Commission."
"That leads me to prefer an annual establishment of the budget."
"In conclusion the attention paid by the rapporteur to expansion has my support."
"After the political decision on the free movement of employees is taken for the candidate countries, the mobility of labour must no longer be restricted by inadequate cooperation in employment provision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s very useful report mentions, in particular, the importance of transparency and the importance of reliable statistics on jobs."
"It is true that in my country, France, by massaging the figures and by introducing costly job-creation schemes in the public sector which are no real use at all, the government has been able to announce what it claims is a spectacular fall in unemployment. In reality, unemployment remains stable, and it may even be increasing."
"Since the beginning of the year, planned job cuts have been followed by more planned job cuts, at Marks and Spencer, who are relocating, and at Danone, who are planning even further cuts."
"We are quick to condemn companies who make staff redundant while they themselves are making a profit, but governments must also bear their share of the responsibility, because the original European plan for free circulation and competition between countries with comparable living standards and social protection schemes has been replaced by the indiscriminate opening up of the market to capital and to products manufactured outside Europe in conditions approaching slavery."
"For those companies who are subject to laws imposed by parliaments and states, the employment market is not only European, but world-wide."
"For workers, of course, it is another matter, and I note that, quite rightly, Recital C in Mr Ribeiro e Castro' s report says that 'a high level of mobility on the labour market is not an end in itself' . Two hundred thousand French people, worn down by the weight of taxation and the endless bureaucracy in their own country, did not wait for EURES, but simply left the country, in order, finally to get a job and a better standard of living, at least that is what they were hoping for, in the United Kingdom."
"So, while it is certainly useful to have a network which enables those who wish to find a job in another country within the European Union, our first priority must continue to be to make it possible for businesses to create jobs for their own people in their own countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the right and the opportunity to live and work in other Member States of the European Union are important political aspirations for Europe' s citizens."
"The basis for the EURES network is the existence of this right, enshrined in law, for workers to move freely within the territory of the European Union and the European Economic Area and the unpleasant fact that barriers to labour mobility remain in place."
"This network, which centres on the exchange of information, on providing advice and on support for appointing professionals, is supported by EURES advisers in dialogue and in collaboration with the Member States' national employment services and by an Internet access service. This service must be more widely publicised in future, which will make it easier for the average user to consult and research."
"EURES contributes to making the European employment market more flexible and increasingly mobile and provides a range of opportunities for vocational training in cross-border regions."
"The positive characteristics of this network, which must be strengthened, as the rapporteur, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, whom I congratulate, quite rightly emphasises, include ease of access and the exchange of information on employment opportunities across this huge area, the multilingual content of the system, which must be regularly and rigorously updated, and legal assistance for citizens, particularly with tax systems and social security."
"Having said this, we must not overestimate the value of EURES."
"Although this network is a very positive thing, it is merely an instrument for implementing the European strategy for employment."
"The truth of the matter is that specific directives do exist in the field of employment, which seek to eliminate the social, cultural, and linguistic barriers that obstruct mobility in the European Union."
"Commissioner, Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his analysis of the Commission' s report."
"The analysis which he has carried out is very painstaking, and it really does enable us to ask ourselves about the relevance and, the effectiveness of this European Employment Service, both in terms of its strategy and objectives and in relation to the resources which have been used in order to achieve the objective of worker mobility and access to the European employment market."
"I should also like, however, to draw attention to its weakness, which lies in its lack of critical evaluation. However, the text presented by our rapporteur will supplement the report as far as this aspect is concerned."
"This report is timely, insofar as it highlights the role which EURES can and should play in the more general context of the European employment strategy, particularly if, as has been requested, the question of its having its formal legal basis in the Treaties is reviewed."
"EURES should be entirely integrated into the strategy, defined at Lisbon and reinforced at Stockholm, on the removal of obstacles to mobility within the labour market."
"It seems to me that there are three points which need emphasising."
"First there is the issue of mobility, which has already been mentioned."
"Everyone praises its merits, but I do not believe that it should be regarded as an end in itself, or as a risky gamble on the future, and still less as a choice that is made by default because there are no job opportunities at home."
"It must be possible for it to be a positive choice, and in that case mobility should not have to face all sorts of obstacles with regard to consistency between social security systems and taxation systems, double taxation, and the recognition of qualifications etc."
"Secondly, let us emphasise the importance of information on the existence of the European Employment Service, particularly in border regions."
"Communications must be strengthened, and addressed as a matter of priority to professional organisations, training centres and universities."
"The added value of the European dimension is not necessarily clear to see, and yet the fact that this Community strategy in favour of employment is taking the very practical form of providing openings in the employment market at European level is an excellent example of what can be achieved."
"Finally, I should like to end my speech by mentioning the question of enlargement."
"In view of the fears which have been expressed here and there in certain Member States of the Union, regarding the prospect of the massive and uncontrolled arrival of workers from the candidate countries, I believe that EURES should have a role to play here, by making it possible to anticipate difficulties, whether real or imagined, in particular by facilitating dialogue and by making it possible for the employment services of the countries concerned to work together with the various social partners involved in the major issue of job mobility in the Union as it is today and in the enlarged Union of tomorrow."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Ribeiro e Castro has been the starting point for an in-depth debate on a question which is one of the biggest challenges to European policy, i.e. the European labour market."
"Until now, employment strategies, guidelines and recommendations have been of a strictly national nature."
"But national action plans relate to national labour markets and what we refer to as the European labour market is clearly developing throughout Europe."
"By which we mean new demands, identical demands regarding the quality of the qualifications of people looking for jobs throughout Europe."
"There is very little mobility of workers within Europe."
"A mere 0.4%."
"The standard response to mobility problems is to cite cultural differences. The question of language, culture and national education systems."
"However, there is clearly more to it than that."
"There are pension problems and insurance problems and regulations on movements of workers and their pensions need to work better and faster, as we have already heard."
"There is the important problem of information, which several speakers have already touched on; the information which jobseekers need to be given on their rights, labour market conditions, accommodation, their children's education, their pension rights and the facility to transfer their rights if they return home."
"These are problems of a national and European nature; they are already on the agenda of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but there are still huge differences of opinion."
"EURES is instrumental to the creation of this European labour market."
"Parliament is supporting the Commission in this endeavour, as it has done since 1993, as can be seen from this year's budget, which is in the order of EUR 13 million."
"EURES already has operational experience and there has been an increase in the demand for information, an increase in the movement of information at transnational level, which reached 40% last year, proving that we need to keep and expand EURES."
"I should like to touch on certain choices made by the Commission in order to promote and strengthen this tool."
"First, there is greater collaboration between the heads of public services, more and more of which are deciding to incorporate EURES in their databases, so that they can provide their customers with common services."
"We are currently studying the possibility of extending the range of services to both jobseekers and employers."
"The Commission will announce a new EURES service from June onwards which will allow jobseekers in specific sectors in which there is a shortage to file their CVs via the Internet and, at the same time, will allow employers to register for this service."
"Now that it has been up and running for 8 years, we have asked the Member States to include problems or new services which might be demanded of EURES in their questionnaires and we shall be presenting Parliament with a report based on these questionnaires."
"I should like to close by pointing out that enlargement will force us to reconsider this tool; for the moment, however, we need to develop it between the Member States to the maximum."
"Finally, I think it is worth mentioning that the legal basis for EURES needs to be revised, so that EURES can be adapted and improved to meet the future demands on these services."
"Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."

"(Parliament approved the joint text)"
"Report (A5-0178/2001) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting [C5-0130/2001 - 1997/0348(COD)]"

"Corbett (PSE)."
"Madam President, after we rejected Amendment No 54 to Recital E, you then put Recital E itself to the vote, although there has not been a request for a separate vote on Recital E and although, under our Rules of Procedure, you need not do so."
"May I ask you not to put the original recital to the vote unless there has been a request for a separate vote: firstly, because it makes the voting time a lot longer, but secondly, the voting lists that all the groups have in front of them do not have a item for a separate vote on that and it can lead to confusion as to how we intend to vote."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett, we shall save precious time."
"On the subject of Amendment No 75"
"Madam President, I have in front of me the English text."
"The oral amendment is that where the English text says, 'qualified majority is unworkable' , the word 'unworkable' should be replaced by the phrase 'it is difficult to work' ."
"Thank you, Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0175/2001) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision laying down the Community Environment Action Programme 2001-2010 [COM(2001) 31 - C5-0032/2001 - 2001/0029(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I should just like to say that after this vote I hope everyone is convinced of the need to reform our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I do not intend in any way to criticise the Environment Committee or the rapporteur, but like Mr Corbett I wish to emphasise that there must be a better way to conduct voting than this."
"We need some constitutional change to enable the committees to work properly rather than the House as a whole acting as a committee."
"Report (A5-0141/2001) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/671/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes (COM(2000) 815 - C5-0684/2000 - 2000/0315(COD))"

"On the subject of Amendment No 70"
"I have to obtain the assent of Parliament before putting Amendment No 70 to the vote."
"Mr President, we in our group discovered, after the group meeting, that there was a compromise amendment, Amendment No 70."
"I must explain that we were not invited to participate in this so-called compromise which, for many of us, contains proposals which we are unable to agree with."
"Nor does the Commissioner agree with them, as she has told us."
"Unfortunately, however, there is no separate vote on a compromise amendment."
"I must therefore explain that, for some of us, whilst we agree with the spirit of the proposal that there should be no discrimination against fathers, there is still a difference between paternity and maternity, at least as things are arranged at present, since men cannot become pregnant and they cannot give birth."
"I should like to say that we have voted freely, because we should have liked to participate in a compromise, because we have an amendment which..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I can also ask my group not to vote to put this amendment in the ..."
"President."
"Mrs Lulling, are you opposing the vote on this amendment or not?"
"Lulling."

"On the subject of Amendment No 71"
"Mr President, it is a minor omission which we can correct, with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr van Hulten."
"In the last paragraph of Amendment No 71, the text reads, 'The authorising officer by delegation shall, at the same time, forward this report to the internal auditor' , and we should like to add orally, if the House agrees, 'and to the accounting officer' ."
"We forgot to include the accounting officer, and it would be better to put him back in, because he too is entitled to see this information."
"Is there any opposition to taking this oral amendment into consideration?"
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"After the vote on the Commission proposal"
"Mr President, first of all may I thank you for the brilliant way in which you have conducted this vote,"
"a fact which seems to have been acknowledged by the House, and to tell you that, as we announced during the debate, and with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, whom I should like to thank very much, and of the other groups, I am requesting the application of Rule 69(2), i.e. that we should not vote on the legislative text, but keep Parliament' s position as it is, and postpone the final vote, so as to allow us to hold what I hope will be effective and useful negotiations with the Commission and with the Council. I think this is justified in view of the lack of response on the part of the Commission to all the points raised yesterday evening."
"That is clear."
"Does the House agree to the rapporteur' s proposal to apply Rule 69(2)?"
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"(Parliament decided to postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to clarify paragraph 11 on which we are to vote."
"It is not about creating new processes, but about adding the ecological dimension to the Lisbon Process."
"I know that comments and doubts have been expressed on this point, but it is a matter of adding the ecological dimension to a process which already exists."

"Report (A5-0169/2001) by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission' s EURES activity report 1998-1999 entitled 'Towards an integrated European labour market: the contribution of EURES' (COM(2000) 607 - C5-0104/2001 - 2001/2053(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Schörling Report (A5-0177/2001)"
"Mr President, yesterday I went to Rome to see the newly elected Parliament in Italy."
"Among the members elected to the Chamber of Deputies is Mr Fatuzzo."
"You will think it is me, Mr President, but it is not me."
"You know that Julius Caesar belonged to the Julian clan, and now Mr Fabio Fatuzzo, who has been elected to the Italian Parliament, belongs to the Fatuzzo family."
"I therefore went round to see him to congratulate him on his election, accompanied by the driver, Ugo Gustinetti, a pensioner, who said to me, 'As a pensioner, I am very much in favour of this report on the environmental programme because we must have clean air to breathe."
"So vote for it!'"
"That is what I have done, following the advice of the Pensioners' Party driver, Ugo Gustinetti."
". (NL) Those intent on economic growth at any price pay the price in terms of compromising nature and the environment."
"The clearest example of this can be seen at the moment in the American Bush Administration, which regards the expansion of oil extraction as far more important than complying with the climate treaty of Kyoto."
"After the expenditure of substantial community funds in the EU on unintended environmental destruction, the necessity of environmental protection is now considered more and more obvious."
"Hopefully that will lead to clearer-headed choices than other EU decisions on the basis of which smoking is discouraged at the same time as tobacco growing is subsidised."
"In candidate countries we see a similar contradiction."
"They want money for the building of motorways through areas of natural beauty, for dams that devastate shorelines and watercourses and for large-scale restructuring of the countryside."
"Anyone frightened to make a choice between the all-powerful economy and the protection of our environment becomes bogged down in conflicting decisions."
"That is why it is a good thing that the compromise in this third reading forces Member States to inform public opinion and hence also interested organisations and to give them the chance to express their views on projects."
"Financing from European funds can no longer be a justification for allowing environmentally damaging expenditure to proceed."
"Roo Report (A5-0178/2001)"
"Mr President, Mr de Roo has presented the directive on tyre regulation."
"I spoke to my daughter, Cristina, well known in this Parliament, who told me, 'Now I understand why Mr de Roo is concerned about tyres!'"
"'Really?' I answered."
"'How have you come to understand that?'"
"'Well, Mr de Roo has a very obvious surname: he is called R-o-o."
"Don' t you see?"
"In his name there are tyres and wheels."
"Nobody else could discuss this report as well as he could.'"
"I know Mr de Roo will forgive me as he is a very nice man."
"I am therefore very pleased to vote for this report of his because nobody could give us Europeans quieter and safer tyres than Mr de Roo."
"Méndez de Vigo/Seguro Report (A5-0168/2001)"
"Mr President, it is difficult to know how we should judge the report by António José Seguro and Iñigo Méndez de Vigo."
"We acknowledge that, with the amendments that have been made, it makes a clear compromise in favour of constituting a convention for the envisaged reform of the Treaties and that the report accepts the launch of a constitutional process."
"We must also say, however, that the report is not as critical of the results of the Nice Intergovernmental Conference as it should be."
"With this report, Parliament is regrettably distancing itself from the prevailing feeling of failure in a European society which saw the Heads of State or Government unable to agree on the path to take for building a political Europe, which is now more necessary than ever because of enlargement towards the States of the East and of the Mediterranean."
"Once again, the Members of the majority in this Parliament have ignored their responsibility as representatives of the European citizens, have subordinated their positions to those of their governments and, paradoxically, have let themselves be bested by the political representatives of their own States."
"Therefore, now, having heard President Johannes Rau, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Prime­Minister Lionel Jospin, I am convinced and have the regrettable feeling that, if the majority Members had known beforehand the positions of these national leaders, the report that has just been adopted would have been quite different."
"What I am talking about in particular and what I am most ashamed of is its consideration of the European Parliament as the central location and institution of the political European Union."
"I hope that in the future constitutional process, this Parliament will maintain a self-respecting position, which is more responsible, especially with regard to the interests and aspirations of our citizens. Lastly, I hope that we learn this lesson and that we are aware of the role that falls to us in European politics."
"Mr President, I voted against this report on the Nice Treaty, but I found it ironic that my colleagues from the main political establishment parties in Ireland, who criticised the no-campaign in Ireland saying we have no grounds for criticism, endorsed a report today which is extremely critical of the Nice Treaty."
"At home they say one thing and out here they do something very different."
"I also find it quite alarming that this treaty basically endorses the whole concept of a European constitution which is something that has not been debated in the national parliaments."
"In fact, in Ireland when we bring this issue up during the referendum process, we are told that it is not going to happen."
"It is quite clear today that this is going happen and there needs to be a bit more honesty with the people."
"It is rather disturbing that we had the Swedish Prime Minister, coming here yesterday urging a ""yes"" vote."
"People are trying to put pressure on Ireland to say that if do not vote ""yes"" we will be stopping enlargement when this is not the case."
"The kind of Europe the Nice Treaty proposes is far more detrimental to the eastern European countries, because it divides Europe."
"We should be looking for a Europe that is not divided into first and the second-class tiers."
"Mr President, I think that the Treaty of Nice will go down in history as a clear example of a lost opportunity, due to the specific requirements of the unyielding defenders of the power of the Member States."
"The Member States are political structures that originated from the greatest capacity for production and mobility, born out of the discovery of the steam engine, which, according to the North American thinker Alvin Tofler, was the second great technological revolution for humanity."
"This meant that the political framework of the old kingdoms, counties, dukedoms and domains which, until then, had structured societies were small and useless."
"But since Marshall McLuhan talked about the world as a global village and Tofler himself pointed out information technologies as the third human revolution, the globalisation of political relations with regard to trade, the economy, defence, leisure, and so many other things has meant that the Member States are now also small and inadequate and cannot respond to the current needs of the people."
"Therefore, the future path for the European Union cannot be resolved through the measures adopted in Nice: what is needed is fewer powers for the Member States and more for the European institutions."
"We need a Constitution, a Parliament, a European Government and a President elected by the people."
"Mr President, I voted for this report on the Treaty of Nice, which I have read with the eyes of a party secretary."
"You know that I am the secretary of a party which is not a party and is called the Pensioners' Party."
"I am convinced that, in the Treaty of Nice, there is an important point that we should develop, which is the point that favours the creation, maintenance and development of European political parties."
"Power, Mr President - I think perhaps you agree with me, or perhaps you do not - is very often in the hands of the parties."
"If we want a Europe we should also have European parties."
"Mr President, I have voted against this resolution from Méndez de Vigo and Seguro for many reasons, but particularly because of what happened this morning, namely the rejection of Amendment No 28."
"That proposed, quite modestly, to recognise in any debate on the future of Europe the political and legislative powers of the current 15 States."
"The problem is that this resolution is quite hypocritical in that even if it says that it recognises its commitment to upholding the rights and freedoms set out in the Charter, these freedoms, such as those in Article 4 of this Charter, are not defended inside the European Union, as can be seen in the case of torture in Spain."
"The Nice European Council, which was held from 8 to 11 December 2000, enabled the Intergovernmental Conference to make a certain amount of progress."
"In particular, the following are worthy of note:"
"Declaration 23 on the future of the Union, and the launching of a wide-ranging and in-depth debate;"
"the revision of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union on the respecting of fundamental rights in the Member States;"
"the loosening up of procedures, making it possible to engage in enhanced cooperation;"
"the increasing of the powers of the President of the Commission and his appointment by a qualified majority of the Council which, together with the recent proposals by the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, on the election of the latter, make it possible to reinforce considerably its legitimacy and therefore its authority."
"This resolution should encourage the Heads of State and Government to go even further, particularly by coming out in favour of the convocation of a convention like the one responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, whose participation in the next revision of the Treaties is essential."
"This convention will not limit itself to being merely a forum: we intend it to participate actively and authoritatively in the debate, and to draw up the next treaty in constitutional form."
"It is essential that the national parliaments should ratify the Treaty of Nice."
"The theory that there is a crisis in the recasting process which would justify a call for non-ratification is a myth which places enlargement at risk and makes it impossible to hold the necessary debate."
"Yesterday, in this House, we saw a good example of one of the methods habitually used in European affairs to cover up problems and to avoid subjecting them to public opinion."
"In the debate on the Treaty of Nice, almost the only thing discussed was the 'post-Nice' situation."
"All the federalist speakers raised their heads above the parapet, one after the other, to urge the setting up, at the next Council in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency (a presidency which, of course, is in favour of ultra-federalism), of a 'convention' which would open up a 'constitutive process' which was to produce a 'European federal constitution' which the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference would be called upon to adopt."
"Thus the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is regarded as a fait accompli."
"We are not even discussing it."
"The debate on 2004 has taken the place of the debate on Nice, and no doubt the debate on 2010 will only serve to cover up any debate on the future draft submitted for ratification in 2004."
"The result, in the short term, is that practically nobody has talked about Nice, and public opinion is still just as ignorant, except in Ireland, where they are holding a referendum, about the content of a very important treaty which will be stealthily submitted for ratification by their national parliaments."
"We published our alternative report on the Treaty of Nice to try to make sure that the debate in France avoids this legerdemain."
"In particular it must be emphasised absolutely that the Treaty of Nice as a whole is fundamentally opposed to the spirit and the letter of the French constitution, a spirit which is the spirit of national sovereignty."
"Some provisions even contradict it openly."
"For example, there is the introduction of integration as an objective for the Union and the Community (Article 43 of the EU Treaty), the introduction of uniform regulations and conditions governing Members of the European Parliament (Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty), the creation of regulations governing political parties at European level (Article 191 of the EC Treaty), the appointing of the Commission by a qualified majority (Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty), the approval by a qualified majority of certain international agreements on common foreign and security policy (Article 24 of the EU Treaty), the new measures taken, by majority vote, to introduce the euro (Articles 111 and 123(4) of the EC Treaty), the transfer to Community level of international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property (Article 133 of the EC Treaty), the inclusion of the Community in responsibility for modernising social security (Article 137 of the EC Treaty), or the creation, in vague terms, of a rapid-response military force (Article 17 of the EU Treaty)."
"It is absurd, in these circumstances, that at present the French government is not even considering bringing the matter to the attention of the Constitutional Council."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the report on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union."
"Despite its shortcomings, the Treaty of Nice deserves clear support, since it makes the EU ready for enlargement."
"This quality should not be underestimated."
"Up until the Intergovernmental Conference, we supported a so-called narrow agenda and also voted against the European Parliament' s very wide-ranging wishes."
"This will also be reflected in our voting on certain elements of this report, where we have voted against, e.g. the section on enhanced cooperation."
"The Intergovernmental Conference that ended in Nice showed that there are great deficiencies in the way in which the EU at present amends treaties."
"Like the rest of Parliament, we take a positive view of declaration 23 concerning the future of the European Union."
"However, we oppose large, centrally controlled information campaigns."
"Nonetheless, we are very concerned that there should be a general debate on the future of the Union in all the countries and in the EU, so that the next Intergovernmental Conference can be much better prepared than that which ended in Nice, with much greater openness in the decision-making process and an underlying basis of visionary ideas concerning the future of the EU."
"The implementation of a convention in the style of that which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year may be a positive contribution in this connection."
"Everyone is in agreement about the disappointing results of the last IGC, which are symptomatic of the limitations of the purely intergovernmental approach."
"The Heads of State and Government have in any case admitted this, in the Declaration on the future of the Union, which forms part of the annex to the Treaty."
"This finding has led the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to demand that the convocation of the new IGC (responsible for carrying out the next revision of the Treaties) should be based on a fundamentally different process, a process which is open and transparent."
"It proposes to take its inspiration from the effective and universally applauded method which enabled the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to be created."
"It would, therefore, be a matter of bringing together a convention that would be composed of Members of the European Parliament, members of national parliaments, members of the Commission and members of the governments of Member States."
"It would start meeting at the beginning of 2002, and would have the task of submitting to the IGC (to be held during the second half of 2003), a 'constitutional proposal' based on the results of a wide-ranging public debate."
"This constitutional process would have to result in the adoption of an EU Constitution."
"In addition, the report launches an appeal to national parliaments, urging them to undertake to support the idea of the convocation of such a convention when they are called upon to take a decision on the Treaty of Nice."
"Although the Treaty of Nice has given much cause for dissatisfaction, it has, nonetheless, removed the last formal obstacle to enlargement."
"Having said that, the accession of new Member States requires an in-depth revision of the way our institutions function, because those institutions have almost been brought to a standstill already, when we have only fifteen Member States."
"The debate is underway."
"Several political personalities have had an opportunity to make their contribution, but we must involve the greatest possible range of actors, together with all the citizens of Europe."
"I shall end by emphasising the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be integrated into the Treaty so as to make it obligatory."
"This would give a strong political signal to our fellow-citizens."
"In effect, we now have three years to create, finally, the institutions that will guarantee 'democracy' , transparency and citizenship at the service of a strong European social plan."
". I was present but did not participate in this vote."
"I wish to put on the record my support for the Treaty of Nice."
"However, with a referendum taking place in Ireland next week, I felt that it would not be appropriate to participate in this vote as it is broader than the text of the Treaty itself."
"I look forward to the ratification of the Treaty and then one should deal with the other issues raised."
"I support the enlargement of the EU and the adoption of this Treaty will remove the final block to that development."
"."
"We, Members from different parties in the GUE/NGL Group, have not voted in favour of the report concerning the post-Nice report."
"We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy, as the report in practice advocates."
"Instead of transforming the EU into a state, we are of the opinion that the Union must be democratised."
"Democratisation of the European Union must be achieved through a decreasing of the Commission's power and the introduction of openness and transparency into the legislative practices of the Council."
"The future debate about the European Union must also be about the role of the national parliaments in the future Europe."
"Today, political debate in Europe is focused on elections to the national parliaments (with the exception of the presidential elections in some states) and this can also be seen in the turnout in the different elections."
"The role of the national parliaments must be strengthened in decision-making in Europe."
"We further protest against the militarisation of the EU."
"We insist that the EU remain a civil organisation and that the non-aligned countries' special status is respected."
"We are of the opinion that the future Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU, reassessing the currency union's lack of democracy and its right-wing policies."
"We demand that the stability pact be reconsidered and Article 56 of the Treaty be rewritten in order to bring the ECB under democratic control."
". (ES) My vote in favour of the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report is based more on the proposal to overcome the limitations on the Union which still remain after the Treaty of Nice, rather than being in agreement with the Treaty itself."
"I agree with the critical view of the current Treaty, as there was a lack of ambition and political decisiveness needed to give it more political content and to improve the capacity for decision making and participation of the Community institutions, especially Parliament and the Commission, in order to overcome a method of operation that is becoming increasingly markedly intergovernmental."
"It is very bad that, even in the new areas on which it was agreed in Nice that decisions would be taken by qualified majority, the codecision procedure was not incorporated."
"Although I recognise that Nice made the positive contribution of enabling the enlargement process, I do not think that this is enough."
"In fact, the Member States recognised the limitations of Nice, convening a further IGC for themselves in order to revise the Treaty of Nice in 2004, with specific objectives that will have to be finally fixed in the meeting in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency, at the end of this year."
"I agree with the priorities that the Belgian Presidency has announced for this and, in particular, with incorporating the constitutional regions into the debating process on the content of the next Treaty."
"Of course, I defend the Brussels Declaration signed on Monday of this week by seven constitutional regions, of which Catalonia is one, and we need to ensure that the European regions with legislative powers participate in a very prominent way not only in the preparatory debate, first in Laeken and then at the IGC in 2004, but also in the decision-making processes on the policies of the Union."
"For the party and coalition represented by Convergència i Unió, this aspect is of fundamental importance in order to ensure that the citizens of the Union participate in it to a higher degree, and it is obvious that the constitutional regions are already an element of representation, responsibility and contribution on a European level that the Union cannot do without."
"I would like to reiterate my support for the proposal that the post-Nice debate should become a constitutional process, as this is the best option in order to clarify and fix the political content of the Union in the 21st Century."
". (ES) The need to provide the EU with instruments that can cope with the challenge of enlargement explains the importance of the institutional reform that should have taken place in Nice, and also the disappointment with the results that were achieved and, above all, with the lack of ambition and political will shown by the Heads of State and Government, who were more concerned with how to block decisions than with finding formulae that would enable us to move forward towards a shared future."
"It is true that some progress was made, but Nice is very far removed from what was expected and needed from it, as the reform agreed on does not serve to make a more efficient and democratic EU in view of enlargement, as is shown, moreover, by the annex on post-Nice that accompanies the final Treaty."
"Therefore, the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report should have been more emphatic, because it was important for Parliament to highlight the inadequacies of Nice and send a clear signal about this, which is why I also regret that some of the amendments tabled that were going in that direction did not stand."
"But aside from this, the report contains some aspects, above all regarding the need to use a method similar to the Convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the need to begin a constitutional process culminating in the adoption of the European Union Constitution, which made me inclined to vote in favour of it, despite my conviction that Nice was a wasted opportunity."
"."
"The state of permanent constitutional upheaval which is a characteristic of the contemporary EU is a major shortcoming in our constitutional arrangements."
"With the Treaty of Nice, coming so soon after the Treaty of Amsterdam and to be followed by another IGC in 2004 we live in an Age of Permanent Revolution."
"There are signs that this successor IGC may achieve a degree of constitutional settlement which is much to be welcomed and to reach it, it is necessary to pass through the Treaty of Nice despite its self-evident shortcomings."
". (FR) The outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice falls well short of what the people and the nations of Europe were expecting."
"First of all, priority should have been given to the content of the European Union and primarily to the question of fulfilling the needs and the rights of all citizens."
"There should have been a debate about a real charter of social rights and freedoms, rather than about ratifying a cut-price charter of fundamental freedoms."
"Once the question of content had been raised, the next question to be tackled should have been the question of the equitable funding of European policies, in particular a review of taxation and a demand for democratic management mechanisms that would satisfy those needs."
"Taxes on capital (Tobin-type taxes) and sanctions on companies that make staff redundant while they are making profits would have been a step in the right direction."
"We now come to the question of the container."
"Europe must equip itself with the means to ensure genuine democracy with reference to all the major issues at stake in our society, while respecting the diversity of the peoples of Europe, yet at the same time allowing the emergence of a European citizenship."
"We must give our workers and our citizens the means of joining in the debate, and influencing issues concerning employment rights and economic choices, placing the governments and the European Central Bank under control."
"The Treaty of Nice is diametrically opposed to this approach, as are the policies proposed by this report."
"This is why I have voted against."
". (DE) I would have liked to vote for the motion for a resolution on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union, with our group's proposals for amendments, if I had had the opportunity to make it clear, through a recorded vote, which points I cannot support under any circumstances."
"I do not believe - in common with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, incidentally - that we should have a European Constitution as long as there are individual states with their own constitutions and as long as there is no European nation."
"Nor am I one of those people who regret the fact that at Nice, the rules on qualified majority voting were not extended to taxation."
"We have not yet reached a stage where an accidental majority in this House could agree, over the heads of the national parliaments, the types and levels of taxation to be levied by the Member States."
"I would therefore have wished to vote against this provision in a recorded vote as well."
"In this House, I have always supported the principle that decisions on fundamental and constitutional matters must be unanimous."
"I would therefore have liked to vote, in a recorded vote, against the paragraph which states - quite incorrectly - that this would undermine the social and political deepening of the Union."
"In order to make my views on this issue very clear, I was unable to vote for the resolution as a whole."
"My colleagues and I in the French delegation of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted against the Treaty of Nice, but since others who also voted against it did so for different reasons, we feel it is essential to explain our reasons, so as to make things quite clear."
"We did not vote against the Treaty of Nice because it did not go far enough, as the more rampant supporters of federalism believe. Nor did we vote against it because it went too far, a complaint voiced among a certain number of schizophrenics who secretly dream of reversing the whole process."
"However, although we are extremely concerned by some of the suggestions that are still being made before this House as soon as there is any mention of the prospect of any further abandoning of sovereignty on the part of the nation states which are the Member States of the Union, we were, nonetheless, pleasantly surprised by some parts of the final version."
"This was because, on the one hand, at a functional level, it strongly curbs the supranational trend which seeks to bring us, as rapidly as possible, to the total obliteration of States, in favour of a bulimic and uncontrollable Commission, and because, on the other hand, it goes beyond the somewhat petty reservations of some people and persists in preparing for enlargement, thereby reminding us that, before being a standardised and uniform single market, Europe is, in principle and above all, a political structure in which, of course, the peoples of Eastern and Central Europe and the Mediterranean, despite being excluded at the moment, of course have their place."
"In spite of these sensible reactions, however, the Treaty of Nice was unable to escape from the logic, so fatal to the democracies and peoples of Europe, that in accordance with Declaration 23 on the post-Nice process, the European Union should be committed to a 'constitutional' movement which can only lead to a European federal state, the affirmation and future functioning of which are totally incompatible with the continued existence of nation states, whatever the two heads of the French Government, Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin, might think."
"Moreover, even though political semantics has already had to accommodate other strange bedfellows which are just as incongruous as this impossible idea of a federation of nation States (we only have to think back to the hilarious concept of democratic centralism), history teaches us that, in the end, people will no longer put up with being abused by what is, at best a tragic error, and, at worst, an unforgivable lie."

". (NL) The Nice summit focused on EU enlargement, but definitely not on a more democratic and transparent decision-making process in the EU."
"Instead of finally moving towards subscribing to the European Treaty on Human Rights a Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union was proclaimed, with a completely unclear status."
"Although the Council long ago lost its raison d' être as the guardian of national interests, and only plays a part as a guarantee for secrecy and chaos, voting relations within that body turned out to be still more important than the input of the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Nice makes the European labyrinth no less impenetrable and more durable."
"When it shortly has a possible 30-plus Member States the complex and obscure decision-making of the EU will become hopelessly bogged down."
"I therefore argue for a different model, without a Council but with more influence for voters."
"The European Commission makes proposals, the European Parliament takes the final decision and the national parliaments then individually decide whether their Member State will be bound by that decision."
"It is not a supranational or supranational model, but an interparliamentary one, focused on recognition of democracy and diversity instead of on a multiethnic society that leaves the real decisions to multinationals and NATO. The rapporteur does not offer that alternative."
"Therefore I myself and a large section of my group will be voting against."
"."
"The Labour Members of the Socialist Group welcome the Treaty of Nice which opens the way to enlargement of the European Union, an objective which all Member States of the Union have sought, as have successive British governments."
"The idea that the Treaty of Nice makes the European Union a centralised superstate is nonsense and was rightly dismissed as ridiculous in the debate yesterday."
"This resolution acknowledges that the last remaining institutional obstacles to enlargement have been removed and we welcome that."
"It also looks at the need for further reform, to which Labour is committed in order to make the European Union more effective, more transparent and more accountable."
"Nonetheless, the resolution contains some criticisms of the Treaty of Nice which are unfounded and also contains some proposals for the future which pre-empt the debate on the future of Europe due to take place over the coming years."
"Some of these proposals are premature and some are unlikely ever to be desirable; for this reason, the Labour Members decided to abstain on this text."
"- (SV) The main task of the European Council in Nice was to make EU enlargement possible."
"All 15 national parliaments in the Member States will ratify the Treaty of Nice in 2001, regardless of the fact that the majority of members of the European Parliament appear to be dissatisfied with it."
"Therefore, we Swedish Christian Democrats believe that paragraph 42 of today' s report, which addresses issues such as the European Parliament' s assent to the accession treaties, could be worded so as to be much more positive and welcoming."
"How will this point be received by Estonia, Poland and Cyprus, for example?"
"My party cannot approve paragraph 25 of today' s report, which opens the way for the introduction of a European level of tax, and what is more with decision-making rules based on qualified majority voting."
"All experience shows that new levels of decision-making for taxation lead to higher taxes and less money left for the citizens of the EU, whom we represent."
"Another key issue, apart from tax law, when it comes to the decision-making ability of each national parliament and government is defence policy."
"Therefore, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party also cannot approve paragraph 31 of the report in question which demands that defence policy be included in 'enhanced cooperation' or ""flexible integration"" ."
"We Swedish Christian Democrats are happy about two proposals in the report for historic and vital improvements."
"The first concerns improvements to the opportunity for citizens and national parliaments to access information about, and to monitor, the Council' s work, by making the meetings of the Council of Ministers open when the Council is adopting legislation."
"This is an issue which I have consistently brought up in the European Parliament' s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and for which I have found increasing support."
"This is now also the common view of Parliament as a whole."
"If it is to be possible to talk in terms of democracy - and not just diplomacy - within the EU, this openness must be achieved, i.e. we recommend approval of paragraph 11 of the resolution and Amendment 68."
"The second proposal is about applying and refining the principle of subsidiarity."
"There is no single European people, but a great many."
"There is no single European mother tongue, but a great many."
"There is no single European nation, but a great many."
"There is no single European culture, but a great many."
"Bearing in mind these circumstances, along with fundamental values such as human rights, democracy, openness, clarity in calls for political responsibility and guarantees of cultural and linguistic equality within the EU, the Swedish Christian Democrats welcome Amendment 77 on clearly delimiting the EU' s political competencies."
"This is fully in line with the fact that citizens do not want increased distance from the decision-makers and increasing European political centralisation."
"As always, European integration is proceeding by a series of tests and necessary measures."
"The essential test which it has inflicted upon itself for the next few years, and which is also a historical imperative, is, of course, the task of opting to reconcile the geography of the continent with its history, and to carry on with the enlargement which will now enable democratisation and considerable economic reforms to take place in the Central and Eastern European Countries."
"The Treaty of Nice, which the Méndez de Vigo report tackles and comments on with great honesty and rigour, is first of all a substantial political choice by a Europe which is finally reunited on the question of its founding values of democracy, freedom, solidarity and culture."
"This is a considerable political ambition for our future, which on its own would justify the ratification of the Treaty of Nice, though it has to be admitted that the Treaty has not provided us with the institutional reforms to enable us to exercise, democratically and consistently, a European political power which is held by at least twenty-seven countries."
"The difficulty in reaching agreement at Nice, even among fifteen countries, on the future institutions of the Union, is proof, if proof were needed, of the limitations of the inter-governmental approach in a Union consisting of an even greater number of Member States."
"This is why I welcome the fact that our rapporteur is proposing to create a convention, based on the convention which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in order to make preliminary plans for and to propose to a future IGC a Constitution for the Europe of the future."
"This step, let us not deny it, will constitute a historic moment in European integration, and its task will be to link our peoples and their future in a way which will be irreversible."
"This is why a democratic and public debate, a debate which is open to all our peoples, must precede this pre-constitutional stage, so as to remove any ambiguities about the kind of Europe that we want to build together."
"Is it to be a political Europe or a business Europe?"
"Is it to be a powerful Europe or a club of countries paralysed by the rule of consensus?"
"The public debate decided on at Nice, and the convention method which we have just affirmed here, are the conditions for this imperative, which is to render more democratic the debate on Europe and what is at stake in Europe."
"Despite the respect I have for the rapporteur Mr Méndez de Vigo, today I voted no to his report on the Treaty of Nice; however, this does not mean a no to Europe."
"The Irish people have not been allowed an adequate debate on the impact of the changes proposed in the Treaty of Nice upon Ireland' s sovereignty and Independence."
"This Treaty does not have to be decided on until the end of 2002, yet the Irish Government is pressurising the Irish people to vote, although they have only had approximately three weeks to digest the minimum information provided to them. The Irish electorate has the right to know what the consequences of the Treaty are for the people of Ireland and Europe as a whole, including candidate countries."
"In a recent national poll, nine out of ten Irish people stated that they did not understand the Treaty of Nice and voter apathy is extremely high."
"This situation I have no doubt is reflected in other Member states and surely it is not the way to engage citizens to feel politically concerned at local, national and European level."
"There are many areas of concern within the Treaty of Nice for a small nation, some of which are: that Ireland cannot be part of enhanced co-operation because of its corporate and energy tax policies; the future loss of veto, the only sure means by which a small country can influence decisions and protect its interests; the undermining of Ireland's neutrality in an increasingly militarised Europe, in which the Treaty of Nice brings an army, called the Rapid Reaction Force, associated with NATO and a military command structure into the EU for the first time."
"There is also the deepest concern with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, clearly intended to be legally binding in 2004, as a constitution or constitution-treaty, which through the decisions of the EU Court of Justice could take precedence over our Irish Constitution and our Courts."
"Our Constitution is a finely crafted document, which enshrines the values and beliefs that have sustained the people of Ireland through the best and worst of times."
"It enshrines among other things the constitutional protection of life, marriage and family and should not be vulnerable to decisions made without the full, informed consent of the Irish people."
"Sadly the Christian foundations and heritage of the European Union are conspicuous by their absence from the Charter."
"Surely an Europe which strives to be a Continental power, proud of its economic progress and intellectual capital should not be afraid to acknowledge its spiritual dimension, a dimension which will lend us strength as we work towards peace and security."
"The federalists' anger over the Treaty of Nice, which is scrupulously echoed in the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, is, initially, surprising because, far from being a change in direction, far from initiating a fundamental reform of the European integration process which would facilitate the harmonious reunification of our continent, the Treaty of Nice actually uses enlargement as a new excuse and incitement to introduce more supranationality, more centralisation and more of the super-State."
"The Treaty of Nice therefore fits in perfectly well with the ideological approach of its predecessors."
"It strengthens the supranational institutions and creates new elements of supranationality such as the European political parties or the uniform regulations applying to MEPs."
"For the first time it lays down in the Treaties the objective of integration, applying it not only at Community level but also, and there is nothing to stop this ideology, at intergovernmental level too."
"Why, then, is there such an outcry, within this old hotbed of federalism, the European Parliament, against a Treaty which boldly displays the predominant federalist philosophy?"
"Could it be, as Georges Berthu has given us to understand, that with Nice we find ourselves confronted with the expression of a new phase of federalism, which is an even more radical departure from the 'state' component, in favour of the component consisting of numbers, of population size?"
"Does this mean, in particular the reweighting of votes within the Council and the Commission, which is closely linked to population levels, and the concept of the demographic verification clause, that the European institutions are being redesigned in such a way as to ensure that the concepts of equilibrium and equality will be obliterated, and their place taken by the domination of those states or groups of states which have the largest populations?"
"If this is true, then we would be heading towards a Europe no longer consisting of equal, and equally respected, states, but a Europe consisting of unequal peoples."
"If we are to halt this dangerous trend, calling on the old federalism to combat the new federalism is certainly not the right way to go about it."
"In order to escape the antidemocratic trends that threaten it, we must rethink European integration, basing it on respect for national democracies."
"(Speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I decided to vote against the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report, although I am a convinced European and I care about the future of the European Union."
"However, I do not think that the preamble offers any real guarantee on conditions for an enlargement that will be fair to all the countries involved."
"In addition, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be binding means that it will not be possible to provide a solid framework for a Europe in which the issue of the greatest deprivation of rights must remain a priority, for example the protection of workers from the arrogance of certain employers."
"Finally, the absence of any clear affirmation of the equality of social, economic and political rights between foreigners or immigrants and European nationals worries me enormously, at a time when the sudden upsurge in the populist xenophobic vote is setting the heart of Europe ablaze, in Austria, Lombardy, Italy and Switzerland, when we see the extreme violence of the ultra-right and extremist movements in Germany, or of the hooligans in Great Britain, or when we consider the fate of thousands of people living in our countries without papers, who are at the mercy of those who traffic in human misery in all its forms."
"These are serious shortcomings. As for the lack of action following the election violence in Spain, described as a pogrom by commentators, this is not worthy of Europe."
"Finally, the fact that the dimension of a Europe turning towards the countries of the south, in particular Africa which is sinking into economic, health and ecological misery, is not really a matter of priority, the fact that there is no provision for simply abolishing the debts of third-world countries and increasing aid to those countries, and also the lack of any thoughts as to how to restore equilibrium between the CFA franc and the dollar, the yen and the euro, all these things will serve only to increase the growing imbalance."
"The fact that the IMF and the World Bank have admitted their responsibility surely means that the development of Africa deserves to be made a priority, in view of our colonial history."
"This does not, of course, detract from the serious work of the rapporteurs and the recent declarations by the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, which both point in the direction of a more fraternal, mutually supportive and just Europe, but which seem to contradict the positions taken up by Mr Schröder and Mr Blair."
"Our Europe deserves a Treaty of Nice which is along the lines of the recent declarations, or at least closer to the declarations of the two heads of the French Government."
"The Treaty of Nice has confirmed the absence of any political, democratic and open plan for European integration."
"On the question of enlargement, the only option proposed is to take from the south in order to give to the east, while at the same time trying to reduce the funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"If we want enlargement to be more than just an expansion of the market and of the euro zone, Europe must direct its efforts towards the Structural Funds, with the aim of reducing development disparities by assisting the least developed regions of the Union."
"The present level of funding is insufficient, not only because of the needs of the new populations which are to become integrated into the EU, but also because intolerable inequalities still persist within the Union as it is today."
"Any new European plan will have to be accompanied by a radical transformation in the thinking behind the CAP."
"The small farmers of Eastern Europe must be able to be included in this redefinition of the CAP (jobs, regional planning, environmental considerations, solidarity with small farmers in the third world, productivism, a subsidies policy that encourages exports)."
"Lastly, enlargement cannot be successful if Europe does not place social issues at the heart of the process, in particular the issue of the living and working conditions of the various peoples."
"This report tackles the question of enlargement almost exclusively from the point of view of the EU institutions, without identifying as a precondition for enlargement the essential agreement and commitment of the peoples and populations concerned."
"Myller Report (A5-175/2001)"
"I would like to justify why the Group of the European People' s Party voted against the Myller report while saying that we fully support the project and the Commission' s Environment Action Programme."
"The Commission drew up an excellent, very balanced and scientific programme, with a great sense of the future, and which aimed to be a document that would arrive in Johannesburg with all the dignity of Europe, proclaiming a viable, feasible environmental policy that is accessible to all and can be implemented and made a reality."
"However, here in Parliament many amendments have been introduced."
"As a group, we cannot accept any of them."
"As a group, in order to demonstrate our willingness, we have broadened the usual horizons of the environment and we have added very clear support for the urban environment, which did not previously exist, we have increased interest in the countryside and the rural environment, we have also supported municipal participation, which did not feature in the proposal, and we have also supported public health with great enthusiasm."
"However, we find that measures have been introduced which are impossible for citizens to comply with."
"The level has been raised so high that it is impossible even for the enlargement countries to achieve it."
"We think that we need to govern with our heads and with a spirit of solidarity towards the citizens."
"We cannot impose things so that we, the Members, get the credit, and profess to belong to the 'greenest' group of all, while it is causing major problems for the people."
"For example, with regard to labelling, complying with the standard would require all companies, including the smallest ones, to have a large amount of bureaucracy devoted to filling in labels, and small companies would have to take out civil liability insurance."
"It would be crazy what the people would have to do if these measures had to be applied."
"As far as taxes are concerned, a general European tax would fall on the poorest people, those who live outside the cities, etc. For all of these reasons, we voted against the report because we defend the people and a viable and common sense model."
"Mr President, the Myller report as it has been submitted to us to vote on, is a report without a concrete plan of action."
"The vagueness that characterises the report contains the danger of focussing only on a number of eyecatching items, such as the introduction of the CO2 tax and the Kyoto standard."
"This report therefore overlooks the central question and specifically the question of how the environment can be better protected than has been the case up to now."
"Thus far, concentration has been focused mainly on raising charges rather than offering concrete incentives to live in a more environmentally aware way."
"In addition they are completely neglecting the absolute necessity of achieving harmonisation at international level, because for as long as we are incapable of doing that, it will create a negative effect, mainly for Europe, and it will prove an obstacle to trade."
"For all these reasons, I abstained in the vote."
"Mr President, I too voted against the Myller report, but not for the reasons that Cristina Gutiérrez explained so well just now."
"I often happen to talk to elderly people and pensioners and so I have also discussed the environment with them, which we have regulated so much here in this beautiful chamber in Brussels and in the even more beautiful and larger chamber in Strasbourg."
"In our conversations they have expressed a doubt, a problem."
"They have told me, 'With your reports, with your environmental programmes, to whom are you trying to give good, clean air to breathe, for whom are you trying to have beautiful countryside, for whom are you trying to make life better?"
"The young, the middle-aged, the old?'"
"Here it is, then: what I see as missing in these plans is the objective of having a clean environment for the elderly, who are the ones who need it most."
"If the environment can be clean and accessible for the elderly, it will also be so for those who are young like you, Mr President."
"The French socialist delegation has always defended and encouraged the strengthening of the existing positive relationship between agriculture and the environment."
"This is why we support the general objectives of the Myller report."
"However, we cannot accept the fact that an attempt is being made, in the guise of an amendment (Amendment No 150), to call into question the very elements which form the basis of the CAP."
"We cannot answer for the replacement of production aids."
"Today' s CAP no longer bears any resemblance to the policy of forty years ago; it has been fundamentally reformed."
"We wish to continue that work, but not in an insidious manner."
"Changes in direction are now possible and desirable."
"We support them, but we cannot rubber-stamp this amendment, which would lead to the calling into question of a whole section of the CAP without integrating it into the overall change of direction."
". As a member of the Environment Committee of the European Parliament, I hope that the United States Government and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of greenhouse gases."

"I am fully aware of the preparation of the European Union for the World Summit on Sustainable Development which is being held in South Africa in the year 2002."
"I support the four lines of action that have been drawn up by the European Commission in the preparation for this World Summit."
"The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of economic development, to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency, promote the sustainable use of water land and energy as well as try and ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation is broken."
"I also welcome the fact that the European Commission recognises that the best approach to take to ensure the successful implementation of these action goals is best agreed under the framework of the United Nations."
"Ten years after the crucial Rio de Janeiro Summit, expectations have not been met."
"The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world."
"We must all redouble our efforts so as to be sure that next year' s World Summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a matter which protects existing communities."
"The Community' s Fifth Environment Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution."
"Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environment Action Programme would not be attained easily, the Commission has rightly decided on a step by step approach setting out so- called interim environmental targets by the year 2010."
"The Environment Committee of the European Parliament will continue to play an important co-ordinating role in this regard."

"- (FR) We voted in favour of the Myller report because we believe it goes in the right direction and gives an overall impression of the policies which should be followed in the context of environmental protection."
"It is important that the concept of sustainable development should be taken into account at all levels of decision making and in all sectors."
"Governments (European, national, regional and local) are also called upon to integrate these considerations."
"Businesses have a major share of responsibility for the current problems."
"However, we must not forget that the public has enormous power, via demand, and it can therefore guide environmental considerations in relation to business investment."
"One of our priorities must continue to be making the public at large more aware."
"In addition, and despite the fact that the environment knows no geographical boundaries, it is essential that the European legislators should respect the principle of subsidiarity, in other words, they should not over-regulate at European level, but should leave it to the national authorities to define sustainable development at local level, since it is a concept which includes not only environmental protection but also the economic and social context which is essential to human beings."
"This is why we did not vote in favour of certain amendments which we felt exceeded the bounds of this context."
"I voted against."
"The purpose of this action programme is to define objectives, to establish a basis for reflection, and to ensure the success of future Community projects in this area."
"Together with many of my colleagues in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I took up a firm position on this report."
"At first-reading, it is necessary to send a strong signal so that, when it comes to the second reading, improved consistency, the right balance and a realistic vision can be found."
"The report that we are voting on today will cause difficulties."
"The objectives that it sets out are too precise. They will lead to a lack of flexibility, and will completely block forthcoming Community initiatives."
"This applies when it comes to setting ecotaxes, or defining too precisely how the CAP is to be reformed, although I believe that reform to be desirable."
"Then again, some amendments go against directives which have already been adopted by the European Parliament, or else they place too many restrictions around those that we shall be considering in the near future."
"This applies in the case of environmental responsibility."
"A report such as this must allow the flexibility necessary to adapt European projects in line with developments in scientific research and technical progress."
"- (FR) We shall be voting in favour of Mrs Myller' s report, amongst other things because it highlights the basic problem posed by the Council' s proposals on the sixth Community Environment Action Programme."
"The intentions, ambitions and priorities of those proposals are often praiseworthy, but the clarification of the objectives (what exactly is sustainable development?) and the definition of the policies, the resources and the time scales, are still extremely vague."
"When it is a question of imposing liberal economic reforms and defending the individual interests of private financial powers, the Council issues restrictive regulations."
"When it comes to facing up to the ecological crisis and thereby defending the collective interests of the population, all it does is issue very general professions of faith."
"The contrast is striking, and it is not difficult to understand."
"The ecological crisis, which is now of human origin, is fuelled by the predatory behaviour of this liberal capitalism which the Council is in favour of."
"The implementation of a policy of sustainable development requires a radical change of direction in the area of economics, a change of direction which the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties seek to prohibit in the name of commercial competition, employers' rights and freedom for private investment."
"There are two alternatives: defending large shareholders on the one hand, and ecological requirements (as well as other, more numerous, social needs) on the other."
". (NL) Environmental pollution is the work of human beings."
"Instead of dividing the existing yield of our natural resources more fairly, we strove for ever-increasing returns in order to make everyone less poor or even richer."
"Air, water and soil pollution together with soil erosion, floods and landslides are a cross-border problem, that we should wish to solve even without the existence of a European Union."
"The listing of objectives and means as a way to achieving this in a programme of action is a first step. Even if it concerns painful means, such as Amendment No 21, which puts an end to subsidies for the use of coal."
"The next step is to crush the opposition of those who still regard opting for the environment as harmful to their own interests."
"Some States and some large corporations still regard profit and growth as much more important."
"The US government and the oil companies that helped to bring that government to power do not regard it as their concern that climate change will result in the expansion of seas and deserts, so that a portion of the land area of the earth will become uninhabitable."
"I see the sixth Environment Action Programme, and especially the tightening up of ends and means proposed by the rapporteur and the three draftsmen, as a signal that the European people do not wish to resign themselves to the impotence that America is trying to impose on us."
"Hedkvist Petersen Report (A5-0141/2001)"
"Mr President, with regard to this report on safety belts, something has come to my mind."
"Would you, Mr President, throw yourself off a bridge with an elastic cord tied to your feet, as so many young people do these days?"
"I do not think so."
"I certainly would not!"
"Yet just think, Mr President, that one of the people elected to the Italian Parliament, who yesterday took part in the first meeting of the Lower House, is an Italian TV presenter, an attractive, pleasant, famous woman, Gabriella Carlucci - who is now Gabriella Carlucci MP - who has jumped off a crane with an elastic cord tied to her feet."
"Well, I think we should not set examples of rashness and dangerous living if we then want to implement directives requiring all of us to be strapped into our cars more safely."
"The report which we have voted on today at first reading is concerned with a legislative proposal to amend Directive 91/671/EEC."
"This directive, it has to be admitted, made a contribution to road safety in the European Union, inasmuch as it made it compulsory to wear safety belts and to use child restraint systems."
"Such provisions are essential as they make it possible to reduce the severity of injuries in the case of an accident."
"Research into accidents has shown that, for children who are not restrained by an appropriate system, the risk of being seriously injured is seven times higher than for those who are restrained."
"However, it would seem essential to revise this ten-year-old text."
"Under current legislation, for example, children less than three years of age can use an ordinary rear-seat belt."
"As the father of young children, I am in a good position to condemn this state of affairs, which places their health and their lives at risk."
"The restraint systems currently available on the market are sufficiently well designed to enable their use to be made compulsory."
"The use of child restraint systems must therefore be further harmonised and made more certain."
"The Commission' s proposal also extends the scope of the directive by including in it the wearing of a safety belt, by the driver and seated passengers, in all motor vehicles which are suitably equipped."
"This proposal, though satisfactory, is not sufficiently precise."
"That is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism wanted to provide additional details."
"These include the launching of an information campaign about the danger posed by an air bag to a child transported in a rear-facing safety seat fitted to the front passenger seat of a vehicle."
"With regard to safety conditions for children less than 12 years old, I believe, like the rapporteur, that it is more logical to take their height into account rather than their weight, because they do not need special restraints if they are at least 150 cm tall."
"Ensuring the safety of our children is a collective responsibility. I therefore voted for all the amendments which work towards that end."
". (NL) First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, for her work and express my support for this report on the amending of Regulation 91/671/EC."
"This will make safety belt systems compulsory in cars up to 3.5 tons. Backward facing child seats will also be forbidden unless the airbag is disabled and passengers will have to wear belts in every vehicle fitted with them."
"My group is gratified that her amendments have been adopted."
"As a result child seats will apply to children not only below twelve but are also shorter than 150 cm."
"There is also demand for an ""airbag information campaign"" to warn against transporting children in seats when the air bag is activated."
"""Smart"" airbags might be a solution."
"And finally the manufacturer should give the consumer better information on which seats are best suited to children."
"The principal aim of the regulation is to reduce the inconsistencies caused by difference in application of the present ordinance in the Member States."
"As a result the regulation will become more transparent and more predictable."
"Problems in intracommunal traffic will be solved because legislation in the Member States will be brought into line."
"There was some discussion on the question to what extent this regulation is a community power or a power of the Member States."
"After studying this question of subsidiarity carefully, I believe that European legislation is required here to increase transparency in the field of compulsory seat belts and seatbelt use."
"It is a shared competence based on Article 251 of the Treaty."
"The fragmented legislation in the Member States cannot be tackled by the implementation of a uniform Regulation at community level."
"Hautala Report (A5-173/2001)"
"Following the discussions which led to this report, my group helped to improve the Commission' s proposal, by means of amendments which were legally sound, progressive, in the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in line with the directive, and which, above all, would not lead to any increase in bureaucracy for employers, Unfortunately, in spite of compromises, with which we were largely in agreement, the rapporteur and other groups, without consulting us, introduced further amendments which called the compromises into question and which culminated in the tabling of a so-called Compromise Amendment No 70."
"On this point, I should like to point out that, while I agree with the idea that one should not discriminate against fathers either, the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this amendment because there will always be a difference between 'maternity' and 'paternity' ."
"Unless the present order of things changes, men cannot become pregnant and cannot, therefore, give birth."
"Moreover, this amendment is something of a muddle, so that those of us who like good, solid, legal texts cannot agree to it."
"As far as the final voting is concerned, many of us were unable to vote in favour of the report because, against our wishes, amendments such as Amendments Nos 4, 36 and 44 were adopted."
"As the Commissioner has said, they are unacceptable because they ignore the most basic procedures, and in particular the provisions of the Treaty."
"If this Parliament is a co-legislator, it should not confuse a legislative text with a resolution, in which one can reveal all kinds of wishful thinking."
"A legislative text must be capable of implementation."
"Let us not forget, either, that in seeking to give women at work all-round protection, we run the risk of impairing and endangering their access to employment and their chances of promotion."
"Please, let us stop getting so worked up over sexual harassment, and finally, in this area as in others, let us not ignore the principle of subsidiarity."
"These are the reasons why many of the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this report."
"I await the second reading, and I hope that the wisdom of the Council will be brought to bear on the irrational proposals which we have adopted."
"Mr President, I voted for this report."
"In fact, I am in favour of all measures that bring equality of treatment between men and women."
"On the subject of men and women, I should like to say something about the presence of women in the national parliaments."
"In the newly elected Italian Parliament, the number of women has fallen: thus we are going backwards."
"I now want to appeal to Mr Berlusconi, who will head the Italian government."
"Mr Berlusconi, is it really true that there will be no women ministers in the new Italian government?"
"I hope not!"
"Even if there is just one single woman minister, it will mean that Mr Berlusconi has listened to my explanation of vote, which will make me very happy."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate the excellent work done by Mrs Hautala."
"She has taken the first step, but after hearing Commissioner Diamantopoulou, we can expect new important steps to improve current EU legislation in this field."
"I think most people in Europe would consider today's vote on this subject as one of the most important steps towards raising the credibility of this House."
"Probably we have done more today to promote the European Parliament than all the euros spent on this institution's official propaganda."
"Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Berlusconi will listen to me and take up the invitation I made to him just now in my last explanation of vote, but I must say that Mr Prodi, the President of the European Commission, has listened to my sister, Anna Maria Fatuzzo, concerning this document."
"Why, you may ask."
"While talking to my sister Anna Maria about the European Community budget yesterday in Rome, she said to me, 'As I see it, you ought to have more funds in your budget."
"Europe ought to have more money.'"
"You will not believe it, Mr President, but, the next day, all the papers in Italy - and I think all over Europe - reported the declaration by President Prodi calling for a tax, paid specifically by the citizens, called a 'tax for Europe' : not an extra tax - which is something I would not agree with - but for European funds to be financed by means of a quota of the taxes paid by European citizens."
"It might be better if you had my sister Anna Maria come here: perhaps, as she is a woman, she would be listened to more than I am!"
"Clearly, Mr Fatuzzo, not everyone can vote here."
". (PT) This report enables us to go into greater depth on the initial proposals for the revision of Directive 76/207/EEC on ensuring equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions, extending its scope to cover all aspects of equality concerning the professional life of women, in an attempt to make a positive contribution to changing the countless forms of discrimination that still remain in the world of employment."
"During the preparatory debate, we made our contributions, specifically by tabling amendments arising from working meetings in Portugal with union activists in sectors in which women make up a large part of the workforce, such as commerce and services, textile industries, the garment and shoe-making industries and the electrical and electronic components sectors."
"Not all of our proposals were adopted but something of their spirit is implicit in the report, particularly in terms of the need to prevent any discrimination against female workers on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity leave, in terms of the need to adopt the necessary measures for reconciling family and working life and in terms of greater restrictions on opportunities for any discrimination in access to employment."
"The report also contains a whole raft of positive amendments in the field of fighting sexual harassment in the workplace and of protecting measures for prevention and for positive action for protecting equality while discrimination continues to exist."
"This is why we have voted in favour of the report."
"I abstained, because many of the amendments adopted have little to do with the original purpose of this text."
"The European Parliament has already had an opportunity to say what it thinks about the issues of equality of opportunity and the special nature of women in a social and professional context, and I am pleased about that."
"However, if we keep on overdoing it, we run the risk of producing exactly the opposite effect to the one we are seeking, and of producing real discrimination against women."
"What will be the attitude of the managers of small and medium-sized undertakings when they are faced with increasingly restrictive rules and regulations?"
"Will they not prefer to take on men rather than women?"
"Is that what we want?"
"Protecting women does not mean imposing increasingly rigid and restricting rules. It means, above all, subscribing to firm principles, at the same time authorising the flexibility made necessary by the constraints of the job."
"The Hautala report' s amendments to the old directive on equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, and working conditions are, to a great extent, progressive."
"The inclusion of positive action in favour of women, the distinctions made between direct and indirect discrimination, the definition of sexual harassment, and the claim that women, at the end of their maternity leave or after adopting or fostering a child, should have the right to go back to their own job in the same way as men do when they have been on leave, all these are intended to combat discrimination and to achieve greater equality between women and men in the workplace."
"We now need to tackle the question of the initial training which, via our schools, accustoms children, from a very early age, to the sexual division of tasks and thus to the inequalities which we find in the world of work and which these amendments are intended to combat."
"In the same way, we must also introduce and integrate compulsory measures to ensure that the laws or directives adopted are fully complied with."
"For example, in France, despite the equal rights laid down by law, the difference in pay between men and women is still, on average, 27%."
"It was with reference to real equality that we supported the Hautala report."
"Dell'Alba Report (A5-0176/2001)"
". I supported Amendments Nos 14 and 179 of the above report."
"Although the report does not concern the public's right of access to the institutions' documents, the Commission text seems to introduce a new and ill-defined exception to access to documents, namely ""interests of the Union"", which could negatively affect the Parliament's right to documents."
"I believe that the Commission's proposal, in the parts which Amendments 14 and 179 seek to amend, is in conflict with the recently adopted regulation on Article 255 (Public access to documents)."
"This regulation states that ""All rules concerning access to documents of the institutions should be in conformity"" with the recently adopted regulation (Recital 12)."
"For more than thirty years, the finances of the European Communities and the European Union have followed the unchanging rhythm of the Financial Regulation, if one disregards implementation measures, and some seventeen years will have passed before the plan to reform that regulation is completed."
"The proposed reform of the Financial Regulation applicable to the budget of the Union, which the European Commission is submitting to the Council of Ministers, is certainly one of the major texts of this legislature, a text which will govern the finances of Europe for a long time to come."
"That shows just how important the new version of this text, which we have before us today, will be to the future of the European Union."
"There are six vital areas covered by this unprecedented reform proposal: the reaffirmation of the principles of budgetary law, the execution of the budget, markets and subsidies, accounting and the presentation of accounts, external measures of the European Union, and other major aspects such as the discharge procedure, the EAGGF Guarantee Section, the Structural Funds, research and development, OLAF and administrative appropriations."
"On 16 May, the Committee on Budgets, when adopting Mr Dell'Alba' s draft report, pointed out, quite rightly, that the fact that the Financial Regulation takes precedence over all other financial rules and regulations should be explained in its enacting terms."
"It also requested, we believe with good reason, that the budget heading to which receipts are allocated should be clearly defined, as should the purpose of the appropriations."
"The Committee also expressed itself in favour of integrating into the Community budget all the European Agencies, including future agencies."
"However, to integrate these agencies into the annual vote of the budget authority would have the effect of making them lose their autonomy, despite the fact that they were created precisely to be autonomous, and the European Parliament already votes on their annual subsidy and their discharge."
"Again, as far as these agencies are concerned, it is worth pointing out, quite apart from the fact that they ought to remain independent, that OLAF is dependent upon the Commission, whereas Europol and Eurojust are funded by national budgets."
"(Speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Blokland Report (A5-172/2001)"
"Mr President, Mr Blokland has presented a report on the environment and the economy, on the needs of the environment and on economic policy."
"I was thinking about this yesterday while on the plane from Rome to Brussels."
"Unfortunately, the weather was dreadful - black clouds, rain, lightning, storms - and the plane began to toss about."
"I had a dreadful ten minutes, Mr President."
"I remember (I was just reading this report) that I wondered, 'Will Mr Blokland,' whom I could see at the controls of the plane, 'also manage to beat the storms, hurricanes and black clouds that I am afraid the environment is bringing us?'"
"I wondered, I wished, and straight away the plane re-entered calm and peaceful weather and I landed in Brussels."
"Long live Mr Blokland!"
"Naturally, I voted for the motion."
"Mr Fatuzzo, the President is amazed at how much you were able to do yesterday in Rome and while you were travelling to Brussels."
"To be honest, your diary is much more flexible than the President' s."
"Hulthén Report (A5-171/2001)"
"Mr President, page 15 of the Hulthén report states, 'Sound and sustainable management of the Earth's resources is essential for the survival of mankind.'"
"I read this part of the Hulthén report to my mother, who lives in Rome, and whom I am always going round to see, as I did, indeed, yesterday."
"She said to me, 'But why on earth should the future survival of mankind interest me?"
"I am 88 years old: my future is today."
"Go and ask Mrs Hulthén and the European Parliament' - and that is why I am asking you now - 'to think not just about the future survival of mankind' - an excellent thing, which is why I voted for the motion - 'but also about the survival of mankind right now, which is all too often not a very cheering subject but which I feel is really important for us here at this time.'"
"Myller Report (A5-0175/2001), Blokland Report (A5-0172/2001), Hulthén Report (A5­-0171/2001)"
"Mr President, allow me to congratulate you on your excellent French just now, which I heard you speak in such ringing tones that I very nearly thought you were a Frenchman who sometimes speaks Spanish."
"Instead, now I have seen, as I had first thought, that you are a Spaniard who speaks very good French."
"I voted for the EURES report, which says that it is necessary to inform citizens about their pension rights."
"Mr President, every week I am a guest on private television channels and inform Italian citizens about the rules on pensions."
"Therefore, I too am a EURES-Fatuzzo or a Fatuzzo-EURES, and so I am in favour of this report."
"As I said, I voted for it and I hope that more and more will be done to keep all citizens, particularly pensioners, informed."
". (NL) This proposal argues for the expansion of the existing EURES network into a European employment service."
"The rapporteur rightly starts from the principle of voluntary mobility of people going to work in another Member State or in Switzerland."
"But what does voluntary mean?"
"Did those who came en masse from the Mediterranean in the 1960s to work in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, come voluntarily, or were they forced by poverty, unemployment and dictatorship?"
"There is still much more work migration in America than in Europe."
"Someone who loses his job there must take a job thousands of kilometres away, often an insecure job that pays worse than the previous one."
"Because it is not necessary there to regard it as emigration to another country, and people are also remaining in the same language area, the government considers it normal that people should be cut off from family and friends."
"Europeans are protected from such pressure as long as no one can force them to look for work abroad or in another language area."
"It is much better to bring work to people that to take people to work."
"But it is precisely on this count that a liberal economy falls down, which concentrates all activity in areas with a favourable location for traffic."
"It is precisely under those circumstances that a single European labour market does not work to the advantage of employees or of society as a whole."
"Parliament has completed its agenda."
"The Minutes for the sitting will be submitted for Parliament' s approval at the start of the next part-session."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on Thursday, 31 May 2001."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of Thursday 31 May 2001 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a comment about the Minutes."
"In the Annex to the Minutes, in the Texts Adopted, on the Méndes de Vigo report - I am just looking for my papers and of course cannot find anything now - it states at one point that a European constitution should be drafted."
"This goes back to a proposal for an amendment by Mr Brok."
"When I checked with Mr Brok, he confirmed that he did not choose this phrase in his proposal for an amendment."
"I would therefore request that the proposals for amendments be used to check again whether this theme has now been included correctly in the final Méndes De Vigo document in all the languages, as we obviously want to avoid any misinterpretations here."
"Of course, Mr Ferber, we shall certainly check this."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"Madam President, we found it very difficult indeed to put forward this proposal, especially as we are always keen to cooperate, also with Mrs Hautala, as far as politically possible."
"However, we wanted to have enough time for the debate on Gothenburg, which is why we have proposed that the Wuori report be postponed until the mini-session."
"This is therefore not a substantive objection; it is simply a matter of having more time to prepare the important Summit in Gothenburg."
"Madam President, I would like to appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering and also everyone else who planned the successful postponement of the reading of my colleague Mr Wuori' s human rights report."
"When this Parliament addresses human rights this is always done at a very theoretical level but when something really could be achieved people want to delay it."
"I would request that Mr Poettering consider that my colleague Mr Wuori' s report not be removed from the agenda and that a short discussion be held nevertheless on the Irish referendum in addition to the discussion we are going to have on the Gothenburg Summit."
"It would be a pity if the undeniable high point of the week, my colleague Mr Wuori' s report, were now suddenly to be taken away."
"None of you wanted this last week."
"We should perhaps have realised that the Irish referendum would arouse discussion but we did not."
"Madam President, my group is prepared to support the postponement of this debate on human rights provided that it takes place during the July part-session and is not postponed indefinitely."
"This is because we believe that the debate on this report is very important, but we also believe that there are other events, such as the case of Ireland, which deserve our attention on the eve of the Gothenburg Summit."
"I will add one piece of information: if I am not mistaken, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, will appear before this Parliament during the next part-session."
"Mr Verhosfstadt, as a senator in the Kingdom of Belgium, was the rapporteur for the committee which studied Belgium' s responsibilities in the case of Rwanda."
"An historic judgment is currently being drafted in Brussels which will define the universal dimension of genocide, which I believe does honour to Belgium and the European Union."
"I believe that it is very important that we listen to the Belgian Prime Minister on such a crucial issue."
"Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo."
"I believe that Mr Poettering agreed to include the report in the agenda of the July part-session."
"Mr Poettering presented the request and Mrs Hautala has spoken against it."
"A speaker in favour of the request will now take the floor, since Mr Poettering tabled it."
"Mr Barón Crespo in its favour, as long as the debate is placed on July' s agenda."
"This means, then, that there are two speakers in favour of postponing the debate."
"Madam President, let me make an alternative suggestion."
"I propose that my colleague Mr Wuori' s human rights report remain on the agenda and in addition the Council and the Commission be asked for a statement on the Irish referendum in conjunction with the Gothenburg discussion."
"This is completely possible."
"We have the whole morning for these two discussions."
"Mr Gollnisch will now speak in favour of postponing the report."
"Madam President, thank you very much."
"Pursuant to Rule 111, I shall speak in favour of the proposal to amend the agenda in order to take into account the extremely important event which took place in Ireland, which proves to us that the cohesion of smaller nations that refuse to give up their freedom is something which must certainly be taken into account."
"I am fully aware of the importance of what Mr Barón Crespo has said and of the presence of our eminent Belgian guest, who is a specialist on human rights in Rwanda, but I also believe that there will be the opportunity at the July session to discuss, in particular, human rights in Belgium and the infamous procedure, which is currently being waged against the Vlaams Blok, which should encourage the Belgian leaders to put their own house in order."
"I shall put to the vote the request by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to postpone Mr Wuori' s report to the July part-session."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although we are unable to change the United Nations' vocabulary, I believe that we are able to use self-discipline."
"Now, at Nice, you proclaimed a charter on our behalf, which gave rise to considerable discussions as to whether the expression 'human rights' should be replaced by 'individual rights' ."
"I believe that this is the terminology that we should use in our internal work."
"Madam President, I have another question regarding Wednesday."
"Due to our ill-judged decision to cancel Friday, for which you cannot be held responsible, we now have to begin at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday."
"We are on the way to a five-day Wednesday!"
"We might as well start at midnight on Tuesday and work right through until 8.30 a.m."
"However, I rise to address the issue of Question Time again."
"Question Time with the Commission has been cut yet again."
"We always prepare ourselves very carefully so that we put specific questions to specific Commissioners."
"This was enforced by this House during a reform of Question Time years ago."
"We have thus addressed questions to specific Commissioners, and I see that apart from a single question to Mr Kinnock, everything has been thrown into one enormous pot."
"The attendance of all the other Commissioners at this Question Time, which was scheduled six months ago, has been cancelled without substitution."
"I would like to know why this is the case."
"I have no requests for amendments to Thursday's agenda."
"The order of business is thus established."
"Speeches relating to procedure:"
"Madam President, with your permission, I rise for the first time here in connection with the Rules of Procedure."
"I wish to propose that we include a debate on the impact of the referendum in Ireland as a separate agenda item."
"In my view, the referendum in Ireland offers this House the unique opportunity to shape democracy and intervene immediately in the current debate, rather than always following after the event."
"Nice resulted in too little democracy and failed to create a sound basis for enlargement."
"We need more than this now, and with the help of the Irish people, we can re-open this debate."
"This is the reason for this motion to amend the agenda: we move that a separate agenda item be included to debate the impact of Nice, our positions as parliamentarians with regard to our own willingness to create more democracy in Europe, and the finality of Europe."
"Europe's citizens would not understand if we shirked this issue at this time."
"Mr Martin, I think that your request has just been more than fulfilled by the vote that the House has just taken."
"Obviously, although the House has decided to postpone Mr Wuori' s report until the July part-session, the reason was not, of course, as Mr Poettering has explained perfectly clearly, because Mr Poettering was opposed to Mr Wuori' s report, but simply so that there would be sufficient time to hold a thorough and in-depth debate."
"I therefore believe that this is a satisfactory outcome for you."
"Madam President, I would like to support Mr Martin' s proposal, for the situation is one of great urgency."
"The Foreign Ministers are, of course, meeting today and tomorrow in Luxembourg and will probably decide to press ahead with the ratifications as if there had been no referendum, and the Treaty is now set up in such a way that 15 signatures are required in order to amend it."
"Consequently, we should take the initiative to ensure that there is at least pause for thought and that we do not just ride roughshod over the Irish referendum."
"The Irish referendum should provide everyone with reason for reflection, bearing in mind the substantial resources employed on the 'yes' side compared with the few employed on the 'no' side."
"Mr Bonde, I would, in any event, refer you to the Rules of Procedure."
"You know that such requests must be submitted at least one hour before the beginning of the sitting and I am absolutely sure that this was not done."
"Madam President, my point of order has, perhaps to some extent been pre-empted by the earlier discussion, but following the Irish referendum I should like to ask whether you, in your capacity as President of Parliament, will write to the President of Ireland congratulating the Irish people on their wise and far-sighted decision, which strikes a blow for freedom, independence, self-determination and the nation state."
"I wonder whether you will also join me in congratulating our colleague, Dana Rosemary Scallon, on the marvellous role that she played in Ireland in helping to deliver a no vote in the referendum."
"Mr Helmer, as you are aware, I sent a message which is not exactly along the lines that you suggested, but which expresses what I believe to be the opinion of the majority of the House."
"Madam President, I should like to say that it is a decision made by the Irish people, whether we like it or not, and I do not particularly like it."
"I want to say to the Eurosceptics in this House and throughout Europe that, whether they like it or not, that decision was made in good faith."
"At the same time it ill-behoves those anti-Europeans to dance on the grave of the Eastern European nations that are so anxious to join the European Union and to join us in this House."
"The Irish people are a generous people."
"We have accepted great support from the European Union since we joined it and we are prepared to give back a great deal of what we received."
"Confusion, however, was spread at a great rate by the fundamentalists of the left, by the fundamentalists of the right, by the cranks in the middle; and the truth was not properly sold."
"Let me say to the Commission and to the others that in future we must make these Treaties simple and comprehensible to the European people; but do not blame the Irish people for making a truly democratic decision."
"We must now reflect on that decision, each and every one of us in this House and throughout the European Union."
"It was a decision made in good faith."
"Madam President, I canvassed and voted in favour of the Nice referendum in Ireland and was disappointed with the result, but, I hasten to add, I fully accept the democratic decision taken by the electorate in my country."
"The will of the Irish people must be respected."
"We should not rush into a debate."
"It is time for reflection and analysis."
"A debate at this time would only suit the many Members in this House who are opposed to giving the eastern and central Europeans the opportunity to share in the economic growth we are enjoying in the European Union."
"Clarification is undoubtedly necessary."
"Let there be no ambiguity: the Irish people are a generous people."
"They have a social conscience and favour enlargement."
"This matter will be resolved within Ireland; we do not need any interference from outside, from Members of this House, whether they are for it or against it."
"The Irish people will resolve their own problems."
"Any future debate here should follow the debate in our own country."
"Madam President, my point also concerns the Irish referendum."
"It has been eloquently made by more experienced Members than myself and so, in the interests of not detaining the House, I shall withdraw it."
"Mr President, following up on Mr Helmer's point on the Irish Referendum, you may recall another event last week, in the UK."
"Mr Helmer's party campaigned on the principle of keeping the pound against the euro."
"Now we all know that the British people soundly rejected his party on that policy."
"Will he now join me in voting to go with the euro?"
"Madam President, one thing that makes my heart very glad is to hear the last unreconstructed Tory of the seventeenth century agree at last that freedom is a good thing for Ireland."
"(Laughter and applause) I extend the hand of friendship to Roger."
"I welcome his conversion."
"I say to him - because he does not have a great understanding of history - that historically, a 'Tory' means somebody who is hunted: 'tóraidhe' , a hunted one."
"I am beginning to think that Roger and those of his political party are feeling a little bit that way since last weekend."
"The tóraidhe were Anglo-Irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion."
"They refused to go and were loyal to the king."
"I hope that Roger is enlightened now."
"I certainly hope that we have bridged the gap between us."
"Edmund Burke, a great British parliamentarian, said: ""All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good people do nothing""."
"Evil triumphed last weekend, not in the person of those people who went out and mistakenly voted for the wrong side, but of those who told them lies and deceived them."
"They are the people who cadged money from abroad in the interests of breaking up the solidarity of the people of Europe and spent it to tell lies to the Irish people, while the Irish government - and, unfortunately, the opposition - were so complacent that we thought everybody would trust us."
"I want the people of this House to know that every major newspaper supported a 'yes' for eastern Europe."
"I want this House to know that a large number of the people who voted 'no' believed that they were doing no damage to the interests of the eastern European countries."
"I have one disagreement with my colleagues Mr Andrews and Mr Gallagher about the generosity and special merits of the people of Ireland."
"I believe we are different."
"We have a slightly different culture and a very different history."
"Yet we are the same as everybody else here."
"We have good people and bad people."
"We accept democracy nevertheless, because it is the only way."
"As the Jacobites said after the Battle of the Boyne, ""Change kings and we will fight you over again"", and I believe we will win the next time."
"Thank you, Mr McCartin."
"I think that Mr Helmer has the right to respond to the first part of your point of order."
"I shall therefore give him the floor once again."
"Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking my friend and colleague Mr McCartin for his lesson in history."
"However, primarily I want to respond to Mr Miller who made a point about the British election and about the euro."
"As he knows perfectly well, but is apparently seeking to hide, the Conservative Party's position on the euro was supported by between 65% and 70% of the British people."
"It was the one key issue where the public were definitely and clearly on our side."
"I would remind Mr Miller that his Prime Minister has just sacked the pro-euro foreign minister Robin Cook and replaced him with the much less pro-euro, indeed some have called him a Eurosceptic, Mr Jack Straw."
"So put that one in your pipe and smoke it!"
"Madam President, I rise on a point of order concerning my friend Roger Helmer."
"We share the honour of being representatives for the East Midlands - information I give to this House more in shame than in anger."
"Mr McCartin pointed out quite rightly that Mr Helmer had no understanding of history."
"In the interests of accuracy: Mr Helmer has no understanding of politics, of statistics, of literature, of courtesy towards a fellow Member State of the European Union - and I could go on for a considerable amount of time."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Madam President, allow me a final remark on Ireland."
"Is it not strange that those Members of Parliament who speak most about national independence are the same ones who lead massive foreign intervention in elections in other countries?"
"I look forward to asking them on Wednesday what it is they want."
"Do they want to weaken Ireland the same way they weakened Denmark ten years ago?"
"I warn against that."
"Madam President, following on from the last comment, it is obvious that the Irish made their decision in a very democratic way, as did, alas, the British people, because they voted in this wonderful Labour government."
"But as we are trying to change what the Irish said in their referendum, maybe we should look at the British vote."
"Surely this House would have wanted to see a Conservative government returned, and on the basis of fact and realistic policy, people would have wanted to vote Conservative on Thursday last."
"That is the result that we would all have liked."
"My fellow Danish MEP, Mr Haarder, decided to speak in a language other than his own."
"I intend to speak in our common language."
"I believe that it is very important that we here in Parliament seek to bring about a debate in which we show respect for the decision that was made in Ireland."
"Although the participation rate was low, I think it is worth remembering that it was no lower than it was in many places in the European Parliamentary elections at which we were elected."
"The participation rate in Ireland corresponds very well to the participation rate in elections to the European Parliament."
"I would like to say to the Irish people that of course it is up to them to work out how we move forward."
"However, I cannot fail to recommend the Danish model."
"In complete contrast to my good fellow Member, Mr Haarder, I would gladly recommend the Danish model."
"I believe that it is the way forward for this cooperation and that it would bring somewhat greater flexibility and somewhat more latitude into it."
"This latitude could also provide room for that diversity which will become part of the experience of all of us when enlargement becomes a success, which hopefully will happen very soon."
"Madam President, I should like to say that I do not entirely agree with my Danish fellow Member, Mr Haarder, in his attack on Jens-Peter Bonde, who was the campaign leader in Ireland."
"In fact, I would like to say that there are an incredibly large number of us Danes who are pleased the more he is away from Denmark, because then he is not doing damage there."
"However, now that Mr Bonde is advocating openness so much, we should like to know whether the DKK 100 000 that he obtained for the campaign came from opponents or from his former comrades on the central committee or in East Germany."
"Madam President, since you have been asked to write to the Irish authorities as a part of the debate on the events in Ireland, I am wondering if we should not also ask you to write to the leader of the British Conservative Party to pass on our condolences at the outcome of the elections, which is mainly due to deep-rooted euroscepticism which is not a good sign."
"Madam President, I rise under Rule 174, the right to petition the European Parliament."
"You may be aware of a number of petitions concerning Lloyd's of London, as well as complaints to the European Commission."
"One of the names of Lloyd's of London received a letter from Lloyd's criticising him for daring to raise this matter with the Commission, and a rather threatening letter saying that it was a clear breach of the terms of an agreement."
"Lloyd's therefore requested written confirmation within seven days that this citizen would desist from taking any further action in breach of the settlement agreement."
"I have written to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, saying that this not only dealt with complaints but also the right to petition Parliament. The President is looking into the question of complaints to the Commission, but he said clearly this is an issue that Parliament would itself want to address."
"I will certainly give you full details of this later but it is such a serious matter that I thought it should be raised in the House now."
"Thank you, Mr Perry."
"I shall, of course, take note of what you have said."
"We have somehow moved onto dealing with the points of order, but we had already established the agenda."
"Madam President, Mr Joaquín José Martínez was declared innocent by a jury in Tampa of two murders for which he had previously been condemned to death."
"All of us in the European Parliament have many times been deeply involved in the debate on the death penalty."
"During that debate, we defined our set of values and our beliefs, and we have also entered into a dialogue with our American friends on many occasions."
"We have campaigned at Senate and Congress level in all manner of ways."
"This should give us a great sense of satisfaction, and I also hope that you will be prepared to express this on behalf of our Parliament during your visit to the Gothenburg Council this week."
"We have in any event noted that, for once, the position of Europe against the death penalty has triumphed over that other set of values."
"I hope that the intensification of the debate on that other set of values between Europe and the Americans can lead to increased awareness on the part of the Americans. If one wishes to condemn another person, but ultimately wants to protect one' s own values, one should not back down from those values, but should defend them instead."
"That is why our protest against the death penalty is crucial."
"I hope that you, on behalf of the entire Parliament, will once again be prepared to voice this at the Gothenburg Council this week, particularly at a time when President Bush is visiting Europe."
"Mr van den Burg, I had already intended to speak at Gothenburg on this issue, along the lines that you have described."
"I would like to remind you, however, that the European Parliament' s Bureau decided that Parliament would co-organise a very important meeting, which will be held on 21 and 22 June, on the world-wide abolition of the death penalty."
"We have already been assured that around 30 leaders of the national parliaments, from all continents, will be taking part, and have accepted to come to this meeting."
"Madam President, I am sorry, but something seems to have got lost in translation."
"My question was very precise."
"I wanted to know why, out of the three Commissioners who were scheduled to participate in Question Time with the Commission, two have been cancelled and all the questions addressed specifically to these Commissioners, such as Mrs Schreyer, have been bundled together under 'General Matters' , where they have no chance of being answered."
"That was my question."
"Yes, Mr Posselt, I was informed that Question Time has been shortened because the Members of the Commission scheduled to attend have not received enough questions."
"Yes, that was why. Your comments have been noted."
"Madam President, I would like to come back to a less amusing issue than the exchange which we have heard during the last five minutes."
"I wish to ask whether there have been any further developments concerning the application for the removal of Mr Dell'Utri's immunity since the last Parliamentary session."
"After all, since 8.30 this morning, we have been deprived of the other case, to the great regret of our colleagues in the PPE-DE, so I am told."
"I would like to ask you this: since the last Parliamentary session, have you received any documentation from the Spanish authorities concerning the application for the removal of Mr Dell'Utri's immunity?"
"If so, have you already forwarded this documentation to the committee responsible?"
"If not, do you intend - now that a further month has passed since May - to take any initiatives to request the Spanish authorities no longer to block the process initiated by the Spanish judiciary?"
"There have been no new developments, Mr Schulz."
"The Supreme Court has still not sent us a request through the official channels, namely, via the appropriate Spanish governmental authority."
"I do not think that it is the task of the President of the European Parliament to urge the Court to do this or otherwise."
"I believe that the President of the Supreme Court is, I would say, old enough to look after himself and able to make up his own mind."
"Madam President, I do not fully understand your reply to Mr Schulz, since, according to your reply to my letter of 15 May, you acknowledge that you have received documents from the Spanish Supreme Court relating to the request for the waiver of the immunity of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, and that does not square with your reply to Mr Schulz."
"This is not the case at all."
"The Supreme Court subsequently sent further documents, and they were again sent directly to me."
"I really do not understand the need to go back over this subject, as the matter is perfectly straightforward."
"The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to inform me of the opinion of the Spanish Council of State, in other words, that it is the task of the governmental authority to submit requests for waivers of immunity."
"This is clear."
"I cannot really see why there is a need to persist with this, as, in my view, the matter seems to be perfectly clear."
"Therefore, until I have received the request sent via the Spanish governmental authorities, I shall not take it into consideration."
"In addition to the answer I gave Mr Schulz, I would also like to reiterate that, as you know, a certain number of initiatives have been taken."
"We have drafted and drawn up an exhaustive document on all the requests for waivers of parliamentary immunity involving MEPs since Parliament was elected by universal suffrage, as, in fact, requested by Mr Barón Crespo."
"This document could not have shown any more clearly that, with the exception of Portugal, all the requests have always been submitted to us by the governmental authorities, again with the exception of Portugal and another case involving Spain, where there is some doubt, in relation to which, the Official Journal stated that the request came from the Spanish Ministry of Justice."
"Another initiative that has been taken is that the Conference of Presidents asked the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up a report on the general problems relating to requests for waivers of immunity and to propose amendments to the regulation, if need be."
"I think I am right in saying that it is Mr Duff who has been appointed rapporteur and we look forward to the report that Mr Duff will present to us at the Conference of Presidents."
"As you see, therefore, we are keeping a close eye on the progress made in this matter."
"Madam President, thank you for permitting me to rise again."
"I greatly regret the fact that my only opportunity to put a question to you regarding the Dell'Utri case is at the opening of Parliament during the discussion of the agenda."
"As a simple Member of this House, there is no other opportunity to raise this type of issue."
"I have been accused on several occasions in this House of only having an interest in this matter due to the Italian election campaign."
"The election campaign is now over, and so I would like to come back to the Dell'Utri case since it has great significance for every Member of this House."
"An application for the removal of immunity could be lodged tomorrow against any Member of this Parliament - against me, against Mr Poettering, against Mr Haarder, against Mrs Frahm, against any one of us - and, in order to avoid public speculation, the Member concerned must have the opportunity to make a direct statement about the accusations."
"For the last nine months, Mr Dell'Utri has been denied the opportunity to make a statement on the accusations made against him here."
"This is why it could be quite important to tell the Spanish authorities that the way in which the Spanish government deals with applications for the removal of immunity submitted to this House is also a matter of honour in its relations with the European Parliament."
"One further point, Madam President: in Europe, where there is a separation of powers, it is accepted that the judiciary can approach the legislature direct."
"There is only one Parliament where it is claimed that the executive must have a proviso in such cases, and that is this Parliament."
"This is an absurd situation for which I hold you, Mrs Fontaine, entirely responsible."
"Mr Schulz, I am sure that Mr Dell' Utri will listen carefully to your concerns."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is worsening."
"Albanian rebels are dangerously close to the capital, the authorities in northern Greece are preparing to receive refugees and Olympic Airways flights to Skopje have been cancelled."
"We all know that the terrorists are from Kosovo, an area under NATO control, which alone is responsible for what is happening in the FYROM."
"At the same time, both ÍÁÔÏ and the European Union are preventing the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from taking basic measures to protect the country and the people, while agreeing to talk to the terrorists and the government on equal terms."
"Yet the Greek government has proposed a plan which, rather than disarming the terrorists, allows them to depart in safety, requires the European Union and the USA to be directly involved in the negotiations and prepares the ground for military intervention."
"We urgently need to take account of the peoples' struggle in order to put a stop to foreign intervention and so that NATO forces can leave and these nations can resolve their differences peacefully and without any foreign interests being brought to bear."
"Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis."
"I would like to remind you that, as you know, the President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be coming to address Parliament on Wednesday morning."
"His visit will, naturally, be brought up at Gothenburg and, as you would expect, I shall also be referring to this in my speech."
"I would like to bring up two points."
"First of all, the death penalty."
"The death penalty equates to murder, and even if a murderer is killed under the death penalty, this is still murder."
"We are opposed to the execution of Timothy McVeigh, even though he is a murderer."
"This should be pointed out."
"There is no good or bad use of the death penalty."
"Even the lowest of the low do not deserve to be killed in this way."
"I would like the European Parliament to adopt this position."
"My next point refers to the debate on Ireland. I hope that it will be organised differently and that it will not take place merely at the level of the group leaders."
"We saw earlier that a slightly more spontaneous organisation gave rise to much more lively debate than when the debates are organised by the heads and leaders of the groups."
"I hope that we shall draw the appropriate lesson from what happened five minutes ago."
"Sexual exploitation of children - Trafficking in human beings"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"report (A5-0206/2001) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography [COM(2000) 854 - C5-0043/2001 - 2001/0025(CNS)]"
"report (A5-0183/2001) by Mrs Klamt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings [COM(2000) 854 - C5-0042/2001 - 2001/0024(CNS)]."
", rapporteur. (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by offering my personal congratulations to Commissioner Vitorino on taking such an important legislative initiative and thank the Swedish Presidency for its support, which will ensure that the Council takes a decision as quickly as possible."
"The sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are, of course, a scandal in a modern civilisation and it is unthinkable that criminal networks and customers should go unpunished and avoid criminal prosecution by taking advantage of the lack of cooperation between countries and shortcomings in our criminal legislation."
"It is high time we addressed appalling cases such as the Dutroux case in Belgium, where the inadequate legal framework means that it is still impossible to prove the constituent elements of the crime and hold the trial which has been pending for the last four years, which is why the Union initiative to stamp out this vile crime and create a common reference framework to strengthen judicial and police cooperation between the Member States and bring these criminal syndicates to justice is all the more important."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has worked through the Commission framework proposal line by line and has adopted a series of proposals and amendments which enhance and strengthen the initial legislative text, such as the definition of child pornography, which has been expanded considerably so as to include the various permutations of this crime and ensure there are none which escape prosecution, taking account of course of new technological developments."
"As far as the sexual exploitation of children is concerned, given the composite nature of the crime and the international networks involved, we have included types of criminal conduct over and above those proposed by the Commission, such as facilitating, buying, selling or transporting a child within or outside national borders."
"Another important point which we have added apportions responsibility both to the natural persons who care for the child, such as parents, teachers etc. and to legal persons, including distribution companies and Internet service providers, which are now required to design protective mechanisms to prevent new technologies from being used to facilitate the exploitation of children."
"As far as crimes relating to child pornography are concerned, we have proposed that importing, exporting, purchasing, selling and advertising, and not just producing, distributing and disseminating child pornography should be criminal offences."
"What is also extremely important is that we have made the possession of pornographic material a criminal offence, subject of course to safety valves which ensure that people who receive material unwittingly, for example by electronic or conventional mail, need not fear prosecution."
"As far as punishment is concerned, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms accepted the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for a stricter criminal framework for crimes inflicted on children under the age of 16, rather than the age of 10 proposed by the Commission, with stricter punishment of at least 10 years rather than the 8 years proposed by the Commission."
"We have also proposed that, in addition to condemnation, any movable or immovable assets which are proceeds from these offences be traced, seized and confiscated and that punishment be accompanied by psychiatric treatment."
"This is another innovation which we have proposed."
"As the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, we have also made an important contribution on the procedural side by making provision for criminals to be extradited, so that the phenomenon of sexual tourism can be stamped out, and amending legislation on double criminality, so that offenders cannot escape to countries in which crimes against children are punished more leniently."
"We also propose compensation for victims and a host of measures to protect victims during investigations and hearings and of course afterwards, especially for disabled children."
"Finally, we propose setting up registers of persons who have committed the offence, in collaboration with Europol, Interpol and national police forces, and involving candidate countries in action to combat the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"I am well aware that promoting legislative arrangements is not the only solution."
"We need to focus on the causes of the mental and physical abuse and exploitation of children, such as poverty, the lack of fundamental structures to protect children, the lack of control and prevention mechanisms, the breakdown of the family and, of course, the fact that such a market - a market of huge supply and demand - exists and, unfortunately, operates within the European Union, discrediting our European civilisation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is estimated that as many as 700 000 women and children are trafficked every year."
"From the Central and Eastern European states alone, 120 000 women and children are lured to the European Union every year."
"These are the figures on which the Commission proceeds."
"The fates of the individuals profiled in the media, but also the statistics highlight the urgent need to combat human trafficking through a coordinated and cooperative approach."
"Combating trafficking in human beings is a very difficult task in itself."
"However, it is made more difficult through the highly diverse provisions of criminal law at national level."
"Definitions and penalties differ widely, and in many Member States, 'human trafficking' does not even exist as an offence in the criminal code."
"The European Union has therefore worked for a number of years to develop a comprehensive strategy to combat this trade in human beings."
"With the Palermo protocol, which was signed at the end of 2000, agreement was reached on specific common definitions for the first time."
"The Commission proposal now aims to lay down, by means of a Framework Decision, minimum rules concerning the constituent elements of criminal acts, and minimum penalties."
"The imposition of a minimum jail sentence of six years, or ten years where the circumstances make the crime more serious, should be sufficient to bring trafficking in human beings within the scope of other instruments already adopted for the purposes of enhancing police and judicial cooperation in the European Union against organised crime."
"In my opinion, the Commission's proposal should be viewed positively."
"I especially welcome the fact that it encompasses not only the criminal act of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, but also trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation."
"The Commission also makes a clear distinction between trafficking in human beings, and facilitation of unauthorised entry of migrants, commonly termed 'smuggling' ."
"While the smuggling of human beings is viewed as an offence against the state, trafficking in human beings is a crime against persons."
"The Commission's draft and the various amendments proposed by the participating committees will enable us to achieve a uniform Europe-wide definition of trafficking in human beings, set minimum penalties, and give priority to protecting the victims as well as punishing the perpetrators."
"I should like to thank all the members of the participating committees for their cooperation in achieving this result."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the requested referral of my report back to the Committee on Home Affairs."
"At the start of deliberations, such a tight schedule was imposed on the European Parliament by the Council's timetable that tremendous efforts were required to ensure that the substantive work on the draft could take place with the necessary thoroughness and level of detail."
"The Members involved expressed their willingness to undertake this task and performed outstanding work, to which I wish to pay tribute."
"However, the Council - without listening to the people's elected representatives - has already progressed so far in its deliberations that the signing of the political agreements is merely a formality."
"Clearly, the Council has no interest in the decision of the only institution in the European Union with direct democratic legitimation."
"A revised draft of the Framework Decision with the Council's radical amendments is already available - but not to the European Parliament."
"In my view, the referral of the report back to the Committee on Home Affairs is urgently required to ensure that this new version, and the Council's unacceptable approach, can be discussed."
"I would therefore ask you all to vote for the referral back to the Committee on Home Affairs during tomorrow's vote."
"In the second half of my speech, I would like to comment on Mrs Karamanou's report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography in the Member States, which calls for a Europe-wide coordinated approach."
"Organised crime - and it is primarily organised crime which is involved here - is not restricted to specific regions or states."
"Cross-border cooperation between criminals is well-established, especially as regards the sexual exploitation of children."
"The European Union therefore urgently requires measures in order to facilitate the cross-border prosecution of these appalling crimes."
"I am delighted that agreement on this Framework Decision has been achieved across party lines, thus pointing the right way forward towards common definitions of criminal acts, the harmonisation of criminal law, and improving the situation of victims."
"This also includes extending the definition of child pornography to include the new media and discussing the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction."
"In my view, victim protection is especially important."
"Crimes against children, in their most despicable form, that is, sexual exploitation, should no longer be dealt with solely with a view to punishing the perpetrators."
"The children concerned will suffer for the rest of their lives as a result of the harm inflicted on them by adults."
"They should therefore be our priority, and they deserve our greatest possible support."
"During criminal proceedings, their primary role, in legal terms, is to act as witnesses, but we should not forget that they are victims first and foremost."
"With the support of the European Parliament, all these points should be included in the draft before us."
"I am convinced that the report by Mrs Karamanou, whom I would like to thank for our good cooperation, will be supported by a substantial majority in this House, enabling us to take a further significant step in combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on this report."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, I should also like say a word of thanks for the cross-party cooperation I had in that committee on this most important issue."
"We must tackle the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography across the EU."
"Whatever anyone thinks of subsidiarity, for something as important as this we have to make sure we have common rules, particularly because of the Internet and the free movement of people across the EU countries."
"I know that there are several child pornographers who have set up business in one EU country because if they are caught they know they will get a lesser sentence in that country."
"We must make sure that we stamp that out."
"I am very pleased that much of the opinion I drafted has been accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, particularly the section on penalties and ensuring that we have the same penalties across the EU."
"I thought the Commission was wrong to bring in tougher penalties for the exploitation of children under 10."
"I worked very hard in my committee to make sure we also set tougher penalties for those who commit offences against children under 16."
"I also wanted to bring in children with learning difficulties. I talked a lot with some of the organisations working in this field and they said that disabled children are twice as likely to be abused as any other children."
"It is important that we protect children with learning disabilities, whose mental age is often much lower than their physical age."
"The question of definitions is, of course, going to be difficult and we have to work on that. We had great difficulty in the Committee on Culture, as we have had across the board."
"But we must make sure that photographs of naked children are caught in that net."
"We see what happened with the Wonderland Club, where individuals had to provide 10,000 photographs of naked children in order to get into that Wonderland Club."
"I want to say very briefly that we have to clamp down on sex tourism and make sure that nationals from Member States can be prosecuted if they commit a crime in third countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, our debate today concerns a highly sensitive issue: the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"Both are on the increase. For this reason, we must engage in closer cross-border cooperation, work far more intensively to prevent such crimes through information and awareness-raising, and try to include society in this process to a greater extent."
"Of course, it is also important to amend our criminal law and ensure that it functions on a cross-border basis, as trafficking, abuse and child pornography operate across borders as well."
"We believe that various measures are necessary for this purpose. The penalty, that is, the term of imprisonment, should be increased from a minimum of eight to a minimum of 10 years, with stiffer penalties being imposed when the victim is under 16, rather than under 10."
"I cannot understand what is meant by the reference to child abuse involving 'particular ruthlessness' ."
"Any form of child abuse is ruthless! There is no such thing as 'mild' child abuse."
"Anything that happens to a child in this context is ruthless."
"That is why I believe that the age limit should be raised to a minimum of 16, as the harm suffered by children is just as profound whether they are under 10, or 11, 12 or 13 years of age."
"I am therefore in favour of raising the age limit to 16."
"Victim protection for these children must also be safeguarded, not only for the children but also for the families and the witnesses."
"Legal assistance and psychological support are very important."
"Children should also be given the opportunity to make their witness statements on video, which is unfortunately not the practice in every country."
"Sadly, there is not enough time for further comments."
"However, I would like to thank everyone who supports the work in this field."
"Mr President, when the Commission submitted its proposal, it said that its ambition was to go further than the Palermo protocol did."
"I am very disappointed at the fact that, instead, the Palermo protocol has been watered down."
"I believe that it is incredibly important that we really keep separate the definitions of refugees, which after all have nothing to do with this particular matter, and of the exploitation of labour and of sexual exploitation."
"We now know that roughly 90% of the victims of trafficking in human beings, whom these matters concern, are women whom it is intended to exploit sexually."
"I realise that the Commission and the Council, just like ourselves here in Parliament, may find it difficult to cooperate on these matters, particularly in view of the fact that there is incredible variation in national legislation."
"In Sweden, we have had active legislation for eighteen months now that also addresses the buying of sexual services, that is, the clients have been criminalised."
"We have thus focused on the man instead of stigmatising the person who is prostituting herself."
"This is to be seen in the light of the fact that a number of the Member States are now legalising brothels and thus also pimping."
"What this does is preserve stereotypical images of women' s and men' s sexuality and sexual needs."
"As far as Mrs Karamanou' s report is concerned, I would like to state that if Amendment Nos 3, 5, 6 and 13 are carried, then my group will not be able to vote in favour of the report."
"The definitions of child pornography that we adopted in the women' s committee are much better."
"In Mrs Karamanou' s report, the definitions are so wide that there is a risk that we will have to cover up the Maneken Pis in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many countries in the European Union, and particularly my own, Portugal, are experiencing cases of the exploitation of people from Eastern Europe who, having come to find a better lifestyle, fall victims to organised gangs which exploit their suffering."
"The exploitation of human beings, men, women and children, is an abhorrent phenomenon, whatever its purpose may be: for clandestine work, to work in the sex industry or for any other reason."
"We therefore have a responsibility to fight this scourge and to create the necessary legislative instruments."
"This was our aim and we tried to reach a common definition of the elements of these types of crime, and attempted to establish minimum thresholds for the maximum penalties that could be imposed. We also sought to define rules of competence and of police and judicial cooperation."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Klamt, Mrs Karamanou and Commissioner Vitorino for the commitment they have demonstrated in these matters. Issues related to the trafficking of human beings and the sexual exploitation of children must indeed be one of the main priorities of the European Union' s political agenda."
"We must step up the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography by improving the measures adopted by the joint action of February 1997 and by ensuring that there can be no safe havens for the perpetrators of sex crimes against children when we suspect that they may have committed a crime in a country other than their own."
"We must also complement the work that has already been undertaken by the Union and the international Community. Amongst these, we should highlight the fact that, in December 2000, the United Nations protocol on trafficking in human beings was adopted under the Convention on transnational organised crime, which was signed by 81 States."
"Our Parliament' s approval of these proposals would constitute a clear demonstration of our will to wage an effective fight against these unacceptable violations of people' s dignity and human rights."
"I am delighted that the Council has reached agreement on the basic principles of the proposal for a Framework Decision on the fight against trafficking in human beings, but I am sorry that it could not reach consensus on the level of criminal sanctions."
"Mr President, firstly allow me to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Klamt, and also in particular to congratulate the Commission on its proposal."
"For years this Parliament has wanted clear and common legislation for combating the trafficking and exploitation of human beings, which are odious and widespread crimes."
"We do not wish to be aware of it, but we only have to look at what is happening with prostitution in our countries to see what is going on."
"The European Commission' s proposal to define the crime in a common manner and harmonise penalties is truly a step forward in the direction proposed by the United Nations in its Palermo protocol, and I am pleased to accept it."
"However, having debated Mrs Gradin' s proposals in this House, which of course have been very useful to some others, such as the United States, which already have federal legislation to combat human trafficking, I must express my great concern at the Council' s attitude at its last meeting."
"There was no agreement on this proposal, whereas we saw remnants of legislation proposed by France, on the entry of people without documentation, go ahead, when it is clear that the trafficking and exploitation of human beings is one of the gravest of crimes. It is much more serious than the issue dealt with at the Council meeting."
"I do not understand it, and nor does anybody else, because no explanation has been given."
"I would like to ask, Mr President, whether tomorrow at the vote the Council will come to explain its position to us, what it intends to do, and whether it intends to introduce any amendments and, if so, which ones. Or, have we instead reached a point of such harmony between the institutions of this Union that, without my realising it, there is only one executive, the Commission, and only one legislative body, Parliament, and that the Council has no part to play."
"Mr President, the only way to catch international and organised criminals is for our police, prosecutors and judges to work together."
"Anyone who opposes such moves must be prepared to justify traffickers and paedophiles getting off scot-free."
"I congratulate Mrs Klamt and Mrs Karamanou, but on some points my group is not entirely happy."
"The first problem, in both reports, is the tendency to be too prescriptive and interfering in the detail of Member States' criminal justice systems."
"The first example is penalties."
"It is quite right to harmonise the maximum sentences, so that wherever a criminal flees, he risks the same penalty - no hiding place."
"But it is not appropriate either to stipulate that the penalty in connection with trafficking must be a prison sentence or to lay down minimum penalties."
"I do not always agree with the Council, but I agree with its view that approximation of the criminal law of the Member States could be necessary for certain specific types of offences, but when approximating criminal law the specificity of the national systems has to be taken into account."
"Both reports are also too prescriptive on the treatment of victims and witnesses, and fail to take differing national arrangements into account."
"Turning to the definition of child pornography in the Karamanou report, my group has problems with the definition which includes creating the impression that the person depicted is a child."
"This will give rise to endless argument and is not a sound basis for a legal definition."
"It is better to target pornography which exploits real children, not pretend ones."
"I also wish to draw attention to Amendment No 38 from the ELDR, which would make access to sex offenders' registers subject to data protection rules."
"Lastly my group agrees with the referral back to committee of Mrs Klamt's report, for the reasons she gave."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has been too quick off the mark."
"What the Council finds important, we deem inadequate and one-sided."
"What I do welcome in the Council' s report is the commitment towards the Member States."
"That is a step forward, but the reception and protection of victims is still being afforded too little importance."
"More guarantees must be offered in this connection."
"That is why, and certainly for humanitarian reasons, we should not so much aim for interim, but permanent, residence permits."
"Where are the bottlenecks?"
"Mafia groups have capitalised on the globalisation of the economy faster than anyone else."
"A second bottleneck is the rift between rich and poor regions; and then there is poverty."
"It is thus not only beneficial to launch dissuasion campaigns against the trafficking in human beings in all those countries of origin, poverty must also be addressed."
"We should also develop immigration policy and open up the borders more, even if this is at the expense of the countries involved."
"Despite this, most European countries still prefer a repressive approach in practice, which first and foremost targets the victims themselves."
"The heavyweights involved in the trafficking in human beings, the entrepreneurs of the trafficking in human beings, and those with vested interests usually remain out of harm' s way, and the current policy on fighting the traffickers has virtually no humanitarian dimension to speak of."
"And where is development cooperation in this respect?"
"The approach must be international, but the Mafias have international, well-oiled networks at their disposal, with fiscal and financial experts and telecommunication and computer experts of the highest calibre."
"Those fighting these practices still need to content themselves with proportionately few people, little expertise and few tools, loopholes in legislation and still a distressing lack of actual international cooperation, despite Europol etc. A structural approach is thus necessary, both in terms of criminal law and international migration policy."
"I should also like to say: do not overlook corruption."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to come back to the issue of the European Union' s signing of the additional Palermo protocol, entitled the 'Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children' ."
"The important part, of course, is 'especially women and children' and today we have Amendment No 1 in the report by Mrs Klamt, whom I would like to thank, which expressly states that we want to combat trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation and labour exploitation."
"In my view, it is not sufficient to mention trafficking in human beings alone."
"The clarification regarding women and children was proposed at Palermo."
"In my view, it is absolutely fair for this amendment to propose that the purpose of sexual exploitation should be mentioned before the purpose of labour exploitation, as we know only too well that trafficking primarily involves women and children, so let us avoid hypocrisy."
"If we had placed labour exploitation before sexual exploitation, we know that we would not really be facing up to the facts."
"That is why, in my view, Amendment No 1 is crucial and I hope that the Commission will take this on board."
"A point which I also believe to be important is that trafficking should be treated as a crime and not a misdemeanour."
"Everything relating to sexual exploitation is a crime and not simply a misdemeanour - we should acknowledge this, highlight this, be aware of this and should not play on this vagueness."
"I would like to thank the various committees and rapporteurs for having insisted on this."
"I would like to add that, out of all the amendments, I believe that the additions relating to the status of the victims are extremely important."
"These additions affect at least three points."
"First of all, there is the fact that we can talk about incitement, which can be one of the punishable causes."
"That means incitement and not just fraud."
"As you can see, there is a small difference between the two concepts."
"There is also the state of vulnerability of the victims, in addition to the pressures that we could easily pinpoint; the vulnerability of the victims is something I see as equally important."
"My last point, which was stressed by the Council of Europe in its recommendation published in May 2000, is that the argument of consent was not relevant. This is another important point."
"The consent or non-consent of the victim is not always relevant - in fact, it is far from being relevant."
"I believe that we must be vigilant on this issue, and we should recognise that consent should not be used as an argument for those involved in trafficking to escape punishment."
"That is why I believe that these reports are crucial."
"I would like to thank the two rapporteurs."
"I would like to say, unlike some Members, that I hope there will be, of course, more cooperation between Member States."
"How can we combat trafficking if there is no cooperation between Member States?"
"Does this proposal allow for sufficient cooperation?"
"Not exactly, and personally I would hope for more, so that we can identify all the victims, male and female, because men can, of course, also be victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation."
"Both men and women can be victims, but the main victims are women, especially, and children."
"I would like to reiterate that one of the amendments proposes we recognise that adulthood begins at the age of 18, and that those under the age of 18 must be considered to be children."
"Mr President, this is a very important report and a significant step forward."
"Like the rest of the House, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"It is through working together at EU and international level that we can do something important for children, who must be protected from such crimes."
"I fully endorse the proposal that depictions of persons under the age of 18 involved in sexually explicit conduct constitute the sexual exploitation of children."
"In my view this is compatible with the Convention of the Rights of the Child."
"The sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography on the Internet, in any form, is abhorrent."
"As the Commission points out, tens of thousands of human beings - especially women and children - are trafficked for exploitative purposes each year."
"None of our countries can claim to be free of these threats."
"None of our countries can halt these acts on their own."
"None of our countries should hesitate about signing up to closer cooperation in the fight against such crimes."
"The European Union has not been ignoring this worrying phenomenon."
"We have spoken about it many times in Parliament: in 1997 the Council joint action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children paved the way for Member States to review the relevant criminal law so as to ensure the criminalisation of certain behaviours and to encourage judicial cooperation."
"The new proposal brings us a further step forward by hopefully ensuring that each Member State will take the necessary measures to guarantee that facilitating or in any way profiting from child prostitution or child pornography is penalised, including by terms of imprisonment of not less than four years."
"Furthermore, we are calling on each Member State to ensure that convictions for such crimes are subject to the tracing, seizure and confiscation of all moveable and immovable assets representing the proceeds of those crimes."
"Finally, I fully support the compromise agreement reached by our committee on Article 5(4)."
"The maximum penalty of not less than eight years should apply in the case of child pornography and aiding and abetting such crimes, including the exploitation of children, when they involve a child below the age of 16."
"Mr President, it is dreadful that we should once again have to pore over these excrescences of human nature."
"International criminal organisations are ruthless and act with extreme effrontery."
"That makes it absolutely vital for the EU Member States and the candidate countries to act in close cooperation in order to combat these serious offences against humanity with all lawful means possible."
"The rapporteurs, Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Klamt, succeeded in presenting an extremely strong case and managed to table sound amendments."
"I sincerely hope that their compassionate proposals can stand the test of legislation. However, I share Mrs Ludford' s doubts."
"I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino would like to expand on this matter."
"Hard-nosed criminals can only be tackled successfully by a concerted, equally hard-nosed approach by the authorities."
"Any hesitation or weakening in the policy should therefore be firmly nipped in the bud. This is why, in this area in particular, the government carries the sword of justice for a very good reason."
"The mere fact that, from Central and Eastern Europe, as Mrs Klamt reminded us, 120 000 women and children are enticed into the European Union annually should make us go red in the face with shame."
"We should never have let things get this far."
"In addition to punishing the traffickers, we also need better control systems in order to liberate those annual 120 000 victims from their slavery."
"Moreover, we should be greatly concerned about the demise of fundamental values and standards at the margin of our society."
"That is why I am grateful that we in the European Parliament are fighting these excrescences with considerable unanimity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate on this report, we can examine this phenomenon, examples of which seem to exist at the highest levels in some Member States, that is, at least, according to public fears."
"The explosion of child pornography has its causes, and it is these that must be examined first of all."
"I can distinguish two causes, the first of which is the explosion of pornography itself and the second is the unfortunate trend of treating children and childhood with contempt."
"The explosion of pornography is in itself due to a loss of moral standards and the domination of the spirit of enjoyment, the fruits of which are bitter."
"We are now counting the cost of this 'unrestrained pursuit of pleasure' , a rule by which even some of the Members of this Parliament lived during the 1960s."
"This reckless pursuit of pleasure inevitably leads to the quest for extreme sensations, and also to the pursuit of violence and sadism, and it is a result of the way these things have become increasingly commonplace in newspapers, films and television."
"This is the first factor."
"The second factor is contempt towards children."
"This contempt certainly begins at a very early stage, since we are proud about presenting the fact, as if it is a right and as if it represents progress, that we are sending unborn children to their deaths in clinics, at the same time as we discuss the poor treatment to which some children are subjected."
"We should not be surprised that there is no rhyme or reason to this aspect of our civilisation."
"The 'right to a child' outside the family unit, outside normal sexual relations, the 'right to adoption' for example, by homosexuals, are claims which are also gaining ground, including in the conservative press, and all this cannot pass without having some impact."
"However, these issues do not lead us to condemn the excellent provisions in the report that has been submitted."
"I would, nevertheless, like to speak briefly about the Council' s legal instruments."
"Why have a Framework Decision rather than a directive, when it is a question of amending several, very important points, several provisions of the penal code in each of the Member States?"
"I would also like to bring up the method which has been used in the report."
"The Commission text was written in sufficiently general terms so that all types of criminality could be included."
"We added to them. In some areas, has the wording of the report not been made more cumbersome than is necessary?"
"On the other hand, we approve the definition of extreme circumstances such as the use of children under the age of 16 years or children with physical or mental disabilities."
"A particular point in the text is raised by Amendment No 26, which seeks to amend Article 8(3)."
"Apparently, this amendment applies when a Member State maintains the requirement of double criminality against its nationals who are accused of child pornography."
"In such cases, the Member State must, nonetheless, take steps."
"What is meant exactly by the term 'requirement of double criminality' ?"
"Does this refer to the principle that lawyers understand by its Latin name, the non bis in idem principle?"
"If so, it would, in that case, mean the principle of non-double criminality, in other words, the refusal to convict nationals if they are involved in legal proceedings in another Member State."
"I believe that we should revise the wording of this point."
"The definition of pornography is more extensive in the report than in the original text; as is the definition of the material used for child pornography or the responsibility of persons that have children in their care."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would, however, give you a warning as regards the Internet."
"It is difficult to ask for the impossible."
"The Internet itself is no more responsible than the postal services for this criminal material, which can be transmitted by post."
"If we ask Internet service providers to carry out checks, which can only be effective if they are comprehensive, would, in my view, bring about the same pernicious effects as if we asked the postal services to check the content of the mail that they deliver."
"With these reservations, we support the majority of the report, as well as Interpol' s integration with Europol."
"We hope that, in this way, the report will contribute to eradicating this despicable phenomenon."
"Mr President, we must congratulate the authors of the two reports, which are crucial and a credit to Parliament's work."
"The proposed measures, which we shall support, aim to preserve the integrity of those who need us most, namely children."
"They represent the future of this world, they are also the most vulnerable and, I regret to say, they have to suffer from the selfishness of adults even before they are born, when they cannot even plead for mercy as they have no voice and no real identity."
"We shall support these two reports by voting in favour of the amendments that go further than the Council proposal."
"We would particularly like to say that these are crimes for which we should show no complacency, and that these measures must be applied in cases where the children involved are under 16 years of age, which is what we voted for in committee."
"In parallel with these provisions, we should combat the genuine, deep-rooted causes of this evil, one of which is the lax attitude of most European nations towards pornography."
"Under the pretext of freedom of the press or freedom of the individual, we are allowing a minority to distribute, via films, books, magazines, the minitel system and, increasingly now over the Internet, a vast library of pornographic material, which scorns the dignity of human beings and, quite freely, shamelessly and disrespectfully, stimulates the sexual instinct in an anarchical manner."
"Taking pre-emptive action in order to combat this crime is part of a policy that is centred on the family and which encourages proper integration of children within society."
"Experience tells us that children who are properly integrated within a family are afforded better protection from the evils of today' s society, such as drugs, the trafficking of human beings and pornography."
"They are also in a better position to resist these evils if they do encounter them."
"Mr President, I was in Parliament in the summer of 1995 when the appalling crimes of Mr Dutroux were exposed."
"It was as a direct result of the horror expressed in this Parliament at those dreadful crimes that we began on the path we are still moving along now towards improving legislation for the protection of children."
"I should like to congratulate both our colleagues on their excellent reports."
"I would also like to express my great regret that six years after those heinous crimes were exposed, this man has still not been brought to justice."
"That perhaps demonstrates that the extent of the crimes was unbelievable to us at the time and that the law was not adequate to deal with them."
"Yet it remains an absolute disgrace that this man has not yet been brought to justice."
"I should like to make a few technical remarks about the report."
"The strong transnational dimension of the problem requires the establishment of high standards of Community law in relation to child sexual exploitation, standards that also apply to the CEEC countries where the problems are even greater than within the Union."
"The age of consent varies between countries: 13 years in Spain and the Netherlands, 17 years in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland."
"So a child abuser can move quite easily between countries where the legislation provides for a lower age of consent."
"They can do this purely to avoid criminal sanctions."
"This also presents a considerable obstacle to developing common standards and comparative data protection."
"Article 5(1) of the Commission text proposes that the penalties for abusing a child under the age of 10 years should be more severe."
"We reject this because any abuse of children is a criminal offence."
"Finally, acquisition and possession of child pornography with the aim of handing it over to the law enforcement authorities should be made an offence."
"It is a criminal offence to own this pornography, and very often the people using it are only pretending they are collecting it for the police."
"I do not think we can believe that."
"Mr President, trafficking in human beings is a serious violation of human rights which is akin to slavery."
"It is a form of slavery which, however, mainly affects women, as Mrs Fraisse has already stated."
"It is not only about enforced labour, but mainly about the granting of sexual services and forced marriages."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that the EU' s Framework Decision, following the UN' s Palermo protocol, contains a common definition of trafficking in women which is as broad as possible, thus covering all forms of trafficking in human beings."
"However, we do not achieve anything with a common definition on paper if no concrete measures are put in place to trace the perpetrators and accessories, and to offer the victims the necessary legal protection."
"What measures?"
"First of all, it is necessary for the victims of trafficking in human beings, once they have reported their case, not to run the risk of being evicted from the country prematurely because they are residing there unlawfully."
"Actual legal protection and personal support can only be brought about when they obtain an interim residence permit which enables them to take part in their trial."
"Secondly, it is necessary for a specific deterrent to be put in place to combat the complicity of officials on duty, such as police and customs officers, since they play a key role, whether they turn a blind eye or effectively fight the trafficking in human beings."
"In short, the Framework Decision to fight trafficking in human beings does reflect the political will of the Member States to tackle trafficking in human beings, but it remains to be seen whether this problem is granted sufficient priority in practice on the agenda of both national and European cooperation at judicial and at police level."
"I would therefore call for periodic reports from the Council and the Commission to this Parliament, so that we can keep a finger on the pulse and can highlight in good time the need to intensify that policy."
"Finally, I should like to comment on Mrs Karamanou' s report on child pornography."
"I remain in doubt as to whether the definition is worded correctly since it is inadequate in the legal detailing and is too broad, and therefore opens the way for a witch-hunt approach."
"I am therefore seriously considering abstaining from voting on this matter."
"Mr President, we must clamp down on child pornography, for children are being abused in the name of child pornography, and we must therefore commit to a firm no in terms of criminal law and society."
"For this purpose, however, we require a well-thought out definition of child pornography which does not compromise the seriousness of the abuse of children and respects the European rights of both victims and suspects."
"The very broad definition in Mrs Karamanou' s report therefore gives my group some cause for concern. Indeed, censoring fantasy is taking things too far in our view."
"Virtual child pornography, pornographic texts and misleading images may be products of an unspeakable fantasy, but cannot be equated with the actual abuse of a child."
"The accounts of the Marquis de Sade do not strike me as particularly uplifting, but I do not want to impose a legal ban on them via this report either."
"Equally, I often dislike violence in books and films, such as Pulp Fiction, but only when fantasy touches reality should criminal law be introduced."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mrs Klamt and Mrs Karamanou for producing such good reports."
"The sexual exploitation of children, child pornography and trafficking in human beings are appalling crimes which are assuming alarming proportions."
"Their proliferation is facilitated through globalisation and modern telecommunications technology."
"These problems can no longer be resolved through national measures."
"The European Union and its Member States must adopt a joint approach in cooperation with the third countries concerned."
"As regards the trafficking in human beings, a clear distinction must be made between two areas: sexual abuse, and the exploitation of labour."
"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there are more slaves in the world than were trafficked from Africa in the previous centuries."
"The United Nations estimates that worldwide, around 200 million people are exploited as slaves."
"Trafficking in human beings is conducted via well-organised criminal and in some cases international networks."
"The Framework Decision is an important step towards better cooperation between Member States."
"The harmonisation of Member States' legal provisions will establish a basis for better cooperation between judicial authorities in order to enable Europe to combat this trade in human beings."
"The same applies to the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"All the preventive options must be expanded further."
"In order to take effective action against these criminal networks, we need targeted training for the police and law enforcement officers."
"These problems must be considered in the accession negotiations with the Central and East European countries."
"With regard to the trafficking in human beings, for example, some accession countries have now become countries of origin, transit countries, and even target countries."
"On the European Union's borders, prostitution, sex tourism and the sexual exploitation of children have become a sad reality."
"Swift measures are therefore required in these countries to combat crime in these areas and strengthen cooperation with the EU."
"Mr President, 140 years ago, slavery was abolished in the USA and Russia."
"Now, it has been introduced into Europe."
"According to the UN body the IOM, half a million women are lured or forced into Europe every year for a life as sex slaves."
"This substantially increased trade is more profitable than drug smuggling and is increasingly often controlled by an organised mafia."
"At the same time, every year over a million children are forced into child prostitution and the growing child pornography industry."
"These children are increasingly being exploited by tourists and businessmen who, remarkably often, come from Europe."
"Despite this grim reality, the penalties for the sexual exploitation of children, for child pornography and for trafficking in women are exceedingly low compared with the penalties for drugs smuggling."
"It may perhaps be a matter of two years' imprisonment compared with 10-15 years for serious drugs crimes."
"Few perpetrators are brought before the courts and even fewer are sentenced."
"We are today debating an attempt to turn rhetoric and fine words, to which we have in fact been devoting ourselves for many years, into concrete measures."
"Our four rapporteurs have carried out excellent work and, on a number of points, go further than the Commission, which moreover I would also compliment."
"It is essential to achieve a harmonisation of the legislation and to increase the penalties."
"Where the sexual exploitation of children is concerned, our most important demand is that the legislation must encompass all children under 16 years of age, which is entirely in line with the usual definition of children in international conventions."
"Setting the limit at 10 years of age may even worsen the situation for children who are just 10 years old, because demand for these children will then increase dramatically."
"The lack of legislation applies not just to measures to combat the criminals, but also to the absence of the laws protecting the victims."
"There are already many of us who support the call to stop the sexual exploitation of women and children, but more are needed."
"We need more men and more governments to support it, and above all we need more practical action."
"Mr President, after complimenting Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Klamt on their fine work, I would like to make two comments, one general and the other institutional in nature."
"As regards reflections of an institutional nature, it seems to me that cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on this very sensitive issue is making significant, excellent progress."
"That is far less the case, though - and here I agree entirely with Mrs Terrón i Cusi - when it comes to the Council."
"We are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue, an issue that is of fundamental importance to our society."
"It is important for there to be an interinstitutional relationship which can give concrete form to the guidelines so well specified in these two reports."
"For the first time since the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted at Nice, we have the possibility of converting a policy document into a legal document and implementing Article 24."
"My general comment is that, on such a delicate issue, so well addressed in these reports, we are faced with a society where, increasingly, we see a creed taking root which is very close to a sort of new nihilism."
"A whole series of personal and interpersonal relationships have been greatly disturbed."
"We imagine that by giving our children everything they ask for, through the benefits of consumerism - I say this as a father - we are giving them some kind of happiness."
"We should think carefully about the decisions we take as a European Parliament."
"The European Parliament synthesises the tensions present in society."
"The issue we are now dealing with, the exploitation of children, which pervades all societies from the most to the least developed, needs to be dealt with through legislation, as we are now doing, but also in general sociological and societal development terms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the content of these two reports, and also wish to thank the Commission for its initiatives to combat these appalling crimes: the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"It is right that we should think not only about how to define child pornography and sexual exploitation but also to what extent and where we set the age limits."
"It is also right that we should discuss the maximum penalties."
"I support the proposals put forward in the report."
"However, I should like to draw your attention to a further point - and I am grateful that it has been included in the reports - namely the problem of minimum, rather than just maximum, penalties."
"A society's condemnation of a crime is reflected to a substantial extent in the minimum penalties it applies."
"Even today, in many cases of child pornography crimes, the inadequate minimum penalties available mean that a suspended sentence is imposed."
"However, child pornography is certainly not a crime where a suspended sentence is appropriate."
"I therefore call for this House, through its cooperation on defining adequate minimum sentences, to create conditions which ensure that society genuinely recognises that these crimes are the worst form of harm that can be inflicted on a child."
"Together, through these initiatives, we should lay the foundation stones for this awareness within the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I congratulate Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Klamt for their excellent reports and thank all those of you who have been raising this very important issue for several years."
"I would like to start with Mrs Klamt's report."
"The Commission's proposals should be viewed in the context of a more comprehensive policy that includes the closer police and judicial cooperation in the fight against organised crime; the contributions that important Community programmes like STOP and DAPHNE have given to this issue; and, last but not least, the Forum on the Prevention of Organised Crime recently launched by the Commission, which includes a specific workshop on trafficking in human beings."
"However, prevention is only one side of the coin."
"Providing victims with assistance and protection is equally important."
"I would like to remind you that in March the Council adopted a Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings."
"That decision addresses several important issues taken up in some of Parliament's amendments."
"Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that the Commission will be submitting a proposal on temporary residence permits for those victims of trafficking prepared to cooperate in investigations against their exploiters."
"Such an initiative should be autonomous and provide a platform for more structured assistance and protection, by clarifying the status of victims vis-à- vis residence."
"Given the circumstances, and bearing in mind the specific nature of the legal instruments under discussion, the Commission shares the underlying aims of several of the amendments put forward by Parliament."
"However, we will be unable to accept those that fall within the scope of other Framework Decisions - the Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, for instance - or those whose detailed nature is incompatible with a specific instrument such as a Framework Decision."
"I regret to say that, although I wholly favour the idea of creating a fund to protect the victims, such a fund would run counter to the subsidiarity principle that we need to honour in specific instruments such as Framework Decisions."
"Having said that, the Commission accepts most of the amendments to the recitals, including those inserting references to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to underline the work carried out by Parliament over the years."
"The Commission also fully shares the objectives of the amendments on the abuse of vulnerability, on vulnerability and debt bondage, and on vulnerability, physical and mental disabilities and illegal residence."
"It can also support the amendments on transportation in inhuman conditions as an aggravated circumstance."
"As far as the Klamt report is concerned, I would like to emphasise that the sterling efforts and commitment of the Swedish Presidency have culminated in a basic agreement on several provisions, but sadly, no consensus has been achieved on the severity of sanctions."
"The Commission has not, therefore, submitted a revised proposal."
"We will await Parliament's opinions and then incorporate them into our own position."
"Let me now turn to Mrs Karamanou's report."
"I would like to praise her approach and to add that, indeed, action should always take practical as well as legal form. For those actions to succeed it will be vital to harmonise criminal law and criminal regulations relating both to sanctions and to the definitions of child pornography, and child pornography on the Internet in particular."
"Here again, we share the objectives of some of the amendments that have been put forward, but we sincerely feel that they come under the provisions of other legal instruments such as the Framework Decisions on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings."
"Regarding the amendments concerned with the definition of child pornography and the offence of child pornography, we believe that the definitions decided by the Union should be as much in line as possible with the definitions taken on board by the draft Convention on Cyber Crime drawn up by the Council of Europe."
"Coherence between these two instruments is, in my opinion, extremely important."
"The Commission would like to highlight its position on two sets of amendments that are particularly difficult from a political point of view."
"First I turn to the amendments suggesting that sexual exploitation of persons below the age of 16 years should be regarded as an aggravated offence."
"This involves very complicated issues of a legal nature, not least as regards the relation between national law and European Union law - subsidiarity."
"Under many Member States' criminal law, sexual exploitation is an offence when it involves a person below the age of sexual consent, as soon as the occurrence of a sexual act has been established."
"This means, in turn, that the amendments setting the age limit for an aggravated offence at 16 will undoubtedly interfere not only with the systematic approaches in the Member States but also with national considerations on the age of consent."
"We have no legal title to harmonise the issue of the age of consent to sexual relations."
"The Commission cannot therefore agree with the relevant amendments but would be willing to consider an age limit set at a higher level than in the original proposal, that is, changing the age limit from the age of 10 to 12 years."
"Secondly, as regards the amendments concerned with jurisdiction and extradition, it should be observed that the articles of the proposal are modelled on provisions reflecting the state of play in regard to specific instruments in this field."
"The Commission cannot therefore agree to the suggested amendments."
"At the same time, we are willing to consider these issues in a broader context."
"However, as regards the extension of the jurisdiction article to habitual residents, the Commission would be prepared to take that amendment on board, as it would all other amendments to the recitals of the proposal."
"In conclusion, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to reach a political agreement in the Council as far as sanctions are concerned."
"I share the view of those who say that in reality the application of penal law differs in our 15 Member States."
"That is true."
"We must not, however, give the wrong message to those who traffic in human beings by not having common sanctions at European level."
"It would seriously defeat our common aim if we were not capable of agreeing on common sanctions when it comes to trafficking in human beings."
"We have already achieved agreement when it comes to counterfeiting the euro, when it comes to money-laundering, or when it comes to smugglers' and carriers' liability."
"I do not see any justification for not reaching political agreement on common sanctions on trafficking in human beings for purposes of economic exploitation and sexual exploitation."
"Animal welfare"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on animal welfare."
"Mr President, honourable Members, today' s debate shows that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have a common interest in animal welfare and animal ethics."
"It also provides us with the opportunity to exchange thoughts on these important matters."
"Man' s relationship with animals is increasingly a matter of discussion in today' s society."
"During my time as a member of the EU' s Council of Agriculture Ministers it has been clear that matters concerning animal welfare have come up on the agenda with increasing frequency and taken up increasing amounts of time."
"In this respect, the year 1995 is not like the year 2001."
"When we discuss issues concerning animals, however, in recent times these have mostly been concerned with diseased animals and with occurrences within agriculture that have had catastrophic consequences."
"The issues concerning the protection of animals dealt with by the Council, primarily concern technical provisions, but I believe that it is high time that we also discussed matters of principle concerning man' s relationship with animals and how animals are to be treated."
"The ethical aspects of livestock farming must guide our decisions in the area of agricultural policy to a greater extent in future."
"Ethics is not about labelling things as good or evil, or good or bad; rather they are a tool to help us as we make difficult choices."
"We must dare to ask why animals are regarded merely as products in some contexts and why we allow animals to be treated poorly in certain cases."
"When unsatisfactory states of affairs are revealed, we tend to react with demands for stricter provisions, but it is not possible to prevent the cruel treatment of animals through legislation or control measures alone."
"How animals are treated is also a matter of people' s attitudes and values."
"At the Council of Ministers in May, I took the initiative for a debate on ethical aspects of livestock farming."
"The purpose of the debate was to highlight the matter at a level of principle, starting from the fact that, in the future too, we will have a society in which animals are in the service of humans."
"All the Member States felt that the ethical aspects of livestock farming are important."
"These must be integrated to a greater extent into future decisions concerning livestock farming."
"The Member States pointed out that animals are sentient beings that must be treated well."
"Several countries stated that knowledge concerning animals and animals' needs, as well as training measures for people who deal with animals in their everyday work, are of crucial importance."
"My conclusions from the debate included the fact that animals are sentient creatures with an intrinsic value."
"They must be treated with respect, and consideration is to be given to their health and welfare."
"In my conclusion, I pointed out that the statements made must not just remain fine words; rather, they commit us to take practical measures in respect of the protection of animals."
"The scientific conference, Food Chain 2001 was held in line with the Swedish Presidency' s emphasis on a holistic view of the food chain."
"I think it is important to note one of the conference' s conclusions in particular. Improved animal welfare which guarantees healthier animals often has crucial economic benefits."
"At the informal meeting of ministers in Östersund in April, the EU' s future agricultural and food policy was discussed."
"Here, it was clear that changes must take place."
"In their contributions, many of my colleagues highlighted the crisis that agriculture is currently in."
"Mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease and unacceptable animal transport are just some of the matters that make the need for change clear."
"Another of Sweden' s conferences during its presidency was Ethics and Animal Welfare 2001, to which Parliament was also invited."
"The aim of this conference was to bring together representatives of industry, animal welfare organisations and public authorities and to conduct a discussion on animal welfare and ethics."
"The participants agreed that the exchange of experiences and an open, continuous dialogue are a prerequisite for improvements in the area of animal welfare."
"For example, it is important that provisions that are adopted are also implemented in practice."
"I am pleased that discussions on animal welfare and animal ethics have been conducted in so many contexts, but in order for improvements to animal welfare to come about, tighter provisions are also needed in many areas."
"During the period of Sweden' s Presidency, the Council has dealt with several proposals in the area of animal welfare."
"One of these dossiers is the Commission' s report on animal welfare during transport."
"The report was presented and discussed at the Council of Ministers in January."
"One of the report' s conclusions is that every Member State must earmark further resources for the implementation of existing provisions."
"It is also important for the Commission to come up with concrete proposals for improvements in the legislation."
"The Presidency is also working to bring about adoption of a resolution on animal transport at the Council of Ministers in June, that is, next week."
"The purpose is to ask the Commission to provide suggestions for provisions to improve animal transport."
"Naturally, the Presidency needs great support if such a resolution is to be decided on."
"In my opinion, the most urgent matter is for the provisions that already exist to really be implemented in the Member States, but that is still not happening."
"This is shown, in particular, by film and video footage that has been recorded in various countries, often in secret."
"Such footage clearly shows that provisions are not being implemented and are also a source of disgust on the part of our citizens."
"It is important to implement the common decisions that we have taken in each country."
"It is also important that the periods for which animals are transported are shortened and that export subsidies for live animals are abolished."
"Fortunately enough, during the latter part of this spring the Commission submitted a proposal within this area."
"The proposal concerns improved ventilation in the road vehicles used for transporting animals for over eight hours."
"The Presidency has initiated discussion of the proposal in the Council' s working party."
"The Presidency has worked very intensively on the Commission' s proposal for a new directive on the welfare of pigs."
"As you already know, the proposal involves improved conditions for pigs."
"We very much appreciate the rapporteur' s, Mr Busk' s, work on this proposal."
"I believe it is very important that we in the Council are able to arrive at a decision on improvements in pig keeping as quickly as possible."
"This of course requires an opinion from the European Parliament."
"I therefore hope for your understanding of our desire for a fast procedure."
"This should allow a clear signal to be given by both the European Parliament and the Council that we see animal welfare as a priority matter."
"Detailed provisions are important, but they must be based on a fundamental position concerning our responsibility for animals."
"Within the EU, we have decided that we must take animals' needs into consideration."
"This is clear, for example, from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which establishes that animals are sentient beings and that animal welfare is to be taken into consideration in the drawing up and implementation of the Community' s policies."
"Naturally, we will continue to show consideration for animals because our legislation demands it."
"Moreover, it is my personal conviction that our human dignity bids us accept our responsibility for animals."
"Man is in a unique and special position and therefore also has a moral responsibility to show consideration for animals."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for taking the initiative to request this debate."
"It is a measure of the importance attached to animal welfare by the Presidency, and by Minister Winberg in particular."
"The past several months have seen a sharp rise in interest in animal welfare issues at Community level."
"There have been several discussions on the issue in the Agriculture Council and a major conference was also organised in Stockholm late last month, as Mrs Winberg has just told you."
"I was pleased to represent the Commission in all these debates and discussions."
"Of course, this presidency is not yet over and there will be further opportunities to address animal welfare issues."
"This Wednesday I will address Parliament's intergroup on animal welfare for the second time this year."
"In a little over a week there will be a further discussion in the Agriculture Council."
"This discussion is intended to lead to a resolution helping to set the future policy agenda."
"A cynic might argue that all this discussion amounts to hot air and is camouflage for a lack of real progress."
"I am satisfied that this is not the case."
"These discussions are genuinely worthwhile."
"It is important to build up a solid consensus on the need for more action on animal welfare."
"We should not forget that until very recently animal welfare was a neglected issue on the Community agenda."
"This is changing fast."
"Moreover, I am convinced that it will become even more important in the future."
"The reason for the higher profile of this issue is not hard to see."
"People care deeply about the treatment of animals."
"They are increasingly intolerant of mistreatment of animals and insistent that our systems of agricultural production must ensure better treatment of animals."
"These sentiments are also feeding into the market."
"There is a much greater demand from consumers for information on the conditions in which animals are reared."
"The public demand more and better information on products and foodstuffs: how and where they are produced, under what conditions and with what ingredients."
"It makes good business sense to respond to these demands."
"I recently received on my desk the results of a reputable survey on consumer attitudes towards key animal welfare issues."
"The survey results include the interesting information that up to 85% of consumers are prepared to pay more for food produced in accordance with the highest welfare standards."
"Even if these results are not fully reflected by consumers in their shopping behaviour, there is a clear potential for the market to give greater prominence to higher standards as a competitive tool."
"These trends will continue to grow and there is no reason why they cannot be accommodated."
"We already have a system in the EU for the identification and traceability of each individual cow."
"There is clear potential to use this system to provide information on other important factors, such as the breed of the animal concerned and the conditions in which it was reared."
"This argument should also be considered in relation to the global dimension of the trade in animals and animal products."
"It is essential to share our knowledge on animal welfare with countries outside the European Union and to create a consistent approach towards the issue."
"In this context, I was pleased to learn that the World Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE, adopted last week at its general session a five-year work programme that includes animal welfare questions."
"This is the first time that a broad-based international forum, like the OIE, has decided to address this question."
"The Commission strongly supports this initiative and intends to actively participate in this future development."
"This House is, of course, very aware of these concerns."
"There is an ever-increasing postbag of letters from the general public and from Members of Parliament on animal welfare issues."
"A disproportionate number of written and oral questions to the Commission are also on this subject."
"It is our duty and responsibility to reflect on these concerns."
"I would like, however, to sound a word of caution on a number of fronts."
"There are increasing calls for more Community action on animal welfare, but we should be careful that this does not distract attention from the responsibility of all parties to promote higher standards."
"I spoke at length on this in Stockholm recently."
"The Commission can ultimately only play a subsidiary role in relation to animal welfare."
"Certainly, within our area of competence, we must take our responsibilities very seriously. However, Member States continue to have the most important role to play since animal welfare requirements are adopted as minimum standards in European legislation."
"In addition, Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation in this field."
"They also have the personnel resources to carry out this role, which the Commission clearly does not have."
"A second qualification relates to the role of farmers and the livestock industry in general."
"There is a danger of stigmatising the very large number of people who work in farming by associating them with images of mistreatment of animals."
"This is unfair, untrue and counterproductive."
"Ultimately, farmers are the persons in closest contact with animals and are the most conscious of their needs and behaviour."
"The vast majority clearly treat their animals in a good and humane manner."
"We can either choose to work with the farming community on these issues or risk alienating them."
"I know where I stand on this: work with the farmers."
"Turning to more general issues, I would like to signal some clear Commission orientations."
"First, animal welfare questions need to be integrated more fully into food policy."
"I reject the argument that animal welfare has nothing to do with food safety."
"I insist that it is an issue which should be included in the policy agenda of the European Food Authority."
"This applies in particular as regards scientific advice and information, which the authority should provide to the Commission on all matters having a direct or indirect impact on consumer health and safety."
"Second, there is the need for further Community actions."
"There are a number of important initiatives already before the Council and Parliament, for example the proposal on improved welfare conditions for pigs reared in intensive rearing systems."
"This proposal includes provision for the abolition of individual sow stalls, a major and legitimate demand of welfare activists."
"The presidency is very anxious to reach final agreement on this proposal."
"This, however, requires an opinion from Parliament and I hope that you will be in a position to respond favourably to the request for the urgent adoption of this opinion this week."
"That would provide a very positive signal of Parliament's own commitment to animal welfare."
"There is also a proposal for improved humidity and ventilation systems on trucks transporting animals."
"The Commission is also awaiting an opinion expected in October from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on densities and travelling times."
"This opinion will help shape our future policy on animal transport, which will be discussed in depth in the Agriculture Council later this month."
"Third, I intend to continue to focus on the global dimension in the issue of animal welfare and animal products, including the World Trade Organisation."
"There is a common misconception that this is a protectionist agenda."
"This is unfair."
"Europe is progressively implementing higher welfare standards."
"We have a duty and a responsibility to press for recognition of these standards both on purely ethical grounds in recognition of the need for the humane treatment of animals and in recognition of the higher costs which these standards entail for producers and consumers in the European Union."
"These are legitimate issues which deserve to be discussed on the international stage."
"Finally, the Commission will continue to press for improved respect of existing Community legislation."
"I repeat again my frustration at the repeated reports from my officials of continued non-respect of Community provisions on animal welfare."
"Equally, the single biggest immediate and practical measure to promote animal welfare would be the strict implementation of existing legislation."
"This is just a brief outline of a complex and sensitive issue."
"Thank you for your attention and I look forward to hearing your views on the issue."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the issue of animal welfare is mentioned, no one in Europe thinks of cats in cages at the airport, no one thinks of horses being transported to the Olympic Games on the other side of the world, and no one thinks of birds in cages on fifth-floor window sills."
"Over the years, it has been the transport of livestock in Europe and overseas which has understandably upset the public most of all."
"The consumers and the animal rights activists do not understand why there is still a need for it."
"In my view, the question is not so much 'why' but - quite rightly - 'how'."
"How are the animals transported?"
"This has been discussed for many years at European level, so it is not a new issue."
"Commissioner Byrne, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 12 years, and we have been discussing this issue throughout these 12 years."
"We have already produced vast quantities of papers and resolutions."
"Why, then, are we making such slow progress?"
"Animal welfare is now given far greater priority, and the focus is no longer solely on costs and competition."
"In contrast to earlier debates about animal welfare, the agenda increasingly includes ethical issues as well as technical aspects."
"To use a metaphor: we are all broadly in agreement about the destination of our journey, but the path is very rocky."
"I say this: through their shopping behaviour, consumers could have made a very significant contribution to setting a new course in the past as well."
"Prices were a key factor then, and I would argue that the final prices paid by consumers will be a key factor in future too."
"In its report, the Commission emphasises its plans to improve the implementation of existing legislation."
"I greatly welcome this statement."
"The licensing of transport companies, transport plans and the Member States' inspection reports must all be coordinated far more effectively, and I completely agree that Community standards should now be introduced for third countries as well."
"The definitions of the animals' fitness for transport, but also vehicle standards, densities, travelling times and rest periods, etc. must all be brought into line with current scientific knowledge to a far greater extent."
"I am in favour of animal welfare, and let me assure you that farmers are too."
"They have been for decades - in their animal husbandry, breeding and transport."
"Mr Byrne, thank you very much for stating this so clearly today."
"Let me conclude by saying that what I am opposed to are the different definitions of the animals' wellbeing."
"Given the great many directives in force, this diverges widely in the Member States."
"Happy hens in Germany will have to feel different from perky pigs in Holland or contented calves in Denmark."
"We cannot have that. It leads to distortions of competition, and I really must oppose it, also in the interests of farmers."
"Mr President, we greatly welcome the fact that the issue of animal welfare is being discussed by the Council and the Commission in the European Parliament today."
"The Community's obligation to take full account of animal welfare requirements within the framework of its agricultural policy is anchored in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The question which now arises in this context is whether this is sufficient for the Community or whether there should be European framework legislation on animal welfare in future."
"Sadly, animal welfare is not understood the same way everywhere."
"Laws are one thing; the actual treatment of, and attitude towards, animals are another."
"The responsibility for animals as living creatures falls exclusively on humans."
"For this reason, it is important to start teaching children how to treat animals responsibly when they are still very young."
"Anyone who goes on to handle animals in the course of their work, who farms them or transports them, must have a certificate proving their suitability and skills."
"Animal welfare also has an impact on farms' competitiveness, however."
"There will have to be restrictions on livestock farming for economic purposes in future too."
"Demands for optimum conditions, which often stem from emotional responses, cannot always be translated directly into practice."
"Viable solutions must be devised."
"The classification of animals as farm animals, breeding animals and pets is not an arbitrary one, after all."
"Economic considerations and global competition ultimately compel us to adopt specific conditions of animal husbandry, thus limiting the scope for truly animal-centred livestock farming."
"However, these farming conditions must be shaped in a way which ensures that animals have the maximum scope for natural behaviour."
"Political decisions on animal welfare can now be based on comprehensive scientific knowledge of the different species."
"The laws on animal welfare should only be developed and improved with the involvement of those concerned."
"In a holistic view of animal protection, the animals' natural behaviour and needs should be compatible with environmental concerns and consumer protection, but also with the expectation of profit."
"Our society's high standards of hygiene must also not be compromised."
"After all, more consumer protection ultimately leads to better conditions of animal welfare."
"Mr President, the treatment of animals is a question of civilisation."
"Pets are cherished, but cattle is often still treated abominably."
"Intensive cattle farming has elevated animal abuse to a methodology."
"The policy is unilaterally focused on cheap production."
"Animals have degenerated massively into commodities you eat or which earn you money, instead of living creatures with an intrinsic value."
"It is high time that animals were no longer adapted to suit their environment, but the environment to suit the animals."
"Drastic improvements are required in terms of their accommodation."
"For example, pigs and calves must be kept in groups and must be given plenty of straw."
"The castration of pigs, bobtailing and the cutting of teeth must be banned."
"Laying hens must be kept exclusively in spacious, free-range bird houses."
"The artificial, fast-track breeding of chicks and turkeys must be discontinued."
"Cows must regularly be led to pasture again and geese must from now on be spared torture for the sake of their tastefully prepared livers."
"It is sheer madness that pigs are dragged across Europe for the sake of being able to label them 'Parma' ."
"Long hauls with live cattle must be abolished."
"In my view, four hours, or 250 km, are the maximum."
"The inspection of cattle transports must be tightened considerably."
"International trade should be conducted in meat and not in live animals."
"Proper slaughterhouses must be set up everywhere, so as to restrict transport. Cattle markets must be abolished."
"The recent disasters may well be the salvation of future animals, but only if we gain the awareness that animals are more than mere production factors."
"Until such time, animals will suffer, and people will suffer from a lack of civilisation."
"Mr President, I also welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission."
"I welcome all the statements concerning this issue of the protection of animals and animal welfare."
"I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency which, for the first time ever, has succeeded in bringing about a public debate on animal ethics in the Council of Ministers."
"This is therefore progress."
"Animal ethics is about much more than mere rules."
"It is about attitudes and knowledge of animals and about how animals must feel well."
"Nonetheless, it is very important that the legislation and rules of both the EU and, especially, the Member States are followed."
"On 8 March, the Greens held a conference on animal welfare here in Parliament, at which, I am pleased to say, Margareta Winberg was also present."
"At this conference, it emerged that there is no overall supervision whatsoever of the EU' s animal transport directives, nor any checks on whether they are being observed."
"Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, animals are being transported the length and breadth of Europe under terrible conditions without anyone intervening."
"The provisions that exist on the transport of live animals are well known, for example, the limits on time in transport and requirements of veterinary certificates."
"However, there is no functioning supervisory apparatus."
"Now we have been given an answer from the Commission to the question that I put."
"The Council too has also stated that the transport of live animals must cease..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, there is a well-known saying that well-being is more important than welfare."
"This may not always be obvious in the case of people, but in the case of animals, I would say that that is a matter of fact."
"Welfare for people can even harm animals' well-being, particularly if we consider the pursuit of profit."
"However, what is more important to us is that animals should also be accepted as God' s creatures."
"Without putting them on a par with people, that means that we should be proper stewards."
"Unfortunately, cattle species in particular have been reduced to production factors in our economy and, let us be honest, the consumer is all too happy to benefit from the low prices which this entails."
"Legislation on animal welfare is mostly very detailed in certain areas, but lacks a coherent vision."
"The enforcement of that legislation is, at the same time, a great cause for concern, and it often amounts to nothing but rules on paper."
"In fact, it is telling that, in a totalitarian regime such as China, the concept of animal welfare does not even exist in the language."
"We welcome initiatives which considerably restrict the transport of live cattle."
"It is really beyond me why slaughter cannot take place prior to transport instead of afterwards."
"In that connection, I consider breaks in the journey to be a stopgap."
"The maximum period of transport for live animals should make these redundant."
"Mr President, if we really take the well-being of animals into account, then it will be obvious that agricultural policy cannot merely be based on economic measures."
"Mr President, in the context of the foot-and-mouth crisis, millions of animals, including hundreds of thousands of vaccinated animals, were killed in the EU as a precautionary measure, despite loud protests from farmers, citizens and country people."
"This was due to European directives which, in principle, prescribe a slaughter policy without vaccination."
"Ring vaccinations are permitted in exceptional cases but with such far-reaching implications for the exports of the Member States involved that, in practice, that also involves removal."
"The European Commission recently decided to allow exports of meat from Uruguay back into the EU without guarantees as to whether the meat concerned originated from animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth."
"It must be the ultimate in bureaucracy for meat from animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth from outside the EU to be allowed on the internal market, but for that from within the EU not to be permitted."
"Now is also a good time for the Council to make drastic changes to legislation on controlling foot-and-mouth, also in the light of unnecessary animal suffering."
"With the imports from Uruguay, the market argument not to vaccinate against foot-and-mouth has been laid to rest for ever."
"If the Council takes European farmers and citizens as seriously as the farmers from South America, now is the time for action."
"I should like to persuade the Commissioner and the Council to repeal the non-vaccination policy."
"I should also like to mention a second point, namely the large discrepancies in terms of animal welfare among the Member States."
"I would concur with the remark made by my colleague, Mrs Keppelhoff, on that point."
"Animal welfare is still too often an element in the distortion of competition among the Member States."
"What is also striking is that, in these matters, the Commission' s and Council' s ambition certainly leaves something to be desired."
"For that reason, Parliament is very likely this week to make the directive on the welfare of pigs stricter but, at the same time, to present an initiative proposal on animal transport in September."
"It is crucial, in this connection, to consider the role of consumers and the possibility of introducing a green tax system."
"Mr President, it is a real pleasure to hear Mrs Winberg and the Commissioner speaking with one voice on an issue which should concern us all."
"This seems to me to mark a turning point in how this Parliament debates these matters, because it sets out here a coherent, ethical framework by which we should all subsequently be judged."
"Animals are not merely products, nor are they simply commodities."
"One of the most appalling things I heard in my own country came from a trader concerning the spread of foot-and-mouth disease: ""They are commodities."
"I take them around."
"I trade them here, I trade them there."""
"They are not stocks and shares."
"They are not speculative metals."
"They are sentient creatures."
"Because of that I believe, with the Commissioner, that the way in which animals are kept reflects on us morally, but also practically, in that bad conditions for animals affect the health and safety of humans as well."
"The Food Safety Authority will need to address this matter."
"The Commissioner is right to say that consumers would be prepared to pay more for 'ethical food' ."
"Another thing they want - but do not always get - is follow-through in the area where animal welfare is promised, but not always delivered."
"Like everyone else in this House, I hope and expect that the sow stalls proposal will go through on Thursday."
"It will certainly have our support."
"I would like to feel that at the same time we are looking at other issues which, because they are cherished in some Member State or in some particular group or community within the European Union, are shrugged aside."
"I have seen recently that the Italians have tackled the issue of how foie gras is produced."
"Others have begun to raise the issue of the cruelties involved in the breeding of animals for the fur trade."
"Now we are coming to the point where, in the testing of chemicals, perhaps we ought to have an absolute assurance (and I know Commissioner Byrne has gone some way towards this already) that we will minimise - and I use that word advisedly - the number of animals sacrificed in the validation of chemical testing."
"Those things seem to me to be enormously important."
"Against such a backdrop we can begin to persuade the WTO that these issues are humanitarian, not protectionist."
"Then, perhaps, we will able to fashion the means of arriving at a food system in which people matter, but animals matter too."
"Mr President, Minister Winberg, however much I can identify with what else has been said here today, I should like to focus on one topic."
"More specifically, I should like to talk about the transport of live animals."
"I have asked you a question in this connection. It is clear to me: animals intended for slaughter should not be seen as products."
"Meat can be transported over long distances; animals cannot."
"That is my guiding principle."
"You stated that you need to monitor this long-haul transport in the Member States."
"It is evident that the means are desperately lacking."
"You responded to me by saying that you have no more than four inspectors at your disposal, that those four inspectors have carried out twelve inspections, only six of which covered animal welfare during transport."
"That translates into less than five percent of the inspection assignments."
"You will understand that we are not satisfied with this."
"Nevertheless, this has led to results, for two infringement procedures have been instituted against Member States and, in three cases, there was a serious lack of animal welfare during transport."
"I believe that those figures illustrate adequately that more inspections need to be carried out and that legislation needs to change, but, more than anything, that monitoring must be stepped up in terms of compliance with legislation, so that we can be certain that animals are no longer tortured during transport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission are holding this debate today."
"In my view, some progress has already been made in the past."
"After all, we have been discussing this issue for a long time, and have addressed problems of animal husbandry, animal breeding and animal welfare on numerous occasions."
"If we examine the process regarding the cage-rearing of hens, for example, we - Parliament and the European Union - have already made significant progress."
"If I look at consumer behaviour following the debates in recent years, I can already see a change."
"Nonetheless, I would caution against taking the Commissioner's statement - that 85% of consumers are prepared to pay more for food produced in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare - at face value."
"This figure is wrong."
"If I asked any member of the public: 'Would you be prepared to pay more for animal welfare?', naturally he is going to say: 'Of course I would!'"
"However, when he is at the counter buying his steak, he has a rather different view."
"Then it is quality and price that count, and nothing else matters."
"Nonetheless, we must try to reconcile the status of animals as a means of production - we have to accept this, it is a fact - and animal welfare concerns."
"There is no point in lashing out at the food producers and blaming them for everything. The only way forward is to do what the Council has suggested - I think this is very important - namely to concentrate on raising public awareness and fostering sensitivity to animal welfare issues."
"This is a very important point."
"This brings us to issues of education and training within the family."
"In other words, a very wide sphere of activity must be included."
"As regards animal health - an issue which has also been raised today - I am a little doubtful."
"A healthy animal is not always one which has been reared correctly in optimal animal welfare conditions."
"Animals can be healthy even without these conditions, as we know from practical experience."
"I wish this House every success in the next few days, also in debating the new directive on the agenda."
"I hope that this will take us a further step towards better animal welfare in Europe."
"Mr President, I would ask to be allowed to comment on some of what has been said here in the debate."
"Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert asked the very important question - not why, but how."
"I still think that we must ask both questions - not only why, but also how."
"For example, why do we dispatch animals to third countries?"
"Why do we send calves from Sweden to Holland?"
"Clearly there is an answer to these questions."
"The answer to the first question is that it is profitable, because export subsidies can be paid when animals are sent from the EU to a third country."
"Young calves are sent from Sweden to Holland, for example, because it is more profitable."
"In Holland, they are reared by a different method than in Sweden."
"We must also ask whether all this transportation really has to take place."
"Fortunately, more and more people are now asking this question, and fortunately more and more of them are also answering 'no' ."
"A number of speakers have mentioned the matter of price."
"Naturally, we must realise that if we want to have good animal welfare - and if we are to have quality rather than quantity in future agricultural production and policy - then there will be a price to pay."
"We cannot have the cheapest food in the world and, at the same time, have the best animal welfare and the best environment in the world."
"Someone has to pay. The question is simply: who?"
"There is also cause to think about this as we gradually draw up a new agricultural policy."
"Who is to pay for animal welfare?"
"Who is to pay for the countryside?"
"Who is to pay for the wetlands, for biodiversity, and so on?"
"Mr Kindermann spoke about the responsibility that man has."
"I share this opinion."
"We have a special responsibility for these matters precisely due to our status as human beings."
"We have a special position in respect of animals and it is only we who can accept that responsibility."
"Mr van den Bos provided the most far-reaching contribution of any of us here."
"It is of course easy to put forward all these demands, but we must also remember that it costs money."
"These things do not come about of their own accord."
"For example, if we demand that international trade must not be in livestock but in meat, we must also remember that there is a connection with the economic system in agricultural policy."
"In other words, we would then also have to reject all types of export subsidies for these animals."
"Mrs Schörling, like several others, spoke about supervision."
"Allow me to say that we cannot just demand that the Commission or the Council bring about improvements in respect of supervision, for the prime responsibility for supervision lies at national level."
"I believe that each and every one of us must go home to his or her country and question that country' s supervision, for it is only when a country is not taking care of matters that the Commission steps in."
"The Commission has a responsibility to ensure that supervision in the various countries is good."
"It does so through the office in Dublin."
"Mr van Dam spoke of the restrictions on live animals, and I share his opinion."
"Unfortunately, in the report, animals are defined as commodities."
"Opinions may differ on this, and I think that we should have a different starting point."
"Mr Maat talked about vaccination and exports."
"Allow me to argue that it is not just because of exports that we have this non-vaccination policy."
"The main reason is that there is not simply one single vaccine for one type of foot -and mouth disease."
"The day we find a marker vaccine is the day we will be able to start mass vaccination with a view to prevention."
"We have not yet got that far, but research is in progress."
"A conference will be held under the Belgian Presidency, once the crisis is over, to allow us to draw conclusions from the policy that has been conducted in this area."
"This will then concern not just vaccination but also other aspects which may even have encouraged infection with foot-and-mouth disease."
"This conference will hopefully be held during the autumn."
"Mr Whitehead spoke about the fact that animals are not just products and commodities."
"In this respect, I refer to my earlier answer - animals are sentient beings."
"He also addressed the matter of chemicals policy."
"In this connection, I would remind you of the Commission' s White Paper on this issue, which states, for example, that it is hoped to develop test methods that minimise the number of animals used in animal experiments."
"I think this is a very good ambition."
"Mrs Maes spoke about the inspection trips."
"In this respect, I refer to what I said concerning the responsibility for supervision."
"This responsibility devolves in the first instance upon the various countries themselves, and then the Commission supervises the countries."
"Mr Schnellhardt gave the example of chickens and said that we had achieved something."
"Yes, we have achieved something, but there still remains such an incredible amount to do."
"He does not believe that people are prepared to pay."
"No, perhaps they are not prepared to pay through higher prices."
"This takes us back to the relationship between animal welfare and cost."
"If we want to have good animal welfare and a good environment, it will not come free of charge."
"We must then also design an economic system that ensures that those who provide good animal welfare and a good environment get paid for it, possibly in a different way than through higher prices."
"Let me once again stress how important it is that the European Parliament produce an opinion in respect of a new directive on pig keeping, and I am very pleased to have Mr Whitehead' s support on this matter."
"It is important that we are able to make a decision as early as next week, because we have been working on this matter for a long time."
"Although I understand the concern that exists in respect of the economic consequences, I nonetheless hope that good animal welfare will pay off, and I am really hoping for Parliament' s support in this process."
"Finally, I would like to thank you very much for the fact that we were able to have this debate."
"It is important that it is kept alive so that the matter of man' s relationship with animals develops over time."
"We have a moral responsibility to treat animals well."
"Cruelty to animals is unworthy of us humans."
"Mr President, Mrs Winberg, ladies and gentlemen, I thank everybody for their contribution to this debate."
"I have taken very careful note of the views expressed and will take them into account in the formulation of policy and in bringing forward legislation in due course."
"Let me deal with a number of the individual issues that were raised by many of you."
"First of all, there is the question of animal transport."
"This is an issue that will get further attention from the Commission on production of the Scientific Committee's report in October, when consideration will be given to the important issues of density and length of time of transport."
"I should issue a word of caution to those of you who have a strong desire for, or who expect, the elimination of live animal transport. Some people made the point that carcass transport should replace live animal transport."
"There is a very large trade in animals for breeding purposes and it appears that a very significant percentage of animals are transported for breeding purposes rather than for consumption."
"I have asked for more details on this but I am told that is the position."
"This issue will be considered in the light of the advice given to us by the Scientific Committee."
"Another issue of considerable concern is the loading and unloading of animals."
"I expect that the scientists who advise us will also focus on that issue, maybe seeing it as even more important than the length of time over which an animal is transported, so long as the conditions under which the animal is transported are humane."
"I would remind you that legislation is already in the pipeline on the upgrading of the vehicles used for animal transport."
"Mr Maat then asked me about the consequences for trade arising from the vaccination policy in the foot-and-mouth disease issue."
"I would repeat what Mrs Winberg said, that there will be a conference on this issue during the Belgian Presidency."
"It is an issue of particular complexity."
"We were very clearly advised that the most effective way, certainly in the middle of the crisis, of eliminating further spread is the culling of the animals concerned rather than the use of vaccination."
"Moreover there are at least seven strains of foot-and-mouth disease, all of which require a separate and distinct vaccination."
"The vaccination administered is effective for only six to nine months."
"If we were to vaccinate all of the animals in the European Union that are susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, this would result in vaccinations being administered to 300 million animals every six months against seven different strains."
"A really successful vaccination policy will only come about when science has developed a form of marker vaccination."
"That means that where a marker vaccination has been administered, a subsequent test will be able to identify whether an animal is a vaccinated animal instead of an infected animal."
"At present such a distinction cannot be made once a vaccination has been administered."
"In those circumstances, the other trading blocs in the world are concerned about trading in animals which are vaccinated but may also be infected, thereby increasing the risk of spreading the infection in their own countries."
"This is not an unreasonable apprehension."
"We hope that science will develop this market vaccination for us and we will then be in a position to take further strides forward on this issue."
"This is something that will be discussed, however, and considered in the context of the conference before the end of the year, together with other issues."
"The importation of vaccinated animals and the exportation of meat from animals that are vaccinated is governed by the OIE rules."
"They apply equally to exportation out of the European Union as they do to importation within the European Union."
"It is quite incorrect to say that different principles apply or that some discrimination operates against traders within the European Union."
"Mrs Maes referred to the resources available and it is correct to say that there are four inspectors involved in this work."
"They draft reports, which are published of course, and forwarded to me for consideration as to whether infringement proceedings should be initiated or not."
"The present position is that infringement proceedings have been initiated against Greece and Belgium in relation to the implementation of Directive 91/628."
"The opening of infringement proceedings against Italy is also being considered."
"Furthermore, infringement proceedings are under consideration for the following Member States that did not comply with Article 8 of the directive, concerning the transmission to the Commission of their annual inspection report for the year 1999: Austria, the Netherlands and Portugal."
"I have given instructions to my staff to pay close attention to this issue."
"If there is a clear and persistent failure to comply with the legislation on animal welfare, infringement proceedings will be initiated against the Member State in question."
"On the question of price and standards and taking into account consumer concern for animal welfare, I am happy to tell you that Commissioner Fischler and I have initiated a debate at European Union level, and with all the Member States, on the question of food quality and the part that animal welfare plays in that context."
"This initiative, draws together a high-level, round table advisory group made up of primary producers, food processors, retailers and consumers."
"The group intends to visit all the Member States to discuss these issues."
"We have already visited Sweden, Ireland and Germany and we are scheduled to visit France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Austria in the very near future."
"We held an Internet chat last Tuesday, where we were asked in excess of 2600 questions in a period of two hours."
"By any calculation that is an extraordinary response which reflects people's enormous interest in issues relating to food quality and animal welfare."
"Many of the questions that were raised in that Internet chat were directed at the issue of animal welfare."
"You can see from this that the Commission is taking this issue very seriously, it is constantly on the Commission's agenda and I look forward to bringing further proposals back to Parliament in due course on these issues."
"I would like to finish by quoting what Mr Whitehead said in his speech calling for a food system in which 'people matter but animals matter too'."
"I fully agree."
"Information and communication technologies in developing countries"
"The next item is the report (A5-0191/2001) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and developing countries (2000/2327(INI))."
"In May, the EU and UN held the third conference on the least developed countries here in Strasbourg."
"It was a good conference in the sense that the right words were said, but there is also cause for some despair when we look at the realities."
"These are, namely, that, since 1971, when the UN recognised the term 'least developed' , the number of the least developed countries has grown from 25 to 49 today."
"Only one country, Botswana, has managed to struggle out of the ranks of the least developed countries."
"The gap between the world' s rich and poor has grown."
"In 1960, 20% of the world population in the richest countries had an income that was 30 times higher than that of the 20% poorest."
"In 1997, it was 74 times as high, and the figure is undoubtedly even higher today."
"There are many reasons why the least developed countries are in such a poor situation: rising population growth, illiteracy, untenable debt, environmental destruction, natural catastrophes and diseases such as HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis."
"In addition, unstable political conditions and a growing number of violent conflicts make it difficult to create long-term development plans."
"However, neither is it any use denying that, despite many resolutions to increase development aid by 0.7%, the reality is that development aid is 0.23% of gross domestic product."
"It is slightly better in the case of the EU, where it is 0.34%."
"The removal of customs barriers in respect of the developing countries, which will help these countries, is progressing slowly."
"This was most recently illustrated in connection with Commissioner Lamy' s proposal, which was based on the Member States' deferring the organisation of the market in sugar, especially with the support of the European sugar producers."
"In connection with the transfer of technology, private enterprise was intransigent in the fight against Aids, private enterprises only entering into a compromise with South Africa following fierce pressure, and now we are seeing exactly the same thing with regard to malaria - namely that enterprises do not have enough incentive to produce a vaccine against malaria, and therefore no vaccine will be produced unless we intervene and do something extraordinary."
"In addition to this, there is ICT."
"This is a development that is creating great economic growth in the industrialised countries, but which also risks further marginalisation of the developing countries due to lack of access both to the knowledge created by virtue of this development and to the technology as such."
"The opportunities that this technology can provide, as well as the risk of further marginalisation, form the background to this initiative report."
"The main viewpoint - the sustaining argument of the report - is that ICT provides an opportunity for the developing countries to make a quantum leap."
"In the report, I mention a number of sectors in which ICT can be used advantageously and in which other organisations such as the UNDP and the World Bank and some of the Member States have already had good experience."
"I believe that Parliament here is in line with the Council which, back in 1997 asked the Commission to draw up a report on experience with ICT in development work and, in November 2000, called upon the Commission to submit a communication on 'the digital divide' ."
"The report on experience arrived here this spring, and the communication will hopefully arrive before the meeting of the Development Council in November 2001."
"The Commission believes that the ICT work must take place through mainstreaming, that is, through ICT being used in the individual projects."
"This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition."
"If this development is not just to help those who are already strong, it is essential that mainstreaming be supplemented with central work so that there is a place from which initiatives can emanate, from which good advice can be obtained and where experience can be gathered, so that one does not have to start from scratch all the time and, above all, so that the right social balance in the development can be secured."
"Consequently, in an earlier report - namely the Gemelli report - in March of this year, the European Parliament also asked the Commission to give this area greater priority, possibly as part of the transport priority."
"The Commission has stood by its previous approach, but I cannot emphasise enough that this is not sufficient."
"This report therefore contains a proposal for an e-development unit."
"Without such a unit, it will be impossible to ensure that there is knowledge to ensure that ICT is incorporated in the right way into the work of the Commission."
"However, it is of course not only ICT that must be used in the context of the aid we provide."
"There is also a need for private enterprises."
"The shining example from other areas is the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which started micro loans for women - in the first instance in the agricultural sector, but later expanding to encompass other areas as well."
"A similar commitment within ICT is imperative."
"There are some that are in progress and more should be given further impetus."
"It would be nice to see a global social commitment on the part of enterprises, and this can easily be combined with general earnings. Finally, Mr President: ICT is always emphasised as the technology that can liberate people."
"It would be nice to be able to see that that also applies to people in the developing countries."
"In view of our experiences with the oil and pharmaceuticals industries, it would be good if enterprises could become a shining example into the bargain."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on this magnificent report on an issue which I truly believe to be of extraordinary importance. We have made many statements in this Parliament and have adopted many measures in favour of the least-developed countries, aware of the importance of removing the barriers separating the rich countries from the poor countries, but, as the rapporteur has reminded us, these barriers, rather than being reduced, are actually increasing."
"If we bear in mind the great potential of the information technologies for the future development of our society, there is no doubt that this gap is going to increase."
"We will thereby prevent the developing countries from overcoming the poverty threshold within which they live, and from benefiting from the numerous possibilities which the information society offers, not only for economic development, but also in the fields of health, training and many others."
"Let us not forget that, according to current estimates, at the end of 2000 there were 700 million people 'on-line' in the world while, on the other hand, 2 billion people had never spoken on the telephone."
"Hence the need to ensure that developing countries have access to the information society and benefit from those future projects which it represents."
"That is why this report is so important and above all why it is so important that the European Union adopts a vigorous initiative so that developing countries may really be included in the wealth society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe goes online."
"E-europe, e-learning, e-commerce, e-business are on everyone's lips, and are increasingly setting the political agenda."
"But what about 'e-development' ?"
"There is no doubt that the targeted use of modern electronic information and communication technologies can open up completely new perspectives for developing countries in particular."
"Of course, it would be wrong to raise false hopes by presenting ICT as a panacea."
"However, there is no disputing that in many countries of the Southern hemisphere, there is the potential - and the will - to bridge the digital divide."
"The developing countries themselves have an urgent interest in doing so, and I can only say that the response to my general report on this issue in the ACP/EU Assembly was extremely positive."
"The task is to put the developing countries on the net as they move towards the knowledge and information society."
"This requires a targeted strategy."
"Our question is this: where is the European Dot-Force - similar to the agreement adopted at the G8 Summit - to promote the developing countries' access to global communications?"
"The European Commission gives its admittedly rather tentative support to one or two projects, but this cannot obscure the fact that there is still no targeted strategy to support the developing countries moving towards the knowledge and information society."
