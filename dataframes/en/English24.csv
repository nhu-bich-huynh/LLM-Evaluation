"At any rate, that is what the Presidency seems to think."
"It goes without saying that Parliament' s support in this matter will, we are sure, enable us to proceed in the right direction."
"Finally, on the subject of the attack on a train in Angola, there is not much that I can add."
"Much of what has been said we can all agree on anyway."
"Like you, the Commission is very concerned about the continuation of this war, and deplores the fact that these confrontations are intensifying and that, yet again, several hundred civilians have been killed in various regions of the country over the last few weeks."
"We are absolutely determined to support the efforts being taken, in accordance with the Union' s common position, to find a political solution to the conflict in Angola."
"I did not get the impression, from your speeches, that you are seriously critical of that common position."
"We are therefore working towards implementing it, by supporting any proposal which seeks to support the initiatives being made by the African Union - and there are some - or by African regional organisations such as the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view to developing the systems which have been set up on the initiative of African countries in order to prevent and resolve conflicts."
"I would remind you that we are continuing our humanitarian aid to Angola, which is substantial, and that we are consequently ready to adjust the nature and the scale of that humanitarian aid."
"Mr President, I was not present at the debate because I was attending the Conference of Presidents, but someone came to tell me that a member of my group, Mr Miranda, was literally the subject of verbal aggression on the part of another Member."
"I regard such methods as inadmissible."
"It was more than a personal accusation, and that is why, Mr President, I should like you to allow Mr Miranda to take the floor, and to ensure that his restatement is included in the minutes."
"Mr Wurtz, you were not present."
"First of all, it was Mr Miranda who attacked the other Member and I allowed the other Member to speak briefly in order to reply."
"That is the end of the matter because if Mr Miranda says something else and Mr Ribeiro e Castro says something else, we may very well be here all day."
"Both gentlemen had the chance to speak on the same subject and the final score is therefore 1 all!"
"Exactly, Mr President, this is a point of order."
"I think that you must have not been paying attention, Mr President, when you said, just now, that I was the first to attack Mr Ribeiro e Castro."
"This is not true."
"In his own speech, which preceded mine, Mr Ribeiro e Castro referred to me in a completely unacceptable way and you said nothing about it, Mr President."
"As you will remember, he said that I have manipulated public opinion, that I have manipulated the press, that I have sought to use this Parliament, and he referred specifically to the fact that I am Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"What I said in my speech that gave Mr Ribeiro e Castro the pretext for answering in the way he did was simply that some friends of UNITA, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, had gone ahead with certain initiatives."
"Mr President, I did not mean any insult by this, because it is public knowledge and widely known that this party, to which Mr Ribeiro e Castro belongs, has clear, public and acknowledged links with UNITA."
"This was the precise tenor of what I said and nothing more!"
"That is why what was said..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I should like to say on a point of order that the President took absolutely the right line because Mr Ribeiro e Castro did not stand up for UNITA; on the contrary, he signed a motion criticising it."
"He criticised it in his speech and the President allowed him to respond to your personal attack."
"To my mind, therefore, the President took absolutely the right line."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Anti-personnel mines"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0542/2001 by Mr Van Orden and Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;"
"B5-0561/2001 by Mr van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;"
"B5-0568/2001 by Mr Haarder et al, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;"
"B5-0575/2001 by Mrs Maes and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;"
"B5-0590/2001 by Mr Segni, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group;"
". B5-0599/2001 by Mrs Bonino et al"
"on measures to promote an undertaking by non-governmental actors to ban anti-personnel mines."
"The problem of landmines is not only a problem for States."
"Long after peace has been concluded, and I hope that even in Angola that will one day be the case, there will still be fields that cannot be walked on, because they are full of mines and therefore put innocent people are at risk."
"In 1997, a treaty was concluded banning landmines."
"One hundred and forty-nine countries have already signed it."
"Many countries have ratified it, but 52 have not and they include some of the largest nations."
"One of the major problems is that not only regular armies lay the mines, but that terrorist and rebel movements also use them."
"That is why it is necessary that they should be urged to stop using landmines."
"It is difficult for an official body like ours to involve non-governmental players in the negotiations, but it is good that we as an official body should urge the countries not to stockpile landmines and that we should support the NGOs that are striving to get the terrorist organisations and rebel movements to forsake the use of landmines."
"I refer in this context to the appeal of Geneva, which we have heard proposed here this week in our own Parliament."
"Mr President, I think everyone is against anti-personnel mines."
"On this point, I should like to express my astonishment that this motion for a resolution is addressed to actors other than states."
"If the mines are produced and used, they are produced and used with the authorisation of states, and it would be up to those states to give an undertaking that mines will not be produced or used, and I do not even understand the title of such a resolution."
"As far as I am concerned, the only interpretation is that Parliament is thus pledging its allegiance to the great powers and the nation states."
"Mr President, I shall keep to the topic."
"Landmines kill, every day and in many countries."
"Landmines are a lethal threat daily in many dozens of countries."
"In Kampuchea alone, over 35 000 people have been injured by landmines and those are the survivors."
"Every day, mines are removed and every day new ones are laid."
"The anti-landmine treaty of 1997 has been ratified by 19 countries and signed by 141."
"Countries that have not yet signed include Russia, Yugoslavia, but also Finland, which uses mines to defend its border with Russia."
"That is, of course, cheaper and helps bring down the defence budget."
"We can understand that."
"If Finland can use that argument, however, why not other countries too?"
"I should therefore like to call on the Member States to force present and future members, as well as countries that receive financial aid from the European Union, to sign the treaty."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Van Orden, who is absent today but who for many years has been directly involved in the work of overcoming the scourge of anti-personnel landmines."
"Most EU Member States no longer have anti-personnel landmines in the operational armouries of their armed forces."
"These weapons have indeed been banned for the past four years."
"It is only irresponsible armed forces such as those in former Yugoslavia and armed groups of non-state actors engaged in civil war and insurgency that continue to use these dreadful weapons."
"By definition such groups are not party to the Ottawa Convention to ban landmines."
"This resolution draws attention to the fact and seeks to find ways in which these groups can be influenced."
"This requires very careful consideration as we must take great care that we do not imply any sort of recognition of the legitimacy of these groups or of their actions."
"We do not wish to distract EU resources from the priority task of mine clearance and assistance to mine victims."
"We wish to bring this matter to the attention of all the states party to the Ottawa Convention that will gather in Managua in Nicaragua later this month."
"Mr President, the European Parliament' s position against anti-personnel mines and in favour of their total ban has already been clearly expressed in various resolutions."
"The result of Ottawa is due to the work of certain specialised NGOs."
"I believe that at the next meeting of the contracting parties to the Convention which will take place in Managua, the European Union should contribute to ensuring that the Convention is signed and ratified by more countries."
"There are 52 which have not signed it and many who are still to ratify it."
"It should also contribute to ensuring that more resources are provided for the complete clearing of mines, since mines which are still buried are causing death and mutilation throughout the world, and the parties involved - State and non-State agents - should be forced to reach an agreement on a total ban of these mines."
"Mr President, I will end by asking for recognition and support for the work of NGOs such as the initiative launched by the humanitarian organisation 'Geneva Appeal' and others, which are going to contribute to the disappearance of such a lethal and odious weapon as anti-personnel mines."
"Mr President, what are we doing?"
"I think that is the question that is being asked and the question to which you are asking us to reply."
"Well, first of all we have equipped ourselves with a framework of rules for the Union, and just before the summer recess we adopted two regulations against mines, so that we now have legal instruments on the basis of which we shall be able to take effective and coordinated action."
"Then at the end of this month we shall be actively participating, together with the presidency, at the meeting in Nicaragua of signatory states to the Ottawa Convention, a meeting which we believe is extremely important, because we shall of course be discussing the challenges posed by the abolition of anti-personnel mines, sharing the practical experiences of those who have been involved in this action and, as most of you have asked us to do, putting pressure on those states which have not yet signed the Convention."
"In our view, the objective remains the same and we are determined to achieve it, by obtaining a universal prohibition on the production, stockpiling, movement and use of anti-personnel landmines."
"The achieving of this objective and the removal of the risk to which the millions of mines which still have to be removed from areas of conflict throughout the world expose not only human lives, but also economic activities, is chiefly the task of states and governments."
"There is no doubt about that. Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that non-government actors also use anti-personnel landmines in internal conflicts or conflicts between states, and they too bear a responsibility for the suffering and devastation caused to populations and societies by mines"
"Experience has shown, as you have pointed out, that we need to explore new ways of involving non-governmental agencies in these campaigns against landmines, and of making them subscribe to the objective of a complete ban on such devices."
"From this point of view, the Geneva appeal is an initiative with laudable intentions, but we must make sure that any future initiatives of this kind take place in the context of the considerable efforts which have already been undertaken by the international community."
"As Parliament knows, the international campaign to prohibit landmines has assumed the form of a worldwide movement which the European Union has supported since the beginning."
"This international campaign, in conjunction with a certain number of governmental and non-governmental agreements, has drawn up standards and action programmes which will supplement the international regulations of which the Ottawa Convention is an example."
"We would therefore like to see, alongside this international regulatory framework, initiatives being set up to strengthen the action that is being taken within states and civilian society, and we are ready to support them."
"We must analyse this Geneva appeal in detail, and encourage those who have instigated it to coordinate their activities closely with the ICBL and with other major agreements, so as to ensure that all the forces that are mobilised towards this objective never run the risk, given the magnitude of what is at stake here, of becoming dispersed."
"There is still a lot to be done to consolidate the ambitious demands and objectives that were defined by the Ottawa Convention."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Drought in Central America"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0547/2001 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;"
"B5-0562/2001 by Mrs Díez González et al, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;"
"B5-0569/2001 by Mr Sánchez García and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Group the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;"
"B5-0574/2001 by Mr Mayol i Raynal et al, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;"
"B5-0591/2001 by Mr Marset Campos et al, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;"
"B5-0600/2001 by Mr Queiró and Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group"
"on the drought in Central America."
"Mr President, I will not waste part of the one minute I am allowed to convince Members of the extremely grave consequences of the sequence of natural disasters which have taken place in Central America."
"However, I will use part of my speaking time to say that this has had short-term consequences."
"In brief: one and a half million people are suffering from hunger in the region, not to mention the long-term consequences for sustainable development and the climate."
"So far the European institutions have reacted by trying to alleviate the short-term consequences: with emergency aid and with deliveries of food, which have gone some way to alleviating the hunger in the region."
"So far we have been incapable of responding to the long-term needs or shortages."
"This resolution asks the Commission firstly to take account of these needs when drawing up the 2002 budget."
"Secondly, that it implement actions which will serve to accelerate and promote a sustainable development policy in the field of agricultural development, which will serve to prevent drought and the long-term consequences which I mentioned previously."
"Thirdly, I refer to section 4, relating to a policy of cooperation with the region in the long term, which would help to meet the needs which I stressed before."
"Mr President, the truth is that the region of Central America has been suffering for too long."
"First there were the death squads and the extreme right governments."
"Then, with democracy won thanks to the mediation of the European Union, there were corrupt governments; then there were the catastrophes of Hurricane Mitch, earthquakes and now this drought, which, as has been said, means hunger, misery and death for hundreds of thousands of people."
"The European Union must behave with a solidarity which distinguishes it from others, not only by approving budgets for this circumstance, but, as has been said, also for the coming years, by approving important and essential budgets which will eliminate the causes and consequences of this drought."
"I drafted the report on the reconstruction of Central America after Hurricane Mitch, and I have seen that the corruption in the area prevents aid from arriving directly."
"We therefore recommend that the aid which we grant arrives in the most direct way possible by means of local councils and democratic NGOs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, every day we see horrifying images of new tragedies which desolate the world: people devastated, children dying from hunger and disease, refugees without refuge, immigrants wandering the world looking for an opportunity to live..."
"There are tragedies, however, which persist while nobody talks about them, which get worse and fester although they do not make the headlines."
"One of those cases filed away in our selective first-world memory is the situation in Central America and the dramatic effects of the drought which has been devastating it for more than three months."
"This is a tragedy which is unfolding in a region, as has been said, which is already weakened by constant natural disasters, quite apart from political disasters, and which has a social and economic structure lacking the least resources for resisting them."
"El Salvador has declared a state of emergency and Guatemala just yesterday declared a state of public disaster, in a truly desperate attempt to combat hunger."
"The drought has destroyed the majority of the crops in the region and hunger is now affecting millions of people, as previous speakers have said."
"All of this in an area where an extremely high percentage of inhabitants live in poverty or extreme poverty."
"The United Nations world food programme raised the alarm very recently, telling us that if the current situation continues, it will only be able to meet the needs of half of the affected citizens for barely three months."
"I therefore draw your attention in particular to the recommendation contained in section 4 which, in relation to that in section 3, seeks to direct our decisions in the field of development aid towards the objective of combating the structural problems."
"Only in that way, by investing in sustainable development in the most sensitive areas of the world, will we be able to prevent and alleviate as far as possible the effects of natural disasters, because we will have invested our aid and our resources in the structuring and strengthening of the population and we will have made them stronger so that they can endure the consequences of phenomena which not even we, in the first world, can prevent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Europe to be able to give out fishing rods, to show people how to fish, rather than to hand out fish."
"Mr President, I agree with what other Members have said."
"In any event, we in the European Parliament delegation for relations with the countries of Central America were in El Salvador in July and were able to see the consequences of the earthquakes and of Hurricane Mitch."
"In fact there is a very important European Union programme for the rehabilitation of institutes in that area; at the moment, however, the worst thing of all, which we were informed of in July, is what is happening as a result of the drought."
"I believe that we must envisage two types of aid: immediate aid, to prevent starvation, and a more long-term aid, in order to work towards sustainable development; because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes that earthquakes, floods and droughts are going to become increasingly common, and in precisely the poorest parts of the world, which are least able to endure them."
"Therefore, I believe that the European Union must use two approaches: immediate aid, which they requested of us when we were there in July, and more long-term aid, in order to prevent what is happening now from happening again."
"We are also concerned about the distribution of aid."
"It must be very well controlled by the services of the European Commission that are on the ground, so that it may reach the people genuinely affected."
"Some complaints have been made about this."
"The Commission is of course well aware of the situation described in this resolution."
"The current drought in these countries is certainly the worst since the one caused by El Niño in 1997."
"For the moment, however, we believe it is going too far to compare the situation with the one that followed Hurricane Mitch."
"There is constant contact between the Commission and the representatives of the countries of Central America, and we believe, along with the representatives of those countries with whom we are working, that the situation is certainly extremely worrying, but that at this stage it is under control, and is unlikely to continue for very long because the rains will soon be returning to most of the areas affected by the drought."
"Although the rains are due to return shortly, that should not prevent us from thinking about the real causes of these crises which, as you have all, I believe, pointed out, are due to cyclical factors but also, and above all, to structural factors, including the falling incomes from primary products, especially coffee, the probably inappropriate nature of agricultural policies, and increasingly difficult access for many rural families to production inputs, not to mention the poverty which is undoubtedly rife in all these countries."
"With regard to monitoring, I should just like to say that the Commission and the Union now have a network of antennae which enables us to monitor the food situation in all the regions that are susceptible."
"One of these antennae is located in Central America and will enable us to be alerted instantly so that we can intervene if necessary."
"The heart of the problem, that is, the structural causes of the lack of food security in the region, is the real problem that we will have to face in the medium and long term, as some of you have pointed out."
"One of the most important solutions, as we see it, is rural development, and this is already a priority in the Union' s action and cooperation in most of the countries concerned, and we would like to see it strengthened even more by the pooling of efforts, whether that means aid to local governments to enable them to concentrate their development policy in that area, something that we can actually do, or whether it means support for the projects of non-governmental organisations or local communities seeking to diversify production and crop distribution and to create family incomes of another kind, or whether it means coordination with other international donors, like Member States, or the Bretton Woods institutions, or, finally, whether it means putting in place programmes to reduce poverty in the countries concerned."
"Like you, we are convinced that we shall have to cope with short-term emergencies, but that the problem is a deep-seated one and is one of the fundamental causes that will have to be tackled if we wish to avoid a repetition of the same problem."
"Mr President, in the Spanish version of the resolution on the Afghan refugees off the coast of Australia there is an error, and I am pointing it out so that Parliament' s services may correct it."
"In Recital E there is a line missing, since it says 'allow asylum seekers to request asylum once' and it should then say 'they have arrived in Australian territory' ."
"This text simply needs to be modified in accordance with the other versions - I have seen the English, the French and the German."
"I point this out so that Parliament' s services may correct it."
"Mr Medina Ortega, I trust you implicitly here because I know that you are extraordinarily well versed in the other languages."
"I am sure this will be corrected."
"I have already been assured from my right that this will be added in the Spanish version."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Mountain farming"
"The next item is the report (A5-0277/2001) by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming has arrived on the European Parliament's agenda in the run up to the International Year of Mountains in 2002."
"Activities have therefore been planned over the coming year at international, national and local level to promote the sustainable development of mountain regions."
"The main objectives of the International Year of Mountains are to create awareness and increase knowledge about mountain ecosystems and their dynamics and operation, to promote and maintain the cultural heritage of mountain communities and the maintenance and sustainable development of resources in mountain regions to safeguard the quality of life of the population now and in the future."
"Finally, mountain regions account for about 30% of the land area and 20% of the utilised agricultural area in the European Union and 10% of the population of the EU live there."
"I feel that the European Union should also use the coming International Year of Mountains as an opportunity to express the specific concerns of mountain regions and recognise mountain regions as indispensable habitats."
"At the same time, the quality of life in mountain regions must be maintained and protected and the constant threat of exodus must be stopped."
"This report is also, by definition, the European Parliament's position on the International Year of Mountains and should be seen by the Commission and the Council as our basic wish list."
"Basically I call in this report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a comprehensive EU strategy for mountain regions."
"The report contains numerous new and, to my mind, practical proposals which I call on you to support during the coming vote."
"The Commission is thus called on, first, to submit a communication this year setting out EU actions in connection with the International Year of Mountains."
"I think this communication should contain a comprehensive concept for the regions in question with regard to the period after 2006 and with regard to enlargement."
"This will, of necessity, include revising Directive 268/75 and subsequent amendments."
"At the same time, I should like to clarify that the overall concept needed must take account of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Despite what are often similar problems and difficulties, it is a fact that even mountain regions differ in their individual characteristics, meaning that there is no universal patent solution."
"Common problems can be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach."
"My report therefore advocates an approach which takes equal account of the following areas: farming and forestry, transport, tourism, energy and water, regional planning, nature conservation and the maintenance of the common cultural heritage."
"Now a few words on individual demands set out in the report."
"Agriculture: basically it calls for the second pillar of agricultural policy, the development of rural areas, to be extended, taking appropriate account of the contribution made by farming to the environment and the countryside and the multifunctional character of agriculture."
"We need to find common problem-solving strategies in the form of regional conventions, set and update criteria and data on mountain areas and fund practical, mountain-related projects under the sixth framework programme, extend the basic infrastructure needed and provide training and further training so that the population keeps abreast of events and strengthen transport networks in mountain regions, taking account of the principle of sustainability, in order to safeguard these regions as habitats and economic areas and nature areas."
"This means, for example, that access roads to farms and alpine pastures must be guaranteed, while bigger roads must comply with criteria of strict eco-compatibility."
"Finally, last but not least, mountain regions need special treatment in the run up to enlargement."
"The forthcoming International Year of Mountains is an ideal time, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the specifics of tomorrow's proposal."
"You, ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of my report, and more importantly you, Commissioner, and the Commission, by implementing the ideas contained in it can make a fundamental contribution to this development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by thanking Mr Ebner for his own initiative report."
"This is a report which I can wholeheartedly support."
"Given that, as Mr Ebner has just said, mountain regions account for around 30% of the land area in the EU, while in many Member States, such as Austria, they account for as much as 50%, I welcome and support this own initiative report."
"The importance of mountain ecosystems is a cultural heritage."
"The maintenance and sustainable management of resources is very important in numerous regions of Europe."
"The protection of mountain regions, forests, water, the ecological balance and biodiversity needs to be set out in an overall European concept."
"Many mountains straddle frontiers."
"Many problems can only be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach and by joining forces."
"I must stress that farming and forestry have a multifunctional role in mountain regions and that this will be hugely important in an enlarged Union."
"Both the people who live in the mountains and the tourists who visit every year looking for rest and relaxation value this unique natural and cultural landscape, which is why we must create appropriate incentives for people to live and work there."
"We must take precautions to prevent the ecological and socio-economic consequences of exodus and depopulation."
"Sustainable cultivation by mountain farmers not only provides quality food, it also renders a huge service to mankind as a whole."
"The United Nations have rightly proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of Mountains."
"I think it is important for Europe to take a stance now and for the Commission to present a communication as quickly as possible, setting out a really clear definition, taking account of criteria such as altitude, gradient and the vegetation which has been cut down so that we can really address the various problems throughout Europe, and proposing appropriate concepts for strategies and development mechanisms."
"Mr President, the Ebner report is going to offer the Commission a very good model to follow when producing its communication for the International Year of Mountains 2002."
"However, amongst its many and, I believe, very valuable, proposals, I would like to draw your attention to certain issues which, on this forthcoming celebration of the silver wedding of mountain farming, should receive very special, and in some cases new, attention."
"I am referring, firstly, to the role which should be recognised for women in this new multifunctional mountain farming."
"For them, a new approach is required today which is very different from their obsolete marginalisation within the traditional CAP."
"This proposal appears in section 19 of the Ebner report, but if we want to do it well, Mr Fischler, coordinated approach is required."
"Within the new agriculture of the mountain regions, women currently play many important roles, both in relation to agriculture and in relation to tourism, rural development, rural tourism, new technologies and in relation to craft-industry, commercial and economic policies."
"I hope you understand, Commissioner, that their potential could be enormous."
"Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the proposal contained in section 22, which also relates to another of today' s pressing problems, that of migration policies."
"It is proposed that mountain regions where population is decreasing could serve as reception areas for absorbing immigrants, given suitable socio-economic planning."
"Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that compensation measures should be taken to prevent mountain regions receiving less structural aid than they receive at the moment as a result of enlargement."
"This must be prevented, because enlargement must not under any circumstances have a negative impact on these areas."
"Lastly, I think that small and medium-sized farms should be promoted by means of a modulation of aid that stimulates employment."
"Commissioner, I hope that if you really want to provide new impetus and a new strategy for mountain farming, you will take these proposals into account."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mr Ebner very much for the work he has done and also for accepting my amendments to the text."
"The report speaks for itself: it is complete and exhaustive and also has the merit of setting mountain farming in a wider and more general context of mountain problems."
"I think this approach is the right one for achieving a genuine European policy in 2002: International Year of Mountains."
"You see, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 does mention mountain farming, but everything gets more complicated at the implementation stage, for instance when Italian regions give notification of intervention laws for mountain areas, for example on animal husbandry or indeed on natural disasters which have already occurred."
"Well, your 'Agriculture' Directorate is turning into a worthy and legitimate control body. It is beginning a long correspondence made up of requests for minute details."
"It will take at least six months or even more for definite replies to come in, frequently stamped on the closing date, sometimes using the competition rules which always seem to deny the particular characteristics of mountain agriculture."
"Sooner or later, especially in the Alpine areas of the Union - lucky Switzerland takes care of its mountains without this network of controls - this could lead to an anti-European backlash."
"That is why we ask you, Commissioner, to publicise the principles of this report on agriculture and remember, not just occasionally, that the Union has signed the Agriculture Protocol of the Alpine Convention."
"Mr President, Mr Ebner, well done!"
"A good report."
"Like under a burning glass, mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location."
"Your report also has a drawback, however."
"It only focuses on this aspect."
"It is interesting that the House, or rather those still in it - although they do, after all, represent the majorities - can reach a majority understanding on these numerous excellent proposals and warnings."
"It is true of agriculture as a whole that we should have fostered sustainable management in general, but then there would have been no agreement here, so that this acts as an alibi and that is a pity."
"However, that should not detract from the usefulness of this report and we shall, of course, vote in favour of it."
"We should like, however, to widen this debate to agriculture as a whole in order to achieve sustainable land management tailored to each particular location."
"Mr President, apart from what is now the standard generalised wish list in the report, the fact that the new regulation will operate within the framework of Agenda 2000 leaves no room for any hope that the present frightful situation will improve or that the survival of farmers, most of whom run small or medium-sized holdings, will be assured."
"As we know, the trend is towards greater liberalisation of agricultural production and the concentration of land and production in the hands of fewer and fewer people, with the result that mountain regions are sinking faster and faster into economic and social stagnation."
"All that the proposal to offset the reduction in Community support for these regions by applying national and regional measures means in practice is that the European Union will completely abandon mountain regions and will attempt to shift even the miserable and ineffective support of the last 25 years on to its Member States."
"This shift will have a massively adverse impact on countries such as Greece, which have a high proportion of mountain regions and a small budget, with the result that it will be impossible to support these regions from national funds."
"In addition, this sort of proposal recommends nationalising the financing for policies formulated by the European Union, meaning that the poorest countries will be forced to apply anti-farming Community policy without any compensation or support measures and pay for it out of their own pockets."
"Furthermore, the proposal to reject the removal of the milk quota system in mountain regions on the grounds of reduced competitiveness and high production costs is proof of the total lack of any social criteria and the annoying hypocrisy of the European Union's environmentally-friendly pronouncements, given that the same restrictive measures are being applied to mountain and industrial livestock farming, while we all know the differences between them as regards both the environment and public health."
"What with grim neo-liberal criteria and the profit and competition argument, mountain regions are condemned to stagnation and abandonment."
"It is for these reasons that we shall be voting against the report, because we believe that the specific measures proposed, operating within the more general framework of Agenda 2000 and the so-called competitiveness argument will not only reverse, they will speed up the economic stagnation and desertification of mountain regions, with huge economic, social and environmental consequences."
"Commissioner, without waiting for 2002 and its International Year of Mountains, we twenty Members who are still here all agree that we should protect hill and mountain farming, which is said to represent 20% of our land."
"I myself come from a region where there are mountains and where transhumance is practised, in our case with flocks of sheep."
"It really is an ideal form of farming, especially for the European Commission."
"You have the countryside, forests, biodiversity and the environment, you are preventing soil erosion and producing high-quality products, honey, meat and fruit, you have the tourist industry, and you put the accent on quality of life."
"Above all, you are not practising productivism, you are not farming intensively, you are not annoying the United States in the world markets in wheat, oilseeds and animal proteins."
"Basically, hill and mountain farming is multi-functionalism without the quantities."
"It is the Austrian model that the 2006 reform of the CAP intends to generalise throughout Europe, including the lowland areas."
"It conjures up a picture of rosy-cheeked milkmaids, accompanied, of course, by Commissioner Fischler, frolicking among haystacks, cow-bells, marmots and alpine pastures, and stroking rare-breed cows, while Mr Bush' s Texans have a monopoly in the meat market."
"So let us say yes to hill and mountain farming, in the hills and mountains, but no to a European farming industry reduced by WTO negotiations to a series of theme parks with peasants dressed up by Mike Moore to look like Walt Disney characters, whose job would be to entertain Anglo-Saxon tourists and conserve the landscape."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Ebner for a very comprehensive and stimulating report."
"We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter, more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect."
"We have to consider too that we will have a conflict."
"Firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement, which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the European Union, while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this House would subscribe to."
"In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars, two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances."
"All the utilities are over-utilised while in other areas we are closing down public services."
"Roads are under-utilised, we are withdrawing police stations and closing down little churches and schools."
"We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made."
"We should not abandon vast areas of our countries, where human activity will fade away."
"These mountains will not be attractive if there are no villages, if there are no variable scenes of farms and livestock and people living there."
"They will not provide the tourist amenities we need in the future."
"If we allow this to happen, it will be like what we did in my country 50 years ago when we closed down our railways."
"We will regret it in 40 or 50 years from now."
"If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it."
"We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed."
"I was in Scotland during the summer and I have seen the extent to which the Highlands have been denuded of their population."
"Britain is much the poorer for that."
"If we allow this to happen elsewhere we will have a Europe that will be much poorer."
"We should return to this subject later and make firm proposals for the budgetary resources that we, as a Union, could use towards this end."
"Mr President, the figures some Members have quoted amply demonstrate that the mountains are the minority of minorities in this House."
"We represent only a little over 5% of the inhabitants of Europe, of European citizens, but, as documented in the annals of the European Parliament over fifty years of the European Union, this is only the third time that the word 'mountain' and a motion for a resolution about mountains have been heard in this Chamber."
"The first time was in 1983. The rapporteur then was Mr Colleselli, from Cadore, in the North of Italy."
"The second time, fifteen years later, I myself had the honour and the duty of bringing the problems of the mountains to this House, with my report on a new strategy for mountain regions, approved on 23 October 1998."
"My report started from an overall view of the problems of mountain regions, in all their complexity, and concluded that mountain farming was and remains the key."
"The Ebner report - and I congratulate the rapporteur on the specific detail he has been able to put into it - takes this aspect further and opens up another horizon."
"I can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself."
"However, we are all aware, once again, that farming cannot do it alone."
"That is why there are also proposals in Mr Ebner' s report which involve the whole mountain world: transport, infrastructure, tourism, the eco-system."
"There is another factor we must protect and safeguard; the vital factor for the mountains, Commissioner, is and remains man."
"The average age of farmers in Europe - as you know -is about 50. Some mountain farmers are over 60."
"That is a dire statistic for the future of the mountains."
"We must make mountain farming attractive again, give the farmers confidence, and give them resources."
"Above all we must have the courage to recognise, Commissioner, that a specific type of farming called mountain farming exists."
"Let us do so with conviction so that the mountains themselves can continue to exist!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission has always seen hill and mountain farming as a very important and highly interesting subject."
"I should like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, more importantly, the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, for this own initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming."
"Starting with the 1998 Santini report on a new strategy for hill and mountain farming and with the International Year of Mountains coming up next year, the Ebner report highlights the importance of mountain regions to the European Union."
"In particular, it stresses the importance of environmental protection and the need to maintain natural beauty spots, produce quality products and urgently maintain the cultural heritage."
"It also points out that the viability of the countryside in mountain regions goes far beyond agriculture and depends on a multitude of factors."
"It is clear from this starting premise that the same questions preoccupy us."
"Multifunctionality is also the cornerstone of our new rural development policy."
"It aims to promote farming in which all functions and services are recognised, every function which farmers offer our society."
"This is an integral part of the European farming model and I can assure you, in response to a number of concerns expressed in the report, that the Commission will stand squarely behind the need to take account of this aspect during trade negotiations at the World Trade Association."
"With enlargement impending, the report calls on the Commission to create a global strategy for mountain regions and hill and mountain farming both in the Member States and in the candidate countries."
"On this point, I must say, the Commission approach differs from the approach taken in the report."
"May I remind you that the new rural development policy only started up last year."
"We placed subsidiarity right at the forefront of this new policy, so that the Member States could set their own priorities and include what they consider are the most suitable measures for making the best of their regions and dealing with local drawbacks or difficulties in their rural development plans or Structural Fund planning documents."
"This decentralised approach, which also applies to the SAPARD programmes, means that the rural development programme can be properly tailored to mountain regions and can accommodate the differences between them. For example, the Pyrenees need different concepts from the Alps."
"This fosters sustainable development which takes account both of socio-economic problems and the environmental challenges facing each of these regions."
"Instead of laying down central guidelines, as was recently the case, we should be discussing how best to implement the mountain region policy in detail not just with all the Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities but also with our economic and social partners, non-governmental organisations and scientific circles."
"I should like to point out, à propos, that the Commission accepted the second report on economic and social cohesion on 31 January this year. This report raises the question of setting priorities for the balanced and sustained development of the regions in an enlarged Union and the question of covering increased cohesion requirements, to mention just two, and calls for discussion on the subject."
"This report offers numerous opportunities to develop regions lagging behind."
"The main aim of the Commission's contribution to the International Year of Mountains, therefore, is to advertise our current development mechanisms more widely."
"The Commission will organise a seminar in the second half of the year at Commissioner Barnier's and my initiative, the purpose of which will be to present and advertise the opportunities which Community policy offers mountain regions."
"You and any other interested parties are also invited to attend."
"To come back to the report, I should like to emphasise that it is already possible as the law now stands to provide targeted support for hill and mountain farming through compensatory payments, which form and shall continue to form our basic support for mountain regions, and through environmental measures, through aid for forestry, through processing aid and marketing aid or through diversification aid, for example in the tourism sector."
"I should also like to remind you, Mrs Rojo, that the instructions for drawing up rural development programmes state that express reference must be made to programmes specifically for women and that each of the rural development programmes must contain a chapter describing specific help for women."
"The same rules apply to rural development and the common organisations of the market."
"These too take account of the specific nature of extensive farming, especially in mountain regions, either through specific, customised measures such as beef extensification premiums or premiums for sheepmeat or goatmeat production or by giving the Member States additional room to manoeuvre by allowing them to give special support to regions of their choice."
"The Commission will address special treatment for farmers in mountain regions in relation to milk quotas, as proposed in the report, as part of its midterm review."
"Finally, we should not forget, with reference to the Structural Funds, that 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2."
"These mountain regions can all apply under current support rules and the Member States can tailor the measures needed to individual demands, be it in relation to transport or telecommunications networks, basic public services or support for economic activities."
"In principle, this can be complemented by national aid, as Mr Caveri mentioned."
"Here too, however, the golden rule is that we continue to require notification a) because this gives regions the security of knowing that their measures will be seen to be compatible with EU law and b) because we must not allow unfair competition between individual regions."
"I cannot address all the suggestions in the report, but I hope that the seminar organised by the Commission to coincide with the International Year of Mountains will give plenty of opportunity to come back to these suggestions."
"In the meantime, the Commission will exercise its powers and right of initiative in order to examine the conclusions of the report in greater detail and continue the dialogue started today."
"I am positive that this will allow us to successfully raise the profile of mountain regions and highlight their importance to Europe."
"Thank you very much Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed"
"The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m."
"Basic education in developing countries"
"The next item is the report (A5­0278/2001) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on basic education in developing countries in the context of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in September 2001 [2001/2030(INI)]."
"Mr President, as you suggested, this report is meant to focus on the real opportunity that the UN Special Conference on Children and Children's Rights which takes place later this month gives this Parliament to focus on a fundamental way in which we can tackle global poverty."
"It is an opportunity for us not only to give a profile to this subject but also to call for action."
"Let me set out what the targets are: free and compulsory education for all, halving adult illiteracy by 2015, eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided."
"We are quite tired of hearing about development targets."
"They are set and they are endless."
"We know the 'whys' for all these development concerns."
"What we from the Committee on Development and Cooperation are asking is 'how' we are going to deliver on these targets."
"The subject is at the heart of the global strategy that we, in our committee, discuss on poverty."
"The EU clearly has a key and central role to play here."
"Clear commitments were made at Dakar in Senegal last year."
"But neither from the EU nor anyone else really are we getting practical strategies."
"I was a teacher myself for 30 years, mostly in primary education so I think I am quite justified in having a passion about looking at the reasons for this crisis."
"One in six of the world's population are functionally illiterate."
"One hundred and thirty million - one in five - of the total number of children are not in any kind of primary education."
"One terrible statistic is that two-thirds of those are little girls."
"Their learning situation is terrible."
"Many of will have seen children trying to learn sitting under a tree with not even a blackboard to assist the teacher."
"When we talk about information technology we are often talking about children who have never even held a pencil in their hand, never mind being likely to sit at the keyboard of a computer."
"In these schools too the quality of their education is often affected by the fact that they are not taught in their own language."
"There is a clear link between illiteracy and income poverty."
"Average incomes in a country mirror very clearly the levels of access to education."
"There is a clear link between child mortality rates and the level of parental education."
"A 10% increase in girls' enrolment in primary school would bring a substantial improvement in infant and maternal mortality rates."
"And yet we see aid from developed countries to basic education being slashed from budgets across the globe."
"It is only 1% of the total."
"Developing countries themselves take insufficient interest in the importance of education."
"The sub-continent of India spends less than 1% of GDP on education."
"As far as the EU is concerned, I hope the Commissioner will agree that this is not enough."
"I hope you are not going to state in your presentation that all of this will be incorporated into existing procedures."
"We need an answer from the Commissioner on how we intend to implement the goals."
"I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indicative programmes for Cotonou and about our involvement in the steering committee working on education in Africa."
"I also know that there is a promise of a communication on basic education from the Commission during the Belgian Presidency."
"I would like to know when we might expect to see that."
"Let me just touch on one or two issues."
"Priority for girls obviously, and I suspect that Mrs Junker will speak about that. Last in, first out; that is what happens to girls."
"Girls have a low status and therefore there is no priority for getting them into school."
"I would like to see a lot more training in ministries in developing countries and concrete programmes to ensure that we get girls into school."
"The impact of HIV is enormous."
"There are millions of AIDS orphans in the developing world and in a country like Zambia there are more teachers infected annually with HIV than they are able to train to put in their schools."
"These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss."
"Meeting the targets looks difficult."
"Is there sufficient political commitment in current circumstances to ensure that we will get all the girls into school by 2005?"
"The reality is, and I hope that people will admit this very clearly at the UN Conference the week after next, that as things are going all of these targets are unachievable."
"Meeting the target of universal primary education looks extremely difficult."
"I would like to know from the Commission how its work in trying to achieve these targets includes NGOs and civil society and all those people who are involved in the Global Education Campaign."
"It is a very successful, active and dynamic campaign."
"I would hope that the European Commission is very much engaged with them but I suspect that is not the case."
"According to the Global Education Campaign, the targets on education would require USD 8 billion a year."
"This is the equivalent of four days of global military spending and 9 minutes of international currency speculation."
"Therefore it seems to me that if the commitment was there, we could deliver."
"It is a price worth paying."
"The current inequities that I have described are untenable and certainly indefensible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is fair that I begin my speech on behalf of the PPE Group by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on her excellent report and on the passion with which she is defending it."
"I believe that the proposals in this report, together with the resolution which we approved at the last part-session in July, represent the best contribution this Parliament could have made to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, because there is no question, unfortunately, that education is still the great unresolved issue within development cooperation, despite the formal declarations and the commitments given at the various international conferences which have addressed this issue."
"The figures on the millions of children not attending school, which Mrs Kinnock pointed out, speak for themselves in this respect."
"While it is a grave situation that so many children are being deprived of their fundamental right to education, it is even more grave that, as a result of the violation of this right, millions of people are immersed in poverty and under-development."
"Because the key to prosperity and progress, especially in the context of the information and communication society which we live in today, lies in the level of education the people have access to."
"The conviction that, by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries, we will not only fail to eradicate poverty, but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase, has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty."
"In this respect, we have to recognise that the Dakar Conference on education for all represented a great step forward, but it is a step which will take us nowhere if action is not taken and if, in accordance with the decisions at Dakar, we do not quickly adopt a concrete world initiative directed towards creating strategies and mobilising the resources required to provide effective support for the efforts made on a national level - as one of the Dakar commitments states."
"The European Union, as the main donor and insofar as it has made solidarity and the defence of human rights an essential dimension of its international action, has the responsibility to promote these strategies in close coordination with the other donors, including the Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the participation of civil society and, with them, policies aimed at overcoming the obstacles which deny children access to a quality education."
"And the European Union has the moral and political obligation to provide the financial resources necessary to achieve free education for all between now and 2015."
"All of this can be done in accordance with the excellent proposals contained in the Kinnock report, which reflect both the practically unanimous feelings of the Committee on Development and the feelings of my group."
"However, achieving this objective will also require us to urgently either cancel or restructure the debts of the developing countries in exchange for the funds made available as a result being directed to education programmes."
"It will require making the developing countries themselves responsible and encouraging them, through persuasive measures if necessary, to fulfil the commitments given in Dakar and to give absolute priority to education."
"Above all, it will require an increase in financial contributions and the allocation of at least 8% of official aid to development and to basic education, in line with the views of the people promoting the campaign for education for all."
"Only through resources which match the challenge we have to face will it be possible to win the battle against illiteracy in the world."
"I will end by saying that only in this way will it be possible for millions of children to exercise their fundamental right to education, an education which will allow them to open the doors to progress and one day become free men and women."
"Mr President, the report by Mrs Kinnock is one of those which the Socialist Group has followed with the greatest interest and affection."
"The text gives figures which are often so scandalous that they should provide little comfort for our consciences, because, at the end of the day, they demonstrate the incoherence of almost all of us who believe that the education of children is important for the success of any development process."
"There are plenty of declarations recognising that child education in the under-developed world is one of the main conditions if those countries are to be able to begin to free themselves from the situation of justice and backwardness they are in."
"Mrs Kinnock' s report mentions the numerous commitments made in this regard by the international community on different occasions. The latest was the world conference on education, which took place in Dakar last year."
"The report, however, is also a compendium and a condemnation of incoherences and irresponsibilities."
"Incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the developed countries which, despite their promises, have not only failed to increase their programmes in favour of education and care for children in the developing world, but in fact have reduced their efforts in that area."
"And incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the countries of the South which, apart from very few exceptions, are still neglecting the education of their youngest citizens in the face of other priorities such as military expenditure which, in the majority of cases, is still above what is invested in education."
"The resolution which we are voting on should not remain, like so many others, as a worthless piece of paper."
"This call for coherence and responsibility is a genuine demonstration that our Parliament should promote this issue as a European Union objective."
"Furthermore, however, this report should serve as a reference for the action of the Union and many European States, members or candidates for accession, at the United Nations General Assembly which will take place in New York in a few days time."
"Glenys Kinnock will be there and will speak out clearly, in the knowledge that we all support her and with the strength which the support deriving from our approving her proposals will give her."
"Documents such as this are the best way to respond with specific proposals to a form of globalisation which, since it is mainly focused on the market, is creating inequalities, poverty and exclusion on a world scale and is therefore becoming repellent to many people throughout the world."
"I will end by offering our thanks and congratulations to Mrs Kinnock on her work."
"It will be important to implement what is expressed here, but we must start by broadly distributing the report."
"This will convince and guide many people and will increase the credibility of the European Parliament amongst the citizens of Europe."
"It will also contribute to some people outside our territory recovering their confidence in us as well as their own sense of hope."
"What does the practice of education in the developing countries teach us?"
"Above all, that good primary education is still far from being granted the priority status that it deserves."
"Good, free education is essential for development."
"Nine hundred million people are still illiterate."
"The Dakar objectives are in danger of not being achieved by a long chalk."
"For this reason, new impetus is necessary at the highest political level, particularly from Europe, America and Japan."
"There is an urgent need for a strategically developed initiative with a realistic timescale and more financial resources."
"Indicative programmes must be drawn up for each country."
"Up to now, the European Union has paid far too little attention to education."
"The argument that other donors are already doing sufficient is simply and demonstrably untrue."
"The cause for the shortfall in educational facilities lies not only with the donors."
"Many developing countries themselves give it far too low a priority."
"It is outrageous that in Africa twice as much money should be spent on military equipment as on education."
"If India continues to spend less than 1% of its GDP on school facilities, of course, development will never come off the ground."
"The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent."
"Certainly, special attention will have to be paid to girls, early school-leavers, and also former child soldiers."
"The basic rights of children will only be respected if adults draw the right political lessons from failing educational practice."
"Mr President, we have, of course, far too little time to discuss Mrs Kinnock' s excellent report properly."
"I share her scepticism about the great conferences where people in expensive suits and large expense accounts meet to talk about priorities that they afterwards immediately forget, while the education budgets of the poorest countries are falling and the number of children condemned to illiteracy continues to rise."
"I really have the impression that a number of countries are acting like some governments in the nineteenth century: keep them poor and keep them stupid, then they will be less trouble."
"That is, in fact, the strategic reason I can identify behind the manifest neglect of primary education."
"That primary education has also had far too low a priority in our own budgets for development cooperation."
"Fortunately, fellow MEPs have already said much that is true."
"I will therefore restrict myself to a few suggestions relating to that primary education in Mrs Kinnock' s report, which are particularly pertinent."
"That education must be free. Children must not be excluded because they cannot afford primary education; otherwise they are condemned to the street, condemned to exploitation through child labour, and so on."
"On the contrary, we should actually give scholarships to children from poor families, so that they can go to school, to cover the miles, to pay for their uniforms, etc. The teachers must also be paid, they must be trained and they must receive a wage that enables them to survive in a decent way, so that they do not have to leave the children to their own devices because they must urgently earn something extra to at least give their own families some food."
"It is clear that national action plans will need to be put in place. I expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem, but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency."
"We are far too inclined to sit on the sidelines with our expensive specialists and our expensive NGOs, while we, in fact, give far too little support to the meagre educational facilities in those countries themselves."
"That does not detract from the fact that I expect the EU to translate all those words into action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kinnock's report is a huge achievement and is to be welcomed unreservedly."
"The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries."
"There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education."
"There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address."
"The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms."
"Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect."
"That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books."
"Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away."
"You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert."
"They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example."
"This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations."
"The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions."
"The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally."
"Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback."
"In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit."
"It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the resolution tabled in the run up to the UN Special Conference on Children and congratulates you, Mrs Kinnock, on your most comprehensive report."
"Your report rightly highlights the need for urgent measures to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar."
"The Commission has also decided to put development policy, especially the education and health sectors, at the top of its agenda in 2002."
"Child welfare is a fundamental concern and a basic objective."
"An objective that we want to pursue mainly though social policies in sectors such as education and health."
"Related questions were addressed last year in the Council and Commission declaration on the European Community's development policy in connection with the fight against poverty."
"They also play a pivotal role in the Cotonou partnership agreement."
"The Commission has also stepped up support in the education sector and focused measures on basic education, especially primary school education, in recent years."
"As a result, the Community has considerably increased the general funds allocated to this sector in comparison with others."
"In addition, most programmes to promote primary school education contain special clauses for the benefit of girls, in order to counter gender-based drawbacks."
"As far as the specific considerations and recommendations which relate to the Community are concerned, I have the following to say: first, the education sector is instrumental in the strategy to fight poverty, which is the overriding aim of the Community's development policy."
"The Commission shares the view that clear objectives need to be defined, that education aspects need to be included in the fight against poverty and that civil society needs to be involved."
"The Commission also takes this standpoint in negotiations with developing countries on strategies to fight poverty."
"The Commission is determined to play an active role in these negotiations and to further international development objectives."
"Secondly, the Community made a formal undertaking in Dakar last year by backing the vision of the world declaration on education for all based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that education is a human right."
"This means that the Community has also subscribed to the call for countries seriously committed to education not to be impeded in implementing this objective by a lack of funds."
"The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that better coordination and more complementarity between Community measures and national projects, with the help of the Group of Experts on Education, and more intensive cooperation with UNESCO and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa are of paramount importance in improving the effectiveness of Community aid."
"The Commission is therefore stepping up its collaboration with UNESCO, especially by supporting UNESCO in coordinating education for all partners."
"The Commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar."
"It is also promoting the objectives of education for all in its negotiations on the ACP countries' strategies for the ninth EDF."
"As far as the difficult question of setting up a global fund for basic education is concerned, the Commission feels, given the Commission procedure for programming and implementing aid, that this sort of fund is not a practicable solution."
"However, the Commission does not in principle reject the idea of a global initiative, as provided for in the Dakar framework for action, even if the implementation methods need to be discussed in detail."
"Thirdly, the question of children's rights is closely bound up with the gender problem in general."
"Education targets for children, especially girls, will not be met until women have an equal status in the family and in the various societies."
"The Commission is very firmly in favour of paying particular attention to the education needs of girls in developing countries."
"It is currently preparing an action plan on equal treatment for men and women which should deal with this problem."
"It is also taking gender-specific questions into account in all special education programmes."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"VOTE"
"The next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Report (A5­0277/2001) by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming [2000/2222(INI)]"
"Mr President, there is a problem with the text at item 11, page 10, in the part about mountain wine-growing."
"In the Italian text there is a contradiction in the third line from the end where it says that no distinction should be made between the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains."
"In fact, the sense of the committee' s work and, obviously, the sense of the amendments which have been tabled is that the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains should be compared with the costs of hill vineyards."
". (NL) An agriculture that is increasingly relying on the world market will try to produce as cheaply as possible, at the expense of the quality of work, of nature, of the environment and of animal welfare."
"The least productive regions will be abandoned first."
"Those are areas that have been uninhabited over a long period, because it requires more effort to earn a living."
"The people who had nevertheless finally settled there, were the outcasts of society."
"Often they were ex-convicts, ethnic minorities and losers in the battle for the best land."
"The least productive areas where the losers wound up are not only the mountain areas, but also low-lying wetlands, that is, old bogs, the bottom of which consists of peat, a water retaining vegetable material that, when dry, shrinks and disappears."
"Farmers in mountains and wetlands now play an important role in nature conservation, recreation and water management."
"In a free, unprotected market, they are doomed to disappear."
"Then their working and living area will not return to primeval nature, but will go to the dogs."
"Mechanising and destroying the landscape to allow it to be cultivated more easily is not an acceptable alternative."
"That is why I should like to back the proposed supporting measures, but to register an objection if these are limited to the mountains alone."
". (FR) We support the author of the report in her demand that free, compulsory and high-quality education should be provided for all children up to the age of 15."
"However, even in European countries where there are laws to that effect, the free aspect is largely a formality, since it does not include the equipment that children need for school, which penalises children from poorer families, not to mention the overloaded classes and under-equipped state of schools in working-class districts."
"These troubles are even more keenly felt in developing countries, even where education is compulsory."
"The report claims that solving the education crisis is one of the most effective strategies for breaking the poverty cycle."
"This is turning reality upside-down."
"Without breaking the poverty cycle, in other words without stopping the pillaging of poor countries and the impoverishment of their working populations, even the most well-intentioned speeches will remain speeches, and millions of children in poor countries will continue to be deprived of even a minimum education."
"Our vote in favour of this report means that we agree with the intentions expressed but only subject to these conditions."
"That concludes voting time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)"
"Acts of terrorism in the United States"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I open this extraordinary meeting with the emotion and the sadness that this horrific event, the scale of which would have seemed inconceivable, inspires in us all."
"The purpose of this meeting is first of all to demonstrate our solidarity with the American people, who have just been struck by a barbaric act of terrorism, to show our compassion for the victims, for the final toll will certainly be appalling, and to demonstrate our support for all those who are working tirelessly to save what further lives they can."
"Yesterday, I expressed this solidarity to President Bush, on my own behalf and on behalf of the entire European Parliament and gave him my assurance that the people of Europe are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the tragic ordeal the American nation is suffering."
"When terrorism strikes in a Member State of the European Union we all feel concerned, and these appalling attacks inspire in me the same feeling of disgust and indignation."
"Today, we share the pain of the American people."
"It is the United States, that great democracy which did so much to help Europe protect its freedom that has just been attacked, but a blow has also been dealt to the sacrosanct values of life and democracy."
"The date of 11 September 2001 will remain forever engraved on the memory of humanity."
"This tragedy calls for a calm reaction on our part but also for the closest cooperation between all countries that reject terrorism so that the perpetrators of these abominable crimes and those who have supported them can be identified, pursued, arrested and tried and so that blind terrorism can, at last, be eradicated from the surface of the globe."
"It also requires the international community to commit itself to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts that nourish and sustain fanaticism."
"Over and above statements, over and above the common response to terrorism that we hope and pray for, all players on the international stage must now shoulder their responsibilities."
"From now on resolute action must be the order of the day and I know that the European Union will have to take decisions of vital importance."
"I welcome the presence here today of Prime Minister Verhofstadt, Mr Michel, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Mr Prodi, President of the Commission."
"The European Union will have no credibility if it does not establish a common policy on combating terrorism."
"The European Commission and the European Parliament have stated this clearly, particularly during our last part-session."
"I hope that the Council will study these proposals without delay."
"Since the Tampere European Council, some tentative progress has, admittedly, been made with regard to the European area of freedom, security and justice, but this falls considerably short of what is needed."
"We must go further."
"Although the European Union has made its presence felt on the international stage, in the Middle East, at Durban and even in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, yesterday' s events are proof, if proof were needed, of the imperative need to establish a Europe of defence and a genuinely common foreign and security policy as quickly as possible."
"An extraordinary European Council meeting could provide a timely boost to all these elements for, as we know, history waits for no man."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us now observe a minute' s silence for all the victims."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just over 24 hours ago the United States was hit by an attack of unprecedented scale and ferocity."
"At this very moment men, women and children of all ages, of all convictions and of all origins are struggling for their lives, while others are mourning the loss of loved ones and others still are suffering the anguish of waiting for reassuring news about the fate of those who are missing."
"Madam President, our thoughts are with our American friends who have been assailed by this despicable and barbaric violence."
"We would like to be able to express just how much we share their suffering."
"Today, we feel that we are all Americans."
"I say that, and let there be no mistake about this, because it is not just the United States and its population that has been targeted, but democracy itself."
"Democracy and its values of liberty, tolerance and humanity, which are the exact opposite of blind and suicidal terrorism."
"As human beings, as believers in democracy, and as Europeans, we cannot nor will we ever be able to accept this barbarity."
"Madam President, the Union that we want to build has its origins precisely in the rejection of the hate, fanaticism and murderous madness that nearly led to the downfall of our continent."
"And in the face of these tragedies a comprehensive range of concrete and firm gestures is called for."
"The various Member States have taken essential initiatives to come to the aid of the United States of America."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Union, and following consultation with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and the leaders of all the Member States, I have conveyed our deepest sympathy to President Bush."
"As a token of solidarity and sympathy, the Union has decided that on Friday, 14 September a day of mourning and solidarity with the American people will be observed."
"The Heads of State and Government of the fifteen EU Member States will be issuing a joint political declaration in the morning."
"At 12 noon, a three minutes' silence will be observed, during which all activity will be suspended."
"(Loud applause) The candidate countries for accession to the European Union are also invited to join us in this act of solidarity."
"With this expression of solidarity, in addition to the political decisions which we will be taking in the coming weeks, the people of the European Union wish to express their deep sympathy with the grief, and particularly the pain, which is affecting the American people today."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission took place this morning."
"We observed a minute' s silence and then discussed the various political aspects of this appalling tragedy which fall within the direct remit of the Commission."
"This afternoon, I stressed before the European Parliament and the General Affairs Council that Europe must demonstrate full solidarity with the American people and adopt a common European position on all aspects of these tragic events."
"The Commission is appalled by these criminal, barbaric deeds and has already sent its condolences to the victims and their families and expressed its sympathy for the American people."
"Our cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism is more essential than ever and must be pursued."
"Over the next few days, the Commission will examine the other proposals made in order to be able to take increasingly effective action to fight terrorism."
"We are fortunate in that the economic and social structure of our countries is strong and resilient."
"Therefore, even in these sad circumstances, we can remain calm and confident, and we will not allow terrorism to divide us or to divide the world in its goals or in its endeavours to achieve them."
"We must reflect at this time on the role of Europe."
"This criminal action is an attack on all our common values and on freedom itself."
"After this event, nothing will ever be the same."
"We therefore need to show great solidarity and friendship towards the American people and their government, and the European institutions and governments will work closely with our US and other friends at this tragic time and in the future."
"However, there is also a purely European dimension."
"The tragic events we have witnessed highlight once again the need for a united, strong, resolute, unified Europe which protects freedom and safeguards peace in Europe and throughout the world, a Europe that acts united alongside countries which share our goals, that acts united to protect and promote the values of freedom and solidarity, the values which are the basis of the democracy preserved by Parliament."
"I invite you, therefore, to reflect upon yesterday' s tragedy."
"Our citizens will only be able ensure peace and stability for themselves and for their children if they are united in their actions and if they feel that they can count on Europe."
"This is the path we must take to safeguard our people: we must follow it courageously, resolutely and responsibly."
"(Loud applause)"
"- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, on behalf of the Council, to express our immense horror, outrage and revulsion at the tragic events which hit the United States yesterday morning."
"I wish here, on behalf of the European Union, on behalf not only of its leaders but also of all the citizens of Europe, to reiterate our most sincere sympathy for the victims and their families and for the American people and the government of the United States."
"This abominable act, which has caused such pain to the American people, is of course also an attack on the universal values which Europe has always shared with America."
"I would like, on behalf of the Council, to solemnly reaffirm here the unfailing solidarity of the peoples of Europe with the American people in defending these values."
"We want the United States to be aware that Europe is by its side in combating the evil of terrorism, no matter what form it may take."
"We cannot allow anonymous terror to undermine the values of the free and democratic world."
"We will stand together in attacking the major threat represented by large-scale terrorism."
"The battle against this scourge will be all the more effective to the extent that it is supported by preventive actions and a detailed political dialogue with the countries of those regions of the world where terrorism has its roots."
"Yesterday' s terrorist attack on the territory of the United States is an unprecedented act of provocation and of particularly loathsome cruelty."
"Acts of such barbarity, terror and cowardice cannot be tolerated."
"The scale of this tragedy demands an appropriate response."
"In conjunction with its allies, the European Union will examine all possible means of preventing such acts and of responding to them in an appropriate manner."
"The European Union will step up its activity in the international bodies responsible for the fight against terrorism with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators, accomplices and sponsors of acts of terrorism are rendered powerless."
"However, our determination should, under no circumstances, fail to go hand in hand with responsible prudence."
"At this moment we do not know the identity of the perpetrators, sponsors and possible accomplices of these terrible attacks."
"These are essential factors in being able to judge and react in a rational manner with a responsible and meaningful attitude."
"We must avoid any type of impromptu action."
"While awaiting a response to these questions, our governments have taken the necessary steps to protect their people."
"The Council has been informed of security measures adopted as a matter of urgency by the Member States."
"In order to maximise cooperation between us, the Council has asked the Justice, Home Affairs and Transport Councils to take whatever measures are necessary to maintain the highest level of security as quickly as possible, particularly in the area of air transport, together with all measures required to prevent other attacks."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 September and the informal Transport Council on 14 September will evaluate those measures already taken and any that may be necessary to complement them."
"The Extraordinary Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers has condemned these acts of barbarity, which are an insult to our common values, in the strongest terms."
"We have declared 14 September 2001 a day of mourning in the 15 Member States."
"We have asked the presidency to maintain close contact with the United States so as to study with them how best to provide whatever help may be required."
"At the request of several Member States, the Secretary General of NATO has informed the Council of the discussions in progress within that organisation."
"I can now read to you the declaration by the European Union:"
"""The Council of the European Union, meeting in special session today, in the presence of the Secretary General of the Atlantic Alliance, expressed its horror at yesterday' s terrorist attacks in the United States."
"The Council stressed its complete solidarity with the government of the United States and the American people at this terrible time and extended its deepest sympathy to all the victims and their families."
"We ask all Europeans to observe three minutes of silence on Friday, 14 September at 12 noon and we also declare 14 September 2001 a day of mourning."
"These horrendous acts are an attack not only on the United States but against humanity itself and the values and freedoms we all share."
"The life and work of our open and democratic societies will continue undeterred."
"The Union utterly condemns the perpetrators and sponsors of these acts of barbarism."
"The Union and its Member States will spare no efforts in helping identify, bring to justice and punish those responsible: there will be no safe haven for terrorists and their sponsors."
"The Union will work closely with the United States and all partners to combat international terrorism."
"All international organisations, particularly the United Nations, must be engaged and all relevant international instruments, including those concerned with the financing of terrorism, must be fully implemented."
"The Community and its Member States have offered the United States all possible assistance with search and rescue operations."
"Discussions are underway to establish what help would be most useful."
"Recalling the strong and enduring ties which exist between the European Union and the United States, the Council has asked the presidency to stay in close contact with the government of the United States in order to convey this message of solidarity."""
"Following on from that, Madam President, these are the conclusions of the Council, so that you will be in receipt of all the relevant information:"
"""The Council expressed the profound solidarity of the European Union with the American people and approved a declaration condemning the terrorist attacks in the United States."
"The Council was informed of the security measures taken by the Member States."
"To ensure maximum cooperation between the latter, the Council asks its Justice and Home Affairs and Transport compositions to take all the necessary measures as soon as possible to maintain the highest level of security, particularly in the field of air transport, and any other measures needed to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist attacks."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 27 and 28 September, or earlier if necessary, together with the informal Transport Council meeting on 14 and 15 September, will evaluate the measures which will already have been taken and those which should supplement them."
"The Council reaffirms its determination to combat all forms of terrorism with all the resources at its disposal."
"The Council also took note of the declaration by the Commission and the President of the ECOFIN Council."
"The Council has requested the presidency, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission submit, as soon as possible, a report on concrete measures that may be recommended to speed up the implementation and the strengthening of the operational instruments of both the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in the field of Justice and Home Affairs."
"These measures will be aimed at increasing the capacity of the European Union to fight effectively, together with the United States and all our partners, international terrorism."
"As for the Council, it intends to return to these measures regularly in order to ensure, in particular, that all the actions taken by the European Union are coordinated."""
"(Loud applause)"
"- (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my group' s sincere thanks to you, Madam President, for having convened this sitting, which gives us all an opportunity to express our deepest sympathy for and solidarity with those families that have suffered losses, with the President of the United States of America, with our colleagues in the US Congress and with everyone in the United States of America."
"Yesterday' s horrendous attack in Washington and New York was not just an attack on the United States, but an attack on the entire civilised world, an attack against every one of us, including those in this Chamber."
"It was an attack on our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace."
"We are filled with grief and horror in the face of this disaster, a disaster which must never be repeated, and the forces of civilisation throughout the world must now work shoulder to shoulder with the United States to bring those responsible for this attack to account, and we must work closely together to prevent future terrorist attacks."
"We must find a way to stop attacks of this kind being planned again, and this will also require a whole new dimension in European and international cooperation."
"We must commit ourselves today to launching a fight against terrorism, so that the apocalyptic events in New York and Washington do not mean a global apocalypse tomorrow, and as a Parliament we can be proud of the fact that last week we adopted Mr Watson's anti-terrorism report by such a huge majority."
"For a few hours yesterday I had the impression that the United States' ability to act had been compromised. The United States is a world power to which we owe a debt of gratitude for fighting against Nazism in the Second World War and thus guaranteeing a peaceful future for Europe and it is a world power which has firmly resisted totalitarian communism, which ultimately led to the collapse of the wall dividing Berlin, Germany and Europe."
"On behalf of my group I would like to say that it is in our interest for America to retain its ability to act and to be strong, and for America to remain a good partner and friend to the European Union, and we should work together towards this goal in future."
"(Loud applause)"
"We do not know who the perpetrators are."
"There are certain assumptions, but I would counsel against surmising that these assumptions are true."
"Above all, should these assumptions be confirmed, I would counsel us all against applying them to the Arab and Islamic world as a whole."
"I have never forgotten an outstanding speech given by Anwar al Sadat, the assassinated President of Egypt, on 10 February 1981."
"He said that Islam should never be judged by the misguided and irresponsible actions of people professing to be adherents of this great faith."
"Islam is a religion based on tolerance, not fanaticism, a religion based on love, not hate, and it is a coherent religion based on order, not chaos."
"We should beware of making generalisations, and we should make it clear that we not only wish to live in partnership with our American friends, but that we also want to live in partnership and, if possible, friendship with those Arab and Islamic countries that are committed to peace."
"(Loud applause)"
"We should commit ourselves today to building an order in Europe and throughout the world in conjunction with all our neighbours - an order in which Europe is strong and united."
"That is why, Mr President-in-Office, it gives such an impressive signal that both you and the President of the Commission are here today, a signal that we Europeans are united and strong, and that we wish to coexist in friendship and partnership with all our neighbours, on the basis of human rights, democracy, freedom, social well-being and, above all, peace."
"That must be the message we send out today, the day after the dreadful events of 11 September 2001."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group shares the indignation and horror at the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington."
"We wish to express our solidarity with the families of the American victims of these horrendous attacks."
"We would also like to express our profound sadness to the families of the European victims and all those who have lost relatives, whatever their colour or continent of origin, because this diabolical attack was not only directed against the American people, but also against the Europeans and the other people who live together in the cosmopolitan world of New York, and we must remember that the World Trade Centre is just a few steps from the headquarters of the United Nations."
"This is an attack on our common values, on democracy, on the very foundations of our civilisation."
"As the late lamented Francisco Tomás y Valiente, President of the Spanish Constitutional Court, who was murdered by terrorists, wrote in an almost posthumous article: ""Every time a person is killed, something dies within us"" ."
"Exactly a week ago, this Parliament unanimously approved the resolution against terrorism."
"Then it was a European problem for certain States."
"Today we can see that the situation has changed qualitatively: terrorism has also been globalised as a result of a lethal combination of fanaticism, cowardice and high technology."
"Our film archives are full of horror and disaster movies, with monsters attacking New York and other cities."
"What happened yesterday reminds us that we do not need monsters: we humans are monsters when we lose our minds."
"And as in Goya' s painting, 'the illusion of reason produces monsters' ."
"We Europeans must play a very significant role in the fight against globalised terrorism, in the fight for common values, for a more peaceful and just world."
"We want to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Americans, with our colleagues in the United States Congress, and also with the rest of our allies, in a joint action to resolve the most ferocious conflicts on the planet with perseverance and decisiveness."
"We welcome the fact that the Americans, led by their President, despite this cowardly aggression, have so far acted with cool heads, containing their rage, as yesterday Kofi Annan rightly asked them to do."
"We would ask the leaders not to change that attitude, not to respond to terror with terror, that we may act jointly, above all in order to achieve something very important, because now is the time to strengthen our alliance with the United States and with all the people of the world who share our ideal of peace, justice and freedom."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, colleagues, this is an important place in which to celebrate this important moment."
"We in this Parliament are the tribune of the peoples of the European Union and we have gathered here today to declare solemnly our outrage, our sympathy, our solidarity and our common bond in humanity and democracy with the people of the United States of America, and with the people of New York City and Washington D.C."
"We witnessed yesterday a profoundly shocking event."
"It is a new and low threshold in the tide of human affairs."
"We witnessed an act of war - without a declaration of war - by persons, movements or states, as yet, not fully determined, but who acted with a grim and focused determination."
"We must make sure that our response is common and not isolated, shared and not unilateral, aimed at our common enemy, which is terrorism, but not at wider forces such as Islam or the wider Arab world, should that be the source whence this monster may have sprung."
"This modern apocalypse is America' s injury, but the wounds are universally shared among the community of democratic nations."
"To the people of the United States of America, to its President, its Congressional and civic leaders, and its communities throughout the country, especially the peoples of New York and Washington, to the grieving families of the missing and the dead and to those who have survived the ordeal, we express our sympathy in this hour of hardship and devastation."
"New York is a very special place."
"It is a multi-cultural microcosm of the whole world."
"It is a special gateway between our old continent and the New World."
"It was through Ellis Island that in earlier generations, before the spirit of democracy took the deep root it has right across our continent, that our huddled masses, our oppressed and our starving went to find freedom, democracy and opportunity."
"It is no accident that when the French Republic gave the people of the United States a gift to celebrate 100 years of that great republic, that they called that statue 'Liberty': no accident either that her extended arms should carry a torch of freedom."
"When someone touches that symbol, they touch us all deeply, because it is part of our common, human, democratic bond and inheritance."
"I remember, as a schoolboy, seeing on television at home a visit by John Fitzgerald Kennedy to places I had never been in our divided continent."
"I remember his visit to the great symbol of that gross division, Berlin, with its wall."
"I remember as a boy I could understand, although I did not know about politics or international affairs, that when that man said, ""I am a Berliner"" , he said something deep and meaningful in terms of solidarity at that time."
"Today, as the Prime Minister has remarked, we are all Americans, we are all New Yorkers, we are all Washingtonians."
"We share the sense of shock and horror."
"We share the bewildered outrage, we feel the vulnerability, for this is our common inheritance from yesterday's barbarous outrage."
"We share common democratic values and interests and we stand together willing to fight against terrorism and promote those interests and values."
"It is important that we as Europeans say to the Congressional leadership today: 'You do not stand alone."
"You are not isolated."
"We can make common cause in this matter, and we must do so.'"
"But, most of all, we stand today in our common bond of humanity as our American friends bravely search for their survivors and for their dead."
"Language often fails us on these occasions."
"My own colleagues have asked me to invite you, Madam President, in addition to this solemn moment, to open a book of condolence that we might also convey through that, at some appropriate time to the Congress, our interlocutor in US democracy, that in spite of the space which divides us across the Atlantic, we are resolutely united by the bonds of democracy and freedom and in the fight against terrorism."
"Our message to them today, in this fight for democracy and against terrorism, is that our only choice is to stand united; for united we stand but divided we shall fall."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, President of the Commission and the Council, the world today seems much bleaker than it did before Tuesday' s shocking events."
"The horrific images of the brutal and cowardly acts of terrorism on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington will stay in our minds forever."
"No cause could ever justify such a terrifying act of cold-blooded barbarism."
"On behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, I want to express the deep sorrow we feel for the victims who died in this tragedy and wish to send my heartfelt condolences to the families and all those who have lost their loved ones."
"Our thoughts are also with the rescue forces, the firefighters and policemen who risked and lost their lives to save others."
"What the world witnessed yesterday - and there are no other words to express it - was a crime against humanity."
"As soon as the terrorists are identified, they should be brought to an international court for crimes against humanity and judged accordingly."
"This is the time to speed up the establishment of a permanent international criminal court."
"In the aftermath of this tragedy, the United States of America should also recognise the need for such an institution."
"If, on the other hand, the United States responds with attacks on possible suspect countries, they will not only be killing more innocent people, just like those who died so tragically on Tuesday, but they will also be encouraging further counter-attacks: two wrongs never make a right."
"The devastating consequences of a spiral of revenge are nowhere more visible today than in the Middle East."
"We should do everything possible to ensure that this attitude is not repeated on a global scale."
"I would like to express our deep concern about the situation in the Middle East and call for international efforts to bring the peace negotiations back on track to be intensified."
"In this regard, we welcome the clear commitment made along those lines by Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Louis Michel, in today' s press and as representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union."
"We need to be tough on terrorism, but we also need to be tough on the causes of terrorism."
"We need a political response on a global scale to this unprecedented challenge in order to weed out the real roots of terrorism which stem from political, social and environmental conflicts: this concept underlies the report of Mr Watson, which this Parliament adopted last week."
"If there is widespread fanaticism, which breeds and supports this sort of terrorism, we can assume that there is something wrong politically."
"The European Union is well placed to engage in forms of conflict prevention and conflict resolution which address the causes and not merely treat the symptoms."
"That is why we believe a European Union/United States Summit should be held to deal with all aspects of the new terrorist threats, including the social and political causes."
"On Tuesday, our sense of security was shown to be illusory."
"It became evident that high-tech measures, such as a missile defence system, would be powerless in the face of this new kind of low-tech terrorism."
"What has happened in New York and Washington cannot be allowed to ever happen again."
"All defenders of democracy must protect our precious civilisation and uphold the civilised rule of law."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none of us, in fact, have the words to express the feelings aroused by the terrorist attack of unprecedented barbarity with which the United States has just been hit."
"The American people is going to have to live through a deeply traumatic experience which is likely to become still more intense as the scale of the disaster they have just experienced becomes more apparent."
"In this unimaginable ordeal, they must be able to count upon our unqualified solidarity."
"I would add that, if these faceless monsters targeted the United States yesterday, they will be able, tomorrow, to bring terror and death to any region of the world, including, of course, the European continent."
"Madam President, my group therefore fully supports the declarations you have made and the steps you have taken on our behalf."
"These dismaying attacks constitute a challenge to the whole of the human community, a challenge we are now going to have to learn to take up."
"I say 'learn' because, if we all agree that the guilty parties must be found and punished, we are obliged to acknowledge that, where every other aspect of the matter is concerned, more questions than certainties arise out of the tragedy of 11 September 2001."
"In my view, nothing would be more inappropriate, indeed more dangerous, than to react to this radically new phenomenon with well-worn notions whose limitations have just been cruelly demonstrated."
"After an outrage of this kind, there may, in other words, be a great temptation to call fervently for violent retaliation which would, however, have immeasurable consequences."
"What is more, you are right, Mr Poettering. It would do no service to the cause of peace to allow criminal fanatics to be confused with entire peoples, a number of whose representatives have, sometimes with much dignity and in a deep spirit of responsibility, indeed just expressed both their radical condemnation of the terrorists and their solidarity with the American people."
"Finally, and in more general terms, no one must forget ever again that we are all part of the same world."
"Even the strongest nation of all is not invulnerable."
"The entire international community is sentenced to confronting together the great problems facing the planet - the oceans of frustration, the great divisions that are opening up and the negotiations that have broken down - and to cooperating as closely as possible in the search for long-term solutions."
"That is undoubtedly the decisive contribution that Europe can make to the world in order to join in taking up the challenge to civilisation facing us."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, Prime Minister, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the initial thoughts which we have to express at this time are feelings of compassion towards the victims and of solidarity with the American people."
"The terrorist attack of which they have been the victims is not only aimed at themselves. It is directed at the very heart of democracy itself."
"Democracies are fragile things, and we are well aware that they have difficulty confronting this type of action. In the light of history and of experience, however, I remain convinced of the American people' s ability to come through this ordeal and, at this time, I believe it is important for this House to express its solidarity with them."
"That being the case, I should like to thank you, Madam President, for having organised this meeting which my group, in common with others, had requested."
"I am glad that it is taking place."
"I hope that it will be followed by a debate enabling us to examine the problems posed by international terrorism in greater depth."
"Having, on two occasions, had responsibility for leading the fight against terrorism in my own country, I should like to say that there is, to start with, one false notion that it is necessary to get away from: that there are good terrorists and bad terrorists."
"There are not; there are only terrorists, full stop."
"(Loud applause)"
"In so far as it involves a minority trying to use force and violent action to impose its point of view on the greatest number of people, terrorism is never anything other than a manifestation of the fascism and totalitarianism which we have fought in the past and which we must continue to combat resolutely."
"However, the fight against terrorism presupposes a state of permanent mobilisation, and it is probably because we have rather lost sight of this idea and this obvious fact that we are now confronted with the tragic situation we see in the United States."
"I think that the United States has made the mistake of believing it is probably immune from this type of action."
"We in Europe have, unfortunately, already experienced such acts: in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and many other countries."
"We know that terrorism is a blind force that can strike anywhere and at any time."
"We also know that political will is needed in order to combat terrorism."
"This will must be affirmed."
"Cooperation is also required."
"If each State wishes to reserve for itself the information it has managed to obtain and if there is no real cooperation at all between the services concerned, then we will be heading for further disasters."
"If, on the other hand, there is a new awareness on the part of our countries and at the level of international cooperation, if there is the will to pool all the information that may be to hand and if, also, a decision is made to create, in one form or another, a permanent body for cooperation, with the ability to analyse this information and propose the necessary measures, then we shall have the opportunity to oppose terrorism with some success."
"I should like, for my part too, to concur with what has been said in this House, firstly by our excellent fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and then by Mrs Hautala and Mr Wurtz."
"There would be nothing worse at the present time than to speak in such thoughtless terms as to create a sense of solidarity between terrorists and the Muslim world."
"That would be the worst of mistakes and the most stupid thing of all to do."
"That is why, of course, none of us can be satisfied with declarations that do not mean very much."
"I personally think, however, that I - indeed, our Community as a whole - would consider it to be of great value if Muslim religious leaders at the highest level were themselves to condemn these attacks and in that way demonstrate that terrorists proclaiming a perverted faith cannot possibly be identified with, or thought to share any common ground with, the Muslim religion, which deserves the respect of each one of us."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, I shall speak on behalf of the radical delegation."
"I would first of all like to thank the Belgian presidency for their initiative on Friday."
"I believe that it is all the more necessary since, while the majority of us feel great emotion and great compassion for our American friends, there are those who are saving their emotion and their compassion for the possible American reprisals."
"I therefore warmly thank you."
"I believe that we have a reason which has not been mentioned here today, another reason to feel compassion for our American friends, and that is that if it is they who have been attacked today, and not us, it is probably due to the lack of courage of our policy, to its ambiguities and its hypocrisies, which have not been demonstrated by our American friends."
"Mr Poettering, you rightly talk about the need to confront the causes of terrorism, and I believe that it is crucial for the European Union to examine its policy over the last fifty years, which has been fundamentally racist in relation to the Arab world and the Islamic world, a policy which has done nothing but sustain the worst regimes in those countries, the worst regimes of Saddam Hussein, of Mr Gaddafi, of Mr Hafez El-Assad in the past and his son today, a policy which has hardly shown solidarity with past and present democrats, such as Mrs Ben Sedrin in Tunisia, Mrs Al-Sadaawi in Egypt, Mr Ibrahimi in Egypt, and so many others who fight for democracy in their countries, and I believe that it is a matter of urgency for our Union to make the establishment of democracy in those countries its political priority, since that is the only way to pursue and destroy the terrorist bases in those countries."
"Terrorism does not come from the Moon."
"It is born and grows up in those countries which encourage it, which often finance it, and which are responsible for the fact that yesterday we saw the greatest tragedy since the end of the second world war, the greatest ever terrorist tragedy."
"I would like to assure the Commission and the Council that I believe our Parliament must completely alter its position."
"It has literally been taken hostage over recent months by certain crypto-Stalinists who have pushed it into excessively Palestinian unilateral positions which certainly have some connection with the current tragedy of our American friends."
"We must finally have the courage to break the taboos."
"We have an historic duty in relation to Israel, but we also have a duty in the present."
"Israel is the only true democracy in that part of the world."
"We must break the taboo."
"Israel must be part of the European Union."
"That is the only way to guarantee security and democracy in that country. But it is also the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to guarantee secure borders for the Israelis, and therefore for the Palestinians."
"Furthermore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is intolerable that the democracies of the world continue to be made fools of, and Mr Louis Michel, our President-in-Office, has borne the brunt of this in Durban."
"I thank Mr Michel for his determination and for the resolute fight he put up in Durban, but it is intolerable that the Syrian regime should do what it did in Durban."
"Our democracies must create and organise themselves into a worldwide organisation of democracies, so that the empty shell known as the UN may recover its original purpose, which is to resolve the great problems of the world."
"Madam President, dear American friends, our sympathy is with the many families who are now missing their loved ones."
"Our tears are shed today for those who have lost a son or a daughter, a mother, a father, or both."
"Our prayers are with those who are still alive but remain in peril."
"Our thoughts are with President Bush and the people he leads."
"Our hope is that in the pain of these terrible atrocities, the reaction of the American people will be tempered with wisdom."
"Even as we weep, we know that this is not a time for hatred and revenge."
"This a moment of truth, a time for reflection for all of us."
"We only have one world and we are all responsible for it and its people."
"World peace is something of which we all dream, but we have learned through bitter experience that it was not enough simply to tear down the wall between East and West."
"We have learned that it is not only the superpowers who can acquire the methods and means of mass destruction."
"Small, faceless groups intent on destruction have it within their power to destroy our whole world."
"The answer is not only improved intelligence and sophisticated security."
"The way to world peace is to work for it by respecting human rights and the right to national self-determination for all."
"We must fight torture, terrorism and every crime against humanity."
"We must take sustainable development seriously."
"We must help the poor, the oppressed and the powerless before they become desperate, suicidal terrorists."
"Just as terror can never be justified, neither can oppression."
"Oppression breeds people who are prepared to take all life before them in the passionate intensity of their hatred."
"We must bridge the gap between the West and the rest of the world, instead of fighting each other."
"In this way we may remove the raison d'etre of terrorism."
"It is still too early to foresee all the lessons to be learned from Tuesday' s shocking event but it is not too early to know that Tuesday, 11 September 2001 marked a turning point in history."
"Our world will never be the same again."
"Our thoughts are with the victims of these horrendous attacks and those who grieve for them."
"Let the memory of these terrible events always call to mind our duty to take better care of this world."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, on this tragic day, we wish to express our solidarity and our friendship towards the American people, victims of the most horrendous terrorist crime."
"Nor do we forget that many nationals of European countries work in the towers of the World Trade Centre, and that many of them have certainly died."
"We have a profound feeling that it is not just the United States, but the whole of the Western world, of which we form an integral part, which has been targeted."
"It is not in fact just the United States, but the whole of Western civilisation that has just been the victim of an act of war, of a new war, which is murderous but elusive, because it does not correspond to any traditional criteria."
"Some people believed, after the fall of the Soviet Union, that the world was becoming less dangerous, and that was an easy excuse to relax the security effort."
"That was a grave error."
"In fact, we have entered a new era, in which there is a greater risk from rogue States led by people driven mad and blinded by hate and ideology."
"Worse still, more elusive than the rogue States are the stateless terrorist organisations whose murderous folly does not correspond to any logic."
"This new war is going to force us to review all our strategic ideas."
"Firstly, Europe is going to have to understand that security must take priority over abolishing controls at borders and elsewhere."
"I shall not dwell on this point, which you all understand."
"Secondly, we must strengthen our fight against terrorism and criminal organisations through European cooperation and worldwide cooperation on the exchange of information and on action, but also by first of all putting our own countries in order."
"It is terrifying to imagine what ideas may be implanted in other places by the attacks which have just been inflicted on the world' s most powerful country."
"Thirdly, we must re-establish the defence effort where it has been relaxed, as it has in my country over recent years."
"The threat is real and takes many forms."
"The rapid reaction force set up by the countries of Europe is a good idea, provided that its democratic control, its variable geometry and the freedom of engagement of the members are better respected than they are at the moment, as can already be said."
"But, above all, it is insufficient."
"While seeking to eradicate terrorism, as you have said, Madam President, we must simultaneously make our territories safer in order to better protect our people."
"In order to make our territories safer, all useful means must be implemented."
"One of these is the idea that President Bush launched some time ago, which is an anti-missile shield for the United States."
"The Europeans, for their part, took a rather negative view of this idea."
"Today, we must review this issue."
"Would it not also be in the interest of Europe to conduct studies into the possibility of having its own shield, alone or in cooperation with the United States?"
"That remains to be seen."
"It would not protect against attacks such as yesterday' s, of course, but it would protect against other risks which we are obliged to anticipate."
"Neither, of course, do we currently have the necessary technological means, but the quest to acquire them would be a challenge worthy of consideration."
"That would undoubtedly be a European-scale project, Madam President, which would no doubt be a powerful demonstration to the public of the usefulness of respectful cooperation between national sovereign states, which is intended to protect them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we have wished to hold a formal sitting."
"We shall consider, together with the Group Chairmen, the possibility of organising a major fundamental debate at our part-session next week."
"I should also like to say that I naturally take a very positive view of the suggestion made to me to establish a book of condolence addressed to our colleagues in the American Congress."
"That book will be placed at the exit of the Chamber tomorrow morning at 10.00 a.m."
"I should like to offer my most heartfelt thanks to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, to Minister Louis Michel, to Mr Romano Prodi, and to all of you, and declare this formal sitting closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Wednesday 12 September 2001."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sittings"
"The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 6 and Wednesday 12 September 2001 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, although I know that we have more important things to do today, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, on 6 September, I raised objections to the Minutes of the previous day and also asked - with a view to having these issues in general clarified, and not just this particular instance - that the committee responsible for dealing with agenda questions be asked to look into the matter of a vote result being retrospectively altered."
"Towards midday, I raised another objection and referred to my first one, but I have to date received no reply, and I do think that a Member is entitled to be given answers."
"So I ask you firstly: do you think that a Member is entitled to be given answers when he raises objections?"
"And secondly: when can I expect to receive one?"
"Yes, Mr Swoboda, of course."
"I believe that Members are entitled to receive a reply to their comments and I can assure you that this matter will be sorted out."
"Madam President, of course Mr Swoboda is entitled to receive an accurate reply."
"I just want to ask your services to give it on the basis of the midday debate."
"Not to be too blunt about it, I had the feeling that Mr Swoboda, on the day itself, tried to use an amendment of the Minutes to change the outcome of this House's vote."
"For this reason, I ask that the midday debate should be taken as the basis of any answer your services give to Mr Swoboda, and please be so kind as to let me have a copy of it."
"I am quite sure that your services understood perfectly well what this House had in mind!"
"Mr Jarzembowski, we shall look into the whole matter very carefully."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commander Massoud visited the European Parliament on 4 April 2001."
"He was recently assassinated in a cowardly attack by his opponents, a few days before the terrible attacks on New York and Washington."
"I had invited him because he embodied the hopes of the overwhelming majority of people in Afghanistan for a future of peace and freedom."
"He had warned us against the Taliban regime' s tacit support for international terrorism and he did everything in his power to fight against those who misused Islam in order to flout the most basic human rights."
"He sent a strong message to us to help him to establish peace as soon as possible."
"I regret that the West did not heed this message and did not do more to help this brave man."
"Many of you met him and were impressed by his intellect and his human qualities."
"I would like to ask you to pay tribute to him by observing a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a communication that I shall now give to you on security measures at the European Parliament."
"As you know, the dreadful terrorist attacks in the United States have fuelled quite legitimate feelings of concern within the European Parliament itself."
"The Sunday Telegraph even reported that we were the target of very serious threats, which had been thwarted."
"I would like to confirm that the European Parliament has never known of any threats."
"On Monday, the prefect of the Bas Rhin department called me personally in order to tell me that he formally denied that these threats had been made."
"As you know, the French authorities also formally denied the threats, as confirmed in an official press release."
"I would add that the British Secret Services also claimed that they had no knowledge of them."
"In fact, I intend to send a letter to the editor of the Sunday Telegraph to protest against the newspaper publishing such serious and inaccurate information."
"I can assure you, however, that the staff of the Bureau are constantly monitoring the issue of security of the European Parliament, the vice-presidents, the Quaestors, the President and General Secretariat."
"We took a number of measures to increase security, particularly in December 2000, at Christmas, when there were rumours circulating that Strasbourg cathedral was a target."
"Given that the cathedral is close by, a series of measures was of course taken at that time."
"Immediately after the events of 11 September, the Secretary-General and I were in contact, and we have introduced additional measures to further increase checks on people and luggage at the entrances of the three European Parliament buildings."
"I would add that we are, of course, in constant contact with the other European institutions as well as with the governments of the host countries of the European Parliament."
"Lastly, the Bureau is meeting this evening in order to consider a series of new measures proposed by the Secretary-General which aim to extend - and I did say 'extend' - security measures."
"I trust everyone will cooperate so these necessary measures are a success."
"Thank you in advance."
"Welcome"
"It is my pleasure to welcome Mr Moussa Touré, President of West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), who is seated in the public gallery."
"The UEMOA, whose structure is closely modelled on that of the European Union, plays a key role in the organisation of regional cooperation in West Africa."
"This is why we hope to build further on the links that already exist between this organisation and the European Union."
"This is the aim of Mr Touré' s visit, and I would like to extend a very warm welcome to him."
"Combating terrorism"
"I would like to welcome Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Minister for European Affairs and President-in-Office of the Council."
"I would also like to welcome Commissioner Vitorino."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements with a view to the informal and extraordinary meeting of the European Council on Friday 21 September, on the measures needed to tackle terrorism."
"I shall now give the floor to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, its citizens and its institutions are still deeply shocked by the terrorist attack on the United States on Tuesday 11 September 2001."
"The Presidency and the Council immediately condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these barbaric acts."
"The strikes against the American nation are a direct attack on the values of democracy, tolerance, respect for human rights and the rule of law that are shared by America and Europe, and upon which our societies and others elsewhere in the world, are based."
"At its emergency session on Wednesday 12 September, the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers expressed its profound solidarity with the American people."
"We clearly stated that no effort would be spared to identify, bring to justice and punish those responsible."
"To achieve this aim, the European Union will have to use and strengthen a number of operational instruments of our Common Foreign and Security Policy and our Justice and Home Affairs policy."
"Terrorism is an international problem and as such requires a global response."
"Madam President, at the instigation of the General Affairs Council, the Council of Transport Ministers held a meeting on 14 September."
"The Council reviewed the urgent measures taken by each Member State in order to guarantee the safety of air travel."
"It also set up a special working group, comprising representatives of the Member States and of the European Commission, which is responsible for increasing cooperation and coordination among the Member States to ensure the uniform and effective application of security measures, including by legislative means."
"A preliminary report on this subject is to be laid before the Council of Transport Ministers meeting scheduled for 15 October next."
"Lastly, the Transport Ministers have decided to draw up common proposals on the subject of security measures."
"On behalf of the Union, these proposals will then be put to the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on 25 September next."
"The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will meet on 20 September."
"It will assess the intelligence-sharing mechanism and the respective roles in this context of institutions such as Europol and Eurojust, as well as assessing the two proposals for framework decisions it received from the Commission."
"The first proposal concerns the approximation of criminal law in the Member States with a view to developing a common definition of terrorist action and establishing a common system for punishing criminal acts."
"The second proposal concerns the introduction of a European warrant of arrest."
"The Council will consider instruments employed in the investigation of criminal acts and will ensure that a suitable balance is struck between the protection of privacy and the needs of the investigative authorities."
"Finally, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will examine a number of measures aimed at strengthening transatlantic judicial cooperation in the areas of policing, intelligence and immigration."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism requires the use of all kinds of instruments to monitor financial flows, to identify suspects, to make air travel safer, to monitor arms trafficking as well as many other aspects."
"The European Union is the best placed organisation to provide a global response to the fight against terrorism."
"The fight against international terrorism will be a long, drawn-out battle."
"As the Heads of State and Governments have stated, the European Union will have to assume an even greater role in managing regional tension and conflicts if it is to stamp out international terrorism."
"The inclusion of fragile nations and regions in a peaceful world governed by the rule of law will be a powerful weapon in the battle against the scourge of terrorism."
"The EU will be much more effective if it can further develop its Common, Foreign and Security Policy and can activate its Common European Security Policy at the earliest opportunity."
"The Common, Foreign and Security Policy will have to be used preventatively, rather than as a means of reprisal."
"If the battle against terrorism is to be truly effective, we will also need to strengthen our policies with regard to the countries and the regions of the world that appear to nurture terrorism."
"We will have to enhance and deepen our political dialogue and use every possible means at our disposal to combat, stifle and finally eradicate international terrorism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is an emerging world power."
"As such we have a greater number of responsibilities, which we must shoulder together."
"The tragic events of 11 September 2001 will also prompt us to develop closer ties with the United States, which will go beyond the established mechanisms for cooperation."
"The transatlantic dialogue will enable us to exchange information and share our respective assessments of the threat posed by terrorism, in all its guises."
"The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Louis Michel, will travel to Washington this evening for talks with the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, on transatlantic cooperation."
"He will report back on his meeting to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council, which is scheduled for Friday 21 September."
"This extraordinary meeting of the European Council was called to review all the political, diplomatic, economic, legal and financial resources that are at the Union' s disposal to combat terrorism."
"The Council will also be an opportunity to reflect on the EU' s diplomatic role in stabilising regional conflicts."
"In order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must be able to rely on the efforts of all the countries that share our values of freedom, tolerance and democracy."
"For this reason, the Presidency has sought to ensure that third countries are fully involved in the actions taken by the European Union."
"The candidate countries unanimously backed the declarations of the General Affairs Council and the declarations made by the Heads of State and Government."
"Third countries have also been invited, via the foreign embassies of Member States, to confirm their commitment to the unrelenting fight against terrorism."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union can thus help to build a world of peace and legality for all nations."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is actively preparing for the European Council meeting to be held next Friday, an important part of which is tomorrow' s European Union troika meeting in the United States."
"This is why my colleague Chris Patten, who hoped to give a speech on external relations with particular emphasis on the fight against terrorism, could not attend this debate."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to stress that we support the principle that the Union must make more effort to give a consistent message where the fight against terrorism is concerned and that we need a European agenda to acknowledge the key role that must be assigned to the United Nations Organisation in the fight against global terrorism."
"That is why we welcome the initiative by the Belgian Presidency to schedule an extraordinary and informal meeting of the European Council for next Friday and we are pleased to take part in today' s debate in the European Parliament."
"We must show the American people and the American authorities that they have the solidarity of the whole European Union."
"But in order for the Union to influence the guidelines on the fight against terrorism, we must give a consistent message."
"Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon. The threats are new, however, and the tools used by the terrorists are new and more sophisticated."
"The tragic events in the United States of America sadly demonstrate the timeliness of the two proposals that were today approved by the Commission, which are closely related and which are also in response to a request by the European Parliament that was approved at the September plenary session in Strasbourg."
"I would like to clarify that our proposals are not a response to the events that occurred in the United States of America."
"The proposals are primarily a response to the fact that, even in our Member States, we have problems regarding terrorism that we must resolve."
"The Commission has been working on these proposals for more than a year, working closely with the European Parliament, and we would like to stress that these proposals will help Europe to co-operate in a much more effective manner in the fight against terrorism, and therefore to collaborate in the fight at international level."
"Terrorism constitutes one of the greatest threats to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development."
"In recent years, we have witnessed an increase in terrorist activities both within the European Union' s borders and worldwide."
"This increase in the power of terrorism is characterised by a profound change in the nature of terrorist attacks."
"The actual or potential effects of armed attacks are increasingly devastating and fatal."
"The increased dependence of our society on technological evolutions is giving rise to new forms of terrorism."
"Increasingly, terrorism stems from the activities of networks operating at international level, which have very close links with other types of organised crime based in several countries, exploiting the legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations and sometimes enjoying extensive logistical and financial support."
"Today more than any other time, therefore, we need measures to fight against this scourge."
"The Treaty on European Union expressly lays down that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice shall include progressively adopting measures establishing rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism."
"The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution, which shows the determination of representatives of European citizens to conduct a fierce and effective battle against terrorism."
"The Commission is proposing a two-fold response:"
"First of all, we are proposing a common definition of acts of terrorism and to set across the Member States levels of penalties that reflect the seriousness of these acts."
"Terrorists take advantage of any differences in legal treatment in the Member States, particularly where the offence is not referred to in one of the State' s national legislation."
"We must admit that the situation is very different from one Member State to another."
"Most Member States have no specific regulations on terrorism and terrorist acts are punished as common offences."
"On the other hand, six Member States have specific laws or legal instruments concerning terrorism where the words 'terrorism' or 'terrorist' are expressly mentioned."
"The Commission' s proposal for a framework decision on terrorism aims to introduce approximation in this area and it provides a list of offences from murder to other actions that can be equally devastating, albeit more insidious, and which are described as terrorist acts if intentionally committed by individuals or by groups against one or more countries, their institutions or people, with the aim of intimidating them and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of a country or to destroy them."
"It is proposed that such acts incur prison sentences ranging from a minimum of 2 years to 20 years of prison depending on the severity of the offence."
"Secondly, the Commission is presenting a proposal of a horizontal nature, a fairly ambitious proposal, I must admit, which is to replace the traditional extradition procedures by a system of surrendering persons to judicial authorities on the basis of a European arrest warrant."
"This proposal, which also supplements the proposal on terrorism although its scope is wider, is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, which the Tampere European Council hoped would become the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation."
"The underlying idea is that where the judicial authority of one Member State requests the surrender of a person, either for final sentencing or because this person is undergoing criminal proceedings, the decision must be recognised and executed throughout the European Union in order to simplify and accelerate procedures as far as possible."
"A time limit of three months is proposed and the reasons for refusing extradition are to be restricted to a limited number."
"In particular, the principle of double criminal liability and the exception in favour of nationals are to be abolished."
"The most important criterion in the European Union is not that of nationality but that of a person' s place of residence."
"The proposal thus seeks to facilitate, wherever possible, the execution of the sentence in the country of arrest, if that is where the person is most likely to be successfully reintegrated into society."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, tomorrow I shall have the opportunity to present these proposals to the ministers at the extraordinary Council meeting called by the Belgian Presidency to discuss the European Union' s contribution to the fight against the threat of terrorism."
"The benefit of this meeting is that it provides us with the opportunity to ask the ministers questions of principle at a political level and to try to resolve them."
"This concerns our legislative proposals as well as a whole raft of measures that should be taken in order to step up our action at an operational level and to improve and make more effective our collaboration with our partners."
"As you know, the Commission does not have any experience at an operational level, but it believes that the European Union should take a number of measures internally, including to ensure that Europol becomes an operational instrument in the fight against the various forms of crime, one of which is terrorism."
"For this to be done, we must implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on Europol, which provide for its participation in joint enquiry teams and the possibility of inviting Member States to launch investigations, which also requires a major review of the content of the Europol convention, including questions of judicial control and democratic control."
"We need strong commitment from the Member States straight away in order to establish genuine and effective cooperation between their intelligence services and to demonstrate that they share mutual trust."
"This is also necessary in order to bring about a significant improvement in the conditions in which Member States' police and intelligence services provide Europol with the information needed to carry out their work, the most important part of which, in my opinion, is the prevention of terrorist acts."
"Furthermore, it is important for the Union to strengthen international cooperation and this will involve taking all the necessary measures regarding judicial assistance, extradition, police and judicial cooperation in order to improve our ability to pre-empt and fight international terrorism."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are some ideas formulated by the Commission and which were put to the European Parliament and the European Council."
"At this difficult time when the citizens of our Member States are, I am sure, contemplating an uncertain and insecure future, I believe that the best political message we can give them is that this gives us a unique opportunity to show that the European project really does have an added value and that is to guarantee them a future of freedom, security and justice."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly welcomes the special summit of Heads of State and Government to be held on Friday at the Belgian Presidency's initiative, and you, Madam President, will of course be there too, to speak for the European Parliament."
"We in the European Parliament can take real pride in passing the Watson Report in the last part-session; it points the way ahead for our common struggle against terrorism."
"Next Friday's summit here in Brussels should, in many ways, be a signal."
"It should again signal to our American friends that the diabolical attacks on Washington and New York were not only an assault on the United States, but on the whole of the civilised world and on every one of us."
"These attacks struck at our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace."
"What was said in our deeply moving session last week is still true today."
"In the Conference of Presidents this morning, I asked the High Representative, Mr Solana - who is at this very moment on his way to Washington with Mr Michel and Mr Patten - to tell Secretary of State Powell, when they meet, that we, the freely-elected Parliament of Europeans in the European Union, expressed our solidarity in the immediate aftermath of these fearful events."
"In Washington, however, we will also say that we expect not only decisions to be announced there for our European leaders to take note of, but also genuine discussions and consultation to take place, so that whatever action is necessary, and responsibility for it, may be shared by Europeans and Americans."
"Madam President, I have the highest respect for Mr Solana."
"In future, however, we must ensure that we can debate with the High Representative of the European Union here in the European Parliament as well."
"I believe there is room for improvement here."
"Friday's summit must also send a signal to the Middle East."
"We urge Israel and the Palestinians to hold talks now."
"Now is not the time to refuse to hold talks, or to cancel them, but a time for dialogue and confidence-building measures, so that peace may be achieved there."
"(Applause)"
"We must repeat: those who now refuse dialogue shut themselves out from our sympathy and solidarity."
"At this time most of all, we need peace developments and confidence-building measures in the Middle East."
"(Applause)"
"We need a signal to the Arabic and Islamic world."
"Our group's Bureau met this morning and decided to recommend to you, Madam President, that we should, as a European Parliament, meet as soon as possible with parliamentarians from the Arabic and Islamic world in the context of the Mediterranean Forum, that is to say, with those States with which we are linked in the Barcelona process and in the Mediterranean Dialogue."
"Allow us now to send this signal, so that they may know that we seek partnership and friendship."
"Let me now turn to another aspect, which I believe must be the essential operational content of the summit here in Brussels on Friday."
"Mr Vitorino, we thank you for presenting these proposals today."
"We must make Europol into a real instrument for combating crime, and we urge Member States to give Europol the information it needs to do this, something which has not happened in the past."
"As we know, only one Member State does this reasonably adequately at present; the others have to date refused to."
"We are very much in favour of introducing a European arrest warrant, and now is the time to act."
"If there is anyone who now wants to stop Europeans going from strength to strength, who does not support European cooperation in the name of Europol, then they are fundamentally denying solidarity not only to Europeans, but also to our American friends, because in combating crime we must also be united against terrorism, if we are to stand alongside our American friends and partners."
"(Applause)"
"For this reason, our group has tabled an amendment to the Budget for the year 2002."
"We want to put the necessary resources at Europol's disposal to enable it to be truly operationally effective."
"The time for words is now past!"
"We must act as Europeans."
"At the same time, however, we must act calmly and with deliberation, and above all we must resolve conflicts peacefully wherever we can."
"A military operation is never an act of retaliation, but must always lead to greater security."
"Let us act calmly and with deliberation, but let us act consistently, and above all let us make our contribution to the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Earth!"
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last week we formally expressed our sympathies for all the victims of these attacks, who came from America, Europe and the whole of the world; we expressed our solidarity with the United States and, now, with pain but also with determination, we must respond to global terrorism, to this mixture of fanaticism and advanced technology which threatens our civilisation and our open, democratic and multicultural society."
"We must send a very clear message to our fellow citizens: terrorism can injure, it can kill, but no democracy has ever been destroyed by terrorism and that is our greatest strength."
"We must therefore work together: Parliament produced the Watson report, the Commission has speeded up its work and this week a Special Council has been called."
"I must stress that yesterday and today the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Minister for External Affairs, Mr Michel, the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, and the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, have taken part in debates in Parliament on this issue."
"I believe that we should welcome this willingness to participate, which increases transparency and communication."
"We Socialists must respond on the basis of one fundamental notion: the global response must be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 of this year, which establishes that we must work together to bring the organisers, sponsors and perpetrators of the attacks and their accomplices to justice."
"This is the basis of the worldwide coalition which we are building with the United States, with the candidate countries, with Russia and with all the states of the world which share our universal values."
"I would add another point: the ratification of the International Criminal Court must be accelerated so that we may have a global instrument of justice in this very field."
"We must also work firmly and with perseverance, acting within the framework of a multidimensional policy which relates to what we are doing in the United Nations."
"This explains NATO' s decision to invoke Article 5."
"We must state that poverty, injustice or conflict are not causes which can justify barbarism."
"No conflict between East and West, between Islam and Christianity, between the traditional and the modern, can explain why killing innocent people can bring progress in the world."
"I believe that the European Parliament, those of us sitting here from different peoples, of different beliefs, ideologies and religions, demonstrates that we Europeans have found a response to fanaticism and intolerance."
"What can be done to create our policy? A series of contributions have been made here."
"The Commission has brought forward certain measures and there are others which the Commission and the Council could activate more quickly. For example, they could speed up the implementation of the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, they could speed up the ratification of the international conventions against terrorism - and this also falls within the competence of the Member States - and in particular the convention for the suppression of terrorist funding."
"It must not be the case, as appears to be happening, that we are assisting in the funding of terrorist organisations through stock exchange speculation."
"There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol."
"Finally, Madam President - and this must be stressed - on the basis of the information given us by Mr Solana this morning, we must activate and pursue our policy of finding an opening, an opportunity, for peace in the Middle East, founded on the Mitchell report."
"Confidence-building measures must not be viewed as recompense, but rather such measures must be an integral part of this process."
"And we must do so jointly with the United States."
"We must send them the message that they should not hide behind imaginary shields, that they should share with us in the responsibility to achieve a world which lives in peace, justice, freedom and security."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, last week's attacks on innocent civilians in New York and Washington shocked and outraged the civilised people across the world."
"They show the difficulties faced by any state, especially a democracy, in defending its citizens against terrorists."
"These atrocities and the subsequent search for those responsible also highlight the weaknesses of our defence of the civilian population and throw into sharp relief the painfully slow progress of EU cooperation in justice and home affairs, so boldly trumpeted in Amsterdam and in Tampere."
"As the Americans seek the arrest of people on European soil who may be responsible, they must shake their heads in disbelief at the multitude of bilateral extradition agreements, which they will need to employ."
"I welcome Commissioner Vitorino's statement."
"The proposals he has put forward today take on board the key recommendations of the report we adopted on 5 September, to which Mr Poettering so kindly referred."
"They deserve urgent consideration and swift action by Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at their meeting tomorrow."
"If they are adopted by Council, they will represent a major step forward in forging a common EU anti-terrorism policy."
"I challenge any minister who may resist these proposals in the secrecy of the Council chamber to explain publicly to citizens in their own country, or across Europe, why they are holding up effective common action in this field."
"However welcome and important the Commission's proposals are, they are clearly insufficient."
"They provide answers to the world as it was before last Tuesday."
"They deal with terrorist crimes within the Union but do nothing to improve cooperation with countries outside the EU."
"They fail to solve conflicts of competence between judicial authorities."
"They leave cooperation and the vital matter of police affairs subject to a national veto, as Commissioner Vitorino said."
"If the EU is serious about combating terrorism, we must gear up the operational instruments of common action."
"We must enable Europol to cooperate effectively with third countries."
"We must give an external dimension to Eurojust."
"We must act decisively too, to combat money laundering in the conciliation currently under way and we must develop common policies for the collection and sharing of criminal intelligence, as Mrs Neyts pointed out."
"Measures are needed too in foreign and security policy: greater cooperation in the UN, in the G8, in the Council of Europe, urging Member States to sign the UN Convention on the financing of terrorism; export controls on sensitive products and tighter association agreements with third countries."
"But we must guard against a blurring of the second and the third pillars, which last week's Council declaration suggested, and guard too against upsetting the delicate balance between the needs of security and the civil liberties, which our citizens enjoy."
"I ask whether now is not the time to consign to the rubble of history the clumsy, outdated second and third pillars of the EU cooperation and make their contents core competences of the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"The fig leaf of national sovereignty serves only to hide the impotence of nation states."
"Democracy faces supranational challenges and these require a supranational response."
"Our policies will need public support, so our policymaking will need proper democratic oversight and control."
"I believe that this House stands ready to play its part."
"We must now call on our national leaders to show the courage and the vision which the moment demands."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group and I believe, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, that the need to see the European Union display its character and show how useful it can be in world affairs has never been so great."
"The coming period - perhaps the next few days - will certainly provide it with the opportunity to display its determination and ability to face three challenges, in particular, which are posed by this tragic situation."
"I believe that the first challenge will be for countries to decide to be willing partners of the United States."
"At yesterday' s debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, one of my colleagues spoke of 'allied but not aligned countries' ."
"This does not mean, of course, that they lack the necessary and legitimate solidarity, particularly in the common fight to seek out, judge and punish those responsible for this act of barbarism or, more generally, to break up the terrorist networks."
"On the other hand, this means that we must have the courage to make clear to our American counterparts what we are perfectly willing to do and what do not sanction under any circumstances."
"Yesterday and this morning, Mr Solana quite rightly stressed that it is vital that our fight against terrorism is not perceived by those in the Arab and Muslim world as a war against their civilisation, or even as a crusade, to use one of the most alarming expressions of President Bush."
"Yesterday, the High Representative for the CFSP already recommended, in the same spirit, that we should be careful, that we should seek to humiliate nobody, avoid any confusion and not create rifts, which would be a huge mistake."
"I welcome these responsible words."
"My group hopes that these words will be translated into an outright refusal by the European Union to allow itself to be drawn into wartime thinking, into a trap which would produce more bloodshed and more innocent victims."
"The second challenge that we must face is directly related to what I have just said."
"We must avoid creating a division, but also review and revive the Euro-Mediterranean relationship."
"Now is not the time, in my view, to discuss free-trade zones with our partners of the South-Eastern Mediterranean. We should instead talk about development, political dialogue, how to bring our societies closer and about human dignity."
"And one of the practical commitments to make in line with this strategic choice is primarily to take concerted action to resolve the Middle East conflict fairly."
"I appreciate the efforts made by Mr Solana and all the European Union representatives in the region."
"These efforts are bearing initial fruit but we can all see that this situation is extremely fragile."
"This is therefore the time to make every endeavour to work not against but in partnership with the United States and other actors, particularly in the region."
"I believe that the third challenge we face is that of working on a new approach to international security."
"Does the tragedy of 11 September not illustrate the failure of the way in which the world has been managed since the fall of the Berlin wall?"
"There are so many unresolved conflicts!"
"There are so many powerful but hidden forces at work!"
"There are so many destabilising forces!"
"Pursuing a unilateralist approach is not a response to this deep-rooted evil. We should combat it with genuine cooperation on a global scale which respects the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter."
"Taking military action or clamping down with law and order is not the way to respond. We need an ambitious and multi-faceted policy for crisis prevention."
"Citizens everywhere - in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the United States itself and often in the Member States - expect to see a revision of world governance."
"At the moment, Europe, in particular, is being called upon to do this."
"This is an opportunity to be seized."
"From this perspective, the coming days could be the moment of truth."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that we have already had the opportunity to discuss the root of the problem in the past and that we will have further opportunities to do so in the future."
"In this debate, therefore, I shall not discuss the general philosophy of the course of action to take."
"I would simply like to reiterate a few points, which some of our leaders now seem to have forgotten."
"We must realise that our first problem is identifying our enemy."
"We must not have any illusions - there are Islamic fundamentalists that have decided to carry out attacks against Western democracies."
"We must be aware of this."
"You must also be aware that there are more or less dormant terrorist organisations in all of our countries and they could very easily become active overnight."
"In this respect, I would like to add something to the extremely interesting comments and thoughts of Commissioner Vitorino, and that is I hope the European Union will cease to subsidise the States that harbour or assist terrorists."
"I believe that this is a practical step that we ourselves could take and one that could be taken fairly swiftly."
"My second point is that we very clearly cannot contemplate taking any action worthy of that name, unless there is also sincere political cooperation between States, first and foremost between Member States of the European Union."
"I can remember a time, not so long ago, and I am not sure that this period is behind us, when the 'every man for himself' mentality still prevailed and we accepted the presence of some organisations on our own soil on the condition that no action would be taken, even if this meant action would be carried out in a neighbouring country."
"I therefore feel that we must have true solidarity and it must be clearly expressed."
"My third point is that I believe we must realise that, in order for action combating terrorism to be worthwhile, it must be preventive."
"We must, therefore, enhance the work of the intelligence services."
"I listened very carefully to everything that was said earlier about the need for Europol to be effective."
"I am fully in favour of enhancing Europol' s effectiveness, but this will not enable you to begin fighting against terrorism instantly."
"We need genuine, immediate cooperation between the intelligence and security services, a sincere exchange of information and for States to be able to take the necessary measures, whatever some States might think - and, for the moment, it is the States who are responsible for security as part of their cooperation."
"I shall not elaborate any further."
"That is what I wanted to say this evening and I would stress one thing."
"I have been listening to a philosophical debate on whether the action against the United States is an act of war or an act of terrorism."
"Given the magnitude of these acts, I believe that they are acts of war."
"And if we do not realise that they may well only be the first of many, then we will pay an extremely high price for our blindness."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic events of 11 September do not only implicate the criminal organisation that carried out these dramatic attacks to express its hatred of the West, but they also reveal that there is immense frustration towards US Middle East policy, which dates back as far as 1991."
"The United States has already lost some of its prestige by attacking Iraq for poor strategic reasons, and by failing to secure a victory."
"It is primarily the United States' systematic alignment with the State of Israel' s expansionist policy, and which the Americans had tried to compensate for by supporting extremist Islamic organisations, that has caused a sense of the most profound injustice to spread throughout the Arab countries."
"This means that the policy of colonisation put in place after the Six Day War as well as the unjustified presence of American troops in the region are therefore condemned."
"Unless the State of Israel gives up its racist policy and evacuates the settlements established on the West Bank of Jordan, the Arab world, in response to a legitimate appeal, will rise up and will destabilise the leaders of the Arab peninsula."
"And why is such importance given to the State of Israel, which has excessive military capabilities and only exists because of the will of the United States?"
"It is out of the question for France and Europe to take part in a new crusade against the Arab world, whether this takes the form of military action, extraditions or European arrest warrants."
"France is not a member of NATO and NATO is not concerned by Afghanistan."
"On the contrary, France will find its strategic interests lie in resolutely supporting the Arab world in its fight against racism in the policy pursued by the State of Israel."
"Mr President, it is terrible what happened in New York and Washington."
"We share in the grief and suffering of America."
"The full scale of what exactly has happened is only just hitting home."
"Within the European Union, it will be necessary for us to develop an anti-terrorist policy in harmony with the United States."
"We owe this to the victims and those left behind."
"I would therefore like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the speed with which proposals are now being submitted."
"This fight is not a fight against Islam or its followers."
"It is a fight against those who aim to reach their goals by terror, whatever so-called justification of their actions they try to put forward."
"We must request unequivocally that all states and governments lend their unconditional support to this policy."
"This fight is about the inviolability of human life as the highest value in our democracy."
"I hope we can adopt this line in unison."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to make an effective contribution to the implementation of a global policy to fight international terrorism, as we say we do, the most effective way of doing this is surely to formally appeal to the Council to undertake an immediate examination of all the texts, particularly those which relate to the movement of people, from a security point of view rather than the perspective of the systematic abolition of checks."
"However, this change of approach must apply to the forthcoming provisions and must also be evident through a systematic revision of the texts that have already been adopted, in the light of the need for the security and protection of our people, which is now a priority."
"The Council must carry out this revision as soon as possible so that it can reform, and, if necessary, abolish all the provisions that may be used to establish and develop terrorist networks in our countries, whether they relate, for instance, to Community transit, border controls, family reunification or application for refugee status."
"We cannot disregard the fact that people living on the fringes of the law are entering our countries and then also complain that terrorist networks are prospering on this breeding ground that we ourselves created."
"We will have the opportunity tomorrow to align our actions with our words, since two reports are on the agenda, which contain recommendations that run counter to the requirement for security and for an anti-terrorism fight that we claim to want to prioritise."
"We cannot possibly vote in favour of the Watson report, which has no explanatory statement, that dramatically widens the provisions on implementing the right to asylum, to the point where this essential right is changed beyond recognition and where the option to carry out checks is irresponsibly taken from Member States' authorities."
"However, I would like to praise the courage of the first rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who refused to have his name associated with such excesses."
"In the same way, is this really the right time to adopt the Coelho report, the second paragraph of which calls on the United Kingdom and Ireland to abolish all their border controls as soon as possible?"
"Is this request not somewhat mistimed?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have the chance to be responsible and efficient by appealing to the Council to review our legislation in its entirety, in the light of the need for security."
"Failing that, we can go into tomorrow' s debate trying not to be overly schizophrenic."
"Mr President, as has been pointed out previously, we European citizens have witnessed, in astonishment and live on TV, a crime against humanity, as the president of my group pointed out, and an attempt to destroy our freedom and democracy."
"The first thing we must do is to share in the pain of the American people."
"Please allow me to say that we Spaniards fully understand the suffering of the victims."
"But in the immediate aftermath we must react determinedly in order to defend our freedom and to do justice to the victims, showing the terrorists and their accomplices that their objectives have failed."
"As in other eras of our history, it is essential that we reaffirm our democratic values in order to destroy the totalitarian course which terrorism takes us along."
"The European Parliament has demonstrated its unequivocal commitment to combating terrorism, and the Watson report is a clear example of this."
"But, now in particular, we must continue to put our political weight and impetus behind the concrete initiatives presented to us by the European Commission."
"The President of my Group has presented certain budgetary initiatives aimed at strengthening the role of Europol."
"Let us hope that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - and I appeal to its Chairman - may, for its part, set an agenda allowing it to present to Parliament a proposal this year, which will allow the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies to finish their work in the coming months."
"The European institutions have an inescapable responsibility to speed up procedures in order to provide the justice system with Community instruments which will make their work against terrorism and organised crime more effective."
"The European Commission, and in particular Commissioner Vitorino, must be aware that it can count on the support of Parliament in order to guarantee concerted cooperation and action in tracking down these criminals, because this is the way to put an end to terror."
"Mr President, as has been mentioned, on the 5th this Parliament approved the Watson report, with a series of measures which were essential to dealing with the issue of terrorism."
"As has been mentioned here, a common definition of terrorism for all Member States, a European arrest warrant - which has been called for for some time - and the elimination of extradition seemed to us to be essential issues when Parliament asked for them on the 5th."
"But in that same report Parliament also sent more than one political message to the other Community institutions: it asked for consideration of the fact that certain acts - and I quote - 'are orchestrated and carried out by groups organised at international level' and indicated that there were States behind these actions and that this must be confronted."
"On 5 September, Mr President, this Parliament took the lead in asking the other institutions to adopt a firm attitude towards these issues."
"We already had the commitment that Commissioner Vitorino would react positively."
"On the 11th, Mr President, very soon afterwards, we realised that we had arrived late, dramatically late, and that the problem had exploded, not in the European Union, but in the United States, in an even more spectacular way - not dramatic, since it is always dramatic - than we have experienced here."
"Mr Watson modestly tells us that what he asked for in his report is useful only within the European Union."
"I do not agree."
"I believe that, if we take this series of initiatives, we can make progress on an internal action which, as Mr Poettering said, would be a demonstration of our solidarity with the United States. If we, given the haste which is now required - and haste was already required - make more rapid progress in offering this example of how there can be an operational reaction on a supranational level in the fight against terrorism."
"We will be sending the best indication of solidarity with the United States. We will be offering the best image, the best option for work in this supranational field against organised crime, as the United Nations recently requested in Palermo."
"I hope that in the case of other measures, such as combating money laundering and so many others which are on the table in the Council, we will not wait until we have to act in haste, until there are other dramatic events, in order to implement them."
"I believe that they are all essential to defending the world and, above all, freedom."
"Mr President, when we visited Washington last week with this Parliament' s delegation, and stayed a few days longer than originally planned, not only myself but also our American colleagues became increasingly aware of a common interest."
"I witnessed among the Americans, and certainly in their administration, more restraint than we generally give them credit for over here, or than we can infer from the sometimes unfortunately chosen words of the President."
"Some of our American colleagues quite clearly said that the time for fine words is over. I believe that they are right."
"This is not only true of the relationship we have with them, but also of the action this Parliament intends to take."
"If we want to talk about punishing terrorists, then we have, in fact, already missed the boat."
"I hope that we can also talk about deterrence from time to time."
"This would involve cooperation among police forces, examining magistrates and intelligence services."
"Commissioner, I hope that your proposals will be dealt with as soon as possible, as I am sure they will be."
"Then it will become clear who in this House is for or against cooperation, who truly wants to make headway and who does not."
"President-in-Office of the Council, I hope that at your meetings behind closed doors, it will also be clear to us who is for and against, who wants to carry on and who does not, so that we can draw our own conclusions and make our own judgments."
"We are still in shock at the moment and are still sharing in the grief of our American friends, but who will recall this debate in one or two years' time?"
"I hope that we will still be very much alert and that we will be able to remember what was said here today."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims of the atrocious attacks is the first emotion we expressed - and rightly so. But I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission set to work at full tilt to formulate proposals."
"We now have globalisation of terrorism."
"Everyone is vulnerable. But we can also turn our vulnerable world into a safer world."
"That is the challenge."
"However, it requires multilateral cooperation in a global fight against terrorism."
"This is the positive element that I am trying to glean from the fact that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked: that it is seen as a sign of solidarity."
"I am not in favour of a blank cheque for any old military action which would claim more innocent victims and would create resentment and frustrations. I would rather see an invitation to enter into consultation and dialogue across the oceans, even though there is the risk of it not being seen in that light."
"We should be aware that our people are anxious, that many people fear that we will simply be dragged along by a war machine."
"We should realise that we must explain what our intentions are."
"We must make this vulnerable world safer by providing political solutions to endless conflicts such as that in the Middle East."
"We must bring hope to large parts of the world that have to live in despair."
"Without a fair world order, stability and peace remain a distant dream, and there will always be a breeding ground for terrorism."
"We are delighted with the unanimous will that has been expressed over the past couple of days and that has been echoed by the Council and the Commission on this platform."
"We now look forward to action, rather than words, for as regards providing Europe with the resources to achieve these goals, some of our Member States have in the past persisted in throwing up barriers."
"How long have we been waiting for the cooperation necessary to turn Europol into an effective instrument?"
"This was called for back at Amsterdam."
"According to Mr Vitorino, the extradition of terrorists is the cornerstone of the fight against terrorism."
"But it remains to be seen whether we can all agree."
"The President-in-Office of the Council listed various instruments for the prevention of terrorism, but will we ever succeed in monitoring the flow of capital which feeds terrorism worldwide?"
"Will we ever want to, and be able to, exercise effective control over the arms trade?"
"Or will the economic arguments prevail tomorrow once more over the arguments for security and prevention of terrorism?"
"For terrorism exists, fanaticism exists, injustice exists."
"There are many weapons which terrorists have not yet used but which are at their disposal thanks to our technological society."
"Mr President, there is no cause, not even a just cause, which can justify the killing of innocent civilians."
"Terror does not pave the way for justice: it is the shortest road to hell."
"We condemn and deplore this appalling crime; we utterly condemn those who planned and perpetrated it."
"Our empathy with the suffering victims, with the pain of their families and the pain of the entire American people at difficult times such as this is no less than the expression of our total commitment to preserving the unique nature of the human race."
"These are not my words but some of the things Palestinian intellectuals, politicians and ministers such as Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Mahmoud Darwish have said."
"They are powerful statements, and they give us hope for they come from people who live and suffer under the Israeli military occupation."
"At times like these, we must all - people, States and institutions - act with the utmost responsibility and determination to remove terrorism from the face of the earth and put a stop to the globalisation of poverty, injustice and war for ever."
"'Words must replace arms' as Mr Solana said."
"Therefore, no words must be allowed to provoke hatred or promote the 'dead or alive' cowboy culture: as the women against war say, between killing and death there lies a third way, which is life."
"No one must be exempt from training in love of peace and respect for the law, especially Heads of State."
"Today, a glimmer of hope for the future has come from Palestine and Israel with the announcement of a truce. It is a faint chance, I know, but it is vital that we do not let it go."
"The European Union has contributed to the possibility of dialogue being resumed."
"The Union' s political role must grow and, if and as this role grows, the Union must uphold the law with increasing determination."
"Just as we told Mr Arafat that he must be resolute in controlling terrorism, so we must make it quite clear to Mr Sharon that he cannot continue to get away with seizing Palestinian land, building settlements, killing and besieging Palestinians in villages or, as he did yesterday morning, destroying the Gaza port which is still under construction and funded by the countries of the European Union."
"We must take tangible action, reassuring the Palestinians that they will have a safe State to live in and assuring Israel that nobody is questioning its existence, that it is its colonialist settlement policy, not its existence, which is in question."
"Yesterday, in the Lebanon, I and an Italian delegation met President Lahoud."
"He stated quite clearly that he rejected terrorism, but he stressed emphatically that resolution of the Palestinian issue and development of political and economic cooperation with Europe and the Arab world are essential."
"We must believe in our own ability to bring peace and respect for the law."
"Madam President, in the fight against terrorism, everyone has to understand that there have to be rules in a democracy and that those who violate laws and destroy freedom and security have to be punished."
"In April, Commander Massoud came to the European Parliament seeking support for his opposition to the fundamentalist Taliban regime."
"We welcomed him as a friend, just as we empathised with the victims of the fundamentalist regime in Algeria and the other countries where citizens, politicians and journalists have been massacred, even including Spain."
"Now, Commander Massoud is dead, killed by a suicide terrorist attack just a few hours before other terrorists caused the absurd, appalling, atrocious carnage in the United States."
"Clearly, terrorists and fundamentalists had planned a precise sequence of events, the first step being the elimination of the most powerful opponent to the Taliban regime."
"If we genuinely want to combat and eradicate terrorism and its bases, its economic power and its message of hatred of democracy and freedom, we must give our full support to the Northern Alliance now: what we denied Commander Massoud when he was alive we owe to him now he is dead."
"We owe it to the men and women who are fighting for freedom."
"We owe it to all those who are combating terrorism and fundamentalism in the world."
"We also call upon the European Union to think again about whether it needs to establish effective border controls, even suspending Schengen temporarily, and, in any case, as President Pasqua has already said, to stop giving aid to those countries which harbour, fund and protect terrorist and criminal organisations. We call for regulation of the use of the Internet, for rules to be established at last, for, as we know, the lack of rules governing the use of the Internet make it easy for terrorism to gain support and operate at international level."
"Lastly, Mr President, we call upon the European Union to have the courage to hold a Euro-Mediterranean Conference to discuss our commitment to peace, where we can work together and defeat those continuing to sow hatred and violence."
"Mr President, I too feel that our response to large-scale attacks must not take the form of a crusade against Islam, but certain things need to be said."
"I would point out, in any case, that one of the organisations with which Osama bin Laden is linked is called the 'International Front for Fighting Jews and Crusades' ."
"I would also point out that part of the influx of billions of dollars of funding dispensed every year to Muslim charities and aid organisations is ultimately used to finance fundamentalist terrorism."
"In addition to this, the profits from banks, Islamic businesses and financial institutions, located in tax havens, which are now, at last, regulated and identified on the international market as well, help to support the international Jihad terrorist force."
"Here in Europe, there are Islamic centres and mosques which have been providing hospitality, screens and even false passports for fundamentalists connected to terrorist groups for years and continue to do so today. There is documented evidence of this."
"Such complicity is a fact and I certainly do not think we can take a few general statements disassociating their authors from Osamar bin Laden as evidence of the conversion to peace and respect for human rights of these wings of the international Jihad force present in Europe."
"I support Mrs Garaud' s call to realism this morning at the Conference of Presidents, when she called for a responsible international policy ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, according to a Chinese proverb, when a wise man points at the moon, the fool looks at his finger."
"The European Union would be well advised to give some thought as to the meaning of this proverb because it is very difficult to actually see the relation between today' s debate and the unprecedented attacks on the United States, which took place on 11 September 2001."
"Was the United States saved because of its police force or federal intelligence system?"
"It has one, of course."
"The United States is the most powerful country in the world and this patently did not enable it to predict or prevent the events of Tuesday 11 September and we really cannot see what Europol can do in this matter, other than to strengthen the European Union, which once again is undoubtedly showing that its sole concern is its own power, that it has absolutely no interest whatsoever in the root causes of the problems and that it is only concerned by its return to a position of power."
"If we - who claim to represent all the people of Europe - had to consider one subject, then it should be our failure to take responsibility and that we are responsible for leaving the United States alone to face the rest of the entire world, when our nations have over 1 000 years of diplomatic, historic and military experience..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, first of all I would like to emphasise the deep sympathy we feel for the victims of last week's attack."
"Right now, before any military action takes place, we are already witnessing a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting many thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan."
"The United States has announced that it will lift restrictions on intelligence agencies and give them a free hand to recruit criminals."
"I quote Vice President Cheney: ""To be able to penetrate these terrorist organisations, you need to have on the payroll some very unsavoury characters."""
"When President Bush declared war - and in fact this is a case of the rich versus the poor, which is the underlying struggle here - he said the war must be won with the tools of action."
"The tools used should be the tools of justice, that is, not by suspending the rule of law or suppressing liberties, but on the contrary, by maintaining them."
"Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner Vitorino, honourable Members of this House, if we fight the wrong war, we will lose."
"Mr President, we will never forget the attacks against the United States, which we utterly condemn."
"We share the grief of the civilian victims and their families and we share the values of our great ally - democracy and individual freedom."
"Terrorism creates a state of mind."
"It provokes outrage and reaction, so we must be united, we must be determined and we must be vigilant."
"However, in addition to our united political reaction, we must adjust the European Union's diplomatic standpoint."
"In the context of the current budget process, we must reassess the EU's vast aid programme, in particular, if states were involved in that terrorism in any way."
"The EU is perceived as pro-Arab."
"I regret this."
"We should be pro-democracy."
"War has been declared and we should unequivocally stand by our American allies."
"My party and group are committed to giving our full support, in particular to the British Government, its partners in the European Union and to our NATO allies."
"The scale and nature of the outrage we witnessed in the United States last week gives us a warning of what else the new millennium might bring, so we must look pragmatically at what we need to do together."
"We should learn from each other as much as possible about how to deal with the security of our people and how best to reduce the tensions which lead to political violence and terrorism."
"As far as possible, our electors should be allowed to get on with their lives, but we as politicians cannot rest while terrorism lives."
"Mr President, I was in Washington last week leading the European Parliament delegation responsible for our relations with the United States Congress and we started our pre-Commission briefing at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 September 2001, just after the first plane had hit one of the towers and just before the second."
"Needless to say, our briefing did not go on for very long and we, like so many in the United States, were soon sitting in front of television sets, shocked and silent."
"That was the mood in America in Tuesday."
"By Wednesday, people were angry and frightened, understandably, and so were we."
"Later there was much more thoughtfulness and a more considered response."
"The many messages from the European Union, and indeed from the European Parliament, plus the many personal messages of support and solidarity, were very much appreciated."
"We were able to fulfil part of our delegation duties, we met members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Congress and had some very useful, although very sad discussions with them."
"The question they put to us was: How will Europe help us?"
"Will Europe support us?"
"That was really most difficult."
"It would have been premature and inappropriate for a partial delegation to respond."
"Of course, we did not know how we should respond."
"I made a statement to Congress on behalf of the delegation which was lodged in the Congressional Records and I hope with your permission it can be lodged in our own Parliament records as well."
"This statement stressed, apart, of course, from the natural sympathy that we wanted to express, that this had to be tackled by the United States of America and the European Union and many other countries in partnership."
"It is becoming ever clearer that the response must be measured and proportionate, and the consequences for all must be anticipated and planned."
"There is a clear need for major diplomatic and political initiatives to maintain cooperation with those countries nearest to any possible targets or military action and those at most risk from the consequences."
"We may be facing terrible times ahead but it is essential that we have the courage as well as the compassion to consider carefully the alternatives."
"I would like to express my thanks to the many here, including the President, who expressed their concerns for our safety and well-being and particularly to my fellow MEPs, including Mr Belder, Mrs Peijs, my two vice-chairman, the other MEPs, the Parliament staff, Council and Commission staff interpreters and particularly the Commission staff in Washington."
"They were endlessly kind in what was a most difficult week."
"Mr President, the attacks in America remind me most of the attack on the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo in June 1914, when a terrorist, who appeared from nowhere, struck at the heart of the Habsburg Empire, a superpower deemed invincible."
"That fatal incident elicited an overreaction, which led to the First World War."
"It is of the utmost importance to combat international terrorism."
"It is equally important for this to be done collectively, forcefully and - I emphasise - with well-considered restraint."
"The European Union itself must also set to work."
"Commissioner, thank you, you are not the problem, neither is this Parliament."
"I would address my former colleague, the Minister of the Belgian Presidency."
"Tampere was two years ago."
"I would urge the Belgian Presidency to abolish the right of veto in the Third Pillar. If not, we will remain bogged down and unable to tackle terrorism effectively."
"Mr President, I was part of the delegation which visited Washington last week."
"I saw the dismay, horror and despair caused by the attack, and I shared and felt this sorrow and despair."
"I still feel strongly for the families of those still missing."
"After listening to the debate here, I have put away the script for the speech I had prepared."
"Instead, I would like to talk about something which has come to me while I have been listening to this discussion."
"I am deeply concerned both about what has happened and about the reaction caused by the events in the US and in Europe."
"I am convinced that, at the same time as we ourselves feel the horror of this event, there are millions upon millions of people out there in the world who have actually rejoiced in this act of terrorism."
"I believe that many poor people in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world have rejoiced."
"We have read about young people in Palestine celebrating this act of violence."
"I do not believe they were alone in this, but that there are millions and millions of people out there in the world who have reacted in this way."
"This fills me with incredible horror and fear, as it means that we are facing a world in which there are millions of potential terrorists and perpetrators of similar outrages."
"We must begin to ask ourselves whether we are now witnessing a sort of social warfare."
"Does this bear any relation to colonial uprisings?"
"From my childhood, I remember the Mau Mau uprising, which was described as a terrorist insurrection."
"We all remember the Vietnam War, for example."
"Is it a social war which, in one way or another, lies behind recent events or which is being declared through them?"
"In that case, ideas about mass bombings in the Middle East or about preposterous police checks on a huge scale are meaningless."
"Our only chance, in that case, is a huge policy of transformation and redistribution, a policy which removes the desperation and despair in the world which feed and create terrorism."
"Otherwise, we shall never be safe, despite carpet-bombing and despite all the security services in the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America and the free world have been taken by surprise by the absolutely barbaric wave of attacks that has destroyed the lives of thousands of men, women and children from more than 60 countries, murdered in appalling circumstances of horror and brutality."
"Once again, therefore, our first words must be, like those of so many other speakers, words of solidarity and condolence, and we must turn our thoughts to all these lives cut short and to the suffering of their families."
"Such attacks completely exceed all the bounds of the imaginable and confirm the fears that the fanaticism of terrorist groups will neither give way nor weaken in the face of any considerations of compassion, which makes us fear for the worst for the future if not enough is done to combat or eradicate such fanaticism."
"The last thing we want to see is a new rift between East and West."
"We can quite easily distinguish those who freely and peacefully practice the Islamic faith from those who, quite intolerably, take a medieval concept of holy war as the inspiration for attacking citizens, communities and states across the world who simply wish to live in peace."
"We must, therefore, respond vigorously to those who are responsible for these appalling acts, which are genuine acts of war against the free world; not only to those who were directly involved in carrying out the acts but also to those who have given shelter to, protected, funded or encouraged these people."
"In this context, the European Union has enormous responsibilities as a community that acts as a trustee of the universal values of life, freedom, peace and security."
"Apart from stimulating relationships of trust, cooperation and cultural dialogue with all Islamic communities and citizens that share these universal values, in an attempt to involve them in an active commitment against terrorism and the threat that this represents, the European Union and its Member States must establish, between themselves and internationally, new and more effective forms of cooperation in the field of gathering and processing information by police forces, in harmonising judicial and legal systems and finally, in the field of common security and defence, which will help to guard against and allow the harsh punishment of anyone who encourages this new form of world threat or their agents."
"We wish to express our expectation and, I would say, our hope, that today' s debate and the conclusions of next Friday' s European Council will be a decisive step forwards in the long and difficult fight against international terrorism. This is a fight that we must see, now and for as long as the threat lasts, as our utmost priority for European, Atlantic and world-wide security."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to a great many sound proposals and seen that there is some convergence too."
"However, I have to say that, as long as the European banks accept terrorists' deposits and increase their capital, we are not combating terrorism; as long as arms are sold to different countries (according to geopolitical interests) which accept the role of the askaris of one or other power in turn, we are not combating terrorism."
"Madam President, I believe that, for as long as we talk about 'war' on a daily basis, peace will not be possible."
"The whole world is afraid because of the vehement statements - and I understand the emotions and the political situation - of the American President, whose reasons of State we acknowledge and for whom we express all our support and sympathy."
"However, we hope that the word 'war' will be targeted against very specific fringe members of the Arab world, for the Arab world as a whole does not deserve to be treated as criminal because of the criminal actions of a tiny, criminal minority of delinquents who are stateless because of their own intentional, senseless, barbaric lunacy."
"Mr President, on behalf of my party, may I offer my deepest condolences to the people of the United States."
"With our very special relationship and with hundreds of British still missing, we too share their desperate feeling of loss."
"My first observation must be to my own Prime Minister, who of course was instrumental in the release of over 400 convicted terrorists."
"We must fight terrorism in all its forms and we must say 'No' to any more appeasement."
"I would also like to urge the Council and Commission not to use this opportunity to further the project of European integration."
"The peoples of Europe will not forgive politicians putting their self-interest above the security of the people."
"However dark and uncertain the future may be, we must stand firm behind the USA as that noble country did for us in our darkest hour."
"Our commitment to the defeat of terrorism must be no less than theirs."
"Mr President, this terrorist attack in the USA affects us all, unfortunately, and not only because there are probably hundreds of Europeans among its victims."
"Thirty Austrians alone are missing to date."
"Europeans should be seen unreservedly offering solidarity and cooperation in response to this terrorist attack, and the European partners should refrain from imposing conditions."
"The EU Member States, Spain and France, have, without doubt, set a standard here, both sending politicians to the USA at a very early stage."
"I wish to appeal to the Austrian political parties to lay their so-called neutrality completely aside, as there can be no neutrality between terrorists and innocent victims."
"Just as important, in this international joint endeavour, as the working relationship of the democratic countries with each other will be their cooperation with moderate Arab States and with those with Moslem majority populations."
"The most important foundation for a successful counterstrike this time will be effective international solidarity."
"And as for those who offer us their pacifist fantasies and words of wisdom about military restraint, I should like to invite them to New York, so they can visit the school my children go to and talk to the children who have lost their fathers or mothers or, indeed, both parents in this attack."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity in speech must now give way to solidarity in action."
"In Germany, the Christian Democratic parties - the CDU and CSU - feel, in any case, that we have obligations towards the Americans in our joint resistance to terrorism, too."
"American action was decisive in the reconstruction of our country and the recovery of our unity."
"So we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism."
"Mr Vitorino's proposals are a first step on this road, and the right one."
"They are not, however, short-term measures."
"They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest."
"Right and proper as they are, we can and must do more."
"We can, for example, make Europol better equipped than it is at present."
"Europol urgently needs an agreement with the USA, within the framework of laws currently in force, on the exchange of data in the fight against terrorism."
"Such arrangements have previously foundered on our making our data protection provisions into the measure of all things."
"Our protection of data has therefore been of more use to the terrorists than it has to their victims."
"We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational."
"We must at once put in place whatever joint action teams are available."
"Wherever terrorists are being investigated, Europol must be on the spot and promoting the immediate exchange of data between the investigators and those working in Europol headquarters."
"These opportunities already exist, and we must seize them."
"It can be done within the framework of the laws in force and does not require us to wait for the incorporation of directives into national law."
"Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no excuse for any terrorist act."
"Terrorism is, above all, contempt for life, contempt for the life of innocent citizens, sometimes even contempt for one' s own life."
"If all citizens have a duty to stand in the way of terrorism, it is not sufficient merely to arrest and pass judgment on the perpetrators and organisers of terrorist acts."
"More than anything, we need to improve the conditions which give rise to terrorism: poverty, underdevelopment and ignorance are fertile ground for all kinds of fundamentalism."
"It is a paradox that any unforeseeable event can easily be explained after it has happened, but it is not sufficient just to explain the world, we have to change it."
"The world economy is in bad shape. After the attack on the United States, it risks getting even worse, particularly if there is prolonged military action."
"Europe, in order to be able to help others, should tackle its own economic problems."
"We should welcome the cut in interest rates, and it is also true that the ECB could have better prepared the markets."
"These measures would have prevented many stock market crashes."
"If there is no balanced growth in the long term, no stabilisation of public deficit, such a shock from the exterior that is unforeseen and unforeseeable should lead Europe to bring automatic stabilisers into play for all EU countries."
"This is not economic laxity but good economic sense."
"This good economic sense is demonstrated to us by our American friends."
"They have just decided on a substantial aid package for their civil aviation."
"Does this mean that Europe will now complain to the WTO about this distortion of competition?"
"Or will she also establish a policy to support those economic sectors weakened by this terrible shock?"
"Luckily, we have the euro."
"Without the common currency there would have been turmoil on international money markets, pushing certain currencies such as the Deutschmark to the top and others seen as weaker to the bottom, with the breakdown of the internal market into the bargain."
"There is not only Europe, however."
"There are poor countries that have a greater risk of suffering from any economic turnaround in a recession that is still a possibility."
"Our main priority should be to aim for the true integration of all countries into world trade."
"Globalisation, often discredited, only in fact affects a severely limited number of countries."
"Four fifths of world trade takes place between thirty or so countries."
"There will be no development without trade."
"Any economy, in order to be able to export, should create endogenous growth, itself creating greater equity within a country."
"In order to permit this endogenous development in poor countries, the problem of third world debt needs to be resolved as soon as possible."
"It is only by eradicating poverty and ignorance that we will definitively defeat terrorism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international terrorism is threatening to multiply its actions and the brutality of the techniques it employs too - the atrocities in the United States were evidence of this, I am sad to say - while other serious threats such as chemical or nuclear weapons are still present."
"Coherent, common European reactions of defence and response are vital, and the Council and Commission statements have set us off in the right direction."
"However, there is still a complex issue to be resolved in international legal systems or, if you prefer, international law: the attitude to be taken by institutions such as the European Union or even the United Nations to States which tolerate and collaborate with terrorist groups."
"There can be no allowances or half-measures such as have hitherto been conceded in these matters."
"In any case, nothing will ever be the same and Friday' s extraordinary Summit will certainly be able to address this issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe and the European Parliament are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States at this dark time in human history, which is certainly the darkest moment since the end of the Second World War."
"We are standing by the United States not least because the victims of the various attacks include a large number of Europeans, many of them Italians."
"It was not just the symbols of the economic and collective freedom of the West that were the targets on 11 September: we have all been affected."
"Europe must take the lead in the new political phase which has opened after the recent tragic events."
"Starting with Parliament, our institutions must play a prominent role in the coming weeks and months."
"Together with all the countries of the world, the Union will be summoned to the front line, and the decisions we are called upon to make will have to focus on certain major questions including, most importantly, identifying those responsible."
"This is vital if the United States and the allies who decide to support it are to be able to react against terrorism in the way that they must, but the aim of the action taken must be to strike those responsible for the atrocities in New York and Washington."
"If we are to win this war against terrorism, Commissioner, we need a thorough reinvigoration of the secret services sector."
"In order to do this, in addition to enhancing Europol, which we advocate, it appears increasingly necessary to create a sort of supranational intelligence service."
"This was discussed at the Summit between the Italian and British prime ministers, a project seeking to create an organisation which can expose and help combat terrorism in all its tentacular ramifications."
"The strategy and international action taken must, of necessity, include all the Arab countries."
"It must be clear that the battle currently being played out is not between the West and Islam: it is between the whole world and the lunacy of terrorism."
"That is why we attach great importance to Russia and China' s declarations and see the positions of Yasser Arafat and the Israeli government in taking certain decisions which facilitate encouraging steps towards peace in the Middle East as positive."
"A military and intelligence response must, in any case, be accompanied by an incisive Union policy in the areas where there is worst crisis: an action intended to extinguish the flames of desperation and intolerance."
"The possibility of financial speculation initiated by terrorists on stock markets throughout the world and the crisis experienced by many airlines which will lead to thousands of job cuts demand a raft of measures from the international community to protect the economy as well."
"Mr President, Europe and all its institutions are called to undergo a great test."
"However, we are all convinced that people will decide en masse for what is right and the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance which we all now uphold will ultimately prevail; we are sure that the European Parliament, the institution which represents the people of Europe, will, from Friday onwards, certainly do its part."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the whole of the European Union stands together with the people of the United States in utterly and totally condemning those who carried out those terrible atrocities in the United States and in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families who lost their loved ones in these terrible atrocities."
"The European Union and all democratic societies in the world should join together with the United States in seeking to bring to justice those guilty of those atrocities and in doing so, ensure that they target the actual terrorist organisations and their members, not the communities in which they live with the danger of innocent people suffering."
"Generally, terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing."
"The European Union can play a major role in solving conflict resolution in the different parts of the world by sending to those areas of conflict not an army but a philosophy of peace based on firm principles."
"It is often forgotten, that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution."
"Who could have forecast 60 years ago where we all are now?"
"Who would have forecast all this in 1941, with the second world war raging and millions being slaughtered."
"If our parents and grandparents had said ""Don't worry, your grandchildren will be sitting together in a parliament of a United Europe"", nobody would have believed them."
"But it has happened, and how and why it happened is crucial."
"For that reason the European Union, rather than having an army, should set up a Commission department of peace and reconciliation with a Commissioner of peace and reconciliation to spread this philosophy."
"Firstly, in all areas of conflict you have divided peoples."
"Violence has no role to play in healing the divisions."
"Dialogue is the first step."
"Secondly there is the principle of respect for difference because all conflict is about difference, whether of religion, nationality or race."
"Thirdly, you need to create institutions which respect those differences, and the fourth element is working together in the common interest."
"Those are the principles at the heart of the European Union that solved the worst conflicts in the history of the world and are the principles that should be at the heart of conflict resolution in any area of conflict."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has up to this moment been more vulnerable in every respect than the USA, and will remain so for as long as cooperation between Member States in both the legal and operational aspects of counter-terrorism is not optimised."
"Admittedly, we have Europol as an institution whose remit covers terrorism among other things, but Europol is powerless if not all Member States comply with the Convention, supply in due time comprehensive information for the analyses required and subsequently make aid available to their fellow Member States."
"Europol is toothless if it has insufficient personnel at its disposal, and at present a mere 12 Europol staff are pursuing inquiries into terrorism in Europe."
"Europol is also toothless if the technology it needs is not made available to it."
"A package of measures is therefore urgently required, and quickly."
"I therefore want the Member States to be exhorted to adhere strictly to the Europol Convention, in particular Article 4, and a mechanism to be introduced to compel the Member States to supply this information."
"Secondly, we must provide a budget sufficient to equip a centre of operations with an appropriate number of analysts to engage in investigations into terrorism."
"Counter-terrorism demands, thirdly, that we set up joint investigatory teams within the framework of collaboration between Europol analysts and representatives of the Member States."
"We welcome the accelerated initiative of Mr Vitorino's two framework decisions as a new and urgently needed legal basis with which to effectively combat terrorism."
"Europe, above all others, has demands made of it."
"Europe is called, now, to be more than decisive in taking a stand in the face of terrorism and taking action to counter it."
"Such is the demand of the moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the attack of 11 September on the WTC and the Pentagon strikes at the very heart of our democracy."
"The key aim of the new terrorism is to instil fear into us, to throw our world off balance and at the same time to exploit the helplessness of others in simple black-and-white terms."
"In a nutshell, this is an attack on our world, the whole world, and on our international rule of law, and this is precisely what I should like to uphold."
"Terrorism has become global and also employs, therefore, global, modern technology and international, criminal structures."
"That is why it requires a worldwide response."
"For example, a higher level of cooperation among our secret services and the infiltration of terrorist networks spring to mind."
"We can no longer afford to work at cross purposes as separate states."
"Instead, we must take joint action and in this new coalition of action, we must go beyond usual concepts."
"International financial consortia and multinational businesses too must cooperate."
"The production of drugs and oil in regions of conflict and the trade in 'blood diamonds' facilitate the financing of illegal activities, of conflict and of war, and are in turn closely linked with the terrorist networks."
"We must discontinue the funding of, or cooperation in, the trade in raw materials, where this feeds conflicts and where it provides a breeding ground for terrorism."
"In this way, we can immobilise the funding of terrorist networks extremely effectively."
"This new war also requires a continued effort in the exchange of economic and criminal intelligence, even if this means that for reasons of security, some public services become more expensive or slow down."
"Our desire to live in an open democracy that is accessible to everyone makes us vulnerable."
"But our strength lies in cooperation."
"This applies overall, irrespective of race, religion or nationality."
"We can see through every terrorist attempt to divide the world into their world and ours, to antagonise groups or religions."
"Terrorists are not nourished by religion or ideology."
"Their hunger is called power."
"Their weapons are fear and destruction."
"They do not want peace in the Basque Country, Liberia or the Middle East."
"They simply want civilian victims."
"That is why we are on the side of America and of every peace-loving individual who wishes to support this international order."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we can see that the response to this terrorist act is being prepared, and I believe it is being done with great care."
"The United States is dealing with this business calmly and attempting to solve the problem in a multilateral context, including cooperation with NATO."
"This indicates that all is being done with calm deliberation."
"I believe that, for this reason, we must also make it clear that there is no reason for us to evade our responsibilities and obligations, not simply because of our gratitude and not only in order to guarantee the future of transatlantic relations, but because it is in our most fundamental best interests."
"Terrorism is taking on the dimensions of a war and resulting in destruction the like of which we knew only in wartime; it is this terrorism that is in a position to strike in the same way at Brussels today, London tomorrow and Madrid the day after tomorrow!"
"The combatants are already in our midst, and so nobody can steal away."
"Nobody, I believe, should look for an alibi, a reason not to join in when the action really does start; and, when it does, it will involve the taking of steps which we must develop on the basis of a new definition of security policy: military action involving the application of all foreign policy instruments, for example the prevention of alliances in favour of the other side, and in conjunction with internal security, about which Mr Vitorino and many in this House have already spoken."
"On this last point, it must be clear that cross-border measures can be put in place against cross-border terrorism and that the best national legislation and the best national police can do nothing without cooperation in this sphere."
"Let me finally say just one thing: nothing justifies terrorism, but we must still make it our concern to remove the root causes of support for it."
"We must, therefore, play our part in removing the breeding-grounds for terrorism in the Middle East and in many other regions"
"Mr President, the terrorist attacks of 11 September have meant that our debate on the need for Community action to combat terrorism is now extremely topical."
"We are still overwhelmed by the horrendous pictures, the horrendous truth and their grave consequences now and, we imagine and fear, for the future."
"Quite apart from the effect on the economy or on world political relations, however, thousands of people have died, thousands have lost their parents, children, spouses, friends and loved ones."
"I would like to dedicate my first words to those people who are suffering, to the victims: they, the victims, must be present in our future deliberations and decisions."
"Because we owe a debt to all of them."
"We will have to act so that justice is done and in order to prevent, through action or omission, more innocent victims."
"We know that something has to be done, that there has to be a response, a just, democratic, proportionate response, but a response nevertheless, because terrorists cannot be allowed to have, or believe they have, impunity and because we are obliged to assure the citizens that, living under the rule of law, we have the necessary instruments to defend their life, freedom and security."
"I cannot and will not ignore the fact that I am Basque."
"I would rather have not had this experience in this field, I would do anything not to have had it, but I have."
"I know that international cooperation is the right approach, that the initiatives presented today by Commissioner Vitorino are the right approach: political cooperation, judicial cooperation, police cooperation."
"Joint responsibility in dealing with terrorism is our main, most effective, political response."
"Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism - as has already been said - has no borders, no homeland, no religion and no ideology."
"It has a common objective and method."
"They have never wanted peace."
"They have always sought to destroy us, to destroy democracy."
"I therefore say to them that what the Commission has decided today, what has been approved today, is historic."
"Allow me to describe it as such."
"The necessary step has been taken to move on from solidarity, which is necessary but insufficient, to common action by all."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, and thank you to all of you for this decision."
"Mr President, immensely rich élites, members and accomplices of which have enjoyed university training, are attacking our financial, economic and security institutions."
"This horrific tragedy requires a response."
"The citizen asks the government to take action."
"In terms of external policy, the European Union is able to do this because we increasingly speak with one voice."
"The value of our input in the eradication of breeding grounds for terror has increased by leaps and bounds, as will be seen, I hope, in the near future."
"As regards internal policy, we still cannot manage to speak with one voice."
"Basically, the 'every man for himself' mentality still prevails."
"Fortunately, the Commission has realised that this is not acceptable."
"Mr Vitorino, I would like to commend you on the fact that you, and the Commission, have realised that speaking with one voice on behalf of the European Union is absolutely necessary."
"Within the space of one week, you produced a detailed plan with proposals which are both practical and also truly necessary."
"This will be rewarded in the form of the citizen' s trust."
"I hope that none of the Member States will dare to distance themselves from this critical plan, inviting the outrage of its own citizens in doing so."
"Needless to say, justice is important in this context, for we are dealing with a crime here, with whatever fine motives it is presented. This is also evident in Northern Ireland where agreements contain terms which are used incorrectly and which are an insult to anyone who takes their religion seriously."
"We have reason to be pleased with the Watson report which provides an initial impulse to the Parliament' s endeavours and may be supplemented with propositions concerning the preparation of crimes which are committed elsewhere, that is, outside the European Union."
"We trust that the Commissioner will not accept draft framework decisions which contain weak formulae such as we now see from time to time and which have absolutely no meaning whatsoever."
"The real added value must lie in the fact that it becomes clear to the citizens that the European Union, as such, takes charge where guaranteeing internal security is concerned."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we must also draw conclusions as regards civil aviation."
"We need to take steps to prevent similar terrorist attacks again taking place in or from the air."
"In the immediate future we need increased security for air travellers, preferably at international level."
"Let us each, though, start with our airports at home."
"We need stricter checks on luggage and hand luggage."
"We need tighter checks on airport workers."
"Above all, it will not be enough for controls at airports to be more stringent today and tomorrow if, in six months' time, they have been relaxed again in certain parts of Europe."
"No, we need strict controls on a permanent basis."
"Looking at specific cases, there is probably a need for armed flight attendants on certain routes, and we must consider the need to secure the cockpit against terrorist attacks, for we must prevent aircraft becoming the biggest weapons in the world."
"Although the safety of passengers is our primary concern, our secondary concern is that, at present, the number of passengers carried by airlines is showing a massive decrease."
"We must keep an eye on this situation."
"Is the number of passengers falling as a consequence of the terrorist attacks, or because of market conditions or structural factors?"
"As we read in today's newspapers, certain governments are demanding subsidies and yet more subsidies, but these cannot be the solution."
"My group rejects subsidies for airlines."
"We must give thought to how we can help them."
"We can do this by coming to an agreement on code sharing and by permitting the restructuring of the companies, along with mergers and acquisitions."
"This would be a more elegant solution, keeping them competitive, but we must not pay out subsidies indiscriminately"
"The situation can, of course, change."
"If the USA supports its airlines to the tune of massive amounts, then we will have to see what effect that has on the transatlantic market."
"Under such circumstances, we will not be able simply to leave our airlines on the outside looking in, but let us be clear-sighted about this. First of all, however, we need increased security for passengers."
"Mr President, on Tuesday we awoke in astonishment to a manifestation of a new form of totalitarianism."
"The Nazism of the past, the Stalinism of yesterday and the Islamic fundamentalism of today all had and have in common a most profound contempt for human beings, who they intend to subject to their plans for world domination."
"On 11 September, it was not only the freedom but also the dignity of the human being that was attacked in New York and Washington."
"Those who financed this monstrous attack deliberately sacrificed the lives of their own people with the sole objective of killing the largest number of innocent victims possible, in order to put terror firmly into their opponents' minds and to rekindle the flame of their supporters' fanaticism."
"The resolve shown throughout the world proves that they did not succeed in their main objective, but the subsequent celebrations that took place in various locations show that the second objective could well have been achieved."
"Faced with this menace, we will naturally be obliged to review our common defence policy, but we should also be working toward the implementation of a new world order that allows Europe, in particular, to be increasingly engaged in the resolution of regional conflicts which, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and in Africa, do nothing to stem the flow of blood around the world."
"In order to combat fundamentalist terrorism, we should mainly focus our efforts on increased assistance to all supporters of moderate and tolerant Islam, whether they be in power or in opposition."
"In Afghanistan, for example, we had no idea of how to respond to the urgent request from Commander Massoud to destroy the hornets' nest that had developed in his country."
"We should support his partisans in the Northern Alliance, the sole representatives of the recognised government in Afghanistan, and help them in any way we can to overthrow the barbarous Taliban regime."
"To combat fundamentalist terrorism we need to completely restructure our own defence mechanisms."
"Europe does not have the means."
"The American Congress and Senate have just allocated USD 40 billion to the President of the United States."
"What amount of money, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do you have today to demonstrate, other than through fine words, our desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the American people in this fight that has been forced upon us?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today everything has changed."
"I hope that in the adoption of our 2002 draft budget at second reading we will know how to draw the right conclusions."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, I represent a country which has a unique and close historical relationship with the United States."
"We very much appreciated the support we received from that country in eliminating violence on our own island."
"What happened in New York and Washington is not new."
"Attacks on economic, political and security targets resulting in major civilian casualties have been the hallmark of international terrorism."
"They have been experienced in Ireland, Britain, Spain and other European countries: that is why we share and understand the pain of those who have suffered."
"We in Ireland hope that this atrocity will precipitate a change in the way representatives of organisations responsible for similar atrocities in Ireland are treated as celebrities in parts of the United States."
"Hopefully, it will also undermine their fund-raising capabilities, particularly when their paramilitary wing still retains the weapons of terrorism and mass destruction and fraternises with other terrorist leaders."
"The major issue facing democratic leaders is how to respond to this latest atrocity."
"When I listen to the language currently being used by President George W. Bush, I must say I am somewhat apprehensive."
"To talk about catching 'dead or alive' may well be the language of cowboy movies, but it is not the language that should be used by a world leader at any time, and certainly not during times of crises."
"The revulsion that followed last week's events, provides the impetus to unite everyone in support of democratic ideals in the fight against international terrorism."
"Handled wrongly however, it could plunge the western world into a conflict with the Islamic world with catastrophic consequences for everyone."
"Therefore the response must be well thought out and proportionate."
"It must not result in unnecessary civilian casualties creating another generation of terrorists."
"We have a unique opportunity to rid the world of the evil of terrorism and underpin democracy."
"Future generations will not forgive us if we squander that opportunity."
"Mr President, in the United Kingdom we have unity of purpose at this tragic time."
"We are reassured by the solidarity with the United States expressed by political leaders right across Europe."
"Previously, the enthusiasm of so many European politicians for European integration has been fuelled by anti-Americanism."
"There must be no more of this."
"Seldom has the need for Euro/Atlantic unity been more vital."
"I trust that European Union leaders will make sure that there is no backsliding by any European governments when the going starts to get rough."
"In previous crises, the resolve of some has quickly crumbled."
"It would be singularly inappropriate to use this crisis to promote and accelerate the integrationist agenda of the Union, in particular the essentially separatist elements of European defence policy."
"Our motive must be serious action against terrorism, not just seizing an opportunity to extend EU competencies."
"On the internal front, I hope that the proposed European Union common definition of terrorist crime and associated legislation will be sufficiently robust to allow effective action at last to be taken against large numbers of terrorist front organisations throughout Europe."
"I have to say, I doubt it."
"The problem is that too many terrorists have their apologists and masquerade in other guises."
"Ways need to be found to prevent terrorist support groups from carrying out what are still regarded as legal acts in our countries, such as recruiting, indoctrinating, broadcasting and fund-raising in order to sustain illegal acts elsewhere."
"Specifically, it is time for the seven European Union countries which have not yet done so, including the Belgian Presidency, to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the suppression of terrorist financing, so that the black money networks which sustain terrorist organisations can be closed down."
"Democratic society needs to protect itself and be able to deal with real dangers."
"In recent years, it has been progressively disarmed."
"Mr President, I firmly condemn terrorist acts. Terrorism is abhorrent, whatever adjectives you use to describe it and whatever ideological label you attach to it."
"I too feel that we must establish very close cooperation with the United States and form an extensive world-wide alliance of all the countries that wish to be part of it to combat terrorism."
"The world-wide anti-terrorism alliance must certainly address military issues to ensure safety, but it must also address all the possible forms of terrorism which exist, which range from financial to banking terrorism, and from economic, food contamination and environmental terrorism to electronic terrorism and terrorism in the form of computer hacking."
"The debate between the European Parliament, the OSCE and the WEU, which met at the assembly of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, focused largely, on the one hand, on the need to speed up the process of democratising those countries and, on the other, on the upholding of human rights."
"These are the two fundamental pillars for eradicating poverty and underdevelopment through the rational use of economic resources."
"Henceforth, the European Union must stipulate the upholding of human rights and the implementation of democracy as firm conditions in all its external relations."
"This stipulation is fixed and unconditional because it guarantees the protection of the dignity of every citizen in the world."
"The European Union must encourage respect for every religious faith and, at the same time, it must require all faiths to condemn and abhor terrorist acts, to make a clear distinction between civil society, which is free to practise any religion, and terrorism, which cannot claim to have any religious justification."
"I support the idea of convening a Mediterranean Forum condemning terrorism, supporting the Middle East Peace Process and reinvigorating the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"Finally, Europol and Eurojust must, together, become effective European tools, concentrating on enhancing the European corpus juris and thereby creating a basic legal reference framework which will serve as the basis for European civil, penal and administrative law."
"Mr President, I share and express my sympathy for the United States and for the other victims of this terrible incident."
"As a former Northern Ireland minister, I have been a terrorist target and I have faced the TV cameras surrounded by the wreckage of a terrorist incident."
"I know, therefore, how important it is to get both the response right and also to protect the general public as far as is possible in a democracy."
"Like my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, I am chiefly concerned about aviation and the mostly ordinary people who rely on it."
"As a member of the Committee on Transport, I have written to the chairman of that committee asking for early consideration of the implications for this important industry."
"First of all, security at airports and on aircraft; secondly, the control of congested airspace in view of the likely increase in military activity, the dangers of hostile incursion into European civil airspace and, of course, as he said, about the continued viability of European airlines."
"It is vital that we are consistent in our approach to public safety and to the collective peace of mind throughout the Union."
"We must not overreact, exacerbating the understandable fears of the traveller and threatening their civil liberties, but we must get it right and we must do so immediately."
"We must act alongside our friends and allies within the United States of America and in international organisations such as the ICAO."
"To get it right will require work and effort and a commitment: As Mr Van Orden said, we want to make certain that we are saying and doing the same things in six months' time as we profess to do now."
"In conclusion, the message is quite simple: Terrorism must not be allowed to win."
"Any attack upon civilians is abominable, and the sabre rattling we are hearing in Washington - the President uses expressions such as 'crusade' - is therefore also abominable."
"It is monstrous because we know that a military intervention will, in any case, destroy civil society and create the best possible breeding ground for further terrorism. Our most important task is to remind our allies in the United States of the need for caution and considered action, for terrorism is not to be combated through military action."
"With regard to the proposals tabled by the Commission, I would just say that these do not contain what is necessary to prevent terrorism, whose roots go much deeper."
"What is proposed is neither necessary nor adequate to stamp out terrorism and does not even begin to pinpoint the fundamental causes, which is what is important."
"Let us steer clear of these military metaphors and this talk of battles, crusades and waging war."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to the many speeches in this debate and believe that a number of very valid points have been made."
"Needless to say, the events of last Tuesday were a kind of wake-up call for Europe."
"As many of you have already stated, it is true that we will need to take decisive action in future in order to remove the inconsistencies between the first, second and third pillars of integration, in other words the second and third pillars within the entire European construction."
"Some may appreciate in these circumstances that a plea for this does not point to an institutional compulsion, but rather to a concern for the effectiveness of the Union' s actions."
"In this connection, I have taken a careful note of the invitation which your Member and my friend, Mr Jan-Kees Wiebenga, addressed to me."
"I would like to tell him to go ahead straight away with the good work by convincing his own political party and his own government to abolish any veto with regard to the Third Pillar."
"That would be a huge step in the right direction."
"As far as our cooperation with the United States is concerned, I have, on behalf of the Council, said that this must be stepped up and will need to go beyond the usual forms of cooperation."
"Together with many of you, I hope that the American request for aid from Europe, as repeated by various Members here today, will remain just as clear in future and that provision will be made for a balanced cooperation, by means of which we, on an equal footing, inform, support and help each other as much as possible in all the actions which are necessary to combat international terrorism."
"As some of you have already stated, I would, on behalf of the Council, like to underline that it would be a terrible mistake to view the events of the past week as a kind of conflict between two civilisations, or worse, a conflict between philosophical-religious world visions."
"Radicalism is nobody' s monopoly, unfortunately, and neither is fanaticism."
"What happened last week is so horrific on account of its sheer scale and the large number of victims involved."
"Those images will be etched in our minds forever, but unfortunately, every day, we are once again faced with expressions of blind fanaticism, much closer to home, which cannot be ascribed - as happens - to certain world visions."
"I would like to warn against this most emphatically."
"We must not go in that direction and we must, on the contrary, ensure that all sources of conflict on our own continent, but also elsewhere, are brought within peace processes as soon as possible."
"Like many of you, I have the Middle East in mind but not only the Middle East."
"I am also thinking of the Balkans - yesterday, in Parliament, a conference was held on the Stability Pact relating to the Balkans - and Africa - I talked this afternoon abut the programme of our Presidency concerning Africa."
"As I already stated in my first speech, the European Union is growing into a global power quicker than many had envisaged and slower than many would wish."
"That brings with it additional weighty responsibilities."
"I hope that in the next couple of weeks and months, we will prove worthy of those additional weighty responsibilities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is grateful for your contributions to this debate."
"I shall certainly convey to President Prodi and to my colleague Christopher Patten the questions for which they are directly responsible within the Commission."
"For my part, I should simply like to emphasise three points."
"The first is to say that I fully share the idea that the strategy on terrorism should not be caught between the various pillars of the European Union."
"There must be a global strategy that harnesses various instruments, such as conflict prevention policy, of course, the development of a political dialogue with the most problematic regions under the common foreign and security policy, of course, development aid policy, of course, but also, and let us be quite clear on this point, security policy and police and judicial cooperation policy."
"We cannot ignore the deep-rooted causes of terrorism, but we cannot allow the slightest ambiguity to remain and we therefore state that no cause justifies the use of terrorism and violence that sacrifices innocent lives."
"The best way of combating terrorism in the name of democratic values, therefore, consists of using the weapons of the law, cooperation between police forces and cooperation between the courts."
"It is worth emphasising, however, that there are clearly some issues which we must look into, such as the funding of terrorism, the need to rigorously apply the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the need to adopt effective mechanisms to combat money laundering and the tax havens that provide financial support for terrorist groups and the United Nations Convention on arms trafficking."
"In other words, we need to implement the Palermo Convention on organised crime. These are many ways of proving, within the framework of the United Nations, that the people who died on 11 September did not die in vain."
"In other words, that States have learned the lesson and that they are willing to give incontrovertible proof that they are improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
"The second issue that I wish to address concerns aviation safety."
"I am pleased to say that the Council of Ministers for Transport has decided that a working group will present an initial report on 15 October, not only on the most immediate safety measures that are being taken in airports and in aircraft but also on the need to conclude an agreement, especially with our American partners, on rapidly defining measures to improve the safety of air transport. I also wish to say that these issues will be discussed by representatives of the European Union at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which opens on 25 September."
"With regard to political decisions - for example, the two framework decisions that the Commission has just approved - it is quite clear that unanimity could prove to be a tricky obstacle to overcome in Council."
"The Commission has already, on several occasions, expressed its sympathy with the idea that methods of decision-making under the third pillar should be streamlined and simplified."
"However, over and above the issue of unanimity, the Commission' s political position on the fight against terrorism is clear: no State must block decisions."
"The effectiveness of the framework decisions also depends on their being implemented uniformly in all the States of the Union without exception, because we do not want a single haven for terrorist or criminal activities to exist within the European Union."
"To this end, I hope that the appeals of this Parliament and of public opinion are sufficiently strong to enable us to reach the compromise formulas necessary to improve police and judicial cooperation, which are the legitimate methods for combating terrorism in a democracy."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino."
"Future of cohesion policy"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the future of cohesion policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since 1988, regional policy has enjoyed undeniable success. This success is not purely coincidental."
"It is the fruit of a major policy decision that favours solidarity, a decision that has resulted, in budgetary terms, in the appropriation of more than a third of Community expenditure for economic and social cohesion."
"During this 2000-2006 programming period, the Commission adopted, on 31 January, the second report on economic and social cohesion in accordance with Article 159, subparagraph 2, of the Treaty."
"In addition to being a pertinent account of the studies carried out and the statistical information gathered in the field of enlargement, the report contains conclusions and recommendations that should encourage debate on the future of regional policy."
"Economic and social cohesion is a real issue that we should be concerned with from now on, for we have to provide answers for the next programming period starting 1 January 2007, a time when enlargement to include new Member States will be a reality."
"With regard to the statistical information in the second report on cohesion, one fact stands out in our minds: enlargement will bring a challenge twice as large as the one we are currently facing, for the figures indicate that regional disparities are set to double."
"In relative terms, regions that are lagging behind in their development and those which are having problems with restructuring will be greater in number and this effect will be multiplied when we are 27 Member States."
"In addition, due to a simple mechanical reality, a certain number of regions in the current European Union will no longer find themselves on the list of problem regions although their true economic situation has not really improved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our attention needs to be focused on two crucial questions."
"The first question is whether enlargement is conceivable without a powerful structure and cohesion policy."
"The second question is how the policy on economic and social cohesion should in future continue to focus on regions that lag behind current Member States developmentally, and what are the objectives that need to be met."
"Both questions were extensively dealt with during the informal Regional Policy Council which was held recently in Namur on 13 July last."
"With regard to the first question, everyone has accepted that enlargement will bring with it a substantial increase in needs in terms of social and economic cohesion."
"That was also clearly underlined in the Commission' s second report on economic and social cohesion."
"The figures in the report speak for themselves."
"Following on enlargement, discrepancies will become more pronounced in two ways."
"Firstly, the section of the population in regions with a Gross Domestic Product per capita that is less than 75% of the current EU average will double, and that means that the number of inhabitants that fall within the scope of present objective 1 of the Structural Funds will increase from 19% in the EU of Fifteen Members to 36% in an EU comprising twenty-seven Member States."
"Secondly, discrepancies will increase in extent."
"Today' s average Gross Domestic Product per capita in the underprivileged regions stands at 66% of the EU average."
"If one adds to this the less developed regions of the candidate countries, the average Gross Domestic Product per capita drops back to less than half of the EU average, to only 77% to be precise."
"On the basis of the above data, one can conclude that with enlargement, the cohesion problem doubles in terms of its original scope and its original extent."
"Poverty and inequality are persistent problems and we realise that we will need to fight them for a long time yet to come."
"Even if the candidate countries were to grow faster than the amalgamated countries have done in the past ten years, even then, the current level of the Gross Domestic Product per capita would imply a convergence process spanning at least two generations."
"Even with the Irish rate of growth of the past ten years, it would take twenty years to reach 90% of the Gross Domestic Product per capita of the fifteen EU Member States."
"It is from that perspective that today' s priorities and objectives of our regional policy must be viewed."
"Even the management itself of the outlined package of measures is an important element, in the sense that we should not overlook the fact that at present, most candidate countries do not have appropriate structures in place to manage properly the regional policy in the way we in most cases propose."
"Having said that, during the informal Council in Namur, we were given a clear signal that it is necessary to continue to support the current underprivileged regions in the European Union."
"The present objectives pertaining to the underprivileged regions, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries, must be supported in a fair manner."
"That will inevitably need to go hand in hand with an even more efficient deployment of Community resources."
"There is therefore unanimity as regards the continuation of the present regional policy concerning those regions which continue to face structural difficulties."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the coherence of the actions to be taken, the Fifteen support a strengthening of this coherence at all levels, particularly between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, with a more specific focus being given to interventions."
"Furthermore, requests for additional assessments, particularly on the efficiency of the current system, have been drawn up by certain Member States before they are prepared to advance further in the determination of procedures and mechanisms that will govern the future of economic and social cohesion policy."
"These procedures and mechanisms will be the subject of a global proposal from the Commission in 2004, in its third report on economic and social cohesion."
"In any case, it is clear that projects and action supported by the economic and social cohesion policy are particularly important to European citizens."
"This contributes to the process of bringing citizens closer to European institutions and policies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, by publishing the second report on economic and social cohesion, has paved the way for an important debate on the future of the European Union' s structural operations policy."
"The Council, during the informal meeting on regional policy that took place in Namur, listened very carefully to the presentation made by Commissioner Barnier."
"The Council then debated the issue in a calm atmosphere where everybody had the chance to speak and be heard."
"The discussions focused on questions of substance, in a climate that was generally positive."
"However, no definitive option has yet been decided on."
"To do this, the questions asked in the second report need to be looked at in much greater detail."
"The Commission will continue its analysis and will encourage debate by organising working parties for each issue."
"The results of this will be used in the drafting of a third report, expected in 2004."
"At this point, it will be sent back to the Council and Parliament, on the basis of the Commission' s proposals, to be used at an earlier stage in the development of the future framework of cohesion policy."
"Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I can personally bring you up to date, as I am sure you were hoping I would, on the great debate we started on 31 January in this very place, when I came to present you with the second report on economic and social cohesion that the Commission had just approved."
"On that occasion we, in addition to this presentation, started a debate that I said, and I am anxious to repeat on this very occasion, would be sincere, objective, without any issue being taboo, on one of the great Community policies at the very heart of the perception that we have of our European Union, for it relates to the policy of solidarity."
"Since 31 January, the debate has been stoked by new contributions."
"I am thinking in particular of the Cohesion Forum of 21 and 22 May, organised right here thanks to the European Parliament, in agreement with your President and with the support of my colleagues Anna Diamantopoulou and Franz Fischler."
"At the same time, enlargement negotiations are progressing with all candidate countries."
"Enlargement, as you know, is one of the main themes of this debate."
"I would like to reiterate now that we must make a clear distinction between accession negotiations, which are based on the application of the acquis communautaire in new Member States, and the reform of structural policies for the period following 2006."
"The debate that I am inviting you to participate in mainly focuses on the period after 2006."
"We are, of course, not calling into question what current Member States receive from the Structural Funds from now until 2006."
"Your Parliament, in requesting the Commission to give its opinion, wanted to take stock of this debate."
"I would like to thank you, therefore, for this opportunity and thus quickly mention certain points."
"Firstly, the forum we held on 21 and 22 May was an opportunity for genuine debate, paving the way for other such moments."
"Since 31 January, the presentation of conclusions from the cohesion report has been, for both myself and my colleagues from the Directorate-General on Regional Policy, a priority."
"You can be sure that I will fully participate in this debate, week after week, at ground level."
"Last Friday in Helsinki, for example, I met the twenty Finnish regional Presidents. Tomorrow and the day after, in Oporto, I will attend an assembly of the conference of peripheral maritime regions, where we will discuss this future cohesion policy."
"In this way, the debate should spread, should move away from the political centre in such a way that it provides firstly the Member States and then Brussels with a certain number of ideas, requests, proof and guidelines."
"The 21 May forum was a very important moment for me and one that taught many lessons."
"It brought together a number of ministers, several former prime ministers, current prime ministers, representatives from regions and towns, not only from the fifteen Member States but also from the candidate countries, and many very high-level contributions."
"I would like to bring to light three aspects of these contributions and the discussion that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck mentioned earlier, that I held in Namur with the fifteen ministers in charge of regional policy, on the invitation of the Belgian Presidency."
"Firstly, the interest the future of this policy after 2006 arouses in all Member States and candidate countries, and the insistence of many on the truly political dimension of European solidarity."
"This is not solely a question of money."
"It is also the expression, as you very clearly stated, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Presidency, of possibly the most concrete, the most precise and visible of the values upon which the European Union is founded."
"The proof that our Union is not just a large free trade area or single market, but also a community of solidarity that should one day be a political force."
"Secondly, I have had no negative feedback regarding the enlargement process."
"There is concern, of course, but also a sense of the European Union' s historic obligation and interest in both new and old Member States in assisting in the long-lasting and balanced development of the whole European continent."
"Thirdly, I have also measured the importance, in order for this debate to succeed, of not forgetting the needs of regions in States that are current members of the EU."
"I would like once again to state my conviction: we are not of the opinion that by admitting very poor regions in Eastern Europe - Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Bulgaria and others - into the European Union, that regions that are poor or that are experiencing difficulties in the north, the centre, the south, not to mention the outermost regions, will become rich as if by waving a magic wand."
"After enlargement there will be problems and needs in the EU as it currently stands."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, here we have what constitutes, when all is considered, strong encouragement for the maintenance of a cohesion policy that is suited to the new economic challenges and future geography of Europe."
"My second point concerns procedures for the future."
"As you know, the Commission has committed itself, following requests from the Council in June, to provide it with a regular report on the development of its work on future cohesion policy."
"This information, which I must give to the Council, I must also, naturally, give to the European Parliament."
"I will propose to the Commission that it adopt the first of these regular interim reports at the very beginning of next year, in January, as soon as we have new statistics available. These statistics will explain, update and clarify the information that is already available in the cohesion report."
"I would like to point out that these new statistics, supplied by Eurostat, will involve, for example, the GDP per capita in 1999, and unemployment statistics for the year 2000."
"Therefore, the more up-to-date these figures are, the more serious and objective the debate will be."
"This interim report for the month of January will therefore contain an update of figures and analyses from the first part of the cohesion report devoted to the situation of regions, but it will also present the results of different studies that we have commissioned, as well as lessons learned from the great debates and seminars that have been organised."
"I can give more details regarding the additional studies commissioned: we have commissioned a study of the situation of the islands, as well as a study on the macroeconomic impact of Structural Funds."
"With regard to this macroeconomic study, I shall be very eager to provide you with information on the impact of these Structural Funds in terms of the direct impact of the use of these funds in net contributing countries."
"I also plan to commission an additional study on the situation of mountainous regions or regions that have long-term natural handicaps."
"In order to stimulate this debate, seminars will be organised during the first half of 2002 on each of the ten Community priorities that have been identified in the cohesion report, with the participation of experts from the Member States and regions who we shall invite in accordance with the various issues."
"My third point involves, whilst still talking about the future, the basis of the debate."
"On the subject of the basis of the debate, I would like to express, or state once more, three convictions."
"My first conviction is that within the coming context of this EU enlargement, the Member States and regions will feel the need for more Community cohesion policy and not less."
"I do not think that a form of unravelling or renationalisation of regional policy should be the way to respond to this requirement, to this need for cohesion in an enlarged EU where there will be - and the figures speak for themselves - more disparities than today."
"But I am equally resolutely in favour, while reaffirming this need for cohesion and planning these new cohesion and regional policies, to find, with your help, a way to achieve more decentralisation, simplification, and less bureaucracy."
"As far as we can, I will, using current European procedures, be anxious to search for and propose all means of moving further towards simplification and decentralisation."
"My second conviction is financial in nature."
"Even if the financial debate is, strictly speaking, premature today, I am not the only one to consider, as I already said here in a personal capacity, that a financial effort that would globally represent any less than 0.45 % of EU GDP would, in my view, call into question the credibility of the future cohesion policy."
"I think therefore that I can state once more that, in my opinion, we cannot, without calling into question the credibility of this cohesion policy, fall below this threshold of 0.45 % which is a threshold universally accepted by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin."
"My third conviction is that future cohesion policy should be fair and non-discriminatory."
"It should, therefore, be directed towards all regions that have structural difficulties of whatever nature and deal with questions in a heterogeneous fashion, that is to say, regions that are very backward in terms of development, that happen to be mostly in candidate countries, as well as regions within the current Fifteen that have not truly succeeded in the process of true convergence and for which it would be a good idea, at an opportune moment, to find some means of fair treatment, so that they are not penalised by a purely statistical or mechanical effect linked to a threshold or to new methods applied within the framework of the enlarged EU, in order to deal with the problems of certain areas which have particular handicaps or certain worrying social issues such as equal opportunities or the situation of urban areas."
"In conclusion, Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that the report we shall put forward at the beginning of next year will take its inspiration from the results of the great debates held in the second half of this year."
"This is just the first of the meetings I have proposed to hold with you."
"There will be others before I present you with the third cohesion report in 2004."
"It is in this frame of mind that I shall be entirely available today and in the forthcoming weeks to listen to your suggestions, your recommendations and your criticisms."
"Mr President, I do not think anything impressively new can come out of this debate on regional policy quite simply, in my personal opinion, because the time is not right, it is not newsworthy, if you like."
"In all events, given that many of the Members are interested in this particular subject and given that regional policy accounts yet again for 35% of the budget, this confirms, I think, just how important it is to the European Union and, in this sense, there is perhaps some point to the debate."
"The second point I wish to make is that perhaps it would be a good idea at some point - and this is certainly the intention of the Committee on Regional Policy - to discuss the state of progress of projects and programmes under the Community Support Framework in individual countries, because I personally am not at all convinced that everything is going swimmingly in every country, not through any fault of the Commission's, but through the fault of certain Member States."
"I do not wish to speak of dramatic delays but I am sure that certain countries are having problems."
"As far as the future of cohesion policy is concerned, a debate was started following the second cohesion report by the European Commission and I think that certain conclusions are already obvious, that is, that far more regions will need to be covered, that in regions in the Member States which are already covered there will appear to be an artificial increase in GNP, which does not mean that they will automatically become rich, as the Commissioner has said, and that it goes without saying that more appropriations are needed but that it does not go without saying that it will be easy to find these appropriations."
"As far as I can see, the conclusions are more or less obvious."
"First, we must not leave things in the lap of the Gods, we must not take decisions at the eleventh hour, because we could bring the European Union to what may well be an explosive situation."
"Secondly, we need to concentrate from 2006 onwards on those in real need."
"Thirdly, we must not create shock waves in regions which stop being covered, because that will give rise to euro-scepticism in these regions."
"Having said which, I have two unpleasant things to say, one of which is unpleasant for the poorer countries and the other of which is unpleasant for the richer countries."
"For the poorer countries, I think that we need to find ways of making the most of appropriations by introducing suitable mechanisms, incentives and, if necessary, sanctions so that the money actually goes somewhere."
"And for the richer countries, we need to rethink the overall logic of the Community budget so as to find a way of increasing appropriations, because there will be a huge increase in requirements and regional policy will, as the Commissioner has said, have no credibility whatsoever if we fall below a certain point."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that the Regional and Transport Committee has started its deliberations on social and economic cohesion via the second cohesion report and that this report launches the debate on how we face up to the challenges of regional funding and structural policy in an enlarged Europe."
"However, whilst I am grateful for the Commissioner's statement today, my group is still disappointed with the Commission as it appears that it has not used its right of initiative and has not engaged itself fully on this topic."
"It raises the question as to what the real proposals of the Commission are."
"Commissioner Barnier referred to the meeting in May in which many Members participated, but again nothing concrete seems to have come out of that meeting."
"On our side of the political divide, we recognised at an early stage how sensitive this issue could be and indeed our experience of Agenda 2000 was the catalyst that told us this."
"But then Commissioner Wulf-Matthies facilitated a common position with Parliament and so we feel that the time is now right for us to start work with the Commission as it becomes more active, positive and decisive."
"My group has discussed in detail the questions that you have posed."
"The main points emanating from our discussion revolve around the principle of keeping the concept of social and economic cohesion and its most representative instrument, namely the Cohesion Fund."
"But a thorough discussion is required on implementing the goals of the cohesion policy before we make any decisions on the future financing of structural aid."
"At the moment, we are facing a number of great challenges and any discussion on the implementation of Cohesion Fund has to include other areas under the umbrella of sustainable development, such as employment and agriculture."
"We must continue to ensure that the poorer regions that presently receive structural aid are not mistreated in the future and that Community initiatives, such INTERREG and URBAN, are retained."
"We also question whether 1.27% of the Community GDP, as was decided on in Agenda 2000, is enough with regard to the new Cohesion Fund."
"In launching this debate, it is our view that our discussions would have been more fruitful and more meaningful if the Commission had come forward with ideas of its own so that it could act as a facilitator of those discussions."
"We know that it is an important issue."
"At the moment, we are left with a series of questionnaires, but we can give the Commissioner a guarantee that our group will be fully involved in discussions in the coming months."
"Mr President, the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is a very timely one."
"I wish to thank the Commission for its willingness to share this debate with Parliament and, at the same time, for the visits undertaken to Member States."
"They are very necessary."
"My concern is not just how regional policy can be made to work effectively both in the present Member States and in the countries that have applied for membership but also the continuation of structural policy in the present Member States in the next Structural Funds period."
"Structural Funds policy is currently managed in too cumbersome a manner."
"Now is a good time to consider, for example, how we might learn from the delay in the preparatory procedures for programmes for the next period."
"How can we become more effective, achieve better results and reduce bureaucracy?"
"In this connection I would also like to enquire what the Commission' s position is regarding what enlargement means for the overall funding of structural policy."
"Is the Commission prepared to increase structural policy appropriations during the next Structural Funds period should the situation regarding European economic and social cohesion so demand?"
"At the same time I would also like to communicate to the Commission that a funding model for enlargement is not acceptable where those having to pay would be the poor regions of the existing EU countries, where there are still lasting problems owing to difficult natural conditions, long distances or sparse populations."
"The EU must also show solidarity in the future so that new money with a new financial instrument can be found for the new challenges of structural policy, where those that pay would include those central regions that will be the first to benefit economically from enlargement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is indeed the greatest challenge facing the Community in the context of enlargement."
"At the same time, cohesion policy will be the litmus test of whether stability can successfully be maintained in an EU of 27 Member States and, moreover, in all its parts."
"The tendency has, however, prevailed in the Member States not to assess the success of cohesion policy in the less favoured areas, but rather to evaluate success in terms of how much they end up getting for themselves out of each negotiation."
"Clearly, this must change from 2006 onwards!"
"Stability and the successful development of an enlarged Union will be guaranteed after 2006 only if common objective criteria rather than the protection of possession constitute the precondition for the allocation of funds."
"This means that a new, common cohesion policy must be tested in its entirety against the old policy."
"The second report on cohesion contains some good proposals, but it perpetuates many of the cohesion policy's errors and is no radical programme of reform."
"I will say a bit more about the proposals."
"I think it right and proper that all regions of the enlarged Union should be assessed on an equal basis provided there is no simultaneous impact on regions which are currently being supported."
"So I wholeheartedly support the principle of phasing out."
"Increased decentralisation and the promotion of partnership must, however, apply also to the acceding countries in the accession funds - and right now - so that their authorities get some practical experience of them."
"Phasing-in the acceding countries into a decentralised structural policy as early as 2002 is also necessary in order to pool experience."
"Even in half measures, an integrated regional policy is the only thing in which donors, too, can have confidence."
"Quality must therefore come before quantity!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I consider the policy of economic and social cohesion to be one of the European Union's undoubted achievements, attesting as it does the principle of solidarity between the highly-developed regions and the weak ones."
"Of course, on further analysis of the way structural policy has worked to date, it has to be said that it has a lot of inadequacies."
"Firstly: The divergence between Member States may well have decreased, but the differences within them - between highly-developed regions and weak ones - have increased."
"Secondly: The unemployment rate in the weak regions has not significantly decreased."
"Thirdly: The average per capita income of the wealthiest regions, which make up 10% of the Union's population, is still 2.6 times higher than in the regions in which 10% of the poorest inhabitants live."
"Fourthly: The underdeveloped regions still do not possess self-supporting economic and social cycles."
"They therefore have enormous problems when it comes to actually reducing the amount by which they lag behind the developed areas."
"Fifthly: You yourselves can see that the commitment appropriations yet to be settled totalled almost EUR 42 billion at the end of 1999, in other words the Structural Fund's input for specific projects is inefficient!"
"This means that other measures, even other projects, must be deliberately chosen, something which can, of course, only be done in collaboration with the Member States."
"Whatever the shortcomings, the enormous amount of change cannot be overlooked."
"Differences would otherwise be markedly greater."
"This also means that we must carry on with the Structural Fund policy."
"You have just said, Mr Barnier, that there must be no taboos."
"Too true!"
"All the Member States said more or less the same thing at the informal meeting in Namur, and proposals were submitted."
"But sooner or later, we must get to the point. At some juncture, it will have to be said that these proposals cost X amount of money, and we must either make it available or we have to admit that we are not going to."
"This cannot be put off for ever and a day."
"You will be aware that the upper limit equals 1.27% of GDP within the financial perspective for 2000 to 2006."
"Where are we in real terms?"
"At 1.06%."
"You can hardly call that putting real structural policy into practice!"
"It is also because of Parliament..."
"(Interruption by Mr Jarzembowski) No, I am not only accusing the Commissioner; we put up with this sort of thing all the time!"
"Not my Group, though; we have always submitted the relevant amendments."
"Perhaps, Mr Jarzembowski, the PPE-DE Group would like to join in next time, then we should almost make up a majority!"
"In the context of this discussion, we must also of course bear in mind that there are very special regions."
"I regret to have to say, Commissioner, that the border regions programme imposed by the Commission is utterly inadequate!"
"Perhaps we will have to give some thought to doing something similar..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Cohesion Fund was created in order to prepare the structurally weak countries of the EU for economic and monetary union."
"The cohesion countries have substantially caught up over the past few years and they all participate in EMU."
"I would therefore observe that this objective of the Cohesion Fund has been attained."
"Despite this, Agenda 2000 decided that the Cohesion Fund should continue."
"Would it not have been consistent to let the Cohesion Fund expire, not abruptly perhaps but by its being phased out?"
"The eastward enlargement means that the EU's present cohesion policy cannot be continued with any longer."
"We all know that eastward enlargement will not be for free, and this must be said frankly."
"Apart from that, I too believe that much is going wrong with our cohesion policy as regards efficiency, administrative costs and this policy's vulnerability to deception."
"What the cohesion policy needs is a fundamental debate about its strengths and weaknesses, that is, about its possible reform."
"I know that this is a difficult debate, being about our patrimony."
"But it is also about a quite fundamental question: what, in the EU, does solidarity mean?"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too will take up your suggestion that this issue should be discussed without taboos."
"I do not believe that there is actually anybody in this House who is opposed to a cohesion policy."
"The question we must ask ourselves is whether a cohesion policy would not be better conducted without a Cohesion Fund."
"There are two problems, the first being that, if the accessions were to take place, then, logically, all the acceding States, being the poorest countries and States, would have to join the Cohesion Fund."
"You cannot say that there is a regional policy for all, a Cohesion Fund for four countries and all the rest can fit in somewhere else!"
"No, so if the Cohesion Fund were to be maintained, it would have to apply to all the acceding countries."
"It is my personal view, however, that cohesion policy can be carried on better through the medium of general regional and structural policy and without a Cohesion Fund, as the Cohesion Fund seems to me to suffer from the drawback that it turns its attention to States rather than to regions."
"It is not the States that we want to support, however, but disadvantaged regions."
"It is for this reason, Commissioner, that I believe this issue should again be considered very carefully."
"I believe, secondly, that we too should, as you have always said, distinguish between substantial reforms and the question of how much money we want to end up spending on them."
"We must, in my view, come to a quick decision about the substance, as the acceding States have a right to be told before 2002/2003 what the cohesion policy situation is going to be if they are Members by then."
"Commissioner, I am not sure that I understood you right: I find your model good in itself."
"You are saying that there are standard criteria for all regions - one or two, shall we say - then there is phasing out for the regions that used to be supported but no longer can be because of the new criteria or simply because there is no more money."
"The question now arises: by what criteria should support actually be given in future?"
"I myself would be prepared to talk in terms of one or two, or even three, criteria."
"I have, though, the slight suspicion - which you hinted at earlier - that there will subsequently be ten."
"So one takes a look to see what criterion fits the region."
"Oh look, there are a few mountains, so this is a mountain region."
"And this place has island status, so we shall call it an island region!"
"I think it better to take any old percentage - GDP plus, perhaps, the unemployment situation, for example."
"If one takes that a step further and says that the balance of the sexes or the standard of education of men and women are to be counted as general criteria, then - if I may say so - things get a bit jumbled."
"So please let us carry on our discussions, as you said you would."
"We are on your side and look forward to continuing the debate with you."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish to express my support for those who have said that this debate must not be about the safeguarding of possession, but about aid for those who need it most."
"I also want to say frankly that, in my considered opinion, nobody must close his eyes to the fact that enlargement is going to present us all with great challenges, those of a financial nature among them. The Germans learned their lesson through reunification, when the citizens were told at first that it would involve no fiscal burdens for them."
"This was demonstrably false."
"Let there be no misunderstandings - of course we want enlargement."
"But we must squarely face the consequences for structural policy."
"We should not simply be told 'as you were' , and I do not believe that we will be."
"If we are not to forfeit the trust of people in the affected regions, we must point this out clearly, honestly and at an early stage."
"If there is not to be a rude awakening, we must explore the possibilities of full support for the candidate countries in building up their infrastructure and, at the same time, concern ourselves with continuing to bring the weakest regions of the Fifteen up to the average."
"The success of this will depend on making certain changes which would have been required even without enlargement."
"First, there is the fact that the cohesion countries can point to very variable results from the catching-up process, and it is evident that the greatest successes were achieved where the actors were on the spot and shared a commitment to maximising the efficiency of the support."
"Moreover, project evaluation needs further improvement and efficient management needs greater rewards than in the past if the effectiveness of the means employed is to be assessed."
"Last but not least, there is no getting away from the need for closer dovetailing with the other EU policies, in particular the common agricultural policy."
"I believe that both targets can be reached through the decentralisation and simplification that Mr Barnier has mentioned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to say that I am in favour of the two reports, which provide us with a good analysis of the application of both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds in 1999."
"On the basis of the analysis contained in these two reports, I would like to refer to three points."
"The first is obvious: the cohesion policy comes within European Union policy and a fundamental element of that cohesion policy is the funds which we are discussing here."
"The regions which are at a lower level than the European Union average cannot do without these funds, with or without enlargement."
"It is therefore inherent to the European Union' s cohesion policy that the least-developed regions of the Union receive funds and resources so that they can try to eliminate the current territorial imbalances."
"As has been said, there is still a budgetary margin in the Union which can be used to meet these needs."
"The second point is that these reports refer to 1999."
"There are a series of criticisms about application, which should be taken into account."
"Let us hope that in 2001, thanks to the action of the Commissioner and his team, the restrictions and shortcomings pointed out may be eliminated."
"Thirdly, we must bear in mind that the series of statistics analysed and the studies done on the long-term application of the funds in the European Union, with very few exceptions, demonstrate that in the least-favoured regions the level of imbalance in relation to the European Union average has been reduced."
"Therefore, since we are talking about the future application of these funds, this must be taken into account in the Union' s new policies in this field."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I am very pleased that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner responsible for territorial policy have agreed firstly that it will be necessary in the future, with enlargement, to have a dual cohesion policy, although it is of a minority nature: the cohesion policy for the regions belonging to the fifteen current Members and the supplementary cohesion policy for the enlargement countries."
"I also note that they agreed on an issue which seems to me essential and in no way hypocritical: there can be no political Europe without an economic Europe, there can be no political Europe without a cohesion policy."
"That is also the case in the current States, and the European Union must assume these responsibilities in the future."
"How can it be done?"
"How can it be achieved and with what instruments?"
"We clearly have to improve the current application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"We only have to look at the differences between Ireland and Spain, in terms of results over past years, or between Portugal and Italy or Greece, if you will allow me."
"The application has been different, and as such Ireland has made extraordinary progress and Portugal has taken better advantage of the Structural Funds than many other States."
"This has not been the case with Spain, Italy or Greece, where, while State income has come closer to the Community average, this has not been the case in their internal regions, which indicates that the Funds are being badly applied, possibly because the State has taken advantage of the funds intended for the regions or because the policy of additionality has not been applied in the State."
"Mr Barnier, you have said, and you had said previously, that the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot be below 0.46% of Community GDP."
"I would remind you that this is the level they had in 1999 and that in 2006 it will be 0.31%."
"If in 1999, in view of the result, we had not managed to eliminate differences between the regions of Europe by means of these Funds, we must therefore be much more ambitious than you are proposing, although you have done so in a very positive way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the question before us is what line our cohesion policy should follow in the new perspective that is opening up with enlargement."
"There are two parts to the response: on the one hand, the principles on which cohesion policies are to be based from 2006 onwards must be established and, on the other hand, the priorities must be set."
"In my opinion, there are two principles which must underpin cohesion policy: firstly, equal opportunities, and secondly, regionalisation."
"Modern economic theory teaches us, with a wealth of detail and supported by considerable empirical evidence, that the success of local development policies is strictly linked to an increase in the power of individuals to take autonomous decisions and to the projects for implementing regional policies which are acceptable to those voters."
"In the same way, talking about regionalisation is the same as defining economic policies at local level so that they respect and appreciate the different assets of each region, and so that the local government institutions, subject to monitoring by the electorate making them politically accountable, can take collective decisions backed by genuine democratic support."
"The achievement of these goals certainly requires a different type of statistic on the state of the economies, at both local and national and Community level."
"Data on per capita income are no longer sufficient to assess individuals' opportunities for access in the European regions; we need much more: we need indicators which measure the degree of access to resources, indicators which measure the level of economic freedoms, which measure the level of fundamental human rights, which measure, in short, the quality of life."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the cohesion policy is an integral component of the European Union."
"The European Union will not make progress in growing together if solidarity does not always play some part."
"We all know that those who are stronger and richer must help those who are poorer or not yet as strong or in the process of catching up."
"We are talking today about what was to be seen over the last few years and, of course, also about the conclusions we must draw from that for the years to come."
"Today, I want to take a look at the current state of our cohesion policy, in other words: how are we spending the money we have allocated to this truly vital EU policy?"
"Right up to Agenda 2000, we used to have the stormiest debates about how much money was to be spent."
"If, though, we now look at how implementation is actually proceeding, we cannot but have grave doubts as to whether this is being taken seriously enough."
"The new aid period began last year, so, of course, things cannot move as fast at the outset as they can halfway down the track, but it must be pointed out all the same that implementation is proceeding at a wretched rate in the various fields. There is simply no other way of putting it."
"This has been a frequent topic in the Committee on Budgets, and even the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has taken it up and will continue to discuss it."
"Looking at current discussions in the context of the Budget consultations - and here I must address my remarks to the Council - we see that the Council has allocated only 1% for next year's new liabilities, and that is then supposed to be converted into payments."
"One per cent of all we are prepared to commit, that is supposed to be paid out!"
"We are producing a backlog, of the sort that we often used to have."
"We are piling up funds rather than fast-tracking aid, and fast aid is good aid, because we want many countries and regions no longer to need aid when enlargement actually comes about."
"If we really want to help them out of their plight, if we really want to make room for the new countries who want to join us, we must give aid fast and in concentrated form, in other words: there must be appropriate follow-up here."
"I call upon the Commission - which has already submitted proposals on this - but also upon the Council, to follow up words with actions, for cohesion is only any good as and when it actually reaches people, and that needs to be as soon as possible!"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will first address a word of thanks to you, Commissioner, for your lucid words and your declaration that, in the context of economic and social cohesion, both the new problems of the candidates for accession and the continuing problems of the present 15 Member States are being appropriately taken into account in various regions."
"Secondly, a word of thanks also for emphasising again that there are no taboos in this discussion."
"We are at the beginning of this discussion process and, in this discussion, we should explore in depth all the options for auditing the Structural Funds."
"Holding 27 countries together economically and socially is a quite different matter from maintaining the cohesion of 15 of them."
"The solid fact is that the accession of 12 new States will substantially increase the disparities in the EU."
"On the one hand, the new Member States will have to be given priority, whilst on the other, the present beneficiary countries must not be denied a degree of continuity."
"We are well aware that the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund can still only be temporary measures and cannot be made part of the patrimony."
"However, regions must not lose their Objective 1 status after 2006 solely on the grounds that enlargement has brought an improvement in their relative position and without their having achieved sustainable development."
"I see the cohesion policy as being credible only if the financial means are apportioned on the basis of objective criteria applicable to all, with the criteria of national and regional prosperity forming the bases."
"The pending review of European regional policy must therefore throw up some solutions, and that is the whole point of the discussion process that is now beginning - to treat on an equal footing the situations both in the new Member States and in the Objective 1 regions of the present Member States."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in view of what one Member said, I believe that this is a very appropriate time to discuss economic and social cohesion."
"Let us hope that this notion transcends European borders and is applied to other regions."
"This would probably be a solution to many conflicts."
"While it is true that this is a good time for the debate, I must also recognise that, at least in my opinion, the responses from the Council and the Commission are unsatisfactory."
"Firstly, I find it difficult to believe that we can talk about social and economic cohesion without making the least reference to the single market and all the policies of the European Union."
"We are currently negotiating the Sixth Framework Programme, a programme which from the outset does not fulfil the cohesive conditions required of it by the Treaties."
"Economic and social cohesion demands that we take it into account in all our policies."
"Mr President, Mr Barnier asked this Parliament certain questions in this report."
"When we asked the Council these same questions, it indicated that this was not the appropriate time to answer them, but Parliament has the right to ask the Commission and the Council these questions so that we might know their opinion, before producing our report."
"I profoundly and fundamentally disagree with the Council' s attitude, and to a lesser extent with that of the Commissioner, because I believe that certain fundamental issues must be clarified immediately."
"We are talking about how the 2006 project is going to affect various regions in the future."
"If we do not do so we will constantly be talking in theory about this issue and we will never bring about the reform necessary for economic and social cohesion in Europe, because we will be looking askance at one another: some of us talking about how we have to remove the Cohesion Fund, others saying that certain regions have to leave it."
"This confusion will prevent us from getting down to a thorough analysis of the issue."
"Mr President, honourable Members, as we all know, the European Union considers that economic and social cohesion between the regions is quintessential to life and has quantified this objective by setting a minimum cohesion target of 75% of the average per capita income of the 15 Member States."
"At the same time, and quite rightly too, our European Union has decided to integrate new Member States whose per capita income is demonstrably lower."
"Is it logical, is it ethical and, hence, is it acceptable in the final analysis for the second objective to be achieved at the expense of the first? By which I mean that enlargement will reduce the new average per capita income considerably."
"The upside, of course, is that at least everyone realises that cohesion policy cannot continue with blinkers on as regards the 75% target and hence various scenarios have been proposed and are being debated, scenarios which may provide a way out but which are not a fair solution."
"It therefore makes sense, it is obvious in my book, to retain the first objective even for the enlarged European Union. In other words, all Member States, old and new, must exceed 75% of the average per capita income of the present 15 Member States."
"That would be consistent."
"Naturally enlargement will need more money than it appears to have."
"So those who need to should take a realistic view of the new situation, they should approach it with an open mind, they should take a long-term view of the cost-benefit ratio of a revised, ambitious regional policy and they should not disappoint regions which continue to require help from Europe, from the Europe of their dreams, the Europe they believe in."
"We must realise, as did Demosthenes, one of the great figures of ancient Greece, when he said in ancient Greek, ""... money, without it nothing we need to do can be done."""
"And if the decisions have already been taken, well decisions are made to be revised."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira Román pointed out in their respective reports, the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds are of fundamental importance to the development of most EU regions, both in terms of infrastructures and from the point of view of social integration."
"The fact remains that, despite the budgetary aid granted, European regions are far from being on an equal footing in terms of development. My colleague Mr Fruteau is especially concerned about the outermost regions."
"You will therefore understand that this current context of enlargement makes me fear that the European Union has its attention exclusively focused towards the East, which would be disastrous for a good number of European regions that are current beneficiaries."
"Please understand me: I am not trying to call into question the pertinence of enlargement, which, of course, means the consolidation of peace on our continent, which in these difficult times, is a noble and fragile objective."
"On the contrary, I am thinking about the conditions in which it can succeed."
"I am, in fact, one of those who think that the success of enlargement will be the result of the strengthening of cohesion."
"But this cohesion has a price that should not be paid by the EU' s poorest countries."
"In concrete terms, Commissioner, I hope that the eligibility criteria of Objectives 1 and 2 will be very carefully revised in order that the poverty of some does not lead to the end of hope and the impoverishment of others."
"Enlargement is a great challenge."
"It is one of solidarity."
"It will not be surmounted unless it is understood and accepted."
"Let us not forget this fact."
"Mr President, the statements we have heard from the Council and from Commissioner Barnier and the speeches of all the Members have confirmed without a shadow of a doubt that cohesion policies are one of the fundamental pillars of the Union and that enlargement requires us not only to continue to pursue these policies but also to consolidate them."
"However, I feel that the crucial issues are different and I will list some of them."
"Firstly, are the instruments we have used in recent years to regulate what are becoming increasingly marked imbalances still sufficiently up-to-date?"
"Can generic indicators such as the GDP or simplistic percentages such as 75% continue to be the only parameters for clarifying and classifying eligibility?"
"Is a fictional blanket paradigm in which the same measures are adopted across the board for subjects and contexts which are only similar in terms of statistics, still viable?"
"Secondly, do the key principles of subsidiarity and additionality have the same meaning today as they had 20 years ago, when the European Union had a different institutional system?"
"Is the idea, put forward in recent days by Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian Prime Minister, of far-reaching innovation leaving the European Commission power over major strategic investments and decentralising regional development actions really so unrealistic and impossible?"
"It is my genuine hope that the participants in the debate held over the forthcoming months will have the courage to address these issues as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, cohesion is a fundamental pillar of the European Union."
"In fact, there can be no political cohesion in the European Union without economic and social cohesion, despite what some of the federalists may think."
"On the other hand, however, there can be no economic and social cohesion without political cohesion, as hard as this may be for some nationalists to swallow."
"Cohesion policy, which has played a key role in recent years, will have an even more crucial role to play in future, as a result of enlargement."
"Cohesion policy is really a prerequisite for enlargement' s success."
"This goes without saying."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, there are certain paradoxes inherent in enlargement: by making the European Union poorer in terms of average per capita income, we will be making the countries that are currently the least favoured richer as if by some form of numerical magic."
"This is a problem."
"What my country, Portugal, and other cohesion countries cannot accept is, as a consequence of enlargement, being relegated to the margins of cohesion policy and becoming the victims of the statistical machinery that automatically places them over the critical threshold of 75%."
"With this in mind, I feel that future cohesion policy must not stray from the following principles:"
"firstly: increasing the budgetary resources earmarked for cohesion; we cannot evade this issue, despite what Mr Walter has said;"
"secondly, guaranteeing that the interests of the current least favoured regions and countries are not touched and that a fair method will be found so that they continue to benefit from the level of support they receive today;"
"thirdly: a thorough reform of the common agricultural policy and greater protection of the rural world;"
"fourthly: the definition and implementation of a development strategy for Europe that relieves the congestion from current urban centres, which are dense and concentrated, to the benefit of the whole of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has essentially been an exploratory and orientation debate concerned with future developments in structural and cohesion policy, as you expected."
"I listened to it very carefully."
"We will, of course, take good account of the observations you have made. However, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion I am going to limit myself to just this brief reaction."
"Mr President, like Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I also listened very carefully to the observations made during the debate, which will be of no great surprise to you."
"Personally, I myself had hoped, at this stage, at the very start of the debate, for a great deal of frankness, criticisms, as I said earlier, and suggestions."
"All the same, if you would allow me, I would like to say that I was disappointed by the remarks made by Mr Simpson earlier."
"I think they are particularly unfair."
"In a different way, Mr Izquierdo Collado has also shown a degree of impatience. With this in mind, I would ask each one of you, however, to be fair to the Commission."
"Since Mr Simpson wanted us to hark back to the past, by citing the name of a woman for whom I have a great deal of respect and friendship, my predecessor Mrs Wulf-Matthis, I would like to remind you of the timetable of the previous debate on the Berlin agenda."
"The forum that opened the debate for the Berlin agenda took place in 1996 for a 1999 European Council meeting opening the 2000-2006 agenda."
"Three years beforehand!"
"If I had worked to the same timetable, it is not in January 2001 that I would have set the date for the start of the debate, it would be in two years time, in 2003."
"You cannot seriously be telling me today that the Commission is not aggressive enough, that you are waiting for us to make proposals."
"We are opening this debate two years early without taboos, without waiting for enlargement to have taken place."
"Once more, therefore, I would ask you to be fair with the Commission, and, when the time is right, after I have listened to you, listened to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the regions themselves and the Member States, you can count on me to show how bold I can be, how aggressive I can be if I have to, and to make tough proposals."
"But do not ask me today to conclude a debate that has only just started, two years in advance in relation to normal procedures."
"I have shown transparency."
"I have shown openness with the European Parliament. And I find it quite unfair that you have come here today to reproach me."
"Having said this, I would like to say to President Hatzidakis, to Mrs Schroedter, to Mr Duin, to Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and to Mr Markov, who have, if I have understood them correctly, insisted more in their speeches on current management, that I agree with many of their remarks, to their calls for better take-up, the respect of commitments, the concern for true partnership in the regions."
"And I am, with the Directorate-General team, extremely concerned to ensure that the words found in the regulations - partnership, good take-up, rigour, parity, as well as others -become reality."
"In a few days time I shall appear, President Hatzidakis, before your Committee to tell you where we stand on 1994-1999 and on the subject of take-up that I hope is now finalised for the previous period, where there were still funds that were not used before 1994, and also to raise the alarm on the implementation of commitments and the first take-up of appropriations in the current period."
"I will make a very clear and very objective point to the Committee on Regional Policy."
"Mr Markov has once again raised the issue of border regions."
"I recognise, Mr Markov, that the response we gave with Mr Verheugen is not entirely satisfactory in relation to the problems of border regions, but once more in this particular case, do not ask me today for more than I can give, for we work within a framework of which you are well aware, which you have approved, which is the Berlin framework."
"I have my own financial framework, which I cannot deviate from."
"I shall use all the margins of flexibility and manoeuvre possible, but I am, until 2006, obliged to work within the Berlin framework, and I cannot deviate from this."
"Mr Pohjamo, and others, brought up the subject of the financing of enlargement."
"Mr Pohjamo, I have to tell you that it is not for the Commission to make decisions on this matter."
"It is for the Council, the Council of Heads of State and Government in 2006, based on the proposals we make, and whilst we are on this subject I would like to say, as I could have said later to Mr Nogueira Román, Mr Walter, Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pittella, who talked about the aims and values of the EU as set out in this cohesion policy, I would like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that in 2006 we will only make the right financial decisions if we first have a true and worthwhile political debate and if, naturally, within the framework of this debate and after this debate, the Commission, playing its proper role, puts forward proposals that are courageous and strong willed."
"You can count on myself, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler to put forward the positions and proposals that will follow whilst adapting and reforming cohesion policy."
"But allow me to tell you that in order to succeed with this challenge in 2004 or 2005, I need true political debate beforehand."
"I need you to provide the proof right here, in your countries and in talking to people about the usefulness of this regional policy, the need for it, its effects."
"If we do not provide this proof, then we should fear the ultimate financial decisions when they are made."
"I would invite you, therefore, in your political groups, amongst yourselves, between countries and regions, to participate in this debate, to react to the initial course led by the Commission and to make proposals yourselves."
"Mrs Raschhofer, you said we need to make reforms."
"I do not know if we have understood each other, but the debate is taking place for that reason and I am hoping that it will pave the way for reforms."
"In your speech, you used a word that I cannot ignore, because we must be very careful with the words we use."
"You talked about fraud."
"Personally, I am extremely strict."
"I am also ruthless on this question of rigour in the management of Structural Funds."
"There are probably errors."
"There are probably delays."
"There are often irregularities."
"But I have not observed in the reports from the Court of Auditors and the Parliament' s own Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control, that they have revealed many cases of fraud in relation to the management of Structural Funds."
"As for errors, delays or irregularities, we will progressively reduce these by taking the attitude I have just pointed out."
"Mr Jarzembowski has himself also started to participate in this debate, which I thank him for."
"So that there is no misunderstanding, when I mentioned the territorial dimension of the future policy, you will also see, Mr Jarzembowski, that in the cohesion report, I pointed out the title 'Unity, solidarity, diversity for Europe, its people and its territory' This is perhaps an idea that we can incorporate into the new and future Objective II policy, if there is still an Objective II policy, as I hope there is, that rather than creating a bit of bureaucracy, a bit of zoning, we should decentralise this policy using several European priorities we shall choose together."
"For each of these priorities, there could be a financial instrument in service, several financial instruments for the various major objectives that you have hoped and prayed for: assisting regions that have long-lasting natural handicaps, assisting urban policy, assisting cross-border cooperation."
"These are a few examples of territorial objectives."
"We can also find thematic goals such as the information society."
"Mr Korakas, you also called for more confidence and regionalisation."
"I agree."
"I will make proposals in the new 2004 agenda for increased simplification and regionalisation, but, for me, the limit is to not permit the unravelling or the dismantling of this Cohesion policy which is one of the great and one of the strongest Community policies at the heart of European solidarity."
"Mr Berend, like others, has made a criticism, which I accept or at least understand, on the current criteria for per capita GDP."
"I am open to this type of criticism. But I would like to say that up to this point the criterion seemed the most fair and the most objective to me."
"It is accepted by all Member States."
"We have reliable statistics from the instruments we have been supplied with. And before this is changed, we should think hard so as to be as fair and as objective as we are with this criterion of per capita GDP."
"Mrs Darras, let me make it clear that when the time is right, I will put forward a regional and cohesion policy that will involve all EU countries. Naturally, we shall concentrate, as we have today, on the poorest regions and countries, for this is the true meaning of cohesion, created so that we can opt out of such a scheme when we are successful."
"I am not at all of the opinion that I should create a policy that would ignore other regions that have fewer difficulties but have specific projects and problems all the same, sometimes areas where there is much poverty."
"I will therefore, when the time is right, propose a policy that will involve, with different degrees of intensity depending on the level of development, all regions in Europe and all countries in Europe, while endeavouring - I am responding here to Mr. Lage - to treat all of these regions even-handedly, in particular so as to avoid, Mr Lage, the mechanical effect that I myself raised in the cohesion report and the statistical effect that could, if applied without due care and attention, penalise regions currently within the EU."
"Mr President, I would like to make a short personal statement in relation to the Commissioner' s comment, which I think was inappropriate and particularly unworthy of a Commissioner who normally deals with Parliament and each of its Members in an excellent way."
"Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding."
"All I have done, Commissioner, is ask you the same question that you asked Parliament."
"You cannot therefore tell me that I am being impatient."
"In January, in the second report on cohesion, you asked Parliament which of the four criteria it thought we should adopt."
"Parliament asks the same of the Council and the Commission."
"Secondly, Commissioner, we have enlargement to deal with."
"We are talking about another time and another era."
"I would like you to know, therefore, that all my comments have been made in a constructive spirit, not only today, but for many years, while fighting for cohesion in this Parliament."
"Mr President, it is intolerable that people should embark on another debate when the speaking time has expired and the Commissioner has spoken."
"I would ask you to prevent this in future, otherwise I too would like to speak for another two minutes."
"As it is, I can only say that the Commissioner has replied very well to all our questions and that we are very grateful to him."
"The debate is closed."
"Cohesion Fund (1999) - Structural Funds (1999)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:"
"A5-0248/2001 by Mr Marques, on the Commission' s annual report on the Cohesion Fund 1999 [COM(2000) 822 - C5-0109/2001 - 2001/2058(COS)];"
"A5-0247/2001 by Mr Nogueira Román, on the Commission' s 11th annual report on the Structural Funds (1999) [COM(2000) 698 - C5-0108/2001 - 2001/2057(COS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission report dealing with the activities of the Cohesion Fund in 1999 proves that, as in previous years, it is continuing to pursue the most immediate objectives for which it was created, which are to provide the so-called cohesion countries, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland, with economic infrastructures in the areas of the environment and transport."
"In these two areas, for example, the Cohesion Fund has been crucial to the creation of infrastructures that are essential to the development of my region. Only in 1999, it funded the extension of Madeira' s airport and a major solid waste treatment plant."
"We have further grounds to be satisfied with the activity of the Cohesion Fund in 1999."
"The physical and the financial execution of the projects that have been supported, the distribution of appropriations between the environment and transport, compliance with Community environmental legislation and the distribution of appropriations by beneficiary countries have all continued to respect the Fund' s operational rules."
"Furthermore, no situation involving fraud or duplication of funding between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community fund was uncovered."
"Because everything ran to plan in 1999, because this is the last year of the 1993-1999 programming period and because the Commission report provides a broad overview of developments that have taken place during this period, I feel it is more important to focus my speech on the contribution of the Cohesion Fund to achieving economic and social cohesion, of which it is a fundamental instrument."
"It should be pointed out, incidentally, that the principle of solidarity, a real pillar of the project of European integration, has seen better days, specifically as a result of the two duplications of financial resources granted to structural policies in 1986 and 1992, whose aim was to enable the cohesion countries to better cope with the pressures unleashed by the huge internal market and by Economic and Monetary Union."
"In June 1999, however, when the Heads of State and Government had to decide at the Berlin Summit on the Structural Funds to be allocated for the 2000-2006 period under what came to be known as Agenda 2000, there were no further duplications."
"There was even a visible decrease."
"It was at that Summit that national self-interest supplanted the European interest of a more cohesive and balanced Europe, which had such tireless champions in Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, however, the proximity of enlargement and the need to correct the enormous regional imbalances we will see as a consequence make it imperative that we give new impetus to economic and social cohesion policy."
"We are convinced that the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Michel Barnier are equal to this challenge. We must also consider the fact that giving new impetus to cohesion policy is necessary, not only to deal with the countries that are expected to join the European Union in the near future, but also, even following enlargement, to maintain the fight against the lack of cohesion that still exists in the current European Union of fifteen countries."
"As a matter of fact, regional disparities within the current Europe of fifteen could even increase as a result of the pressures produced by the enlargement process, specifically in the relationships between countries on the periphery of the Union and those at its centre."
"In other words, countries such as Portugal, for example, may become more peripheral and the current centre, which includes London, Paris and such places, may be increased even further because it will become the centre of a Europe that is economically integrated from the west almost to the eastern border."
"We must remember that excessive regional imbalances constitute an economic and political threat to the European Union."
"They are an economic threat because, unless we are able to take full and more efficient advantage of the resources of the most depressed regions, the entire European Union will lose out. They are a political threat because the European Union cannot succeed if it is underpinned by stark territorial and social inequalities."
"Europe must have cohesion or it will not work."
"Not enabling Europe to work is the great risk that we would run if we went ahead with the totally unacceptable idea of renationalising cohesion policies."
"We therefore feel that the creation of the Cohesion Fund by the Treaty of Maastricht has been fully justified."
"This is, as a matter of fact, clearly demonstrated by the balance of the first operational period of the Cohesion Fund between 1993 and 1999."
"The Cohesion Fund, we can now say, has been a major factor for real convergence, and has provided a strong incentive for the beneficiary countries to comply with the nominal convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht."
"We must, therefore, oppose any attempt to abolish the Cohesion Fund."
"We must also draw the lessons of this first period of operation to improve the effectiveness of the Cohesion Fund even further."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the figures provided by the Commission in its 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds - confirmed by the Second Report on economic and social cohesion - show that, despite the budgetary effort made in the 1994-1999 period, the considerable social and territorial inequalities that existed prior to 1994 still remain. The major initial regional differences have remained the same or have increased."
"Proof of this is the fact that the average per capita income of the 10% of the population that lives in the most prosperous regions of the Union is still 2.6 times higher than that of the 10% of the population living in the least-developed regions. Territorial inequalities that existed within certain States that have Objective 1 regions, such as Italy, Spain and Greece are also still very much in evidence."
"In contrast with this situation, we have seen a strengthening in recent years of the area between London, Paris and Hamburg. This is a huge central region, which accounts for only a seventh of Europe' s surface area, but for one-third of its population and which enjoys almost one-half of its total income, in a concentration of cities and employment that threatens the sustainable development of the European Union."
"Unfortunately, nothing suggests that these trends are likely to change over the next few years."
"The budgetary forecasts approved in Agenda 2000 for the present period are extremely restrictive, which means that, whereas in 1999 the percentage of the European Union' s GDP dedicated to cohesion policy reached 0.46%, in 2006 it will not exceed 0.31%, a return to 1994 levels."
"These figures are extremely worrying. Furthermore, one need only look at the experience of German reunification to understand that, if we do not do everything that we can to remedy the situation, the problem will get worse when the enlargement States join the Union."
"Given these circumstances, we must be aware that when we talk about Structural Funds policy, we are not dealing with 'just another' EU problem."
"On the contrary, we are talking about a fundamental issue, in that the direction of political Europe depends to a large extent on positive developments in cohesion policy both with regard to Objective 1 territories in the current EU that still need it and to the new Member States that will require budgetary funds that must not be additional or supplementary funds."
"Unless this is precisely the decision we take, we will see the unacceptable paradox of the much-needed cohesion policy for the new States being paid for with money taken from the budget that is today earmarked for the least developed countries of the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow the European Union to take a step backwards in territorial and social development policy."
"Political Europe would not be what it is today without cohesion policy and it would be hypocritical and irresponsible to call for the one whilst refusing to provide the economic resources to make the other possible."
"In this context, I think that we cannot delay taking a decision that will ensure an increase in the Union' s budget for the next programming period that is considerably higher than 1.27% of the Community GDP."
"Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities sees the European Commission's initiative to mainstream action to support equal opportunities between men and women as an important element in this report."
"This initiative has a political and a symbolic side."
"It highlights the fact that equality between the sexes is a necessary dimension of our endeavour to achieve economic development with social and regional cohesion."
"However, our committee is disappointed that this presentation is regionally based and does not contain accurate data which allow us to assess both women's access to Structural Funds and the impact of Community initiatives on promoting equal opportunities."
"Under the new regulation which applies to the 2000-2006 programming period, mainstreaming equal opportunities for women and men is a priority aim and the Member States are obliged to conduct an ex ante evaluation of their programmes from the point of view of gender equality using indicators and statistics."
"We should take this opportunity to stress that indicators and statistics need to be broken down by gender, something which the European Parliament has called for repeatedly."
"However, we should also stress that we are calling on the European Commission to ensure that the principle of gender equality is duly taken into account and that statistics are kept - not just during programming but throughout the whole monitoring and intervention procedure - on the increase in female employment, the provision of quality, viable new jobs and the creation of infrastructures which allow family and working life to be reconciled."
"And, finally, we want to stress the importance of coordinated action between the European Commission and the Member States on informing regional agencies and all entitled beneficiaries of the possibilities of implementing equal opportunities through Structural Fund measures."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of annual reports is to carry out analyses over a limited period and draw conclusions from them."
"This 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds relates to a year which is undoubtedly very important for the development of the European Union's cohesion policies."
"My group supports the rapporteur on some of the proposed measures and options to improve the management of the Structural Funds, such as speeding up the implementation of approved measures, concentrating assistance in areas whose development is lagging behind or improving on-the-spot checks to combat what is still a very high level of fraud."
"However, we also have some criticisms. We should point out that we do not endorse some of the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, such as the overly negative assessment of the Structural Fund results during the planning period and the failure to meet the regional policy objective of harmonising living conditions, which has supposedly only been achieved in part."
"I would say to the rapporteur that he has adopted the wrong approach to European structural policy, whose task is solely to reduce disparities and which I believe has generally achieved this goal."
"In fact, there will always be a discrepancy between living conditions in the rich and poor regions of the EU, and even within Member States."
"We are daydreaming if we expect harmonisation from the structural policies."
"We should not confuse achievable goals with a wish list here."
"My second point of criticism is that despite all the significance of 1999, the 11th Report is an annual report and not a storehouse catalogue in which all the concerns and problems faced by the European Union in the past, present and future have to be rolled out yet again."
"If reports are to achieve anything, they must focus on specific priorities, as we all know from our years of practical experience here in Parliament."
"This is precisely what this report does not do."
"As I said, the rapporteur's conclusions are not necessarily wrong, but much of what is included in the report really does not need to be there."
"That is why we believe that some of the points raised in the report need to be amended by the plenary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are discussing confirm some of my concerns regarding the execution of the Structural Funds for the 1993-1999 period but, alas, also regarding the new programming period which will end in 2006."
"The most striking example is the vast sum of resources which were not spent during the 1993-1999 period and must be used before 31 December this year."
"I feel that it is right and important to send out a clear warning two months or so before the expiry date."
"We need enthusiastic commitment but, instead, there are regions and States who are irresponsibly disregarding the impending danger of wasting these funds."
"Then there is the fact that it would be useful - so to speak - to learn from the errors and delays which occurred during the 1993-1999 period and avoid repeating them."
"Mr Mastorakis has already quoted some Greek to you and I am going to quote some Latin: errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum."
"This is a well-known saying but many appear to have forgotten it."
"The statistics for the year 2000, with which Commissioner Barnier is familiar, do nothing to allay our fears."
"Despite the increasing endeavours of the Commissioner himself, the innovations contained in the reform of the Structural Funds are being incorporated slowly and laboriously."
"Parliament must seize this opportunity too to reaffirm its right and responsibility to act."
"Parliament, which is the body directly elected by the citizens, cannot remain silent if a fundamental instrument for the development of the Communities and their cohesion is not being properly implemented."
"We must therefore work shoulder to shoulder - Commission, Parliament, Council and regional and local players - to bring about rapid acceleration and to finalise the payments to projects which enhance the competitiveness of regions, particularly those which are most disadvantaged and underdeveloped."
"We must make it clear to everybody that the quality and size of the expenditure, the profitability of the various objectives and the results achieved by the different beneficiaries will be the crucial factors for defining the European Union' s future cohesion strategy."
"Mr President, the first thing that the annual reports on cohesion policy for 1999 point out is that the results have been very poor."
"During the eleven and seven years, respectively, which these Community Funds have been operating, the average per capita income in Spain, Greece and Portugal, which in 1988 stood at 68%, has risen to 79% of the European average in 1999."
"In other words, it has increased by an average of one point per year."
"At this rate, it would take 21 more years for the whole of the European Union to achieve an equal level."
"I have serious doubts about the political will to eliminate the differences and the genuine solidarity of the governments of the Union."
"And I say this because, as Mr Nogueira has pointed out, in 1999 the Funds of the cohesion policy for 92-99 represented 0.46% of GDP, while those from Agenda 2000 until 2006 will only represent 0.31%, that is to say, they will be reduced by 15 points."
"Furthermore, there are some who do not intend to increase their contributions but nevertheless, through these reduced amounts, expect to show solidarity with the new Eastern States which will be part of the enlarged EU."
"Mr President, if we are really committed to equal opportunities, solidarity and a genuine united Europe, we must stop being miserly and we must all give more money, especially the richest amongst us, for the benefit of the poorest."
"Mr President, there is absolutely no doubt about the major role that has been played by the Cohesion Fund in the development of trans-European networks and in environmental operations in the four beneficiary States, and it is certainly very important for the convergence of the economies of the European Union."
"The results achieved, however, are not the same across the board, and it is worth exploring the reasons for this."
"In reality, strangely, there are bureaucratic problems and mechanisms which are still poorly defined, particularly as regards the time frames for the disbursement and use of the funds: this applies to the Cohesion Fund, of which all the appropriations for 1999 were not used, and it applies to the Structural Funds, which did not achieve the 100% expenditure target both because the majority of the resources were committed only just before the end of the programming period and because of the slow rate of disbursement of the appropriations available."
"The delays certainly do not contribute to the overall improvement in socio-economic and employment conditions in the regions concerned."
"In this sense, a crucial moment for both funds is the evaluation, not just an ex ante analysis but also, most importantly, an ex post evaluation, which is no use if it is not carried out within the correct time frame, the correct time frame being before the programming of the subsequent operations, which cannot be carried out rationally if the final evaluation of the previous programmes cannot be taken into account."
"Moreover, the evaluation is necessary in order to verify that the principle of additionality is being respected according to the clear indications of the Court of Auditors, which should be observed."
"Linked to this is the point that it would be beneficial if the Commission were to provide clearer, more comprehensive information of an essentially social and economic rather than accounting nature on the evaluation of projects, highlighting whether the aim of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions has been achieved; the European Parliament needs to receive this information in due time, not - as has happened this time with regard to the Cohesion Fund - two years late, for that clearly makes it impossible to correct shortcomings and reprogramme operations in useful time."
"And this is an operation that is becoming still more necessary in view of the now impending enlargement."
"Finally, we must demand a more active role for Parliament in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the operations and the goals pursued."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that over the years, the Cohesion Fund has helped to make less developed regions within the Union stronger."
"However, it would be a mistake to think that we do not need to question the current level of the Cohesion Fund."
"The impending accession of a number of new Member States alone would prompt this."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Marques has outlined the goals, means and conditions of the Cohesion Fund."
"The fund was set up to help Member States meet the convergence criteria with the EMU in mind."
"There is no ambiguity in this respect."
"The Structural Funds, on the other hand, are designed to help meet other goals."
"The accession requires us to evaluate and revise the structural policy, including that of the Cohesion Fund, but in my opinion, not so many changes are required."
"It is important, however, for the fund only to be used for the purpose it was intended."
"If that is the case, the existing system has many successful years ahead, even following the accession."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, I would briefly like to point out, in relation to the reports that we are currently debating, and as we have seen previously, that we are holding a great debate with an important future in terms of the construction of Europe and also the construction of an enlarged Europe."
"We are dealing with Funds which were established at a particular moment when our objectives involved a policy of economic and social cohesion."
"On the one hand, this policy has clearly been successful but, on the other, we also see that differences remain, as the reports demonstrate."
"Does this mean that this policy has failed?"
"I would say rather that it means that the policy is not only successful for the cohesion countries, for the poorest regions which are receiving significant aid, but also for other regions, in the wealthy countries, which do not receive the aid."
"In the end there is widespread movement throughout Europe and, by means of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, those regions of the richer countries end up benefiting from the aid, because technologies are being bought, because investments are being made by those countries in which technological progress is being made."
"That is perhaps the reason why the differences are being maintained, after the large amounts of aid and the great investments which have been carried out through the Cohesion Fund."
"We are now facing the problems relating to enlargement."
"Does the Cohesion Fund need to be modified?"
"Will the poorer regions stop receiving it?"
"Are the States which have so far been receiving aid going to stop doing so in favour of the new States?"
"I believe that this is currently the great challenge for the Commissioner and for Parliament."
"I believe that the aid must be maintained, that we have to be imaginative and must ensure that the Funds continue to reach all the regions."
"Otherwise, the differences will increase."
"We must make an effort to ensure that the enlargement countries also become economic motors which will allow this policy of economic and social cohesion to eventually lead to a much more just and free Europe."
"We have seen recent examples of the results of poverty and fanaticism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have already told Mr Nogueira that we do not share his negative view - or at least his excessively critical view - of the application of economic and social cohesion."
"I would even go as far as to say that that evaluation should be positive or even better, given how brilliant the results are."
"We would like to make some very specific comments in relation to these two reports on the application of the Funds during the years in question."
"It is the case that the information is good because, firstly, Parliament' s recommendations are complied with."
"The balance between investments in railways and in road infrastructures, in terms of the environment, has moved into line with the parliamentary recommendation."
"There is no report on fraud in the application of these Funds and another series of statistical criteria are correctly complied with."
"But we are not the Court of Auditors."
"What these reports lack is more of a qualitative character: we want to know what qualitative economic and political effect these investments are having; to what extent is the metabolism of these regions being changed; to what extent are the governments correctly applying the investments, directly towards productive investments, as the structural policy demands."
"That is what is lacking in the reports on the application of the Cohesion Fund."
"And this is true in all respects."
"Next year we will have to examine the reports on the application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in 2000 and 2001."
"The data will not be good, but I do not want to condemn it in advance because, if the Commission demonstrates that they have been well used in terms of programming, this will be a qualitative element which Parliament will have to take into account."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds may be the last one on the 1994-1999 programme, but it has many lessons to teach us."
"First of all, we agree with what the rapporteur, Mr Nogueira Román, says about the lack of a complete quantitative description or detailed explanations of these funds."
"Europe must have a genuine return on the funding it grants in order, on the one hand, to monitor that the projects are effectively carried out and that public monies are being put to good use and, on the other hand, to optimise the new programmes."
"Furthermore, the citizens of my region keep making the same criticisms: too complicated, too much red tape, too slow."
"I think we do not give enough precedence to the small structural projects where simplicity and speed are of the essence if we want to respond to real needs on the ground."
"I cannot help wondering about the contradiction between saying we want to give priority to employment, with reference in particular to the Lisbon European Council declarations, while at the same time paying so little attention to the small micro-enterprise and SME projects which, after all and as everyone knows, are the prime job creators."
"It is vital that all of us, beginning with the Commission, try to work more closely with all our fellow-citizens."
"In conclusion, I want to protest about a practice that I personally find unfair and unfounded."
"What I mean is that the Commission could use a form of blackmail - and I am weighing my words here - by tying the funding to strict respect for the environmental obligations it lays down."
"I entirely agree about the growing need to respect our environment, but I am equally against this kind of pseudo-ecological diktat."
"I think that would be a real diversion of these funds which, let me remind you, are supposed to help finance job-creation and wealth-creation projects to combat the economic imbalances between the various European regions."
"Since I know that economic cohesion remains unsatisfactory, let me end by asking what is really behind the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund policy: are these funds designed to be a means of applying pressure or are they designed to provide genuine economic assistance?"
"It is a question worth asking."
"Mr President, I thank both Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira Román for their fine reports, as I thank all the speakers for their comments."
"With regard to Mr Marques' report, relating to 1999, it did indeed arrive rather late, in January 2001."
"I can tell the rapporteur that this was due to the problems of reorganising our Directorate-General."
"Let me now assure him that the report for the year 2000 has been finalised and that the Commission will most probably adopt it in early October."
"Briefly, there are four lessons to be learned."
"The first concerns total and complete financial implementation throughout the programming period."
"It is true that not all the payment appropriations for 1999 were used in full; only 91.6% of available payment appropriations were implemented."
"The reason why the appropriations were not all used is the large number of applications for payments reaching the Commission in December 1999."
"But, on a more positive note, not a single case of fraud or double financing between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community source was detected in 1999."
"I have kept Parliament informed at regular intervals of the progress in implementing the budget and will continue to do so."
"Secondly, there is the question of balancing investment in transport and investment in the environment, which, like you, I consider important."
"Thirdly, I understand and endorse your wish to see the Commission devote more resources to on-the-spot checks."
"Here again, the reorganisation of our departments and in particular the decentralisation of those activities has caused some problems."
"Our Directorate-General is now responsible for carrying out on-the-spot checks of Cohesion Fund measures but also of all the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds."
"Fourthly, Mr Marques, coordination between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has been given real impetus with the new regulations for the period 2000-2006 and, within the Directorate-General, with the integrated management of the various departments concerned with the Cohesion Fund and the other Structural Funds."
"That is what I wanted to say, very briefly - following the President's advice - in response to the four points made in Mr Marques' report, for which I thank him."
"Turning now to the report by Mr Nogueira Román, while thanking him too for his fine report, I would again like to make four comments."
"Firstly, regarding the implementation of the funds in 1999, 99% of appropriations for the period 1994-1999 were committed and 75% were paid."
"That is a figure that, I believe, is broadly satisfactory."
"As you know, on-site payments can be made up to 31 December this year, in accordance with the regulations."
"The payment appropriations will, I think, be implemented in full and for the last two years - this was a job that began before my arrival - I have been working with the Member States to ensure that they are taken up as fully as possible."
"That is a concern that Mr Pittella also raised a moment ago."
"The delays in the start-up of some programmes in 1994 and 1995 have, therefore, been overcome for most of the actions under the on-going programme."
"A similar improvement in the rate of execution can be seen in the programme of Community initiatives, although here the delays were a little more serious."
"It is true, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, that many outstanding commitments still remained to be paid at the end of 1999."
"Basically that was because of the accumulation of projects at the end of the programming period. But let me point out that the situation quite clearly improved in 2000, since the commitments remaining to be paid at the end of 1999 were reduced by 47%."
"In order to keep Parliament more fully informed on the subject, at the end of June 2001 the Commission drew up a full report on the unexpected commitments remaining to be paid for all categories of expenditure."
"Secondly, the rapporteur welcomed the fact that the horizontal theme of 1999 was equality between women and men in the Structural Funds programmes."
"With regard to the Structural Funds for the current period, I can confirm that gender equality has been one of the criteria for accepting plans received from Member States and you can count on Anna Diamantopoulou being very vigilant on this subject; the same applies to Mr Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs Avilés Perea, as I noted a moment ago."
"For the period 1994-1999, however, Member States did not have to provide information on the access of women to the Structural Funds."
"That means that we have no detailed information on these matters for that programming period."
"Thirdly, there is additionality, which the rapporteur sees as open to question, as I do at times."
"On this point I can confirm that the Commission has carefully checked for compliance with this principle during the ex-ante review of new programmes for the period 2000-2006."
"Regarding the previous period, the Commission will conclude its final check on additionality at the end of 2002. I agree about the need for more stringent penalties in the event that a Member State does not respect the principle of additionality."
"As honourable Members will know, no provision is made for such penalties under the fund rules for the period 2000-2006."
"The legislator, chiefly the Council, was firmly opposed to the idea at the time the regulations were adopted."
"We do, however, have some measures we can take in the event that additionality has not been verified and if necessary I shall take these measures in consultation with my colleagues."
"On the subject of evaluation and monitoring, as you know the mid-term ex-ante or ex-post review was fully integrated into the programming for this new 2000-2006 period."
"The Commission has just launched the ex-post evaluation for Objectives 1 and 2 for the 1994-1999 period, together with thematic evaluations of the information society, sustainable development and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"These evaluations, like the mid-term reviews that will be carried out in 2003, will provide answers to any outstanding questions and I will, of course, inform the European Parliament of the results."
"Fourthly, with regard to monitoring, the same vigilance will apply; but here the Commission now has a different role to play."
"As you know, on-the-spot checks now fall within the remit of each Member State, which is obliged to report back to the Commission at regular intervals."
"We for our part will and do verify that each Member State has set up a reliable system of on-the-spot checks."
"Lastly, let me emphasise that the number of these checks also rose in 1999, reaching the figure of 120 compared with 100 in 1998."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me repeat that the Commission is committed to the basic principles of the Structural Funds: concentration, additionality and partnership, and the best possible coordination with the Cohesion Fund."
"In their reports, the rapporteurs urge us to be even more effective and vigilant."
"Let me assure you that I am confident that we will be able to give you even greater satisfaction when we come to study the results and the evaluation for the year 2000."
"That is the year when the new programming will start, together with some new rules."
"I believe we will be able to present more positive results, in response to your demands and to the vigilance that you are showing."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Female genital mutilation"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0285/2001) by Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on female genital mutilation [2001/ 2035(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a small correction to make: I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and not the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I am particularly glad I was appointed draftsman of the opinion on this crucial question, which affects so many women in developing countries aside from those in the Fifteen."
"I am glad because the Commission adopted my opinion unanimously."
"People often look askance at unanimous decisions, suspecting a degree of inattention."
"However, I think the Commission and the members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation voted advisedly in this case and were convinced by the various paragraphs that make up the opinion."
"I would like to draw Members' attention to two other points, aside from the unanimous vote, given that this unanimity is rather inconsistent with the debate that is still on-going in some political groups."
"The first is the right of asylum."
"We supported Mrs Valenciano's suggestion to the Council, the Commission and the Member States in her report that the clauses on right of asylum should indeed include one recognising the immediate right of asylum in the Fifteen of women and girls at risk of being subjected to female genital mutilation."
"That is most important."
"Here the vote was unanimous."
"I therefore hope that a large section of Parliament will also vote for this paragraph tomorrow."
"My second point, Mr President, concerns money."
"We asked for EUR 10 million to finance all the measures aimed at helping these countries escape from this trap."
"I hope that Parliament will vote for it tomorrow and that the Committee on Budgets will follow suit, something the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not done so far."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco for her work, which followed on a resolution supported by 316 Members."
"This may be part of the reason why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the report unanimously."
"The most important element, which Mr Dell' Alba and Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco referred to, recognising the right of asylum of women under threat from genital mutilation, is considered by our committee too to be one of the major, crucial points in this battle."
"I would like to mention once again the two figures which have already been cited: there are 130 million victims in the world; 2 million children undergo genital mutilation every year."
"In addition to the various education and information, humanitarian, social and health initiatives and initiatives supporting non-governmental organisations, in particular, our committee feels that it must single out one in particular: the appeal to the Member States to ensure that female genital mutilation is prosecuted through the rigorous application of existing provisions laying down the right to health and personal integrity as a fundamental right, and the rigorous application of the provisions of the penal code which ban any deliberate action violating this right."
"We demand, that is, for there to be no possible recourse to the concept of exception or cultural diversity to justify relativism or the watering down of this fundamental right or of the related legal protection which is incumbent upon the State."
"We therefore call upon the Commission, the Council and the Member States to endeavour to make our resolutions reality with all speed."
"Thank you very much, Mr Turco."
"We shall now suspend the sitting until 9.00 p.m. when we shall continue the debate."
"I hope that you will gather your strength sufficiently to be back here at 9 on the dot."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with an own-initiative report by the Committee on Women' s Rights which examines a serious problem, the genital mutilation of a great number of women and girls."
"This ancient practice violates the fundamental rights of the women and girls who fall victim to it and therefore constitutes an attack on the fundamental human rights recognised in the Treaties and in the Declarations of the United Nations."
"The report proposes the extension of protection and prevention in all the countries where it is practised and also in the European Union, where we know it is still practised within immigrant communities, or by means of a visit to the country of origin where the genital mutilation is carried out, since this practice is well-established within the customs of many people in Africa and some in Asia."
"Only prevention by means of information campaigns and clear explanation of the irreversible consequences of this practice will help to eradicate it."
"These campaigns must be carried out by NGOs, but with the firm commitment of governments and the decisive support of leaders, religious leaders in particular; education campaigns in schools, directed at boys and girls, such as those being carried out with considerable success in Burkina Faso, as Mrs Campaore has told us today."
"The prosecution of genital mutilation as a crime, both in the country where it is practised and when it is carried out in another country, that is, the extraterritoriality of the crime, will effectively help to eradicate it."
"In serious cases, some countries envisage the right to asylum, as contemplated in the directive under the heading of the right to asylum for reasons of sexual discrimination."
"We believe that to include here, in a general way, the right to asylum for alleged victims, that is to say, for millions of girls and teenagers, is inappropriate."
"We cannot open doors we are then unable to close, and we in the European Union cannot receive all the alleged victims who want to leave their country for this reason."
"The reality is that we cannot do it even if we would like to."
"It is on this issue that the Group of the European Peoples' Party differs with this report, which may mean, in the event that it is approved, that we will abstain in the final vote."
"This is regrettable, because the report has many positive elements, particularly the need for the commitment to include the fight against genital mutilations in all cooperation programmes and to provide them with adequate financial aid, and the demand that the governments of the states where they are practiced commit themselves effectively to their eradication."
"We in the Group of the European Peoples' Party unreservedly condemn genital mutilation and we defend the full physical rights of all women, their full sexual rights and their right to decide on their future even though that decision may be at odds with their people' s traditional past."
"We defend the rights of women as human beings, fully safeguarding their lives where ever they may be, and we are committed to continuing the work to eradicate this horrendous practice regardless of what may happen in relation to this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and a few gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Ms Valenciano for her outstanding report, which sends out a very clear message: genital mutilation is a human rights violation!"
"Various reasons are given to justify this human rights violation in the name of traditional culture or religion."
"In reality, this is an instrument which is intended to perpetuate women's oppression."
"Women who do not want to practise genital mutilation are excluded from society; as outcasts, they face unimaginable poverty and disgrace."
"This grave assault on women, which irreparably damages their bodies, minds and health, has gone largely unnoticed."
"It was only the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 which initiated a global debate and solidarity process and called for the international community to take joint action."
"We also encounter genitally mutilated women in Europe, as well as many different perpetrators and accomplices."
"Although FGM is punishable in many countries, the media and self-help organisations report that there are an estimated 5000 cases in Germany alone, and around four times as many cases involving girls being sent back to their countries of origin to be mutilated."
"There are unscrupulous doctors and other individuals who earn between DM 1000 and 3000 per case."
"The Socialist Group demands that at-risk women be granted asylum, perpetrators be punished, and that we proceed in accordance with the principle of extraterritoriality."
"Let me make this very clear: for my group, this is an important point, and we completely fail to understand why some sections of the PPE-DE - or indeed, the group as a whole - intend to abstain on this asylum issue, have no intention of voting for the report, and are thus abandoning women to their fate."
"The fight against ignorance and oppression must be fought at international level, and the Socialist International has therefore launched a worldwide campaign against violence against women."
"Fifteen states have already banned FGM, including nine African countries."
"More support must be given."
"My government in Germany has already allocated DM 3.8 million for education work and projects."
"The EU is helping with DAPHNE."
"Yet this is just a drop in the ocean."
"We must work together to fight for reproductive health and combat AIDS and genital mutilation."
"Then we will have a chance of reaching women and giving them the help they need."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to express my appreciation to Mrs Valenciano, who, in her excellent report, has tackled this sensitive issue in a clear and compelling manner."
"The Liberal Group will therefore support the report."
"The genital mutilation of women and girls is a terrible violation of fundamental human rights."
"More than 130 million women have already fallen victim to this, and another two million are added every year."
"Europe should therefore pull out all the stops to combat this phenomenon, wherever it appears."
"I too understand that some Members are considering voting against this report on account of the sections on asylum and extraterritoriality."
"However, I would like to reassure everyone: if we consider the present asylum practice, we see that in most of the fifteen Member States, genital mutilation is already a basis for asylum."
"I believe that to be appropriate."
"From that point of view, the report merely accommodates existing practices."
"It is true that at present, the principle of extraterritoriality only applies to child-sex tourism, but it should also cover mutilated women or women who are at risk."
"For this is the only way to prevent EU citizens, for example from Somalian extraction, from taking their daughters to Somalia during the summer holidays to have them mutilated."
"If these people realise that upon their return to Europe, they are at risk of being prosecuted, we then give the parents a weapon with which to protect their daughters against the pressure of society."
"Finally, I would like to direct a comment to those who do not want to deal with genital mutilation due to it constituting an expression of a certain culture or religion."
"In all countries where genital mutilation is practised, local groups are running campaigns to abolish it."
"It is therefore not a case of us imposing our Western standards."
"No, it is precisely these women whom we need to support by showing our solidarity tomorrow during the vote."
"The Koran too leaves no room for mutilation. Despite this, it is mainly in Islamic countries that it is practised."
"We must therefore call on the Imams to help eradicate this phenomenon."
"This is crucial, since we cannot afford negative stereotyping of Islamic beliefs in the current sensitive climate."
"Genital mutilation is not a religious phenomenon, it is a violation of a fundamental human right."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my entire group, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano on this sterling report and the recommendations it contains, to which I subscribe 200%."
"By far the majority of women who have undergone genital mutilation - reference is made to 130 million - live in Africa."
"In at least 28 African countries located between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer, female circumcision is practised systematically."
"Outside Africa, it is practised in southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, on the Arab peninsula in Yemen, in Oman and in the United Arab Emirates."
"Even in a country like Egypt, few tourists who visit the sphinx realise that 90% of the women are circumcised."
"However, some of these women have fled to Europe in order to save their daughters from this treatment, or to have operations in order to ease the pains."
"But if these women were to return to their native country, they would be ostracized."
"On the other hand, a summer holiday in the country of origin can turn into a nightmare for migrant girls, when family members deem it necessary to uphold their tradition."
"I have devoted years of my life to helping women who had fallen victim to the trafficking in human beings."
"From my own experience, I know that circumcised women are often considered unclean and are therefore sold as prostitutes."
"In this way, they become victims twice over."
"African girls, who work in brothels day in day out, who, genitally mutilated, are sold and re-sold, rely on their clients to pay off their debts."
"I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission once again to recognise genital mutilation, or the threat thereof, as a gender-specific reason for granting asylum."
"We should not hide behind a possible review of the Convention of Vienna."
"I would ask those in this House who are still not convinced to watch the videos that are being made of these 'festive occasions' , as they are sometimes referred to in those countries."
"It is of fundamental importance that the silence around this taboo subject is broken."
"That is why socio-cultural programmes in situ, as well as awareness campaigns involving the relevant migrants in Europe must be encouraged."
"We cannot continue to accept this flagrant violation of human rights and of the dignity of the women and girls involved, under the guise of national customs and traditions."
"I would like to take the opportunity of saying that, in view of the excellent quality of the next report by Mrs Smet, our group will not be taking the floor: that report equals perfection."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano once again on the work she has done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance and originality of this courageous report, in comparison with the countless reports and documents adopted by many international bodies, is that, unambiguously and without making any hypocritical concessions, it views the question of female genital mutilation as an issue of freedom, dignity, law and human rights for hundreds, thousands of women in the world."
"I hope that Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco has the support of all of us here. She does not make any hypocritical concessions to supposed respect for traditions or cultural relevatism, which we hear talked about so often, nor does she make any concessions even to the cheap efforts to salve our consciences which so often characterise the positions we adopt."
"Indeed, while emphasising in the report that female genital mutilation is a crime, which must therefore be prosecuted, she proposes a raft of pro-active measures which it will also be our responsibility and the responsibility of the other institutions - Commission and Council - to implement."
"I would, however, like to make one point to Mrs Avilés Perea, for whom I have great admiration."
"You presented to us a situation which does not exist, saying that it would be inappropriate to establish the threat of female genital mutilation as grounds for the right of asylum because that would be to open our doors to millions of women seeking protection."
"You see, Mrs Avilés Perea, if there were millions of women and children who were able to revolt, to come out into the open and flee family, social and male control, then the problem would already be resolved."
"Therefore, the situation must be different: sadly, there are not hundreds of thousands or millions of children and women who currently have the chance to revolt, to come out into the open, to go and knock on the door of an embassy to seek asylum."
"We are in a situation in which there are very few indeed who have the courage to do this, and to think about closing the door even on these few - and I beg you once again to consider this - is not responsible. We would not be doing our duty."
"We would be back in a situation of preaching empty sermons, of cheap efforts to assuage our consciences, of failing to assume responsibilities that our ours, that are the responsibilities of this free, civil, democratic Europe which upholds the rights of all."
"This, I believe, is what we are trying to say in our report tomorrow: we want to say that we are for a world in which human beings are all equal."
"I am convinced that, if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow Members, the issue would have been resolved long ago."
"The problem is that this is not yet the way in which the world works and it is our responsibility, the responsibility of this institution, to set an example."
"Lastly - and I am addressing the Members who are also part of the Committee on Development and Cooperation - today, I have a meeting with the Secretary General of the ACP Secretariat, Ambassador Goulongana, who has declared himself willing to include this matter in the forthcoming meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Brussels at the end of October."
"I know that the agendas are fixed and that it may be too late to make changes, but there must also be an element of political interest in all this that will ensure that some flexibility preserved in this rigid climate!"
"There must be a difference which we can use to our advantage!"
"I hope that the ACP-EU Joint Assembly will approve our position as well as this House."
"Ladies, I would remind all of you who are hesitating that there are very few women - very few indeed - who have the chance, the courage and indeed the good fortune to be able to revolt."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that this report has been presented."
"Every one of us who has read 'Desert Flower' by Waris Dirie will always be shocked and appalled by this practice."
"I am thinking today of the 130 million women and girls who have been subjected to female genital mutilation, and each year some two million more are affected."
"I am also thinking of the many young girls who die horrifically as a result."
"Let me say from the outset that I am strongly in favour of the EU and its Member States adopting a joint position to abolish these practices which are harmful to women's sexual and reproductive health."
"Within the framework of a joint immigration and asylum policy, the Commission and the Council will have to take account of these aspects of female genital mutilation."
"The same applies to refugee policy."
"In this context, let me point out - and this is clear, in my view - that asylum will then be granted primarily when political protection is required for reasons of state."
"Genital mutilation is a grey area, and it is usually carried out by private individuals."
"This makes it even more difficult to combat the practice."
"A great deal of persuasion, public information and educational work is required from all of us and a change of attitude is needed in society as a whole."
"For me, genital mutilation is a human rights violation which I cannot accept under any circumstances or from anyone."
"A public debate on this issue is needed to raise awareness both in the EU and in the developing countries and spare future generations of women this dreadful mutilation."
"Above all, we must ensure - and this has been mentioned by previous speakers - that this practice is also outlawed in the Member States, for I know that there is a major grey area here."
"I ask everyone to work together with a genuine will to stop this practice."
"Mr President, two weeks ago a Swedish TV documentary attracted a great deal of attention when it showed how religious leaders, Christian and Muslim, in Sweden recommend Sunna circumcision, how Swedish citizens have their daughters circumcised in Kenya and Somalia during the summer holidays, how circumcisers are flown into Sweden to conduct circumcisions and how a Swedish doctor failed to report to the social services the fact that he had saved a girl from bleeding to death after her parents had had her circumcised."
"For those of us combating female genital mutilation, it is precisely the support of the holy men for this torture which is most disheartening."
"Religious leaders have a particular responsibility."
"Their influence is enormous and their voices crucial to putting an end to circumcision."
"I welcome the excellent report from Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco with its demands for a holistic strategy for eliminating female genital mutilation within the EU through initiatives such as extensive publicity campaigns and laws against female genital mutilation in all Member States."
"Of particular importance is the requirement for the introduction of specific national laws which also apply to circumcisions beyond national borders and which make it possible to punish citizens when they return home after travelling abroad to have their daughters circumcised."
"In 1999, Sweden became the first and only country in the EU to have this type of extra-territorial legislation, which hopefully will now make it possible to bring to book those Swedes who put their daughters through 'summer holiday circumcision' abroad."
"Another key point in the report, which many have already mentioned, is the requirement that escape from this torture should be taken at least as seriously as escape from political persecution."
"The US and Canada have, on several occasions, already stopped the deportation of girls and young women who have sought asylum for fear of being circumcised."
"Europe should not lag behind in this respect."
"It is high time that we took strong measures to save the two million girls around the world who, each year, are at risk of genital mutilation."
"We place our hope and our confidence in the Commissioner' s returning with practical proposals on which our ministers can then adopt a position."
"Mr President, female genital mutilation is a terrible act of extreme violation which causes serious physical and mental damage and a lifetime of suffering."
"The mortality rate among those who are subjected to this practice is high."
"There is a need for really vigorous efforts to combat this abomination, this terrible act, wherever it occurs."
"This is also a European problem, and it is important to ensure that knowledge, research and documentation on female genital mutilation is improved in Europe."
"We need cooperation in order to find common strategies to ensure that this operation, which is not prescribed by any religion, can be abolished."
"Several Members have highlighted the need to cooperate with religious leaders."
"Those women already circumcised need care and rehabilitation, and we must therefore put our faith in more knowledgeable midwives, social workers and teachers."
"Mrs Theorin referred to what we in Sweden call summer holiday circumcision, which is when girls are taken abroad to be circumcised."
"In my country this is forbidden, and so it is only natural for the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to support the proposals to introduce this ban everywhere."
"This would provide a clear signal that female genital mutilation is illegal at home and illegal abroad and that such mutilation constitutes a violation of human rights."
"Mr President, the use of genital mutilation is an extreme form of female repression which, in some countries, is as old as time itself."
"It was the women of those countries themselves, of Egypt and of Somalia, who told us about their extreme suffering."
"They denounced it and had to overcome a world of prejudice in the process, but they did it for the benefit of their sisters, who were often younger, or their daughters."
"They are asking us to show the same courage."
"A number of women have sent the European Parliament a petition in the same vein."
"We are supported by women across the world."
"Respect for the human being must be judged the same for men and women alike: women' s rights are human rights."
"Allowing this mutilation to take place under medically acceptable conditions does not make the mutilation itself acceptable."
"Neither is the fact that this cruel custom is one of the oldest traditions in some communities - I am deliberately avoiding the term 'religions' , for they have little to do with it - reason for us to tolerate it."
"The sexual mutilation of girls must be considered a punishable offence in every country and every society, as demanded in various international agreements."
"A positive development is that, in any event, an increasing number of countries have prohibited genital mutilation in women. But in many cases, they are merely paying lip service to this ban, and we should therefore amend the Cotonou Agreement so that we can implement it in the same way as for human rights violations."
"For the rest, I share the view of fellow MEPs."
"Mr President, Valenciano Martínez-Orozco' s excellent report clearly states that female genital mutilation is a crime, about which Europe must not remain silent."
"I too appeal to all Members of Parliament to show their unanimous support for the report in tomorrow' s vote."
"Female genital mutilation, of whatever degree, is an act of violence against women, which violates their fundamental rights, their individual integrity, and their physical and mental health."
"The rights of women, young girls or baby girls are being trampled on in the name of various cultural traditions or even the assumed dictates of religion."
"Ever present in the background, however, is women' s social status and position, which is inferior to that of men in these cultures."
"There is therefore also a need to promote equality."
"Regrettably, female genital mutilation has been found to have taken place and to be taking place in immigrant communities in the EU also, although this practice is prohibited in the criminal legislation of Member States and it is clearly in breach of the principles of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"No religious or cultural practice can be allowed to take precedence over the basic principles of human rights or someone' s physical and mental integrity, on which European democracy is based."
"We must also vehemently resist the demand that genital mutilation should be carried out by doctors in clinical conditions."
"This must not be compared to male circumcision, where this practice has been adopted in some Member States."
"I support the report' s positive measures that aim to end these crimes in EU Member States."
"Information, awareness-raising and prevention must be the priorities."
"But we also have to take action where the crime of mutilation has already occurred, with penal measures and sanctions."
"Personally, I am also prepared to adopt the principle of extraterritoriality in this connection."
"I urge authorities in the Member States, and, as a Finnish member, obviously those in my native country of Finland in particular, to implement all necessary measures as soon as possible to bring to an end these inhuman violations of human rights, which are something out of the Middle Ages."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco on her excellent and comprehensive report."
"It is a fact that, for millions of women throughout the world, genital mutilation is an unavoidable, terrifying ordeal which they have to go through if they are to survive."
"The absence of any alternative and a complete lack of information are one of the most serious problems for women who suffer this degrading mutilation, which is one of the worse forms of suppression, terrorism and exploitation of women, a criminal practice which violates their personal freedom, their physical integrity, their freedom of conscience and their right to health by causing serious physical injury and mental side effects, not to mention the impact on their sexual identity and ability to bear children."
"One hundred and thirty million mutilated women in the world is a terrifying number."
"Unfortunately, this horrible practice has also been introduced into the European Union."
"According to a statement by the British Medical Association, three thousand women are mutilated in the United Kingdom every year and naturally the fundamentalists, even within the European Union, have no hesitation in applying mediaeval practices in order to subjugate women and control their sexuality."
"Every human being is entitled to protection under the law when fundamental freedoms and rights are at risk, as is the case with mutilation."
"However, European Union law seriously lacks any teeth, which is why we are calling for legislation to be applied which will make this horrible practice a crime."
"And, of course, the European Union can exert a great deal of influence through the trade agreements under the Cotonou agreement which it concludes with countries in which such practices are rife and by introducing extraterritorial legislation."
"Finally, I should like to call on the PPE-DE, for us to unite in demonstrating our solidarity with the thousands of women who have undergone this horrible procedure and for you to change your decision by tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, female genital mutilation inflicts endless pain and suffering on women and girls in at least 25 African countries, most of them ACP countries."
"Women are the victims of violent and life-threatening cultural traditions which must be ended, for a tradition which violates individual rights - in this case women's rights - in a truly horrific way must not be allowed to continue in the twenty-first century."
"Thankfully, the ACP countries in Africa are increasingly recognising this fact."
"It is gratifying that Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Uganda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic and the Côte d' Ivoire have legislated against female genital mutilation."
"Efforts are also being made - with the support of aid organisations and numerous NGOs - to stop this dreadful practice through public information campaigns and awareness-raising."
"In this context, a resolution adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at its last meeting in Libreville (Gabon), Ms Bonino, should be emphasised in positive terms."
"Supported by the representatives of the ACP countries, the resolution called unanimously on the authorities to take the necessary steps to end this practice, adopting all appropriate legislative, administrative and judicial measures and launching cultural awareness and information campaigns."
"The meeting thus branded the practice as a human rights violation. This is a great improvement on the earlier taboos surrounding this issue, and we must pay tribute to it."
"However, the battle to protect the physical and mental integrity of women in the ACP countries and elsewhere is still not won."
"Our solidarity and support are still needed."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco and start by stressing the political importance and impact of this report, which will of course be even greater if it is supported by a large majority."
"This report will give momentum both to the Commission's work and, more importantly, to the women's organisations in Europe and Africa trying to combat this barbaric practice."
"This is a problem which, as several Members of Parliament have said, does not only exist in Africa."
"According to data from the DAPHNE programme, there are about 700,000 women from these countries in Europe today."
"It is difficult to quote an actual figure but we suspect that it is much higher than we can possibly imagine."
"This is a difficult, thorny problem."
"Obviously cultural traditions which go back centuries in certain areas of our planet form part of it."
"But a cultural tradition cannot be used as an alibi for trampling all over human rights."
"Obviously, as stated at the World Conference in Beijing, genital mutilation is a violation of human rights and, at a secondary level, it is discrimination, because it only applies to women and girls."
"What can the European Union do?"
"First, proposals and legislation."
"There is some disagreement as to whether the present Treaty provides a legal basis for European legislation."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice cannot as yet form a legal basis."
"However, legislation is not always the only solution and there is a great deal which can be done in this area."
"The question of asylum."
"Several speakers raised this argument and the report is clear here."
"May I say that, a few days ago, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive to the Council on the adoption of minimum requirements for recognising the status of third country nationals or stateless persons or refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention. After a great deal of discussion and effort, the text includes a clear reference stating that applications for protection for women will be recognised, especially where there is a probability of sexual violence or some other gender-related conduct."
"I think, therefore, that it is worth examining this Commission proposal, which could provide a basis for an agreement which would be very important to all the groups in the European Parliament."
"However, over and above the legislative framework, current European Union programmes can be used as a basis for supporting action and campaigns to recognise the problem, mobilise society and increase public awareness and, of course, to inform and educate hospital staff."
"Medical and health workers in at least five countries in the European Union often come into contact with such cases and they must be specially trained and specially qualified to help these people."
"The potential for educating and supporting immigrants. Clearly, women need financial resources if they are to be financially independent and organise their own rebellion, and support for female immigrants in Europe is therefore paramount."
"We can support them and integrate them into the labour market and fund information and public awareness campaigns through existing programmes which we have already debated in Parliament and we are waiting for proposals from non-governmental organisations on these issues."
"As far as our relations with the third world are concerned, we have already made a serious effort to ensure that development aid is predicated on respect for human rights by governments, especially in this area, and to take account of governments' efforts to apply policies to educate, train, raise awareness and support women and families."
"We already intend, in collaboration with the development sector and the Commissioner responsible, to increase financial support to countries intent on wiping out this practice."
"I think we can draw satisfactory conclusions from the implementation of this programme in Ethiopia as to what we can achieve if the European Union works with governments through development aid."
"Finally, we appreciate that non-governmental organisations can act as a catalyst both in the European Union and in Africa, which is why they are the Commission's main contacts, our main partners in this endeavour."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Equal pay for work of equal value"
"The next item is the report (A5-0275/2001) drawn up by Mrs Smet on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on equal pay for work of equal value."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the judicial instruments at European level and in the Member States banning wage discrimination, there are still considerable and persistent wage differences between men and women."
"The figures that are available to us from - indeed very interesting - European studies, show that there is a wage gap of 25 to 28% and in some countries as high as 30%."
"For example, the wage gap is greater in the private sector than in the public sector, the industrial and agricultural sectors have greater wage differentials than the service sector, and the gap seems to be widest in those sectors where women are underrepresented."
"It is not always easy to interpret these statistics correctly. But it is generally accepted that the different career patterns of men and women account for about half of the wage gap - for example, women interrupt their careers more easily than men, with slower career progress as a result - the lower qualifications especially of older working women, the fact that working women are on average younger than working men - in other words, the objective, structural differences."
"The other half of the wage gap, however, cannot be explained objectively and seems to suggest that there are hidden mechanisms of discrimination at play which lead to the undervaluing of female-dominated jobs and professions."
"The key mechanism is the job evaluation system, by means of which different jobs are ranked according to importance, and according to that job ranking, are allocated their salary scales."
"In most cases, this job evaluation is done by the social partners, whether or not based on a system set up by an advisory office."
"Discrimination in job evaluation is evident from the fact that too low a value is placed on characteristics associated with traditionally feminine jobs, including social skills, women' s greater capacity to concentrate and greater dexterity."
"As they are awarded lower scores, valued less, these jobs are thus given too low a place in task hierarchies and payrolls, which means that the wage level for women is lower."
"At the same time, the characteristics associated with traditionally masculine jobs, for example technical insight, physically demanding work or financial responsibility, are correspondingly over-valued."
"In general, workers do not know how their job is classified."
"It is even open to question how much insight the social partners have into how jobs are classified within businesses."
"Moreover, women are generally not involved in job evaluation since they are not the negotiators with the social partners."
"The question then arises as to what Europe can do about this."
"Commissioner, I believe that first of all, the gathering of statistical data on wages of men and women, and on wage differentials, must drastically improve."
"At present, the gathering of statistical data both at European level and in most Member States leaves something to be desired."
"This should therefore be addressed first."
"I know that the Commission has appointed a group of experts to set this in motion, but I would also urge them to look for an explanation of the wage differentials."
"Secondly, the European Union would do well to delve deeper into the issue of discrimination in job evaluation."
"For this purpose, an initiative could be launched, for example to supplement the Directive of 1975 which deals with equal pay, with an annexe in which a number of rules and criteria are laid down which guarantee a gender-neutral evaluation system."
"The Member States need a guide. So do the social partners."
"In my opinion, Europe could provide the perfect solution. Moreover, the social partners must be committed to ensuring transparency concerning the value scales used in the wage formation process."
"How can people find out if their wage is or is not the product of discrimination if there is no transparency whatsoever in the way in which their wage is determined?"
"The social partners should commit in the same way to involving more women in wage negotiations, particularly to removing discrimination and at long last making wage discrimination No 1 on their agenda, for that never happens."
"In addition, the guidelines for employment must be tightened up with quantitative objectives, target dates and goals in mind."
"They are not included, not even in the new guidelines, even though they are much better than the previous ones."
"This must be followed much more closely."
"I have never heard the Commission complain about the fact that the national action plans devote too little attention to this issue."
"In summary, there is a need for a global policy strategy."
"All these elements would form part of this and of the campaign which the Commission intends to launch and which could, in fact, be a useful tool in highlighting a number of these matters."
"Commissioner, I would therefore urge you to make this item for once a priority for the benefit of women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on her report and thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for adopting so many of the conclusions produced by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Three things are clear: one, women's wages are on average lower than men's across all occupations; two, women are predominantly employed in areas where the work has traditionally been regarded as of less value; three, women comprise a significantly higher proportion of part-time workers than men."
"The problem is therefore, clearly a deeply rooted one and cannot be solved without concerted action by all parties."
"This must include the introduction of job evaluation schemes based on objective, gender-neutral criteria, so that the current undervaluing of women's skills is brought to an end."
"However, we need also, as Mrs Smet has said, a much wider range of initiatives designed to tackle the structural disadvantages suffered by women on the labour market."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is appreciative of the extent to which the Commission is already addressing the issue through its proposals for the employment guidelines in 2002."
"The emphasis on gender mainstreaming and the strengthening of guideline 17 are particularly welcome."
"We also look forward to the proposals the Commission may have for a revision and updating of the 1975 equal pay directive."
"In the meantime, we call on both the Member States and the social partners to involve themselves actively in developing measures of the kind urgently needed to eliminate the gender pay gap."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report, which was so necessary and which she has produced in a very professional way, because she has a profound knowledge of the problem and has done a lot of work on it."
"But despite the fact that it is a very good report which attempts to study each of the points relating to inequality of pay between men and women, today we are facing a deep-seated problem to which we see no solution."
"It is more difficult for women to find work than it is for men, they have more difficulties in terms of training and professional promotion and they have lower salaries than men."
"But this does not only affect women who have been in the labour market for some time, but it also affects young women who are very well prepared, in many cases better prepared than men, who do brilliant work and who receive lower salaries than their male colleagues."
"There is no justification for it whatsoever, there is no legislation which allows it in any of the countries of the European Union but, despite all this, it is a reality which we are facing and which we have no idea how to solve."
"Social partners, both company organisations and unions, probably have a large role to play in resolving this problem."
"I am sure that, if there were more women in the leadership of these organisations, the issue would probably have been dealt with a long time ago."
"It is very regrettable that, while we are combating many other types of discrimination which are sometimes difficult to demonstrate, we have still not been able to resolve this one which is so obvious, which is reflected in the figures which appear on everybody' s payslips every month."
"I believe that the fact that women' s work is undervalued, that their work has always been considered subordinate to men' s work, that it has always been thought that they are not capable of holding top positions, are prejudices which are still present in society' s mentality, which hinder equality, professional access and greater promotion for women."
"I would ask the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, to seek some initiative which will contribute to resolving this problem."
"If in a Member State of the European Union somebody suffering discrimination presents a case and wins it, if they work in the public sector, their greatest problem will be confronting the dirty looks of their colleagues, but if they work in the private sector, sooner or later it will lead to them leaving their job."
"This means that many women do not even use the legal resources available to them."
"Mr President, this is a very important issue because this is discrimination which faces all women, not only in the EU, but across the world."
"We therefore welcome this report as its findings are indeed serious."
"It shows, as the rapporteur said, that there is a 20-25% difference between male and female earnings on average in the European Union and that in some Member States the situation is much worse."
"This report is a very practical one, putting forward measures which actually suggest very concrete things which can be done to address this very difficult issue."
"So we support the measures set out in the report and call for this action to be taken sooner rather than later, because this is discrimination that women have faced for a very long time."
"We have hundreds of years of discrimination to address and we need to get on with doing that. I certainly support all calls for this to become a priority for the EU and for the Commission."
"I would particularly like to draw attention to the fact that there are three Member States mentioned in the report in which the situation is significantly worse, worse enough for them to be singled out in the report."
"Those Member States therefore have a special responsibility to take action and to ensure that they get themselves up to the EU average as quickly as possible."
"There are two other things in the report I would like to highlight."
"First of all awareness campaigns: these are something that Member States could actually do without too much difficulty."
"They will not address the actual issues in the workplace, but it is something which governments can do relatively easily."
"The other thing which the report mentions, which I would like to draw attention to, is that governments themselves can provide a model, and I therefore call on Member State governments to look at their own employment policies and identify how they might become better employers themselves."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Smet for a quite outstanding report."
"However, I cannot omit to say that I find it disgraceful that, in the year 2001, we are still discussing these problems, and we know into the bargain that enlargement is not going to make matters any better, to put it mildly."
"The conclusion is that not only do women have lower paid jobs but, as a result, they do not get the plum management positions either, their having access to which is one of the prerequisites for our being able to change the situation."
"If, however, I wanted to take the floor here this evening, it is because I want to draw your attention to a study which has just been published in Denmark and which shows that 'unequal pay' has its origins in childhood."
"The study shows that girls receive far less pocket money than boys."
"They are given far fewer consumer goods than boys and they earn less than boys, which means that boys begin saving up while they are still children. Inequality has thus already been established."
"This applies to all age groups, except for the 16 to 18 group."
"In all other age groups, girls are given less pocket money than boys."
"It is parents themselves, indeed women themselves, who give their girls less pocket money than their boys."
"It might also be added that boys have much better jobs and so earn more, too."
"The situation is the same regarding consumer goods."
"It turns out, of course, that boys have more TV sets, more PCs in their rooms etc."
"Perhaps we should begin with ourselves."
"Parents must give some thought to how they treat their children and prevent their being treated unequally from the cradle onwards."
"I recommend obtaining this Danish report."
"I thought it was very interesting."
"I thank Mrs Smet for having taken the initiative to draft this report."
"I would like to point to three difficulties but first of all I want to make one thing clear: when we refer to a 25% wage gap, this covers all occupations taken together."
"In general the figure is 15% in the case of equal work."
"The reason I want to remind you of these two figures and these two concepts is because it is most important to highlight the difficulties we find ourselves in today, as my colleagues have done."
"The situation is extremely difficult and the solutions are not very visible or effective."
"Let me draw attention to three points."
"Firstly, in France, for example, women only occupy 10% of all jobs."
"Of every 300 jobs, only 30 are filled by women."
"Women therefore have access to 10% of all the jobs on offer. So there certainly is a need for a change of approach."
"Secondly, in this report we refer to atypical work."
"It is also known as part-time work."
"Some countries think it is good for women."
"Personally, I do not think so at all."
"That is not the way to achieve equal pay and economic equality. For there cannot be equal pay without economic equality."
"Thirdly, we need equal representation in the social partners' decision-making bodies."
"I would certainly be the first to fight for parity between men and women in the social partners' decision-making. But there are many jobs where no social partners exist, that is, all service jobs."
"So what can we do there?"
"We have laid down a law on night work in France, which says that the social partners must address the matter."
"But there are no social partners in the case of these jobs, which poses serious problems."
"I would just like to ask the Commissioner for one thing in face of all these immense difficulties: that we lay emphasis on the question of equal pay at the second reading of the 1976 directive we are currently revising together with you and with the Council."
"This issue does not seem to be welcome in the discussions with the Council."
"I think it is quite essential if there is to be any point to this revision of the 1976 directive."
"If we are once again to talk about equal pay, even if it is a principle that has already been introduced by the Treaty of Rome, it must be time for us to ask ourselves whether other strategies might not be necessary to abolish the wage gap between men and women when the EU' s overall efforts have proved a failure."
"I believe that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we must in future transfer more of the responsibility to the individual Member States."
"It is in individual workplaces that experience is gained."
"To be quite specific, it must be up to the individual countries, via the two sides of industry, to incorporate the principle of equal pay into national collective agreements."
"We must take account of the fact that there are differences between collective agreements and wage agreement systems in the Member States."
"Instead of direct EU legislation in this area, the EU must provide guidelines and recommendations, and the principle must be incorporated, more than it has been so far, into national action plans for employment and non-discrimination."
"In the years to come, the labour market will have a need for a larger workforce, and it is therefore important for us to expend more energy on creating better conditions for women."
"All in all, I am able to support all the initiatives put forward in the Smet report."
"Mr President, efforts to equalise pay for male and female workers for work of equal value have been made at European level since 1951."
"In 1957, this was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome as a guiding principle and in 1975 in a directive."
"Despite the legal ban on wage discrimination, there is, as has been said on several occasions today, still a wage gap in the EU at the moment."
"That is unacceptable."
"I appreciate that in some cases, it is difficult to establish an objective wage formation process or job evaluation procedure, but that does not take away from the need for more transparency and gender-neutrality."
"The report rightly mentions value discrimination."
"That is where the government could step in, but so could the social partners."
"As stated before, they too play a significant role."
"It is also important to involve women more in wage negotiations and in the decision-making process in general, and to recruit more women in decision-making bodies."
"It is embarrassing that the statistics available at European level on male and female wage differentials are out of date and incomplete."
"I therefore welcome the initiative to collect new data and I support the idea of carrying out further studies into the factors which affect salary scales, as well as the causes of unequal pay for work of equal value."
"A wage difference of 15% remaining after taking into consideration aspects such as age, training and career level is, as already mentioned, not acceptable."
"The topic we are discussing at the moment cannot be seen in isolation from other aspects related to women and the participation of women in work."
"It is closely related to aspects such as access to work, chances of promotion, a combination of work and care, etc."
"Equal pay for work of equal value can help break the vicious circle of lifelong inequality: lower pay leads to a smaller pension or to more work in order to obtain the same pension; more work often entails a greater need for child care, less time to develop other talents or abilities or to relax outside work, etc."
"I am pleased that the Belgian Presidency prioritises this issue and hope that the Member States will take this appeal seriously this time."
"I am also expecting the campaign on this topic in the year 2002 to provide a boost for it."
"The report we are discussing is an initiative report."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Smet, on her work."
"It is mainly thanks to her commitment that this initiative report is now before us."
"It outlines once more a number of aspects very clearly and offers specific directions for solutions."
"Mr President, the report's estimated 28% pay differential between men and women is particularly revolting because in many cases even men are not paid nearly enough to make a decent living in the twenty-first century."
"But it is not enough simply to make this statement; if Parliament really wanted to put an end to this injustice it would take binding measures and force all employers without exception to respect the principle of equal treatment for men and women on pain of heavy penalties."
"There are areas in which Parliament is able to adopt binding measures."
"But judging by the woolly proposals in the report, there is no question of adopting coercive measures towards employers."
"Under these circumstances, even if the European Parliament votes in favour this will be a complete waste of time."
"It will be up to working women to impose equality themselves, joining forces with the workers to demand a living wage for all."
"Mr President, Mrs Smet's report is the outcome of serious study as well as political experience and personal commitment, which is why it was enthusiastically adopted by a large majority in committee."
"It deals with a general practice, which is common to all the social and economic systems of Europe, a harsh reality which will cancel out all legislative progress, be it at national or European level."
"Women have difficulty not just in accessing work but in advancing their careers and levels of pay."
"The last report on employment tell us that most of the Member States have given up trying to right this wrong and that this issue is missing from the social dialogue agenda in most countries."
"We urge the Commission to call on the Member States to conduct a serious assessment, as the rapporteur suggests."
"And to avoid repeating what has been said by my fellow Members, with whom I fully concur, I should like to suggest to you, Commissioner, that we take a global approach to this issue both in your policy and in that of the Member States."
"The political practices which apply in numerous countries in the European Union in the area of women's employment, social protection and pensions marginalise them professionally, marginalise their ambitions, efforts, competitiveness and claims and hence their pay."
"Our role, your role is a difficult one; we must convince public opinion and women themselves that all these issues are interlinked. We must convince them that their so-called vested rights run counter to their interests and to the quality and viability of and pay for their work."
"Commissioner, please help the governments bear the political price which this endeavour and change usually imply."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report and on the thorough, comprehensive document before us."
"The wage gap between men and women is a well-known phenomenon which is present in all the States of the Union, although in different proportions, and the issue has been on our agendas for a long time now."
"Previous speakers have mentioned the World Labour Organisation Convention of 1951, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the 1995 directive and the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"A great deal has been done, including in terms of the measures to be taken."
"The Commission has been presenting recommendations for over 10 years now, sometimes at Parliament' s request;"
"I also remember the code of conduct prepared by the Commission which sought to raise awareness in the Member States and the two sides of industry in order to take practical action in this field."
"Although the information is still not complete, analysis of the phenomenon allows us to understand the reasons for the existence of the differentials."
"There are structural reasons, which have been recorded, such as age, training, seniority, and precarious and part-time work, in which mainly women are employed."
"However, there is also genuine discrimination, direct discrimination - in some cases there is unequal pay for equal work - but, above all, value discrimination: women' s work is still considered to be of less value than men' s, even when they have the same qualifications and responsibilities."
"Here is an example from my country: it was only in the mid-1980' s, after 15 years of campaigning, that a pay rise was at last obtained in the textile workers' pay agreement for the category of workers 'packing supervisor' , which exists in the textiles sector."
"I feel that this is a tangible example of an issue which was only resolved in Italy in the mid-80s and which still remains unresolved today in a great many other situations."
"The rapporteur has made numerous proposals and, in my opinion, we should follow her recommendations."
"The Commissioner and the Commission are very open to such proposals and the employment guidelines for 2002 make this a priority too."
"Mr President, I too want to begin by thanking Mrs Smet for the excellent job she has done and, in particular, for the high quality of her explanatory statement."
"Looking at this report, we all have to acknowledge a sad fact today."
"In spite of the many initiatives taken over the years and in spite of the positive action taken by the Commission, the pay gap between the women and men of the European Union remains."
"Not only do women on average earn 28% less than men for a job of equal value, often their jobs are also more precarious and unpleasant, an issue that is not raised often enough."
"More women than men are unemployed and more of them are long-term unemployed; finally, most of the time it is they who look after the children and sometimes other dependents too."
"Of course we have to take action, and in several directions."
"That is why I agree with the spirit and the proposals in this report: we need to set up a group of experts to improve the collection of statistical data; it is a good idea to launch a major Europe-wide campaign in 2002; and it would no doubt be useful to take that opportunity to publish a comparative report on the various Member States."
"Similarly, as the rapporteur proposes, we must review the 1975 directive and do something about training, to ensure that women really have the right to lifelong training, encourage the social partners to increase the participation of women in collective bargaining and, finally, take measures to help reconcile working and family life."
"To ensure, however, that this goes beyond statements of intent, all the political leaders of the Union really must get down to work and clearly state their resolve to do so."
"Indeed, at a time when we are entering a new world and facing terrible challenges, those who govern us must realise that this situation is not just discriminatory and unjust, it is not just counterproductive; it is a daily contradiction of the values we believe in and the model of society that Europe must uphold."
"Mr President, I too should like to make a point of congratulating Mrs Smet, whose report demonstrates her personal knowledge of and experience in this matter."
"The pay differential is the clearest and plainest expression of inequality between the sexes."
"We have heard data and analyses of the causes of the present inequality and I do not intend to repeat them."
"I intend to talk about what is being done today in terms of policy and planning."
"As you know, the fourth line of action in the strategy on employment, which relates to equal opportunities, has dealt with the issue of unequal pay since the strategy on employment was first implemented back in 1999."
"Over the years, from 1999 onwards, the Commission has evaluated the policies of each Member State on the question of equal pay."
"What we have found over the last three years is that several, not all of the Member States, have noticed the differential, have noticed the problem and have proposed policies and measures to combat it."
"The Commission refers specifically to this issue every year in its joint report on the basis of the data at its disposal and makes suggestions to the Member States as regards their policies."
"The question which arises here is what tools does the Commission have at hand to make this assessment."
"And this, of course, is where we come up against the problem of indicators and statistics to which Mrs Smet referred."
"We need new subjects and new statistical analyses of them so that we can formulate the problem in absolute terms."
"The Commission is already working on this and I should like to give you one example."
"We need a statistical analysis of the ratio between men and women as regards the hourly wage for paid employees working longer than 15 hours."
"We need to analyse gross and net salaries in the public and private sectors and that means a breakdown by age, education, profession, economic activity, type of work and employment status."
"Very few countries have statistics in the form which I have referred to."
"And apart from the problem of the subject of the statistical analysis, we also have the problem of how to carry out statistical research."
"In some Member States, there is a huge gap between the date on which data is collected and the date on which the final results are published."
"And this does not just apply to the Member States, it also applies to some of the statistics published by the European Union itself."
"So improving statistics, which are a very important tool for improving policies, is our number one priority."
"You will see that this year's suggestions to several Member States refer specifically to the need to improve statistics systems."
"The second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002."
"I appreciate that this is a very clear strategy which calls on the Member States to set specific targets to reduce the wage differential between men and women."
"And, of course, our objective is to work with all the Member States and to exchange best practices so that some countries can imitate changes which are already under way."
"The third point I wish to raise is that in the fifth programme, which is starting up now - the evaluation of the proposals submitted is being completed - the first priority when selecting proposals is the question of equal pay."
"We have divided the priorities which need to be set by the programme into five individual areas so that we can study the question of equal pay and move on to the question highlighted by several lady Members, that is, the need for an integrated strategy."
"A few days ago, on 13 September, the Belgian Presidency and the Commission held a major conference on the question of equal pay."
"Mr President, honourable Members, may I say that our final decision on revising the existing directive will take account of the results of all these actions and the policy evaluation which I mentioned."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Harassment in the work place"
"The next item is the report (A5-0283/2001) drawn up by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on harassment at the workplace."
"Mr President, the subject of this own-initiative report is certainly not a new problem, but a problem only recently highlighted."
"According to the Dublin Foundation, harassment in the workplace is on quite an extensive scale."
"Eight percent of EU citizens, or around twelve million people, have felt harassed in the workplace during the past twelve months."
"What is this due to, and are there any connections to be made? Yes."
"We know, for example, that insecurity of employment plays a role."
"We also know that those who are harassed suffer more stress than others."
"We know that those with high-pressure jobs also suffer more."
"The issue is one of security in working life and the organisation of work."
"What are the consequences of harassment?"
"Harassment naturally has consequences for the individual, who feels less well, is absent from work more often and is ill more often."
"The whole team, including those who are not themselves being bullied, functions less well."
"Bullying also has consequences for companies in the form of lower productivity, reduced profitability and poorer working conditions within the company"
"I have been asked why the EU should concern itself with these issues and what all this has to do with the Community."
"Well, harassment in the workplace is a problem common to all Member States, but it receives very different attention in different places."
"In recent years, we have increasingly started to talk about more job opportunities and better workplaces, that is, about the quality of working life."
"Quality in working life is about health and safety and the organisation of work, and so harassment in the workplace is a problem."
"The EU has had legislation for a long time regarding health and safety at work."
"What do we need to do?"
"Firstly, we have to review the definition of harassment and, at the same time, try to obtain a common definition."
"We have to obtain significantly better statistical data, and the Dublin Foundation and Eurostat have a future role to play in this connection."
"We also have to work on the open coordination method."
"Member States need to develop their legislation, regulations, etc. so that best practice prevails, and that means looking at each others' solutions."
"The Lisbon Process also includes qualitative indicators."
"Where does legislation come in?"
"Should we state in advance that legislation is not needed in this area, bordering as it does upon another area in which the EU already has legislation, namely that of health and safety?"
"We currently have a major ongoing debate on health and safety in which it is assumed that it is not only the physical, but also the psycho-social, working environment which has an impact and which will be of ever greater significance for the new working life of the future."
"Women in particular are affected by atypical jobs, insecure employment, etc."
"The issue of legislation is highlighted in two points in the report, although it is not stated that we definitely should have legislation or how such legislation should be formulated."
"In issuing its communications about a Community strategy concerning health and safety at work and the strengthening of the quality dimension in employment and social policy, as well as in publishing its Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility, the Commission is urged to take account of the problem of harassment in the workplace and to consider the need for legislation."
"Of course, it is possible that the Commission will say that we do not need, and will not have, such legislation."
"In that case, we shall have to conduct an analysis, but I find it pretty incomprehensible why the possibility of legislation should be ruled out in advance."
"It is likely that the framework directive on health and safety at work also covers aspects of the psycho-social working environment, but we would like clarification on this point."
"If we receive such clarification, there is no problem but, otherwise, the scope of the framework directive will have to be expanded to include the essential 'new' area."
"In this context, it must also be considered whether there is a need for some kind of regulations or legislation regarding harassment in the workplace."
"Let me take an example from my own country."
"We have framework legislation which states that the employer is responsible for dealing with harassment in the workplace when this occurs."
"It does not state in detail how, in fact, it should be dealt with, but it is clear that the employer has a responsibility."
"Paragraph 24 of the report urges the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the situation regarding harassment in the workplace and then to present an action programme."
"This is probably the most important point in the whole report."
"Mr President, first of all, allow me to congratulate the instigator of this report, Mr Andersson: he has tackled a new issue that is regulated in some measure in only a few Member States."
"I welcome the fact that, as frequently happens, Europe leads the way in a number of cases."
"Well done."
"Why did the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities give its opinion specifically on this subject matter?"
"It is, of course, a problem which affects men and women alike, but our committee considered that women often, far more often in fact, fall victim to this and other kinds of harassment, which very often lead to sexual harassment."
"Our committee therefore had its role to fulfil and has issued its advice."
"I think that we should all be aware of the fact that this is a new problem."
"We can learn from the measures which many Member States have taken in terms of sexual violence, for coming up with a policy to tackle moral intimidation in the work place is not so easy or self-evident."
"But there are a number of Member States that are attempting to do just that, and many Member States have experience of combating sexual violence."
"What can we do?"
"First of all, a preventive approach can be adopted, which means that companies must make it clear to their staff that they do not tolerate harassment at work."
"That would introduce a preventive stance."
"Secondly, an intermediary could be appointed who could mediate between two parties if a problem arises."
"To reach a solution in a company via mediation is always preferable to one of the parties having to take matters to court."
"I prefer this type of solution."
"Thirdly, if a solution is difficult to find, the management could impose penalties."
"Fourthly, the option of going to court must at any rate remain open."
"The above appear to me to be practical solutions which we could put in place."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been intending to discuss the problem of workplace harassment here in the European Parliament for some time."
"The debate has been a long time coming, for the question which has always arisen is this: is this House the right forum for this debate?"
"Some members of my group reject the report because they believe that this is not a European issue."
"The majority will follow my recommendation and vote for the report, because it is indeed a Europe-wide issue and problem."
"Bullying exists in every country of the European Union, in all sectors, and even in the EU institutions themselves. It is a difficult issue."
"It is very embarrassing for many people, and a large number of cases go unreported because no one really wants to talk about it. Victims feel ashamed, exploited and stressed."
"Their distress often has a high cost, not only in terms of their own mental and physical health, but also economically: sick leave, medical and treatment expenses, a high staff turnover, lower productivity, a loss of quality and image for the company or institution, and therefore also a decline in the number of customers."
"Bullying causes all these problems."
"The dignity of every individual should not be upheld solely on paper and in the Basic Law, but also in our social relations."
"A little more respect and fairness and a little less egotism would probably make our debate about harassment unnecessary."
"European legislation is unsuitable as a means to address the causes of bullying and is likely to be ineffective."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for including my ideas in his report."
"Measures to tackle bullying should focus primarily on the Member State and actively include the social partners."
"It is in companies' own interests to ensure that these incidents do not occur within their organisations."
"Due to the difficulties in arriving at a precise definition, the Commission will not find it easy to draft its proposed Green Paper."
"However, there are a few models of good practice in tackling bullying here in the European Union, and I believe that everyone should learn from each other."
"Tasks must be assigned effectively to the most appropriate levels; this will also increase the desire to take action and ensure that this difficult issue is taken seriously."
"I want first of all on behalf of my group to thank the rapporteur for this report."
"It is an important report because harassment is a far too prevalent problem in the workplace."
"My group will be supporting the report as it stands in its entirety and will not be expecting or requesting any deletions of parts of paragraphs or phrases."
"It is a sad fact that the Dublin Foundation has found that over 15 million people have reported violence, sexual harassment or bullying in the workplace."
"It should not be allowed to continue because this kind of bullying and harassment can be fatal and has in many instances resulted in people either taking their own lives or, through misadventure in the workplace, in others taking their lives."
"It seems to me therefore that it is something which the Commission and the Parliament should address."
"Legislation is in place in Ireland, as part of the health and safety legislation, to ensure that large companies put in place codes of practice to deal with bullying."
"However, it is not clear yet to what extent companies have implemented this legislation."
"I came across a case recently where a young man starting in a job in a state company was bullied consistently by older men in the job, not by women, but by men, who simply did not want him in that job because they felt threatened by his presence."
"They did not succeed in forcing him out of that job but it was extraordinary that this should occur in this day and age."
"It is true that the trends emerging over the last ten years, as shown by the Dublin Foundation, have been on the rise."
"It is clear also that this is largely due to insecurity in the workplace and changes in the nature of work."
"Typical work is causing stresses and strains which are being reflected in this kind of activity, so I support the call by the rapporteur for a communication from the Commission by next year and a programme of action by the Commission by the end of next year."
"Could I say before I sit down on an entirely different matter, but one related to the work of the Commission, that I would appeal to the Commissioner to ask our colleagues in the Commission to take steps to relax the rules and regulations governing state aid for the aviation industry, otherwise we are going to have to deal with tens of thousands of workers right across Europe who could well be unemployed in the not too distant future."
"This is what I call harassment in the workplace."
"I cannot speak without people smoking behind me and that gives me an asthma attack and that is harassment."
"I congratulate Mr Andersson on his report."
"It is important for action at both national and European level because, as we have heard, 12 million people are harassed or bullied in the workplace every year."
"There are many forms of harassment and as I said, smoking in the workplace in no-smoking areas is a form of harassment."
"It can also have devastating effects, both physically and pyschologically."
"The level of stress caused by bullying and harassment in a workplace is tremendous."
"Disabled people, women and in particular, ethnic minorities, suffer a great deal."
"They can be doubly discriminated against and are harassed simply because they come from those disadvantaged, discriminated groups."
"I am also glad that Mr Andersson referred to those on short-term contracts because again we have evidence that those too, are bullied."
"But can I turn quickly to the reason for the split votes that the ELDR has asked for on paragraphs 8 and 13."
"I believe that it is a role of the European Union to have common guidelines, best practice and benchmarking across the Member States, but I do not believe that we need more binding legislation: that is a role for the Member States and a question of subsidiarity."
"So although I agree with much of Mr Andersson's report, I disagree with the fact that we should have binding legislation and that is why we have called for the split vote."
"Mr President, my group would also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for his work on this excellent own-initiative report: it has been a very good evening for those."
"As has already been said, we should not underestimate the effect that harassment in all its forms has on people's lives and health and the long-term mental and psychological problems we have heard about."
"If we are looking at figures, then if we were to take this Parliament as an example, we would be looking at a group roughly the size of the Liberal Democrat group as the percentage of those suffering harassment."
"Up to now, very little has really been done to address the problem of harassment generally, so this report is especially welcome as it allows an open debate on an issue that has all too often been ignored."
"A French survey also reveals that 70% of harassment of victims are women and this applies at all points of the employment process, so not only do you get paid less, you get harassed as well, and chauvinist and sexist connotations, which are more often targeted at women than at men, can frequently turn into something more serious."
"Therefore the Commission should give particular attention to ways of tackling this unacceptable situation for women in Europe."
"Mr Andersson is right, employers must have the responsibility for preventing harassment in the workplace, not colluding with it, or practising it."
"However the framework directive on health and safety at work does not clarify whether employers are responsible for the mental, psycho-social or social working environment, so I believe steps should be taken to revise the directive to include this definition."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work, although we do not have a definition of harassment, perhaps because harassment takes many forms and is difficult to define."
"I would like to express my solidarity with, and sympathy for, Mrs Lynne, who has just told us of a new form of harassment."
"By way of analysis, an acceptable definition seems to me to be that of the Irish working group for the prevention of harassment, which defines it as direct or indirect, inappropriate and repeated behaviour of a verbal, physical or other nature, directed by one or more persons against a third party or parties in the workplace and/or in the execution of their work, which may justifiably be considered to violate an individual' s right to dignity at work."
"And, of course, an isolated incident of behaviour such as that described in the definition may constitute an affront to dignity at work, but an individual and isolated incident would not be considered harassment."
"We can accept this definition or any other."
"The fact is that up to 12 million people in the European Union claim to have been morally harassed over the last twelve months, women appear to be victims of harassment to a greater extent than men and certain sectors of activity seem to be particularly affected."
"Harassment has repercussions for the economy of the company, leads to absenteeism, inefficiency and low productivity."
"For society, harassment may lead to medical and psychological costs, sick leave, early retirement, etc. Above all it affects the worker and presents risks which add to problems of physical violence and ergonomic issues."
"Furthermore, there remains much to do in order to eliminate risks to health, both of a physical and chemical origin."
"Above all, moral harassment, pestering - which is one possible name for it - seems to me incompatible with Article 1 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights: 'Human dignity is inviolable."
"It must be respected and protected' ."
"Harassment therefore constitutes a risk to health but above all an attack on the person' s dignity."
"I therefore welcome this initiative aimed at preventing harassment in the workplace and at preventing workers suffering the pain of helplessness."
"Mr President, the question of harassment in the workplace relates directly to respect for fundamental personal rights, the right to dignity and the right to participate in economic and social life on equal terms."
"In his initiative, Mr Andersson has revealed new aspects to us which need to be borne in mind when it comes to the material application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to a more integrated approach to policy on employment standards."
"Most importantly, we should welcome this initiative because it gives us an opportunity, with an issue which is played down and which is usually included in our interests as an afterthought, to see how important it is if we are to issue a successful series of policies, such as a policy against discrimination and exclusion, a policy for the disabled, a policy for unemployment and employment standards."
"Only once all employees feel safe in the workplace from harassment from colleagues and superiors, once all employees, rather than being ridiculed for their disadvantages, feel comfortable in the work environment, then the groups - and there are a lot of them - which fall victim to harassment will choose to enter the labour market and the fruits of their labour will far exceed any weaknesses they may have."
"If we bear in mind that, according to the statistics, the number of people which make up these vulnerable groups is over 8%, the political dimension is easy to see."
"At the same time, there are numerous groups which fall victim to harassment, from women and the disabled to foreigners and people of a different faith."
"This gives us an idea of the size of the problem."
"We must use this report as a springboard to draw up a plan to combat all levels of harassment, which starts as simple sarcasm and disdain, coupled with intimidation, humiliation and undermining, and ends up in more violent acts, a plan which will be applied irrespective of whether it is top-down harassment of an employee by a superior, bottom-up harassment or horizontal harassment."
"In addition to measures to ban harassment, the action plan must require employers to foster a climate of non-harassment between colleagues, accompanied by mutual encouragement between colleagues in the workplace."
"And because no one is deliberately bad, it must be flanked by measures to abolish distrust and superstition towards the people which make up these groups."
"Mr President, the report we are discussing today concerns 12 to 15 million people in Europe, that is, between 8% and 10% of European workers."
"There are three aspects to this modern evil."
"There is an economic aspect, since according to the report of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions the deterioration in working conditions over the past 10 years is due to the faster working rate and to flexibility in all its forms."
"There is a sociological aspect, symptomatic of the individualism that is increasingly threatening to take over our society."
"There is a psychological aspect, which makes harassment particularly odious and can sometimes cause individuals to suffer a breakdown without leaving the slightest trace."
"At present there is a serious legal vacuum at national level and a wide disparity at European level, which, however, is being counteracted by an increasingly solid body of case law."
"That is why this report, which is well documented and rigorous, provides a highly encouraging response and sends out a strong signal to the working environment."
"In paragraph 12, among the envisaged measures, it emphasises the need for more serious dialogue on this subject between all the social partners and the appointment of an independent external mediator, as also advocated in the amendment I tabled, which I regard as an important guarantee of real progress in this field."
"But it is up to all the European institutions to continue to fight an evil that is now firmly entrenched, as they have been urged to do since the European Social Charter."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur's proposal to call on the Commission to publish a Green Paper and to present a Community action programme by next year."
"On behalf of my group I also support the inclusion of these matters in the Green Paper discussions on corporate social responsibility."
"We must all support this fight, at our own level, persuaded as we are that society as a whole will enjoy the benefits of balance within society and within individuals."
"Mr President, around 12 million people in the EU are reported to have been subjected to bullying at work."
"The real figure is far higher."
"The victims suffer exclusion and harassment, rumours are spread about them, they are deliberately denied information and scapegoated."
"Managers or staff - anyone can become a victim or a bully."
"The impact of harassment is still completely underestimated, so very few effective instruments are available."
"Yet it is a serious workplace problem."
"It causes aggression and stress, sickness, resignations, staff turnover - all of which cost the economy and the social systems several 100 million euro per year."
"Together, the fifteen EU Member States must take stock of the situation."
"Best practice approaches will help us all benefit from an exchange of experience and devise effective measures to combat the problem."
"However, solutions must be tailored to the type of bullying involved, which can be gender-specific, age-specific or racist."
"Jan Andersson has submitted an outstanding report."
"It was quite rightly adopted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Almost all the proposed amendments from the PPE-DE have been integrated, such as consultation with Europe's social partners on developing joint anti-harassment strategies."
"In practice, this will involve constructive conflict management, better internal communications, and the creation of support networks for victims."
"We also propose appointing a confidential mediator at the workplace to whom employees can turn if they so wish."
"Ms Diamantopoulou, we firmly expect the Commission to submit a Green Paper next year on the issue of bullying at work so that we can develop an action programme which will have a sustained impact."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his excellent report. I quite agree that harassment is an extremely important issue, it is dangerous in the workplace and it has significant social and economic repercussions not just on the employee and the company but also on the economy as a whole in that it is one of the main reasons for falling productivity."
"I should like to assure the House that the Commission is fully aware of the problem, which is why this issue is one of the important aspects of the Commission communication on standards released in June and one of the issues for which we are also examining the question of indicators."
"Similarly, as regards current tools, I must remind you that the social partners need to provide protection and can play an important role here and remind you of Directive 89/391/ÅC which states that, when preventing danger in the workplace, account must also be taken of psychosomatic pressure which, of course, is not always easy to define."
"I should like to inform you that an advisory committee of representatives of the Member States is already up and running and is examining the question of health and safety. It has set up a sub-committee especially to study the question of violence in the workplace."
"This committee completed its work yesterday and we now have a general definition of violence in the workplace."
"The proposal for an initiative and a Green Paper on this subject is not feasible now and I can tell you why immediately."
"As you know, the Commission has taken the initiative to overhaul its strategy on health and safety in the workplace."
"And this report will play an important part; it will help bring about change and propose a new strategy on health and safety and for this reason I should like to make a point of thanking the rapporteur."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Air pollution"
"The next item is a joint debate on the following reports."
"A5-0293/2001 drawn up by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants, and"
"A5-0293/2001 drawn up by Mrs Riitta Myller on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants."
"Mr President, it is nearly three years since the Commission tabled a proposal for a directive amending the rules on the emission of pollutants from large combustion plants."
"After those three years, we have this week finally reached completion of this - what I believe to be - very important dossier."
"Nobody will blame me for saying that we have travelled an arduous road, a road that has also been peppered with painful experiences."
"We have met with a great deal of opposition, not only on the part of a number of Member States, but also among some fellow MEPs."
"There have been strong warnings and protests from interested parties, also from the electricity industry in some Member States."
"Despite this, we managed to amend without any problem the original regulation in the form it was submitted and which, in my opinion - and that shared by a few fellow MEPs - was far too weak."
"After all, the technical possibilities are not lacking, and in a large number of the EU Member States, those rules which we incorporated at first reading have long since been prescribed and form part of regular policy."
"The original Commission proposal to amend the directive from 1998 was, according to the majority of this House, not a huge success."
"Regulation was too weak and moreover, existing plants were excluded from the directive' s scope."
"We as the European Parliament have collectively given real significance to the environmental policy, and I should once again like to extend a warm thanks to all the fellow MEPs who contributed to this. We have demonstrated what it means if we really want to do something about this filthy air pollution, which is so harmful to people."
"We as Parliament made great improvements to emission standards at first reading, and we also brought existing combustion plants within the scope of the directive."
"Then came the Council' s collective standpoint."
"This was arrived at with the greatest difficulty, it has to be said."
"Legislation was tightened up to some extent, but the European Parliament' s wish for existing combustion plants to be brought within the scope of the directive was accommodated."
"But alas, each country stipulated its own exceptions, and had it been up to the Council of Ministers, we would have continued using old, outdated polluting plants ad infinitum."
"In our opinion, the common position lacked all vision."
"It had become a pick-and-mix with something for everyone."
"If I compare this with the regulations which currently apply in Japan and the United States, we, who all want things to be done just so, would have cut a very poor figure with the Council' s emission regulations during the discussions on Kyoto."
"There were calls that it was not necessary to prescribe regulations for combustion plants because this was to be addressed by Mrs Myller' s very fine report on emission ceilings, and that there was therefore no need to interfere as a European authority until those emission ceilings were in place, for everything was to be regulated on that basis, every Member State adopting them as a binding measure."
"But things on that front too ultimately took a different turn."
"If we were to meet the expectations of those in favour of liberalising the energy market, in other words, if we did not prescribe any regulations or if we agreed to exceptions in order to generate electricity using old, polluting power stations, we believe that the market mechanism would be disrupted, and those who neglect the environment would be rewarded with a head-start, because they would be able to charge lower energy prices with their old power stations."
"Since the Council refused to accept Parliament' s amendments, we had to resort to conciliation, whereby the present report was combined with the report by Mrs Riitta Myller. I would like to thank her too."
"She proved to be an excellent partner in those negotiations."
"In fact, during the trilogue with the Swedish Presidency and the Commission in May and June of this year, considerable progress was made straight away where the emission reduction of SO2, sulphur dioxide and a number of major technical topics were concerned."
"As for NOx and the nitrogen oxides, progress was only made with the greatest difficulty."
"At the trilogue, agreement was reached provisionally on the Commission' s obligation to extend monitoring - for which we have Mr Hans Blokland to thank - to include emissions of heavy metals."
"In addition, the Council met Parliament half-way and deleted certain exceptions, especially for certain plants which are fired with solid fuels and native brown coal."
"Unfortunately, during the first meeting, we failed to reach genuine agreement on what strikes me as the most important point, namely NOx."
"After first reading, we made huge progress when the Council agreed to allow old plants to be brought within the scope of the directive."
"That was important because those old plants are often least efficient in terms of energy, and also emit a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gases."
"By means of the compromise achieved by conciliation, the European Parliament managed to tighten the proposed limits for SO2 and NOx."
"The Council agreed, straight away in fact, to a considerable reduction in SO2, especially for the medium-size and large combustion plants, for that is where it matters most."
"With regard to NOx emissions, we as Parliament upheld the reduction of NOx limits for large combustion plants between 650 mg per cubic metre and 200 mg for those plants which run on solid fuels."
"These limits, however, only apply from 2016 to new and existing plants."
"That is, in fact, too late."
"As I stated earlier, a number of Member States introduced these standards some three years ago."
"We did not object to this for it marked a huge step forward, also in view of the fact that this is an important condition which we will soon be able to apply to the candidate countries."
"Furthermore, we managed to reduce the exception which the Council wanted for peak-load power stations, with the result that the polluting emission can be curtailed in this respect too."
"All in all, I am therefore of the opinion that conciliation produced a satisfactory agreement and that we went much further than we deemed possible at second reading."
"I thank the Swedish Presidency. I thank all my fellow MEPs, especially Mrs Myller."
"I thank the Commission for its constructive support."
"I would therefore recommend, also on behalf of the delegation, that this proposal be adopted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament' s objective with respect to this directive was to achieve the strictest possible ceilings for air emissions responsible for acidification."
"Acidification, ground-level ozone, and soil eutrophication are interconnected problems caused by emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and ammonia."
"It seems only reasonable to examine these problems together, as in that way we could succeed in reducing emissions in the most cost-effective way."
"On this basis, the Commission in its proposal had calculated for each Member State the ceilings they should achieve by the year 2010."
"In both the fifth environmental action programme and its acidification strategy, the Community - the European Union - laid down its objective to guarantee that people would be protected from all known air pollutants."
"The Commission stated in its proposal that at this stage it was unable to set 'final targets' for critical loads and levels: to achieve a final, long-term objective it was necessary to proceed via some interim target values, which the Commission set for 2001."
"Except with regard to ammonia, Parliament approved the Commission' s targets in its second reading, with the addition of a long-term objective."
"In Parliament' s view, the interim target values should be achieved by 2010, and the final objective, whereby people would be protected throughout the EU from all known atmospheric pollutants, should be achieved by 2020."
"By the time it had reached the conciliation stage all positions were clear, and the Council clearly gave us to understand that it was unable to alter the figures, which it had approved within the framework of a common position."
"Neither was it prepared to approve the long-term objective on the grounds that the demand that critical levels and loads should not be exceeded in any area was not, in the opinion of the Council and the Commission too, technically feasible."
"The Council' s common position on emission ceilings was a long way from the Commission' s figures relatively speaking, but, nevertheless, better than the 'Gothenburg' values that most of the Member States had sworn by."
"Approval of the Council' s common position would have meant that we would have been raising our hands in favour of improving air quality and protecting the health of our citizens."
"At the conciliation stage, after some considerable amount of arm wrestling, with the Commission busy producing compromises, the main principles of the directive were pulled in the direction of Parliament' s views."
"During conciliation the Commission' s and Parliament' s stricter emission limits were approved as indicative values and the Council' s common position was recognised as binding on Member States."
"Indicativeness means the Commission is obliged to reappraise the directive in its reports for 2004 and 2008, taking account of future scientific and technological developments and hence the possibility of achieving stricter emission limits."
"With these investigations it must also be considered to what extent the long-term objectives can be achieved by 2020."
"The result of conciliation was thus to give the Commission the tools to make the directive' s target levels stricter and require it to study reductions in emissions in the long-term also, the aim being that critical levels and loads are not exceeded and that people really are protected effectively from all atmospheric pollutants."
"It was quite an achievement to have this long-term objective included in an Article of the directive, but it was perhaps the most important accomplishment during conciliation."
"The emission sources causing acidification that are the hardest to deal with are emissions from aircraft and ships."
"We have made progress in this area too, and the Commission is being asked to propose measures to deal with this problem."
"I would also like to thank Ria Oomen-Ruijten for her excellent show of co-operation during conciliation."
"It was really most significant that the directive on large combustion plants was dealt with so successfully, as it will be a key instrument in helping to carry through this directive on emissions ceilings."
"I also want to thank the President of Parliament' s delegation, the Members, the representatives of the Commission and Sweden, as the country holding the presidency at the time, for their excellent show of co-operation."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the Parliament's rapporteurs on the hard work that they put in."
"They produced a result which they can be proud of."
"It was produced after an immense amount of work very late at night."
"However, speaking as a British Member of the European Parliament there were enormous difficulties about these directives, particularly the Large Combustion Plants Directive."
"I want to focus on the point that we laboured under the enormous difficulty that neither the Commission nor the Council really came clean about the impact of what they were proposing."
"Nor did they give us an accurate assessment or help us assess the impact of what the European Parliament was proposing."
"Mr Bowe and I, as British Members of the European Parliament, were faced with lobbies from Britain basically saying that if we adopted the Parliament's amendments, the British coal mines which are still in production would all have to close down."
"We were therefore faced with the possibility of voting for amendments and voting for reports from our own committee which would have had a very serious economic impact in our own Member State."
"When we went to the Council of Ministers meeting, we found that there were other Member States with exactly the same problems, Finland, for example, where the ministers and governments of those countries had never really contacted their Members of the European Parliament to explain the difficulties they thought they were going to have."
"We also had the extraordinary situation, when we got to the codecision meeting, where four civil servants delivered speeches that really should have been made by ministers."
"The point I want to make is this. We need two things: we need much greater honesty from Member States and the Commission about the actual impact in the Member States of what is being proposed and what is being discussed."
"There should at least be some advice on that."
"Secondly, when we go to the codecision meetings we must stop having meetings between fifteen MEPs, one minister, and fourteen civil servants."
"That is ridiculous."
"Many of the points made to us on the reports by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller should have been made by ministers."
"It is ministers we want to meet when we go to the codecision meetings."
"Mr President, I will just simply say first as a British Member, that I would endorse what Mrs Jackson said."
"Only the people in this room really know just how much work both the rapporteurs did to reach this final position and to get these two reports as proposals to this Parliament for a final vote."
"We are your peers and we know how much hard work you did and we congratulate you both on that work."
"It has been a very long time and this is one of the most difficult reports I have seen in twelve years in Parliament."
"Finally though, despite all the difficulties and even the final conciliation, we have a workable and practical proposal."
"It is not going to be easy."
"It is going, in fact, to be extremely hard with regard to some of the requirements, but it strikes a satisfactory balance between the protection of the environment on the one hand and society's need for a reliable and secure source of power at an affordable price, which is something we cannot ignore."
"Changes are going to have to take place to meet the requirements of this proposal."
"The power industry will undoubtedly be required to replace some old plant, hopefully by some more modern sources of power generation."
"There is going to be a substantial reduction in sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions which are the main causes of acid rain and ground-level ozone with a consequent improvement in the environmental conditions for human health."
"One possible side effect may be that as the general efficiency of power plant operation improves, we will see an overall reduction in carbon dioxide in comparison to the energy generated."
"That would be a helpful and useful side effect of this legislation."
"It will not be easy to put all these measures into place."
"There is a long time scale."
"That is acceptable and understandable in these circumstances, so on behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome these proposals and we will give them our support in the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome both the directives and congratulate both rapporteurs as other Members have done."
"I have particularly followed the debate on the limitation of emissions of large combustion plants."
"These plants are one of the biggest emitters of air pollutants in Europe after transport emissions and therefore it is very important we have stringent legislation to control this."
"The inclusion of existing plants is a major improvement on former legislation."
"It means there will be a level playing field for all plants including the worst polluters and some plants in the applicant countries, which can generate electricity more cheaply because they have fewer controls and do not have to meet the same standards."
"Again, as other Members have said, we can reassure people that because of the various derogations and allowances for lower standards, which were built into the final compromise text, current power stations such as Aberthaw in my own constituency are under no threat."
"Aberthaw coal-fired power station has been the subject of considerable press and media attention due to perceived threats to its viability and its profitability from this directive."
"In fact the opposite is true."
"The directive will actually protect jobs in the Welsh coal and generating industries in the longer term."
"This has been a very important debate, because it has shown that there is not a straight choice between cleaner air standards and employment, as some would have us believe."
"Work to combat pollution can go hand-in-hand with protecting jobs and sustaining communities."
"My group also supports the compromise which tightens the limit values for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and introduces generally stronger standards."
"The group also supports the results of the conciliation on Mrs Myller's report on the National Emission Ceilings Directive and we will be voting in favour of that too."
"Mr President, I will confine myself to air pollution caused by large combustion plants."
"I am still of the opinion that the outcome of conciliation has been overtaken by the current technical potential to reduce polluting emissions."
"Bizarre exemption provisions were left in the directive, as well as the permission for large old combustion plants to pollute for 2 000 hours per year, and the exceptions for Spain, Crete and Rhodes."
"Existing plants will continue to pollute the air enormously by emitting sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides."
"Particularly with regard to nitrogen oxides, the outcome of the conciliation is saddening, since at the moment, the standards in the United States already far outstrip those which will not come into force for a number of years in the European Union."
"Moreover, we already notice that much biomass is being used as a supplement in coal-fired power plants."
"For these, far less stringent emission standards apply compared to waste incineration plants."
"I should have known that as a result of the liberalisation of the energy market, equal environmental conditions would be used to prevent distortion of competition."
"In conclusion, the reason why I shall be voting in favour of this directive is not that it will effectively fight air pollution, but because, compared to the previous directive, this new directive is the lesser of two evils."
"Mr President, my colleague, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, deserves praise for her work as rapporteur at all three stages of the reading of the directive on large combustion plants."
"We have before us now a revised directive that can be expected to have an important impact on reducing emissions from large combustion plants, at the same time, however, taking account of the practical realities of life."
"I am grateful for having been involved in tabling the amendments of compromise and that first the rapporteur and then Parliament adopted them."
"These amendments are still visible in this directive even after conciliation and, among other things, make possible combined heat and power production, which is essential from the point of view of sustainable development."
"At first there was a danger that the directive would have made CHP unprofitable."
"That would clearly have meant a step backwards."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report, like that of my colleague Mrs Myller, are examples of how the codecision procedure can also achieve a successful end result when the subject-matter is very difficult and demanding."
"These two directives are obviously in this category."
"National limits for emissions and emissions from large energy plants are matters in which Member States have traditionally looked after their own interests and tried to prevent the setting of targets that could jeopardise the competitiveness of Member States themselves or that of the EU as a whole."
"The Commission had to take this into account when drafting its proposal."
"Parliament too, for all its idealism, had to take account of political realities."
"In spite of this, the result can be considered to be an ambitious one."
"It will be important right away as far as air quality in Europe is concerned."
"In addition, it indicates something important for the future: the EU is ready to work to achieve the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol within the framework of practical policy as well."
"We still expect the Commission to make several important proposals this autumn to combat climatic change."
"The two reports now to be decided on promise good results."
"The EU institutions are capable of producing a balanced result, from which we can expect challenging results."
"In the face of the facts of climatic change anything less is out of the question."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for their tenacity and commitment."
"I have no doubt that these were essential qualities during the negotiations with the Council, especially in the discussions about large combustion plants."
"This House was determined to ensure that old plants were included in this directive as well, and finally achieved this goal."
"This is a key area in which we have been successful."
"However, we have not been entirely successful."
"We have had to accept a great many derogations, extensions and lower limit values, not because no other option was technically feasible - for otherwise we would frequently have been accused of trying to achieve the impossible."
"In this instance, it is quite obvious that upgrading existing plants to meet the standards in modern installations presents no problems from a technical point of view."
"Indeed, in many sectors, this is already a reality."
"No, the resistance focussed solely on microeconomic factors relating to specific large combustion plants."
"This is a short-sighted view."
"We must think macroeconomically and take account of the public health costs of pollution and harmful emissions."
"In this respect, I simply cannot understand the Council's negotiating position on this issue."
"However, as the directive now includes old plants, I shall vote for the compromise as well."
"Mr President, neither the time nor the mood feels right for starting any sort of squabble - either with the Committee Chairman or with other British Members of this Parliament - on who has most to lose from acidification or measures against acidification."
"Instead, I will try to be rather more positive and thank the British Members for managing to get through this directive and for ensuring that tomorrow we shall be able to make a decision."
"To put it rather dramatically, this decision means that my region can come back to life and that forestry, the fishing industry and biodiversity will be given a chance to repair the damage which has occurred over decades and perhaps even a whole century."
"This is an excellent example of the benefit of practical and solid European cooperation."
"Through this kind of cooperation, we can achieve a change in my region which we should not have been able to bring about ourselves, that is, a halt to acidification."
"Even if we cannot eradicate acidification completely, we can halt it and try to repair some of the damage which it has caused."
"I look forward to the review which is to be carried out, as I know that such measures are insufficient."
"Acidification will continue, despite the decision we shall make tomorrow."
"I wish to thank the Members and the Commission for the work we have carried out together."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased that these two important additions to Community legislation on air pollution are reaching the stage of final adoption."
"I join with you in congratulating and thanking both rapporteurs, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller, for their efforts, but I would also like to thank the President of Parliament's delegation, Mr Friedrich, for his role in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion - unfortunately he cannot be here this evening - and Mr Provan for stepping in at the last moment in what proved to be one of the finest evenings of the summer."
"The proposals on national emission ceilings (NECs) and large combustion plants (LCPs) represent a major advance in Community legislation on air pollution."
"As you know, the NEC proposal would help to establish an ongoing programme for tackling transboundary air pollution by requiring Members States to limit the emissions which cause most damage, not only to themselves but, as Mrs Hulthén said, to their neighbours."
"The first stage sets legally binding emissions ceilings which Member States will have to meet by 2010."
"It provides for a series of periodic reviews - in 2004, 2008 and 2012 - in order to reduce emissions ceilings more in the future: this review system has been strengthened a great deal in response to Parliament's concerns."
"The first reviews will try to make up the shortfall by 2010 taking into account total emissions for the Community as a whole as set out in the Commission original proposal."
"All reviews will look at how we can achieve our long-term goals of staying below critical environmental levels after 2010."
"The year 2020 will then be taken as a benchmark."
"In subsequent reviews, the Commission will report, in particular, on progress towards attaining our long-term goals and, with these aims in mind, will consider what further measures are necessary to achieve these goals, as the rapporteur has said, ""preferably by 2020""."
"At the same time, with the large combustion plant proposal, new and tougher emissions standards will apply in the power generation sector, in particular for older power plants which are a major cause of acidification and ozone pollution."
"The Commission's analysis of the common position on large combustion plants shows that both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from this sector will fall substantially as a result of this legislation."
"The compromise on the LCP proposal will provide medium-term flexibility to take account of differing circumstances in the Member States as well as substantial environmental benefits in the long term in an enlarged Community."
"Parliament has achieved a great deal in this debate and should be very proud of its contribution."
"The Commission is pleased with the outcome."
"By approving this legislation, the Commission will be under an obligation to return in 2004 to review both directives and present its proposals for further progress."
"We have already explained how we intend to prepare for this first review in the communication on clean air for Europe which we presented in May 2001, and work is already under way on this."
"In conclusion, I invite Parliament to adopt the outcome of conciliation and to join us in moving forward."
"I look forward to Parliament's support for CAFE."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, my name is not on the list of those present at yesterday' s meeting, but I was present, as shown by the signatures to all my group' s meetings."
"I would be grateful if you could have this oversight remedied."
"Mr Santini, that will be corrected."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I sat here throughout the debate yesterday on the statements by the Commission and the Council in relation to the tragedy in the United States."
"Not a single mention was made of the crisis being faced by the aviation industry in Europe as a result of this atrocity."
"It is incumbent on this House to make clear to the Commission and the Council that aid needs to be provided to the European airline industry and to the aviation industry in general, so that we can maintain a European aviation industry, particularly our airlines."
"Otherwise, we would be in a very serious situation, particularly if, as is proposed, the United States provides aid to their airlines."
"It is of the utmost importance that the tens of thousands of jobs currently under threat in the aviation industry are saved."
"Mr De Rossa, we have noted your comments."
"The agenda for the next session will be set by the Conference of Presidents."
"We will put forward your suggestion."
"Decisions on freezing assets or evidence"
"The next item is the report (A5-0274/2991) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the governments of the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Belgium for the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing assets or evidence (5126/2001 - C5­0055/2001 - 2001/0803(CNS))."
"Mr President, this report concerns the recognition by one Member State of orders made by a court in another Member State on the freezing of assets or evidence within its territory in order to ensure the integrity of the legal process up to the final judgment."
"This framework decision, which is an initiative by the governments of France, Sweden and Belgium, is to enter into force by 31 December 2002 and will apply to all the Member States without any need for ratification, a very important point indeed. This is the general position regarding mechanisms for the recognition of criminal sentences which have existed up to now."
"In short this is about ensuring that an order made in one Member State automatically guarantees that assets and evidence essential for the prosecution and punishment of a crime and which may be located in any part of the European Union are not lost, do not disappear or are not concealed from criminal investigation."
"In the original version of the decision, this mutual recognition mechanism relates to cross-border crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud affecting the European Communities' financial interests, laundering of the proceeds of crime, counterfeiting of the euro, corruption and trafficking in human beings."
"However, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs considered that this classification of offences, which is limited to types of crime relating in particular to the functioning of the single market, excludes other criminal offences and especially, and this is indeed topical, the type of crime we are most concerned with now, crime relating to terrorism."
"I believe that the new version of Article 2, prepared with the invaluable help of Mrs Palácio Vallelersundi and approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, is far more appropriate and effective in the context of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is a matter of strengthening the principle of mutual recognition which will be the basis for the prosecution of criminals and criminal organisations in the European Union."
"I think that we are now perfectly aware of the vital importance of this, and I therefore call on this Chamber to adopt Amendment No 5 on Article 2 of the original proposal for a decision, and ask the Commission and the Council to take this on board. This will bring the proposal for a decision before us in line with others which will soon follow in relation to the war on terrorism, as announced yesterday by Commissioner Vitorino."
"Mr President, this decision, in as far as it goes, will make a small contribution to the creation of a European area of justice, but it is these small things, these small stones, that will build the foundations of a European area of justice capable of protecting our citizens."
"In this way we can counter the judicial void that exists in Europe and thus fight against the inertia and bureaucracy of the institutions."
"It is our job to prove to the public that Europe is also there to protect them, and that a European civil and criminal legal system is possible."
"This is about promoting citizenship, of course, but it is also about fighting the anonymous and stateless crime which is so prevalent."
"Not even the greatest pessimists would deny that these are steps in the right direction."
"Isolationist sovereignty makes crime easier and helps criminals."
"As from tomorrow, and I mean tomorrow, the date of the Extraordinary European Council, we will be speeding up the creation of a Europe of freedoms, that is to say the largest area of democracy, freedom and justice in the world."
"Mr President, I endorse what the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, said."
"The truly tragic events of last week emphasise the importance of the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"The coalition we are striving to build across the world to fight against terrorism is trying to find a cure to the problem, but there is also the issue of prevention in terms of security and diplomacy."
"Other steps too are necessary if we are going to prevent those kinds of crimes from happening again."
"The second directive on money laundering is already in conciliation and we are trying to get it through."
"We have to recognise that at European Union level we need only one legal area."
"It is illogical for people to apply for asylum between one Member State and another within the European Union."
"It is illogical for us to have a situation where a warrant for arrest is not applicable across the whole of the European Union."
"There was a case where someone fled to the United Kingdom from France and managed to stall his extradition back to France for the crime of terrorism."
"He has actually faced the courts for a period of five years."
"The series of reports we have before us this morning attempt to move things forward."
"Mr Marinho's report is part of that initiative by the French, Swedish and Belgian governments and I congratulate him and them on this report."
"A judicial decision in one Member State must have automatic application across the whole of the Union."
"We must have the mutual recognition that Mr Marinho calls for."
"Mr bin Laden has a London bank account."
"One might hope that this report will make it easier for that account and similar accounts elsewhere in Europe to be frozen if that was proven necessary."
"On behalf of the party of European Socialists, I support this report and the similar measures that will follow in the other reports this morning and in subsequent weeks and months."
"The best memorial for those innocent people who died so tragically last week is to take action to prevent its repetition."
"This is one small part of that process."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the initiative by France, Sweden and Belgium on the mutual recognition of orders freezing assets or evidence."
"This is in fact the first fundamental proposal to be made since the adoption by the Council and the Commission of the programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters."
"I am also very grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Marinho."
"His report is excellent and as he has stressed, mutual recognition will be a crucial step forward in judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"As you all know, traditional judicial cooperation is slow and bureaucratic, which runs totally counter to the interests of the public, and the current situation highlights the need for swift and effective judicial cooperation."
"I also welcome the approach adopted by the rapporteur in his amendments, and in particular the implication that this initiative does not go far enough."
"It only applies to a very limited list of offences already harmonised at EU level and does not cover certain traditional offences such as murder, armed robbery and rape."
"Nor does it cover terrorist acts."
"The rapporteur accordingly suggests that the provisions of the proposed decision should extend to any offence punishable by means of a custodial sentence or custodial security measure with a maximum duration of at least six months, and the Commission is totally in agreement with this."
"Furthermore, the Commission is already advocating such an extension to the Council and negotiations are under way."
"Parliament therefore has a good chance of making this initiative more ambitious, which would reflect the objectives of the Heads of State and Government, who established the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters at the Tampere European Council."
"Mr President, it is in this spirit that I welcome the adoption of this positive and ambitious report."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"External borders and Schengen"
"The next item is the report (A5-0233/2001) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation (10846/1999 - C5­0042/2000) + (11329/3/1999 - C5­0043/2000) + (SCHAC 2533/1/2000 - C5­0729/2000) + (SEC(2000) 1439 - C5­0730/2000 - 2000/2015(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation under Schengen started in 1985 between five Member States."
"The idea was to abolish internal borders so as to allow the free movement of persons and to adopt compensatory measures, including measures concerning police cooperation, the fight against drugs, extradition and the creation of the Schengen Information System."
"All the Member States now belong to Schengen, although the United Kingdom and Ireland only partially participate."
"In addition, two non-member countries also participate, namely Iceland and Norway, which belong to the Nordic Passport Union."
"With the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Schengen acquis has been integrated into the treaties and there has been a communitarisation of certain third pillar issues, which have been transferred to the Community pillar. This applies, for example, to visas, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation on civil matters."
"In the process of preparing this report, I had to deal with a number of issues which I would like to see resolved as quickly as possible."
"The first of these is extension to include the remaining Member States."
"Whilst welcoming the extension of the Schengen area, the European Parliament regrets the fact that it has not been sufficiently well informed or even formally consulted on the changes that have taken place in this area."
"We see the partial participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland, which we regard as a positive development, as being a provisional situation and a step towards full participation."
"Secondly, there is a lack of transparency."
"Everyone hoped that the integration of the Schengen acquis would lead to a considerable improvement in transparency."
"However, the results have been disappointing. To be precise, the acquis was published late and not in full, and, paradoxically, the European Parliament now receives less information on Schengen than it used to receive when Schengen was of a clearly intergovernmental nature."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of the integration of the acquis in the treaties."
"This could have facilitated significant progress, but it has had a chaotic and incoherent impact, partly due perhaps to the power of initiative conferred on the Member States."
"On the other hand, due to the restrictive interpretation of the treaty provisions by the Council, Parliament has been unable, under the third pillar, to participate more fully in the legislative process."
"Fourthly, there is what I might call the 'perversion of Schengen' ."
"Article 2(2) allows any Member State to unilaterally re-impose internal border controls for reasons of public order or national security."
"This has already been put into practice by France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and most recently by Italy."
"We are not opposed to what might be called 'safety valves' ."
"We are all aware, especially at present, that greater freedom has to be matched by greater security."
"However, it has to be said that the absence of a legal framework making clear under what conditions and in what terms this article can be invoked makes this a real blank cheque."
"Accordingly, bearing in mind the scoreboard, I urge the Commission to bring forward a formal proposal including legislative provisions relating to prior agreement by the Council, approval for a limited period, a requirement for proportionality, and conditions for extending the period."
"My fifth point concerns Schengen cooperation and police cooperation."
"Schengen cooperation is distinct from police cooperation, with the development of Europol being a separate matter."
"However, these two sets of legislative provisions, which are considered in isolation and which lend greater weight to the issue of the confidentiality of documents, mean that the area of criminal matters and security has become even less transparent and more confusing for the public."
"As part of the third pillar, parliamentary and judicial checks on increased cooperation between the Member States are still inadequate and need to be reinforced."
"My sixth point is the extension of the Schengen area to the candidate countries."
"This extension will significantly change the shape of Europe and the new Member States will become responsible for controlling the thousands of kilometres of new external borders of the European Union."
"The process of checking compliance with Schengen has taken a considerable amount of time for the existing Member States."
"I therefore believe that a two-phase approach is required: the first stage being the acceptance of the acquis upon joining the Union, and the second stage being full implementation of the acquis, with borders being lifted as soon as circumstances allow."
"The seventh point is the Schengen Information System, the SIS."
"The SIS is the biggest database in Europe and the first experiment in terms of a large-scale exchange of sensitive data at international level. In practice, it is hoped that in the long term it will become a European information system."
"The SIS cannot continue to be managed secretly on a purely intergovernmental basis."
"Instead it should be managed on a Community basis, with the task of managing it being entrusted to an independent agency over which this Parliament should have a control function; it should be financed from the EU budget and provision should be made for a Community information system, which by keeping the data separate, could contain data collected under various agreements."
"Mr President, I would like to conclude by thanking all those fellow Members who have assisted with the preparation of this report, and in particular Mrs Van Lancker for her help with the various compromise amendments."
"Mr President, the United Kingdom is largely outside the provisions of the Schengen acquis."
"The policy of the British Conservatives towards Schengen is therefore rather like our policy towards the euro."
"We wish our neighbours and allies well, but it is not our businesses to tell them how to run initiatives which we have no intention of joining ourselves."
"Accordingly, as is becoming traditional on these occasions, my party will be abstaining."
"There is another matter which is becoming traditional on these occasions."
"No report on Schengen is complete without a ritual complaint about the failure of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic to take part."
"Thus, in Mr Coelho's otherwise admirable report, we have paragraph 2, which in a somewhat brusque tone calls on those two states to abolish their border controls."
"This Parliament has repeatedly expressed the viewed, echoed by Commissioner Vitorino, that the UK opt-out is illegal under the terms of the Single European Act."
"I believe that this is legally flawed, but that is not my point today."
"My point rather, is that by persistently seeking to challenge a derogation which was clearly understood by all sides at the time, this Parliament is acting in bad faith."
"It is worth recalling the circumstances in which the Schengen Accord was built into the treaties."
"That decision, like all treaty changes, required unanimity."
"Without the consent of the United Kingdom, Schengen would have had to continue to exist within a separate legal framework."
"The British government took the view that if other states wished to go ahead on their own using the institutions and mechanisms of the European Communities then it was not Britain's place to hinder them."
"Accordingly, it allowed the other states to push ahead within the treaties, but only subject to a clear guarantee that the UK's own border controls would not be affected."
"That guarantee was written in black and white into the Amsterdam Treaty."
"No sooner had Amsterdam come into force however, than the European Commission and Parliament began to question the opt-out."
"Not for the first time, the UK had allowed other states to use the common procedures of the European treaties only for those states promptly to start clamouring for Britain's inclusion."
"As with Schengen, so with the social chapter and so with economic and monetary union - in all three cases Britain consented to a new EU initiative on the clear understanding that it would not be affected, only for its derogation later to be disputed."
"This surely is no way for the Union to proceed."
"After all if opt-outs are no longer legally reliable, the only alternative is a rather more promiscuous use of the national veto and that I submit would be even more objectionable to the integrationist majority in this House than it is to me."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Coelho warmly on his sterling report and thank him in turn, on behalf of my group, for the sound cooperation."
"What should really have been an annual debate on the implementation of the Schengen cooperation is today being afforded added topical value in the light of the Council of Ministers for Justice and for the Interior debating European measures to combat international terrorism."
"Nobody will deny that Schengen could play a role in this."
"I shudder at the thought that appeals such as those during yesterday' s sitting could be made by the Right, to put a definitive stop to the free movement of people and to put Big Brother-like mechanisms into place."
"The Schengen discussion in my group has always sought to strike the necessary but difficult balance between the right to free movement of people, respect for the principles of the rule of law and human rights and the right to safety via police and judicial cooperation, and I should like to keep it that way."
"However, despite the fact that Schengen has now been in existence for six years as a predecessor to the area of freedom, security and justice, we have to observe on the basis of Mr Coelho' s report that many aspects leave a great deal to be desired."
"I should like to list three."
"Firstly, although Schengen exists, we have to observe that there is still no effective police cooperation and no effective exchange of intelligence which could yield major results in the fight against organised crime."
"In fact, the annual report states that there is a marked improvement, but the question is whether the right areas are being prioritised."
"To put it bluntly, is the Schengen intelligence system being put to actual use in the fight against international crime and terrorism, as defined in the UN Convention?"
"Does it not mainly serve as an intelligence system to combat unwanted migration?"
"Please allow me to put this question to you again in today' s climate."
"Secondly, Schengen does, however, appear to be used in the framework of demonstrations on the occasion of European and international summits."
"No Democrat will object to the fact that trouble-makers who come to cause havoc are arrested."
"But the way in which peaceful protesters are being arrested via internal border controls and the exchange of intelligence on the basis of the Schengen Information System is really a bridge too far for anyone who is in favour of freedom of expression."
"Thirdly, police cooperation and the exchange of intelligence require proper monitoring by the legal systems and parliaments."
"That is where Schengen really takes things too far."
"It even goes so far that the Council has decided not to publish any more reports, since Schengen now supposedly forms part of the European acquis, as if Schengen ceases to exist as a result."
"In any event, my group would like to see Schengen in fact replaced by transparent, democratically controlled European rules but, in anticipation of this, we want the European Parliament, in tandem with national parliaments, to monitor Schengen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our objective is to develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice within which citizens' rights are respected and the free movement of persons is guaranteed."
"However, for over 20 years now, association activists and many elected representatives have been advocating a citizens' Europe that demonstrates solidarity and is open not only to goods and capital but also and above all to persons."
"For one brief moment, we had faith in the hope that was born in Schengen, a hope that was virtually suffocated at birth by intolerance, a failure of courage and a lack of calm political analysis."
"If Schengen represents a considerable step forward for Europe because of the progress made in certain areas, including police and judicial cooperation, it has to be said now that this step forward is a halting and discriminatory one."
"Although the Schengen Convention has come into force in its entirety in several Member States, there are still inequalities that affect persons who do not hold a European nationality or have the necessary papers, although certain persons or members of their family may have lived in Europe for very many years."
"Some Member States do not grant the same rights to everyone resident in their country, even if they all accept the same responsibilities."
"On top of this, we have an immigration and asylum policy that varies from one country to another, differing procedures and controls and repressive police practices leading to dramatic situations in human terms such as those we are now witnessing at Sangatte in the north of France."
"At the very heart of Europe, in the Channel Tunnel, thousands of men, women and children are risking their lives every day in an attempt to enter the United Kingdom."
"These people, while awaiting their journey, are concentrated in a reception centre in humanely unacceptable conditions supported only by humanitarian organisations without any power or means at their disposal, such as the Red Cross."
"These practices bring back some bitter memories."
"The political authorities still treat refugees and asylum-seekers with coldness, hypocrisy and intolerance."
"This is unacceptable in the wake of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Just imagine that police officers have even dared to fire real bullets at asylum seekers!"
"In fact you do not have to imagine it, because other police forces in Europe have already done it."
"These facts are continuing to discredit our parliaments in the eyes of thousands of members of the public who are calling for a halt to inequality, to injustice and to a Fortress Europe policy."
"For these reasons, we will be voting against this report, which overlooks all these facts and fails to offer any alternative."
"Instead, we should act together, as a matter of urgency, to find concrete and equitable solutions to all these dramatic situations, and in particular to the sufferings of the refugees at Sangatte, and to the cries of distress from all those who come to Europe seeking asylum and help."
"The decision-making processes nowadays concerning the police, the military, criminal law, Schengen and border controls are reminiscent, if anything, of a kind of political bodysnatching."
"Today' s report on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation and yesterday' s proposal from the Commission are really two sides of the same coin."
"As a Danish professor of criminal law expressed it very clearly yesterday, the alarming thing is that 'the EU Commission and other institutions are merely using the attacks in the United States as an opportunity to promote far-reaching harmonisation, and harmonisation means that the national traditions of criminal law, criminal procedure and police investigation are eliminated in favour of arrangements adopted in more or less of a panic that make controls more stringent and damage civic rights' ."
"He also says: 'Politicians feel they must demonstrate their power to take action, but there is no point at all in harmonising criminal legislation in the EU."
"That will not, in any case, reduce the number of terrorist acts by so much as one.'"
"That was the message."
"Today' s report will quickly be overtaken by events which take place long after the report has seen the light of day."
"The question underlying every political decision is that of whether we are thereby advancing our aims and, secondly, that of whether the means employed will compromise these aims."
"I am afraid that the answer to the first question is: 'No, we shall not achieve the declared aims' , and that all experience goes to show that the answer to the second question, of whether the means will compromise the ends, is unfortunately 'yes' ."
"The controls will be harmful, and anyone who cares to read the Supervisory Board' s report for 1998-99 and subsequent statements on the lack of supervision of the Schengen authorities will acknowledge that I am right."
"Mr President, Commissioner, illegal immigration is a daily phenomenon at all of the European Union' s borders, affecting certain regions with particular intensity and with an enormous humanitarian, social and economic impact."
"Please allow me to focus on those border regions of the Union which, like Andalusia, most vividly experience the arrival of dozens of people each day."
"Andalusia, owing to its geographical proximity to the Maghreb, is enduring great migratory pressure without having the appropriate instruments for confronting it."
"The Spanish administration has publicly acknowledged that the situation is unsustainable and, furthermore, bilateral relations with the Maghreb and the Kingdom of Morocco are difficult at the moment due to problems related to fishing, drug-trafficking and illegal immigration itself."
"Some of us have been arguing for years that, within the framework of the Schengen Agreement, the special status of border regions such as Andalusia should be recognised and that these areas of the European Union should be provided with instruments which would allow them to deal with the arrival of these immigrants more effectively."
"They should also be given the power to propose measures to the central government and to the European Union relating to work, residence and the necessary social integration of people who are forced to emigrate across the Straits of Gibraltar to reception regions such as Andalusia."
"Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to congratulate Parliament and its rapporteur on their detailed work."
"This report on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation touches on a subject at the very heart of the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"In fact Schengen is a rather special animal."
"On the one hand it guarantees freedom of movement, which is a key part of the Treaty, and on the other hand it responds to the need to encompass this freedom within a solid and coherent policy of external border controls and other compensatory measures."
"However, the integration of Schengen into the EU framework in practice marked the end of that agreement, although it lives on as a symbol."
"Schengen was created as a kind of test laboratory for the implementation of the absolute obligation laid down in the Single European Act."
"Schengen has subsequently been divided up and integrated into the framework of the Union, and the legislative provisions of the Community and of the Union are gradually replacing and developing the Schengen Convention and other decisions relating to it."
"By way of example, the joint manual and joint consular instructions have become regulations, and new proposals under the third pillar complement or replace the equivalent provisions of the Schengen Convention, which have been assigned to this pillar."
"Furthermore, in July the Commission submitted to the Council and Parliament a proposal bringing together in a single legal instrument the five categories of persons who can move freely within an uncontrolled area, thus following up the wish expressed by the European Parliament to bring together the various disparate provisions governing the movement of persons."
"The Commission accordingly intends to bring forward a proposal relating to Article 2 of the Schengen Protocol, so as to better encompass the safeguard clause on the reintroduction of internal border controls."
"This work has not been completed, but the objective is to 'Amsterdamise' Schengen in the near future."
"Mr President, that is why I think it would be difficult to embark upon an exercise which would involve regular reports on Schengen, because these would end up being reports on the various instruments that have replaced or are in the process of replacing Schengen."
"But I can commit the Commission to continuing to keep Parliament regularly informed of developments in this field, which for the sake of semantic convenience we will call Schengen."
"Furthermore, Parliament is kept informed of overall legislative and practical activity by means of the scoreboard created following the Tampere Council, which is regularly updated."
"The Commission considered that the conversion of the Schengen acquis should be based on priority needs depending on the development of the situation and political guidance from the Council and Parliament."
"One of these priorities is of course the development of the Schengen Information System, and of course also, and this will be of great interest to you, issues relating to the candidate countries."
"The rapporteur has taken these concerns on board and the Commission certainly shares them."
"I would like to give you some information on the most recent developments concerning the Schengen Information System, SIS II."
"As you know, the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 and 29 May did not reach unanimous agreement on intergovernmental finance."
"It was therefore agreed to provide financing from the Community budget."
"Furthermore, the Belgian Presidency and Sweden presented two initiatives, one on the first pillar and the other on the third pillar, with a view to giving the Commission, assisted by a committee, responsibility for developing SIS II between 2002 and 2006."
"The key objective of these two proposals, which are currently being considered by the Council, is first of all to provide a legal basis for the financing of this stage of development."
"Secondly, legislative proposals are to be presented on the various key aspects of SIS II, in particular the issue of management and functionality."
"In the context of its responsibility for financing, the Commission will also present a communication covering the various aspects of SIS II, that is to say legal, technical and financial issues, but also the various preparatory stages needed, and also the general method to be adopted until SIS II is finally established."
"Mr President, Mr Coelho, I wish to conclude by assuring you that your resolution will be taken into account by the Commission in assessing the efforts already made and those that remain to be made and in defining its priorities for action in the Schengen field."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Refugee status in Member States"
"The next item is the report (A5-0291/2001) by Mr Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"Mr President, I have the honour to have my name attached to this report but most of the work has been done by my Christian Democrat colleague, Mr Ingo Schmitt, who took this report through committee."
"Due to the result of the vote, he chose not to pursue it by introducing it in plenary and I am doing so on behalf of my committee."
"The Commission has proposed a Council directive on minimum standards for procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"The Commission has come forward with proposals for a number of rules on the handling of asylum applications."
"This is very much a first step towards the common asylum system which the Commission has proposed and which this House has on many occasions supported."
"These rules cover reception and detention facilities, the content of refugee status and the application process."
"They designate time limits for applications and appeals and they introduce specific rules for dealing with inadmissible cases."
"It is my honour to present on behalf of the committee a number of amendments to these proposals."
"We recognise that these amendments are not binding but we hope that they will be considered carefully and taken on board in policy formulation."
"Our amendments seek to clarify and strengthen the position of asylum seekers."
"We aim to ensure due respect for the Geneva Convention and its protocols and for the European Convention on Human Rights when dealing with applications for asylum."
"We aim to secure for asylum seekers the right to remain on the territory of a Member State until their appeal has been decided."
"We recommend special attention be paid to the cases of applications from women and children who have been particularly vulnerable to abuse and attack in the countries from which they flee."
"We seek to improve access to legal assistance for those seeking asylum and to emphasise that asylum seekers should not be sent back to places where their lives might be in danger."
"As a general rule, we reject or resist the practice of holding asylum seekers in detention centres."
"I for one welcome the recent United Kingdom court ruling against the UK government's practice of locking asylum seekers in detention centres, however modern those centres may be."
"We believe that asylum seekers who are often escaping persecution of the worst kind in their homelands have the right to be treated with dignity when they reach our shores."
"We understand the pressures on Member States but we reject the creeping tendency we see towards a dilution of the rights of asylum seekers."
"We believe that the determination of refugee status must remain a legal matter and not a matter of politics or one of political expediency."
"The health of a society is judged not only by its practices but also by the direction in which its face is set and my committee believes that the Commission's policy is taking us in the right direction even if we seek greater clarity in the rights of some of those to whom it is directed."
"It is not only a question of our legal and humanitarian obligations but also a question of economic and administrative common sense."
"The more asylum seekers that a government rejects - perhaps in the hope of courting short-term popular support of the basest nature - the more appeals it will face, the more it will be tied down in lengthy processes which will hit the taxpayer in the pocket."
"Our amendments seek to ensure not only administrative efficiency but also a humanitarian approach to the position of those on our planet who deserve our support and protection."
"I hope the House will follow the line that has been put forward by the committee in this report."
"Mr President, the Foreign Affairs Committee welcomes the changes made at the committee stage of this report, for as the common asylum and immigration policy of the EU develops, it is essential that its impact on the outside world and especially upon our close neighbours is fully taken into account."
"These countries, many of them candidate states, are at the sharp end of the refugee problem."
"Most of them have no experience of refugee and asylum policy."
"They all lack the financial and human resources to deal competently with applications to stay."
"The Foreign Affairs Committee also felt it was important to insert a reference to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as the obligation to respect all existing international law commitments."
"Finally, we have also insisted that the EU's new procedures should aim to contribute to the improvement of international relations by being as clear, transparent and reasoned as possible, so that their interpretation by third countries and their citizens will be facilitated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, I believe that the Committee, which adopted this version of the report by a majority, is on the wrong track."
"Let me explain briefly what I mean."
"About a year ago, when the Commission submitted its working document, we attempted to reach a compromise on this very difficult and sensitive issue."
"We agreed that we would distinguish between three specific groups: firstly, asylum seekers; secondly, persons who come to us on a temporary basis from crisis regions; and finally, people who wish to migrate to the Member States in order to make their lives here."
"In particular, we all recognised that we could only regulate the last pillar, that is, immigration, sensibly by ensuring that the number - I am choosing my words carefully - of unfounded asylum applications can be reduced, at least that we can process them consistently."
"We all know that no more than 10% or 15% of the applications submitted are genuinely well-founded and likely to be recognised under the Geneva Convention."
"This is where the Committee and a majority of its members have made two errors, in my view: firstly, it has abandoned the consensus which we worked so hard to achieve and, secondly, it has done no service at all to genuine applicants who are politically persecuted, because it also treats everyone who enters Germany or another Member State without a well-founded claim in more or less the same way and thus undermines the standing of genuine applicants."
"Expanding the rights of asylum to include new forms of (non-state) persecution, restricting the opportunities of Member States - at least those Member States which have to cope with large influxes - to make effective use of the 'safe country of origin' principle, but also the issue of how manifestly unfounded applications should be dealt with - indeed, the entire contents of this report - means that there is longer any way of taking effective action when large numbers of unfounded applications are made."
"I appeal to you yet again!"
"I know this is a difficult issue."
"I also know this is a sensitive issue."
"However, let us try to uphold the details of these common pillars which we discussed a year ago, and where there was plenty of scope to reach a consensus."
"I hope that the German Social Democrats - who adopt an entirely different tone in their dealings with their Home Affairs Minister in Germany - might change their voting behaviour today."
"I also hope that we will again find a way of achieving consensus which will enhance the status of those who have genuinely suffered political persecution and seek asylum in the Member States."
"Mr President, may I thank Mr Watson on behalf of our committee for bringing this report to plenary."
"I listened carefully to what Mr Watson and Mr Schmitt just said."
"Mr Schmitt spoke a lot about unjustified applications and, of course, we need to look at all applications properly."
"Mr Schmitt said, and I wholeheartedly agree with him, that Member States have to do more to address the root causes that are forcing people to migrate across Europe and across the world, but it is not easy to address the root causes in the countries from where many asylum seekers come."
"The highest number of asylum seekers in Europe come from Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka and at the moment, as we know only too well, it will not be easy to address quickly the situation in Afghanistan: we watch that situation with some terror."
"Nearer to home, we are affected, at the moment by the lack of a common working asylum system for Europe and the separate issue of a common immigration policy, which will come later."
"But we see on our television screens, certainly in Britain and France nightly, and colleagues in Spain have a similar problem, the way that the lack of a proper system manifests itself in tragedy."
"Asylum seekers are desperate people escaping in many cases war, violence and torture."
"Yes, Mr Schmitt, some of them are just escaping poverty, but we should not knock them for that."
"We need to give them respect and make certain that they are treated fairly."
"This report calls for high standards for reception of asylum seekers, to recognise that they are not criminals while their cases are being heard."
"People escaping from the worst situations do not need to be detained in prisons, detention centres and I agree with Mr Watson on this."
"Those escaping from war and torture do not need to be welcomed by barbed wire and armed guards."
"They need to have their cases heard properly, they need a fair system and they need a system that puts the individual at the heart of the process."
"This report goes some way towards that, but it is part of a much wider picture working towards a common European asylum system with a separate immigration system alongside it."
"I hope that we can get this through as amended and continue the vast amount of work still to be done in this area."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the People' s National Congress of China is seated in the official gallery."
"This delegation is led by Mrs Li Shu-Zheng, Vice-Chair of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the People' s National Congress of the People' s Republic of China."
"Mrs Li Shu-Zheng is accompanied by seven members of the People' s National Congress and by several high-level representatives from the Department for Foreign Affairs of the People' s National Congress of China."
"I warmly welcome the Chinese delegation, which has been participating in the 18th interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and China."
"This meeting took place on 17 and 18 September 2001."
"It gave rise to various bilateral meetings with the chairmen of the political groups and of the committees, and to a meeting with our President, Mrs Fontaine."
"The dialogue between the European Parliament and the People' s National Congress of China has developed over time and now covers a wide range of issues."
"We wish to see a permanent deepening of this dialogue combined with the strengthening of our cooperation with the People' s Republic of China."
"Refugee status in Member States (continuation)"
"Madam President, the objective of this important report is to produce an asylum system that is fair: fair on asylum seekers, but fair on taxpayers too."
"This report is not about who you should accept as a refugee, and I remind Mr Schmitt of that, but about how you decide which claims are valid."
"It is a great fallacy to assume that if you give asylum seekers less help in making their claims, they will somehow disappear and cost less time and money."
"Governments in search of populist headlines about the number of applications rejected from so-called bogus asylum seekers should tell the truth. The truth is that cutting corners early on in the procedure ends up costing a lot more in administration, court time, lawyers and the cost of food and shelter."
"I fear that Mr Schmitt did not understand this truth and has somehow misled Members of his group."
"I appeal therefore to those moderate Members of the Conservative/Christian Democrat Group to join the majority in this Parliament in strengthening the guarantees in the asylum procedure, because investment in high quality initial decisions including such matters as assistance with interpretation, legal advice, proper interviews and reasonable time limits, is a good bargain."
"Then on the question of fair treatment I would like to stress in particular the use of the safe third country concept."
"My group accepts the use of this concept as a guidance, but it must be one which is capable of being rebutted in an individual case."
"It is perfectly fair that an asylum seeker from, say, Canada, will have a greater job convincing the authorities that asylum is justified, compared to someone coming for example from Iraq."
"But it should be possible to make that case through individual assessment, not with a blanket dismissal of the claim."
"Madam President, we have heard a great deal over the last few days about some of the values which we hold dear, especially those of democracy and freedom."
"I would like to add: humanity, respect for human rights and equality before the law."
"So, within that context, I welcome much of the report now presented by Mr Watson: That perspective however, also explains why my group will not be supporting amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group which we rejected in committee and which we believe seek to restrict the rights of asylum seekers."
"I particularly welcome some of the amendments proposed by the committee, which state that the right to refugee status should be recognised rather than granted: refugee status is a legal right, not the gift of a benevolent regime."
"I also welcome the recognition that there are forms of persecution which are not included in the Geneva Convention."
"We debated such an issue in this House only last night, that of female genital mutilation."
"My group believes that we should be building on the Geneva Convention and that hopefully a common asylum policy will eventually do that."
"We also welcome the fact that the gender dimension is now recognised in this report."
"We also welcome the recognition of the need for the interviewing and assessment process for asylum applications to take place in the applicant's own language."
"This is crucial as the outcome of such procedures can literally be a matter of life or death for the applicant."
"How can we expect an individual who has suffered torture, humiliation or sexual degradation to express that in a language in which they can just get by."
"My group, however, rejects the concept of a safe third country."
"When we look at the huge variation between Members States of what they view as safe we can see the problems raised by this concept, especially taking new forms of persecution into account."
"As Baroness Ludford has said, every application must be dealt with on its own merits."
"We need the highest standards possible, and in that respect, this report has made substantial improvements."
"Madam President, the pictures we have seen in recent days from Afghanistan are of course clear evidence that the problem does not go away but that the flow of refugees unfortunately continues as a direct result of the policy we are pursuing here in our part of the world."
"I hear quite a few people talking about a common European asylum policy."
"Indeed, that might well be a very sensible idea, but I want, for my part, to say that the prerequisite for my being able to support it is that it should be a sound policy."
"The rapporteur originally tried to word this report in such a way that it restricted asylum seekers' rights and opportunities in our countries."
"What the committee finally agreed upon was to require that we should end up with a policy which, if anything, amounted to the status quo."
"I think it would be a good thing if the European Parliament could send out a clear signal now that, if there is to be a common asylum policy in the EU, it must in no circumstances be a policy that provides asylum seekers with poorer conditions than those under which they are at present living in the Member States."
"I very much hope that the result of the vote we are to hold this afternoon will be to send out such a signal."
"Madam President, Europe is running two risks."
"One is that we are erecting a 'fortress Europe' where foreigners are no longer welcome and where we do not take the slightest notice of the rest of the world."
"That is not what we want, nor is it in line with international obligations."
"The EU Member States must look after refugees, and not only refugees at their own backdoor, but also refugees elsewhere."
"Although the Commission' s proposal is not related to this, I still believe it is necessary to draw attention to the many refugees in camps."
"They too deserve support and attention, often more than they are receiving now."
"That is why the UNHCR must be given a huge financial boost."
"No fortress Europe, therefore, but there is also another risk."
"That is that Europe might be turning into a kind of playground to which almost everyone can gain easy access to enjoy the many benefits it has to offer."
"That is not want we want either."
"It places too heavy a burden on the facilities of the European states."
"In this day and age, when evidently many find the money and the means to come to Europe and seek asylum, asylum procedures must be strict and straightforward."
"Otherwise, life in the refugee camps will be in even starker contrast to this ideal."
"The Commission proposal is now a sober and realistic document which generally strikes the right balance between straightforward procedures and the rule of law."
"However, the amendments tabled by this Parliament with regard to the Commission document often lack the necessary balance."
"That is why I cannot support the majority of these."
"Madam President, the proposal for a Council directive on procedures for granting refugee status, which, as defined in the Treaty, is supposed to be binding on the Member States as regards the outcome to be achieved, whilst leaving it to the national authorities to decide what procedures and means to employ, is in fact an extremely nit-picking document."
"For example, it goes into inordinate length and detail on the definition of an unfounded application for asylum, in Article 28, of a safe third country, in Article 22 and in Annex I, and of a safe country of origin, in Annex II."
"As if the Member States were babes in arms and as if their officials had never processed a single application for asylum in their lives."
"But what is most extraordinary of all is that this proposal manages to be both nit-picking and lax at the same time."
"Because there are not many provisions motivated by the concern to grant so-called high-level guarantees to asylum seekers that are not also - and we must not overlook this point - low-level guarantees for the citizens of Member States."
"Let me quote just one example amongst many, Article 25, which stipulates that if the applicant's declarations are not proven but appear simply to be probable, he should be given the benefit of the doubt."
"This may seem to be a generous gesture in principle and indeed it is, but in the context of the troubled times in which we find ourselves today it fails to take account of other interests at stake, and above all those of the European public."
"That is why we believe that the text before us today should just be the first part of the final directive."
"Following this first part, which is devoted to the protection of asylum-seekers, a second part needs to be written, which will be devoted to the protection of the European public, who at best will foot the bill for this policy and at worst will be the victims of it. I say that because we should not forget that at least three-quarters of applications for asylum submitted nowadays ultimately turn out to be unfounded."
"And please do not tell us, Commissioner, that those texts will follow later."
"They should be presented to us at the same time so that we can take an overall view."
"Having said that, I can scarcely bring myself to mention the amendments proposed in the report from the relevant committee of the European Parliament."
"I will come back to those in my explanation of vote."
"Let me just say at this stage that they are so rash that in the end the rapporteur himself ended up resigning and having to be replaced in fairly disastrous circumstances."
"All these texts, both the directive and the amendments, remind us, against the background of our recent debates on security, that it is extremely unhealthy in times like these to authorise 400 000 to 500 000 asylum-seekers a year to enter our territory, given that the majority will ultimately be turned down, but as they are not expelled, will remain on a semi-clandestine basis."
"This floating, unchecked population is growing every year and adding to other sources of clandestine immigration."
"We believe, Madam President, having seen the documents before us today, that the European institutions are still a long way from giving priority to the public' s safety."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are being asked to express our views on a subject which in itself involves a very broad spectrum of activities."
"It is easy to talk about the right to asylum pure and simple, holding it up as a sacred principle, and it is all the more clearly sacred at this sensitive moment when the world is shaken by such dramatic events; solidarity and goodwill are the feelings that we all, in our bewilderment, feel we want to appeal to so that we can build new, better structures between people, worlds and cultures."
"It is also clear, however, that, right now, we must not deviate from the objective of achieving tangible situations and establishing practical prospects that are closely linked to reality."
"In the proposal for a directive, as Mr Schmitt has already mentioned, there are some - in our view - complex concepts that conflict with the direction we had embarked on in our work last year and open up certain political problems that, in our opinion, are quite serious."
"Is it right, for instance, to accept that a third country that is considered safe should always be so regardless of the tangible fact that links it to the asylum seeker?"
"Or that a manifestly unfounded application should, even so, always give rise to a complicated, expensive verification procedure?"
"It goes without saying that certainty on this is in the clear interests both of those who have serious grounds for seeking protection and of the host country itself."
"I do not want to go into the legal and philosophical concept of what constitutes being manifestly unfounded, but on matters which are now more sensitive than ever such as that addressed by the Watson report, we must show our determination to build without putting up obstacles, and to help without negative or even destructive effects on our social systems."
"Therefore, when we look at the wording on the extension of the right to asylum, the fast-track procedure and the appeals procedure, I think that, on careful analysis, my doubts will be widely shared."
"Madam President, I feel compelled to respond to the things that have been said in this House with regard to the position of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on this issue."
"Mr Schmitt, there is absolute agreement in my group that the three different groups of people arriving in the Union should be dealt with differently."
"So much so that we supported the Wiebenga report with regard to the first group that you mentioned, with a view to creating regulations on reception for temporary refugees, who come in massive numbers fleeing from conflict, which is something the European Peoples' Party did not do."
"With regard to asylum and refuge, we agree that we should treat asylum seekers as a group of people seeking protection and who want to enter for humanitarian reasons on an equal basis with those seeking reunification with their families."
"The problem is, Mr Schmitt, that my group cannot renounce, despite what you claim Mr Shily, the German Interior Minister, says, the idea that refugees are individuals and that each case must be treated individually in accordance with personal circumstances and not nationality, as well as the safe non-EU country they have reached, for example. A non-EU country may be safe for one individual but not for another, but do not force me to give examples, since these are always odious."
"We cannot relinquish this idea and furthermore, at a time when the European Union is going to produce the first harmonised legislation on refugees, we want to send a clear signal that we are in favour of this common legislation but not in order to reduce levels of protection and rights of asylum seekers, a field in which the European Union has been an historic example and has greatly assisted organisations such as the UNHCR and others."
"With regard to the issue of asylum and immigration, there is no doubt that we agree that immigrants are not refugees."
"But the problem is that we lack the courage to create clear immigration laws, which would allow the legal entry of people which our society and our labour market can absorb, without destroying the asylum system in the process, which has been the only open door for many years."
"We are in absolute agreement on this."
"This is our position and it seems very clear to me."
"Madam President, I want to thank the committee and its chairman for a well-considered report."
"The increasing flow of refugees in recent years shows the need for a common refugee policy both within the EU and globally."
"The various Member States' more or less panicky reactions faced with people' s desire to find sanctuary and a new life in Europe have struck a very discordant note, given the humanitarian values the EU stands for."
"There have been many tragedies on the EU' s borders, involving vessels that have gone down, desperate refugees who have hidden in containers and refugees who have tried to swim their way to Europe."
"On many occasions, I have felt depressed by quite a few of the proposals from the Member States and the Commission whose main aim seems to have been to stop, impede, deport and expel."
"Those who have spoken of an EU that is developing into a fortress Europe are, unfortunately, not completely mistaken."
"Against this background, this proposal for a directive is along the right lines."
"The rights of the individual are emphasised, and repressive measures do not dominate."
"It is certainly true that common asylum rules are needed within the EU, but there also needs to be scope for individual Member States to make more generous assessments."
"The committee has guaranteed this scope."
"The committee also strengthens the rights of the individual under the Geneva Convention in relation to the position of children, the ability to hold refugees in custody, greater knowledge on the part of those who have to deal with matters relating to refugees and reasonable periods within which applications are to be processed."
"Quite simply, it is a question of increased legal certainty."
"I am nonetheless a little uneasy about the Council' s future handling of these issues."
"We must safeguard the absolute requirement under the Geneva Convention that every refugee shall have his case examined individually, just as Baroness Ludford said."
"As I see it, there are no safe countries."
"If, as Europeans, we are not completely to forfeit our good name, a different refugee policy based upon respect, openness and legal certainty is required."
"It is not countries such as Nauru that can be expected to assume responsibility for people fleeing from barbaric regimes such as that in Afghanistan."
"Empathy and humanitarianism are required even more now, a week after the tragedy in the United States."
"Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the clarity of the proposals contained in Mr Watson' s report on the granting of refugee status."
"I feel that he has succeeded in reconciling various points of view."
"I personally see this report as complementing both the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Geneva Convention."
"As the Commission wanted, I believe that we finally have a good basis for discussion."
"We all know that there was a very wide disparity between the various Member States' approaches to accepting refugees."
"We also know that the steps involved were complex and difficult."
"This report enables us to go somewhat further."
"And it also enhances the aid and support that we can give to refugees."
"I am also satisfied that our committee has taken into account the new forms that persecution can take. A few decades ago we were welcoming Chilean and Soviet refugees fleeing from dictatorships and persecution at the hands of their own governments."
"Nowadays there are certainly forms of repression, which force us to change our mindset and to take into account practices such as the sexual and genital mutilation of women, and new forms of persecution associated with terrorist groups and fundamentalists, and I believe that we have certainly taken that into consideration."
"I would even go further and say that it is time that we considered asylum on health grounds bearing in mind that a disaster like AIDS is ravaging a continent, and similarly we should consider accepting child soldiers when they are at the mercy of arms dealers."
"I believe that it is also important for this report to be adequate in terms of the fight against discrimination."
"I shall conclude by saying that in recent weeks, in view of the terrifying attacks committed on the United States last week, the fear of attacks against Afghan civilians has become a real one."
"At present, there are 600 people in the camp at Sangatte who are firmly committed to opposing terrorism."
"They are asking to be accepted here."
"I think that if we were able to accept them, this would not only be a way of breaking the perceived link between terrorism and Islam, but that these people would also be solid allies in the fight against terrorism."
"Mr Watson, let me take the liberty of suggesting that we could ascribe that phrase from Camus to you, when he said that his revolt was also the revolt of others."
"Thank you for your report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's proposal offers refugees an opportunity to acquire refugee status under the Geneva Convention in accordance with uniform criteria which will apply throughout the European Union."
"This proposal guarantees rapid and reliable procedures for genuine refugees - who account for around 10% of all those who apply for asylum - and also ensures that unsuccessful applications will be rejected quickly."
"This applies to around 90% of asylum seekers who apply for reasons other than genuine persecution. That is better than being forced to wait for years before being informed of a negative decision."
"This proposal also puts an end to 'asylum shopping' ."
"However, we also need supplementary measures."
"These include the Dublin Convention, Eurodac, and rules on safe third countries and safe countries of origin."
"The European People' s Party therefore supports the Council's proposal."
"However, on behalf of the PPE-DE, I should like to make it clear that asylum law must not now be exploited for political purposes through all the amendments and proposals put forward here and used as a pretext for immigration on many different grounds."
"This ignores the reality."
"We must use these new European instruments for immigration, asylum or short-term help when refugees come from war-torn regions."
"We must not adopt any unrealistic measures."
"In future, it must be guaranteed that the right of asylum will be reserved for those who are politically persecuted and will not be extended to groups who some people might want to bring here for political reasons but who do not comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention."
"Our aim must be to guarantee reliable and prompt support for genuine refugees, as well as follow-up measures to assist them with integration. At the same time, we must make it clear to everyone else that there will be other new instruments governing economic immigration into the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, particularly in light of recent events, today's debate - which I believe we are conducting in a genuinely objective way - is a good example to other parliaments."
"It is extremely necessary, but because it is necessary, it is also very difficult."
"Sadly, we now have to begin yet again to dismantle prejudices against people seeking asylum."
"These prejudices result from fears which are largely unjustified but which must nonetheless be taken seriously."
"Now in particular, I think it is important that we no longer engage in lengthy speech-making but take action."
"I believe that those people who, in the wake of the recent outrages, shouted for the military to intervene must admit that as politicians, we bear responsibility now more than ever and that we must prove that we are not responding in blind panic but are capable of acting responsibly to deal with the difficulties we face."
"For this reason - and I say this to the Members on the Conservative benches - we are not acting as if we are in fundamental agreement with Mr Schmitt or Mr Pirker because we like them as individuals."
"There are reasons why we are changing our voting behaviour and voting differently from our group on a number of amendments."
"The background is as follows: although we are delighted that the Party of European Socialists in this House is doing everything possible to grant refugees more protection and rights, which we greatly welcome, we have a problem as German Social Democrats."
"We cannot accept an agreement or decision if it does not conform with the German constitution."
"At present, the German Basic Law does not permit us to accept around 17 of the proposed amendments."
"For this reason, we have to adopt a different voting behaviour from our group on a number of these amendments."
"This does not imply that we have different objectives."
"Our objectives are the same."
"However, we have to consider the credibility of our policies in Germany."
"We cannot disappoint our citizens and accept a decision which is impossible to implement at home."
"This is why we will be adopting a different voting behaviour today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in a situation in which the outrages in the USA have been used by some people as a pretext to incite antipathy towards asylum seekers, it is especially important for the European Union to devise minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status which are based on respect for human rights."
"The Commission's proposal meets this requirement."
"I particularly welcome two provisions proposed by the Commission."
"Article 3(3) states that Member States may decide to apply the provisions of this Directive to procedures for deciding on applications for kinds of protection other than that emanating from the Geneva Convention for persons who are found not to be refugees."
"This means that persons fleeing from fundamentalist violence - as in Algeria - or rape victims can be granted asylum. The UNHCR has been calling for this provision for some time."
"Unfortunately, it has not yet been adopted in practice in my own country, for example."
"Annex 1 sets forth the three criteria which must be met for a country to be defined as a safe third country. If these criteria are applied in future, some of the deportations from EU countries will no longer be permitted."
"I am pleased that the Commission's acceptable proposal has been improved by the Committee responsible and not watered down as the original rapporteur Mr Schmitt intended."
"As it now stands, the Directive is an important step towards a more humane asylum policy in the European Union."
"Madam President, I would like to remind the House of the importance of the proposal we are debating today, for various reasons."
"Firstly, I believe we should make it very clear that this is a very important first step towards a common European asylum system which, in the long term, will be valid throughout the Union."
"Secondly, I believe that we must not now forget that what we are doing is no less than fulfilling one of the objectives agreed at the Tampere European Council, where respect for the right to asylum was reaffirmed in a completely unconditional way."
"Thirdly, despite possible discrepancies between parliamentary groups on certain points of the proposal we debated, we must not forget that, in reality, we are providing all the European national systems with a structure that may operate efficiently in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees."
"I believe that the European Union, from this Parliament, cannot look the other way and fail to implement the instruments that Europe is developing at this moment."
"We must remember the Charter of Fundamental Rights which this House recently approved and that, if it is to be borne in mind in this particular field, it must always be with a view to implementing that which was agreed in the Geneva Convention and never to reduce it."
"For one reality we cannot forget is that, since the second half of 1996, the number of asylum seekers in the European Union has increased considerably, while the resolutions which recognise and grant that right have diminished alarmingly."
"For all these reasons I believe that the amendments that we have adopted in committee and which we are presenting to Parliament today have substantially improved the Council' s proposal and have highlighted certain very interesting questions, especially with regard to the safeguards for asylum seekers, the principle of non-return and also certain essential minimum requirements throughout the process of taking decisions on the recognition of this status, which require that each case be studied individually."
"These asylum requests cannot be resolved collectively."
"Despite the Commission' s misgivings, I believe that we will have taken a great step forward with these amendments, if they are also adopted today in Parliament."
"Madam President, I am sorry to have to begin by saying that this proposal is highly disappointing for several reasons, as is the debate that we have had so far, with rare exceptions."
"Some speakers have shown that they are not quite aware of the limits between humanitarianism and permissiveness or between necessary controls and unnecessary torture, but, above all, many have shown they do not understand that laws are not made of rubber - they are not as elastic as some would like, that is - but they have certain fixed points, certain cornerstones, beyond which one cannot go."
"The reason why I think this document should be rejected is that it is not balanced."
"It all too clearly favours the position of the asylum seeker, exaggerating the values I have just summarised, and places the Member States and competent bodies in a really difficult position to make a serious assessment of asylum seekers' applications."
"Another reason is that this seems to be a purely theoretical text, clearly divorced from the reality on which it is necessarily and inevitably based: the everyday reality of countries - particularly (but not only) my own, Italy - that have to grapple with the problem of uncontrolled immigration on a daily basis."
"Another reason for rejecting this type of formulation also derives from the lack of uniformity in the assessments made by Member States in their procedures for granting refugee status."
"One can thus find cases of secondary migration; that is, refugees enter via the most permissive State and then transfer or move on internally to another, more restrictive State."
"The proposal is not even clear on the distinction between the three different groups of asylum seekers either: those suffering political persecution as defined in the Geneva Convention, which has already been mentioned; refugees from war zones; and economic and occupational immigrants."
"It is unacceptable that three categories of asylum seekers that are so different from each other should be dealt with under the same rules."
"The Commission, furthermore, seems even to want to streamline the asylum acceptance procedure, extending it also to people whose cases do not come within the spirit of the Geneva Convention or the openings of the Tampere Council or even the updates on this issue to Title IV of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"What makes the Commission' s proposal and also the Parliamentary Committee' s draft legislation inadequate is that they do not correspond to reality."
"An ordinary piece of legislation is proposed for a severe emergency situation."
"Come and see what has been happening every day for the last ten years along the Italian coastline; come and see the conditions under which we are working to receive the people, not to put them in prison, and you will realise how inadequate these proposed guidelines are."
"As I said at the beginning, here we must not confuse humanitarianism with strictness: the two things can go together."
"If you think that 300-400 refugees arrive in Italy every day, 1000 yesterday alone, you will realise that certain precautions are necessary or even inevitable."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for long laments of pity such as I heard just now."
"There are no cases of inhuman treatment, nobody is held in temporary prisons; the refugees are received and fed, and then they are identified and classified to sort out the illegal immigrants among them, who are rejected, from the genuine ones, who are helped to stay, and also to try to identify underworld infiltrators."
"There it is, then: strictness, yes; permissiveness, no."
"That is why our group will support all of Mr Schmitt' s amendments that aim to restore the original text of the report, that which lays down fairer rules, especially for the Member States that find themselves in this difficult situation."
"In short, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: once they have got through the door into Italy, thanks to Schengen you will find all kinds, genuine ones and unwelcome ones, in your own countries."
"I shall give the floor to Commissioner Reding to wind up the debate on Mr Watson' s report."
"Commissioner, rather unusually, we have a little time at our disposal, so if you would like to take advantage of that, we will be pleased to hear what you have to say."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I have to say that having been a Member of the European Parliament myself for ten years, it is little short of a miracle to hear you say that I have time to speak!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission very much welcomes the in-depth consideration that Parliament has given to this proposal."
"I would like to tell Mr Watson how much we have appreciated his work."
"Furthermore, the number and quality of the amendments are bound to add to the debate, and this comes at a crucial point in the process of creating a common policy on asylum."
"I would first like to put this proposal in its proper overall context."
"The Tampere European Council actually wanted to create a common European asylum system and it agreed on a two-phase approach to achieve this."
"Firstly, the adoption of minimum common standards in the areas laid down in Article 63 of the Treaty, and then the development of a common procedure and uniform status for persons under international protection."
"The achievement of the first phase was dependent on the Commission adopting a certain number of legislative initiatives, which did indeed take place with the adoption on 12 September of a proposal for a directive on determining the status and forms of subsidiary protection."
"So this cycle is now complete."
"Furthermore, in its communication of November 2000, on which this House, Madam President, will give its opinion on 2 October, the Commission proposed moving on to the second phase by means of a special methodology."
"Its intention is to present this methodology in this communication and to draw lessons from the first year's work, and it will make proposals for new directions in the run-up to the Laeken European Council."
"The proposal that we are discussing today is one of the most important and most sensitive aspects of this system."
"It was prepared chiefly on the basis of information drawn from a wide-ranging consultation process based on a working document presented in March 1999."
"The European Parliament had an opportunity to give its views in June 2000 and the Commission took on board many of the recommendations brought forward at that time."
"Madam President, today' s resolution comes at a turning point in work in this area."
"I say that because the Belgian Presidency, with the support of the Commission, intends to use the coming months to make significant progress on asylum matters."
"This dossier, like immigration in general, should be one of the key aspects of the interim balance sheet of the implementation of the Tampere decisions and will therefore be prepared by the European Council by the end of this year."
"Against this background, the Council of Ministers is due to hold an exploratory debate on 27 and 28 September and the outcome of that debate will determine how ambitious we are in our overall approach in this area."
"We need to remember that our objective is to approximate national arrangements on procedures."
"I would add that this work will also extend to the two other proposals, one on reception conditions for asylum-seekers and the other on the determination of the Member State responsible for examining an application for asylum."
"What is more, these three texts are interlinked."
"They need to be seen as a whole and I believe in fact that this House has always seen things in that light."
"I would like to take the liberty of encouraging the European Parliament to give its opinion on these two other initiatives as quickly as possible."
"With particular reference to procedures, there is no denying that there is a great disparity in a number of key areas."
"And I do not believe that that should come as a surprise to us, because this initiative deals with a great many technically complex issues, which in itself is not so difficult, but they are also politically sensitive, which in the present political climate is a real problem."
"Furthermore, the Council' s technical bodies have not yet completed the first reading, which means that the Member States' delegations have not yet had an opportunity to express their views on certain key provisions."
"This is one of the reasons, Madam President, why it is difficult at this stage to comment in a definite way on this House' s amendments on appeal procedures, because we are still waiting for the Council to analyse and examine this issue."
"Lastly, the discussions in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the content of the excellent draft legislative resolution presented by Mr Watson confirm the feeling that there is at present a clear divergence - as you know and as was evident this morning - between the expectations of the European Parliament and the capacity of the Council to reach unanimous agreement."
"So the Commission is to some extent between two stools, as it were, but it intends to take on board your opinion, and the guidelines that may emerge from the discussions at ministerial level, as a basis for preparing an amended proposal so as to facilitate a possible consensus."
"In this context it seems vital to maintain the balance sought in the original proposal between, on the one hand, the desire to consolidate the rights of asylum-seekers, with due respect for international instruments, and in particular the Geneva Convention, and, on the other hand, the need for efficient and swift procedures and the need to achieve a degree of convergence so as to prevent 'asylum shopping' ."
"That is why, and I wish to repeat this and make it very clear to your rapporteur, the Commission has a great deal of sympathy for the general approach that emerges from the draft legislative resolution."
"However, it will not be possible for the Commission to adopt some of the suggestions made in that resolution which would undermine the achievement of these dual aims, and which would ultimately undermine the adoption of a text which we all wholeheartedly wish to see."
"For example, the distinction between the normal procedure and the accelerated procedure, which is actually practised, in theory at least, in the Member States is a cornerstone of this."
"If we were to accept the amendments seeking to eliminate this, this would involve seriously compromising the chances of getting the proposal adopted."
"On the other hand, Mr Watson, the Commission is certainly ready to take into account either the spirit or the letter of certain amendments that aim to improve the applicant' s protection without undermining the fundamental distinction, which I mentioned earlier."
"By the same token, the Commission shares the concerns reflected in various amendments which seek to further improve the quality of decisions made, whilst enhancing the situation of applicants and aiming to improve the efficiency of the national authorities which implement the procedures."
"Nevertheless, the legislative route is not necessarily the best way of achieving such an objective, which in many cases may be done by improving and approximating administrative practices."
"It is more likely that these standards will be achieved by implementing other means of cooperation, such as the open cooperation method which the Commission will in coming weeks be proposing should be extended to asylum matters."
"Furthermore, certain of the amendments would fit better into your resolutions on the communitarisation of the Dublin Convention and on the definition of refugees to which I drew your attention just now."
"Other proposals will have to be taken into consideration."
"The Commission is accordingly in favour of strengthening the connection between this directive and international or European human rights instruments."
"In particular, compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union needs to be clearly stated and guaranteed."
"Similarly, it is important to be aware of the effect of adopting a text of this kind in the context of enlargement, and of its impact as regards updating the international protection agenda."
"I have in mind in particular the global consultation process launched by the United Nations High Commissioner' s Office for Refugees on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention."
"Lastly, the Commission does of course agree with your desire to see a more systematic follow-up to the implementation of this directive."
"A measure of this kind is indeed vital to support and speed up the changeover to the common procedure decided upon at Tampere as the ultimate objective for the European Union."
"Madam President, to conclude, the Commission reiterates its appreciation of the quality of the draft legislative resolution before us today."
"It agrees with the general spirit of this resolution, but must nevertheless clearly inform this House about the difficulties that exist."
"We need to take account of the constraints on the preparation of our amended proposal, and, furthermore, we hope that the Laeken European Council will give the European Union the necessary impetus to finally put into practice the aspirations declared in 1999 at Tampere."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. until voting time and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)"
"Mr President, colleagues, I wanted to send you an e-mail about this, but unfortunately I cannot send e-mails at the moment."
"I know that many of you have been experiencing particular difficulties with GroupWise."
"Since the beginning of last week, other computer problems linked to the main computer system have been sorted out, but the GroupWise blockages have not yet been solved."
"I am in constant contact with the LSU-MEP Help-Desk and hope to have more concrete information on the GroupWise situation later today."
"The company responsible for the server has been brought in to help find the solution."
"I also wanted to send another e-mail advising colleagues to be at the airport at least two hours before the departure of their flight."
"This is because of long delays as a result of increased security checks."
"I am sorry to have to make a point of order again about smoking in the workplace."
"As I was about to make a speech on harassment at work during last night's plenary session, the people in the booth behind me were smoking with the door open."
"I had an asthma attack just before I was due to speak."
"That is a case of harassment at the workplace."
"You are absolutely right."
"Quite apart from your personal health problems, it is a matter of courtesy."
"Neither Members nor anyone else should smoke anywhere other than in the designated smoking areas."
"VOTE"
"Mr President, Mr Barnier was in contact yesterday with the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control to explain to her the Commission' s position on this subject."
"I can therefore assure you that while it will not accept the amendments proposed, the Commission will take the necessary steps to achieve the outcome sought by Parliament, and that when the amended regulation is adopted by the Council the Commission will make a statement in which it will confirm that the provisions for combating irregularities and fraud contained in the financing agreements signed between the Commission and recipient countries will be strengthened, and it will commit itself to improving the information given to Parliament."
"Welcome"
"Before we continue with the vote colleagues, it is my pleasure to inform you that Mrs Chantal Compaore, wife of the President of Burkina Faso and Goodwill Ambassador of the Organisation for the Unity of Africa against female genital mutilation, and Mrs Shamin Kahn, Deputy Minister for Social Affairs of Tanzania have now taken their seats in the official gallery."
"I wish to extend to them a very warm welcome on behalf of this House."
"(Loud applause)"
"VOTE (continuation)"
"Mr President, do you know the difference between sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide?"
"I am sure you do."
"You know that sulphur dioxide is written SO2 whereas, in chemistry, sulphur trioxide is written with the formula SO3."
"I am sure you know that."
"I did not, and thanks to this directive I have had to brush up my chemistry, which I feel is a really good thing for me personally because, had I not become an MEP, I would not have had the chance to study chemical formulae again, which are so important in this directive laying down that SO2, that is sulphur dioxide, emissions will be restricted."
"I have, of course, voted for it in the interests of the well-being of all pensioners."
"Report Riitta Myller (A5-0292/2001)"
"This directive too, Mr President, deals with the emission of harmful chemical substances into the air we breathe."
"I want to confirm that I voted for it, like many of us, not only because this will enable us in future centuries to have a less polluted atmosphere that is less damaging to our health, but also because I believe that, if everybody knows that we in Europe breathe healthier, cleaner, less polluted air, we shall have more tourists in Europe who, as well as coming to see the beauty of history and nature that we have throughout Europe - in Scotland, for instance, where you come from, or in Genoa and Liguria, where I come from - if there is cleaner air as well, will come in even greater numbers!"
"Reports Oomen-Ruijten and Myller (A5-0293 and 0292/2001)"
"We voted for both the Oomen-Ruijten report and the Myller report because both propose setting emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants."
"Although the proposals are limited, they do represent a slight improvement as compared with the present situation."
"We nevertheless regret that because of capitalist interests and national self-interest, which are two sides of the same coin, the proposed texts delay application until 2010."
"Whenever an attempt is made to control private interests, even by proposing measures in the public interest, it is always the latter that suffers in the process."
"Report Marinho (A5-0274/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for this regulation of the acceptance by each of the fifteen European Union Member States of the legislation of the other States, with mutual recognition of judgments and decisions, beginning in this directive with the seizing of assets and securing of evidence."
"I am not in favour of this Europe, Mr President."
"I should like a European criminal code, a European civil code, a European code of civil procedure and a European code of criminal procedure."
"I believe that, at some point in the future, Europe will have to have the same laws in all countries."
"We voted in favour of the Marinho report supporting the initiative by France, Sweden and Belgium for the adoption by the Council of a framework decision, which would greatly facilitate judicial cooperation in Europe."
"This would in fact involve accepting the automatic mutual recognition of judicial decisions freezing certain assets or evidence in the context of inquiries concerning certain defined offences."
"This approach provides a useful means of stepping up cooperation while respecting the legal systems in the various Member States."
"We would even be in favour of a more clear-cut approach."
"Under the text proposed, the new mutual recognition procedure would apply to freezing orders in the context of very precise and specifically listed offences, that is to say drug trafficking, fraud affecting the European Communities' financial interests, laundering of the proceeds of crime, counterfeiting of the euro, corruption and trafficking in human beings."
"However, other important offences are missing from this list. These need to be curbed as a matter of urgency, as in the case of terrorism, which we have denounced once again over the last few days."
"That is why the Members from the Movement for France support Amendment No 5, which provides for a broader definition of the offences targeted, that is all offences punishable by means of a custodial sentence or custodial security measure with a maximum duration of at least six months."
"If there were a need to go beyond the freezing of assets or evidence, we should study in greater depth an improved right of safeguard system, which can be used effectively but also rapidly by the Member State receiving the application."
"Report Watson (A5-0291/2001)"
"Mr President, on behalf of my 34 colleagues from the Social Democratic Party of Germany and also on my own behalf, I should like to make the following comments about the vote on the Watson report, which was formerly the Schmitt report. In the Federal Republic at present, the issue of immigration/asylum legislation and residence rights in Germany are the subject of a very broad debate."
"The Federal government, the German Bundestag, the Länder, party commissions and cross-party commissions have been engaged in an intensive debate on issues which to some extent fall within the scope of the Watson report, and we are currently in the process of debating legislation within Parliament and between Parliament, the Federal government and the Bundesrat."
"Against this background, the SPD representatives in this House have been presented with Commission proposals, the opinions of the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt - now Mr Watson - and proposals from the various groups which partly conform and partly conflict with the domestic policy issues facing Social Democrats in Germany."
"On a number of points, we have therefore deviated from our group's voting behaviour or rejected the proposals. Here, our apparent proximity to the PPE-DE Group exists solely on paper, for our substantive views are generally different from theirs."
"However, we joined our group in supporting the Watson report in the final vote out of our sense of Social Democratic loyalty, although in terms of German constitutional law, we had major concerns on a number of issues which we believed it was important to voice."
"I felt I should explain this background because when the vote was taken in this House, we had yet to reach a position in the domestic policy debate. As a result, some of what we have agreed here does not necessarily tie in with what we are debating at home."
"You will excuse me, Mr President, I mean no lack of respect to Mr Watson, whom I like a lot, but I could not help thinking of Sherlock Holmes and his faithful ally, Dr Watson."
"'Elementary, my dear Watson!' is what I feel I must say at this moment, meaning that it is obvious that one must intervene to stop uncontrolled and illegal immigration."
"But unfortunately I have had to vote against this measure."
"Why?"
"Because the excellent amendments by my friend Mr Borghezio, who is sitting here beside me, were not passed."
"They were aimed at limiting immigration to stop the kind of thing that happened to me in Brussels: I had barely stuck my nose outside Parliament when some people who looked like immigrants snatched my MEP' s diary from me;"
"I am still looking for it and I have not yet found it."
"Mr President, the institution of political asylum is part of the most noble legal tradition of our peoples, but the Watson report, in my opinion, makes a serious mistake in extending its scope, in expanding it to embrace a number of cases that lie outside the historical nature of this important and noble institution of public law."
"My amendments had a single purpose - and I thank Mr Fatuzzo for recalling it and pointing it out - which is to prevent the improper use of the institution of asylum and that of the political refugee: we are running the risk of encouraging illegal immigration which, as another Member of this Parliament has highlighted in the debates of these few days, also breeds terrorism."
"It therefore seems rather serious that some political groups, who appear to be against illegal immigration, should have wanted to block my amendments with their votes."
". (FR) - As might have been feared, Parliament has just approved the proposal for a directive brought in by the Commission on the granting of refugee status, the laxity of which I condemned in the course of the preceding debate."
"Parliament has also, however, found the means to add amendments which worsen these defects still further and strengthen our opposition."
"In particular, the original proposal envisaged, in principle, that an appeal against a ruling rejecting a request for asylum would have a suspensive effect, permitting the asylum-seeker to remain in the territory of the country in question while awaiting a final decision, but States would be able to claim an exception to this rule in certain instances, for example, where a request was rejected as manifestly unfounded."
"The European Parliament, however, removed this exception by means of Amendment No 85."
"The result of this is that, even where a request is manifestly unfounded, the applicant could then remain on our territory while awaiting a final ruling on his appeal."
"This intention is confirmed by the adoption of Amendment No 5, which seeks to create a ""right to remain on the territory of the country of asylum until the reaching of a final decision""."
"Furthermore, the adoption of Amendment No 96 prevents Member States from dodging this disaster because it prevents them from abolishing the option of appealing where a request for asylum has been turned down on the grounds of being manifestly unfounded."
"All these amendments are extremely serious, because they aim to settle notoriously persistent asylum seekers down for months on end to await a definitive ruling, which is bound to be negative."
"In the meantime, however, they will, of course, have disappeared and gone underground."
"They want to promote massive immigration, as demonstrated by the rejection of Amendment No 126 which stated that a request for asylum is manifestly unfounded if it is made only ""for economic reasons or with the sole object of escaping from a general situation of poverty or from an armed conflict"". The blow that this would deal to our countries could contribute to destabilising them even further."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the Watson report."
"We agree that the EU should establish minimum standards for procedures employed in the Member States for allocating and removing refugee status."
"We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position."
". (FR) - We voted for all the amendments which seek to extend protection and provide greater rights for refugees, and likewise for the report as amended."
"However, we protest against the passage which insists on States' ""prerogatives of immigration control and control of entry into their territory"", thereby in fact restoring to them the right to impose restrictive measures."
". The new proposals to harmonise asylum procedures across the EU are welcomed by the Green/EFA Group, as it constitutes an important step forward and is very much needed."
"These proposals provide for basic norms in three key areas: the authority responsible for determining the receivability of the asylum applications, the independent institution to which the asylum seekers can resort to re-examine their application and the appeal procedure."
"In particular we welcome the time limits introduced for the processing of applications which will ensure that the current backlog in many member states will be cleared and a fairer procedure brought into place."
"However it must be remembered that the attempt to establish common norms regarding safe country, and the concept of safe country of origin, in general is restrictive and could be used and abused by member states."
"I know that in Ireland, my own country, the government has bilateral agreements signed with Romania and Nigeria and is planning to sign more in the future."
"These agreements are to speed up the procedure of deportation and fall far short of what should be done."
"We feel a thorough examination of each asylum demand and a decision should be based on each individual case."
"It is essential that these concepts should not be enshrined in the Directive as it would open the way for abuses of all kind, and I feel the same applies to speeding up asylum procedures which could also downgrade the quality of the procedure."
"- (SV) We feel uneasy about the fact that the concepts 'safe countries of origin' and 'safe third countries' are on the way to being introduced at Community level."
"Any State can potentially infringe human rights, and no country can therefore automatically be regarded as safe."
"Asylum seekers must be entitled to have their cases examined on the same basis, irrespective of which country they come from."
"The report makes it possible for the Member States themselves to choose whether or not they wish to make use of lists of safe countries."
"There is nonetheless cause for concern about the development of the principle of safe countries at Community level."
"It is extremely important that we together affirm the principles under the Geneva Convention whereby everyone is entitled to have his case examined individually."
". (FR) Following the attacks on New York and Washington, there can be no consideration of any policy dealing with the movement of persons unless absolute priority is given to the implications for citizens' safety."
"The implementation of asylum policy is no exception to this imperative."
"Today even more than yesterday, the Watson report's proposals appear to be an example of what should not be done, because their ultimate effect would be to gravely and dangerously weaken the degree of security which the citizens of our countries must enjoy."
"To multiply, indefinitely and to the point of absurdity, the guarantees of all sorts which the Watson report and the amendments adopted by Parliament propose to bestow on asylum-seekers whose requests have been adjudged to be manifestly unfounded, even though we know that three quarters of asylum requests fall into this category, may appear to be generous, but it opens the door to the gravest errors."
"The concept of 'benefit of the doubt' is difficult to reconcile with the demands of security."
"At a time when the most rigorous measures are being put in place, our Parliament is indulging in an extremely lax approach which can only lead to an increase in illegal immigration and, along with this, further infiltration by terrorist networks."
"Why then do all the Watson report's proposals deal exclusively with asylum-seekers and none of them with the security of the citizens of European countries?"
"Such an imbalance, which, I might add, is found in the proposal for a directive as much as in the Watson report, is not acceptable."
"It is imperative that it be corrected so that both the legitimate rights of genuine asylum-seekers and the legitimate desire of our countries' citizens for security and protection may be taken into account."
"Report Marques (A5-0248/2001)"
"Mr President, a few days ago I was having dinner in a beautiful Italian city with a beautiful Bulgarian blonde and, to my astonishment, at a certain moment, she asked me, ""But why do you still give Cohesion Fund money to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland?"
"We candidate countries are very much afraid that the same will not be done with us even though we have a far, far lower gross domestic product than those countries."
"Mr Fatuzzo, could you not say that a Cohesion Fund should be set up straight away for the candidate countries, who are greatly concerned that they will be falling farther and farther behind you?"""
"Could I have refused to accept that beautiful Bulgarian blonde' s request, Mr President?"
"What would you have done?"
"I thought it only fair to be the spokesman for her request."
"- (DA) We have voted against the report because we do not believe that it is sufficiently stringent in its criticism of the Cohesion Fund."
"The introduction of the common currency in the beneficiary countries of Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain ought, as a minimum, to cause the Fund' s activities to be suspended until such time as the first Southern and Eastern European countries have been admitted to the EU."
"Resources must be channelled to where there is most need for them - namely to the candidate countries."
"What we miss, too, is a more thorough and critical analysis of the way in which the Cohesion Fund is fulfilling its objectives."
"There is a disproportionate focus upon maintaining the scales applicable between one country and another and between the two prioritised policy areas, and there is too little importance attached to whether the money is in fact being allocated properly."
"It is not enough merely to note positive socio-economic development in the beneficiary countries and in that way to conclude that the funds are being properly distributed."
". (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Marques on his excellent report."
"It is a fine piece of work which highlights several key points."
"I would like to stress the following aspects:"
"1."
"Cohesion is a treaty objective which it is vital to implement"
"Economic and social cohesion, which is laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community as one of the essential objectives of the Union, stipulates that the present disparities between the various regions should be reduced and possible imbalances should be prevented, with a view to promoting the harmonious development of the Community."
"In reality, there is still a great deal to be done to achieve this objective."
"2."
"The Cohesion Fund fills a vital gap"
"Cohesion also has a fundamental role to play in progress towards economic and monetary union, which implies convergence between the economies of the Member States."
"However, as the rapporteur rightly emphasises, the Maastricht Treaty did not provide for any support or cyclical adjustment measures within the framework of economic and monetary union, which means that the Structural Funds and in particular the Cohesion Fund are all the more important."
"3."
"The objective of cohesion will not end with enlargement"
"The rapporteur draws attention to the fact that the disparities between the present Member States could increase because of the impact and dynamics of enlargement."
"It is important to prevent this from happening and to respond to the temptations offered by those who, armed with statistics, are preparing to do away with the cohesion effort between the present 15 Member States."
"The objective of cohesion will not come to an end with enlargement; indeed it may and should be reinforced following enlargement."
"This will make enlargement an enormous challenge for the solidarity of the Union, requiring careful and efficient preparation taking into account the Union as a whole and its specific characteristics."
". (EL) The economic and social cohesion we hear so much about is no more than a deliberate attempt to mislead the people of Europe and impose policies on them which serve the interests of big business."
"The relentless law of asymmetrical development operating within the capitalist system is not a figment of our imagination, it is a reality and the figures in the Commission's own reports confirm that there can be no talk of convergence; on the contrary, what we have is divergence between the Member States of the Community, between the rich and poor regions, even between regions within a Member State."
"A typical example is Greece, where the GNP of regions such as Epirus, Mytilene or the Peloponnese has fallen rather than risen."
"The per capita income in Hamburg is 440% higher than in Epirus, which is the poorest region in the ÅU."
"In Greece and Portugal, 22% of the population are living below the poverty line."
"Decisions by the ÅU are exacerbating social and economic differences, thereby giving the monopolies more and more options."
"EMU and the Stability Pact deprive the Member States of the right to exercise monetary policy, impose budgetary discipline and reduce social expenditure and public-sector investments."
"And people's earnings and the country's economy are being hit particularly hard by privatisation and, in more general terms, the structural changes being pushed forward in the form of liberalisation of the markets and reactionary decisions on the labour market."
"The prevalence of atypical, short-term and temporary forms of employment, part-time employment and changes to the national insurance system, along with the concentration of capital, are exacerbating what is already an unacceptable situation."
"Structural interventions funded from the Community purse are not designed to bring about real development in each region."
"They disregard what is unique to and the comparative advantages of each region and are dictated by big business's demand for greater profitability and the need to serve the objectives of the Stability Pact."
"As a result of this policy, considerable sums of money are being spent on showcase projects, on scrapping traditional productive sectors and on creating infrastructure works which serve private capital, helping to liberalise the markets and boost the unaccountability of the monopolies."
"The workers are fighting these political choices and aims on the part of the ÅU and the adverse impact which they generate, an impact which is being paid for by the poorest sections of society, workers and pensioners, farmers with small or medium-sized holdings and small enterprises, especially in the processing and trade sectors."
". (FR) We support the principles that underpin the creation of the Cohesion Fund."
"Like the rapporteur, we do believe that the Maastricht Treaty ""did not provide for any economic support and adjustment mechanism in the context of economic and monetary union"" and that the Stability and Growth Pact has ""effectively restricted government investment."""
"We share the idea that such funds may be of use in environmentally friendly land-use planning."
"We also believe, however, that the thinking underlying these funds contradicts the neo-liberal thinking behind European integration."
"It is all very well to ""link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions"", but it would be even better not to fragment Europe still further by the systematic privatisation of public services."
"Seen in this light, the report does not go far enough in its critique and postulates that the financial criteria of the euro and of the Stability Pact can be reconciled with the demands of real regional development."
"That is why we have abstained - so as not to give succour to such an illusion."
"Report Nogueira Román /A5-0247/2001)"
"Mr President, this document too deals with the procedures for spending the funds that the European Union has available for improving the situation in which the less fortunate European citizens live."
"On this point, as the Pensioners' Party representative, Mr President, I should like to point out to Parliament as a whole, which is listening to me so carefully, as you see - I am referring of course to the television monitors that are on in our offices - that the Pensioner' s Party is requesting a rise, a marked increase in the funds that the European Union should have at its disposal to implement its activities and policy."
"What we receive is too little. In my view, it is alms for Europe."
"Europe should have much, much more for all the European citizens who need to see this Europe as important and close to them."
". (EL) The asymmetrical capitalist development which characterises the economies of the ÅU can be seen in the changes which have taken place over the last decade, during which asymmetries between the Member States, between the rich and less developed regions and even within Member States of the ÅU has worsened."
"Instead of convergence and cohesion, divergence is worsening, widening the gap between the rich and poor."
"Even the report admits that the ÅU ""still exhibits major regional asymmetries in economic and social development regional asymmetries have actually increased within some Member States""."
"The golden triangle formed by Yorkshire, Franche-Comté and Hamburg accounts for almost half (47%) the income but only one-seventh of the surface area and one-third of the population of the ÅU, while 18% of the population of the EU is living below the poverty line."
"As a result of 'labour mobility' strategies, which strengthen migration towards and the concentration of wealth in the rich central regions of the Union, flexible forms of employment and unbridled privatisation within this triangle, all policies, both national and Community, come second to the law of maximum profit."
"Instead of creating jobs, we have mass redundancies and spiralling unemployment."
"Even the report tells us that the ten poorest regions have an unemployment rate of 23%."
"In the countries which are the main beneficiaries of Structural Funds, that is, Italy, Spain and Greece, there was a clear increase in unemployment between 1988 and 1998, especially in Greece, where the official unemployment rate of 6.7% in 1988 compares with 11.7% in 1998, an increase of about 75%."
"These structural interventions are not designed to bring about real development in each region which takes account of its unique features; on the contrary, they come second to even bigger profits for big business."
"Not only are funds for structural interventions both insufficient and limited, 30-40% of total funding received by the poorest Member States finds its way back to the richest Member States in the form of payment for know-how or capital equipment."
"And this funding has been paid for by scrapping traditional productive sectors, changing crops, destroying agricultural produce and deserting areas."
"The ones who suffer as a result are the poorest sections of society, while the ones who benefit are the monopoly behemoths and the various rodents which surround them, in that Community funds are the ""pieces of silver"" paid for integration into the ÅU; in a way they are a form of compensation to big business for doing away with much of the protectionism which it enjoys under a national market system."
"- (FR) The report states that the Structural Funds, principally intended to promote regional development and the equality of men and women, still fall a long way short of what is needed."
"Its insistent demand for ""the implementation of an integrated policy to promote women's interests"" is laudable and highlights an important area in which we have fallen behind."
"We, too, consider that ""the risk exists that economic and budgetary stability programmes could result in cutbacks in public investment, notably in transport infrastructure and R & D in the less-favoured regions"" ."
"The report does not follow its analysis through to its conclusion, however, and does not adequately break free of such restraint."
"On employment, for example, it invites the States to ""continue with the employment policy process launched in Amsterdam"" and makes the ""national action plans for employment"" its reference point."
"The latter, however, merely translate into operational terms the dogma of the necessary flexibility of labour markets and are in practice contrary to the fight against precariousness to which the rapporteur refers elsewhere."
"Since we are unwilling to lend our names to such a position, we have abstained."
". (PT) The 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds (1999) concludes the 1994-1999 programming period and thus saw the conclusion of the Delors II package of measures which made a key contribution to regional development, both as regards infrastructure and production and in terms of social integration."
"Nevertheless, now that the 1994-1999 period has come to an end, the 11th Report bears witness to the fact that the cohesion situation remains unsatisfactory."
"Despite the budgetary effort made with the Edinburgh package and the progress achieved, the European Union continues to be marked by enormous regional disparities in economic and social development, and there continues to be an asymmetry within the European Union between the peripheral regions - including the ultra-peripheral regions - and the centre."
"Accordingly, the impact of the Structural Funds has not been sufficient to correct the disparities in production between the richest and least developed areas."
"Against this background, I would like to express my support for Mr Nogueira Román's report, stressing by way of conclusion that remoteness and insularity, factors which are the hallmark of the ultra-peripheral regions, can be compensated for by developing activities financed by the Structural Funds with a view to increasing the competitiveness of the production chain, improving access to information and integrating these regions in the context of an enlarged European Union."
"This should accordingly reinforce the current cohesion policy, which is more necessary than ever to meet the challenges of enlargement."
"Report Valenciano Martínez-Orozco (A5-0285/2001)"
"The report by Mrs Martínez-Orozco is, Mr President - and I am sure you will agree with me - extremely important."
"Measures must be taken so that women - not only women, but in this case women - have no fewer rights in society than men have."
"In some places they have many more rights - in my home, for instance, women have more rights than men - but in the rest of the world, unfortunately, as in this case, women really have to face torture."
"I therefore ask the European Union not to give a penny more in development aid to those countries that still practice female circumcision and to really implement a policy supporting respect for human rights in those states to which we do give our money."
"- (FR) Although we do not support all the proposed measures, we have voted for this report."
"Female genital mutilation is a barbarity to be eradicated not only because it is an act of violence with physical consequences, but also because of its purpose, which is to ensure that women' s position of inferiority is maintained."
"Those who, when dealing with this subject, invoke tradition, custom, religion or any other such nonsense do no more than shroud in hypocrisy their failure to confront barbarism."
"Those who dare to speak of the right to cultural differences demonstrate only their contempt both for women in general and for the peoples whose women are victims of this barbarity."
"I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Elena Valenciano Martinez-Orozco, and the committee as a whole for the high-quality work that they have presented to us and for the courageous social choices that they are leading us to make today."
"Female genital mutilation endangers health and leads to serious and irreversible consequences such as serious and potentially fatal complications in sexual relations, pregnancy and childbirth, and so it strikes me as essential that we vote for this report today and thereby condemn all female genital mutilation, to whatever degree it is carried out."
"This report is all the more deserving of a favourable vote because it calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to define all female genital mutilation as a crime and to impose criminal sanctions on any of their residents who have engaged in this practice, even if the offence was committed outside the EU's borders."
"This principle of the offence's extraterritoriality must be firmly upheld."
"If any further proof of the need to vote for such a report were required, I shall give the following reason: the fact of being a victim of such practices, as well as that of being born a woman in a place where one runs the risk of undergoing genital mutilation must constitute valid and conclusive grounds for the right of asylum or of humanitarian protection to be granted."
"The Commission, the Council and the Member States must, within the framework of the immigration and asylum policy agreed in Title IV of the Amsterdam Treaty, adopt measures on granting residence permits to the victims of this practice and recognise the right to asylum of women and girls who risk being genitally mutilated."
"For the sake of equality, liberty and dignity, to which every human being has a right, it appears to me - and should appear to us all - imperative that we protect women and vote unhesitatingly for this proposal."
"This is a political responsibility that we must shoulder."
". British Conservatives, of course, deplore the practice of female genital mutilation, wherever it occurs, and we are pleased to note that in some countries it is already against the law, but we do not feel that this report will assist in ending the procedure altogether."
"For this reason, Conservatives have abstained, as we feel, from an international perspective, that more diplomatic pressure should be brought to bear against those countries in which the practice of female genital mutilation is still allowed, and that world-wide education and diplomatic initiatives would be the best means to employ in order to put an end to the procedure."
"Certainly, in any event, we do not wish to see an extension of the Geneva Convention of 1951 in terms of the criteria it sets out on asylum, however worthy the cause may be."
"- (SV) I have voted in favour of this very important report in defence of human dignity as something unique, inviolable and shared by all in equal measure."
"It is a question of giving expression to the common basis of values that European cooperation must ultimately rest upon."
"Female genital mutilation causes irreparable damage to health and can even lead to death."
"Any form of female genital mutilation, of whatever degree, is nothing other than an act of violence which constitutes a violation of the woman' s or girl' s fundamental rights, particularly the right to personal integrity and physical and mental health and of her sexual and reproductive rights."
"Such violation and mutilation of a human being can under no circumstances be justified by respect for a religion such as Islam or by invoking traditional cultural practices or initiation ceremonies."
"Religious freedom and female genital mutilation have no connection with one another."
"Female genital mutilation is an assault on the rights of women and children as enshrined in several international conventions and is prohibited in the criminal legislation of the Member States."
"Moreover, it is in breach of the principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is therefore time for any form of female genital mutilation now to be classified in the EU' s Member States as a specificcrime, irrespective of whether or not the woman concerned has given any form of consent, and for anybody who helps, encourages, advises or procures support for anybody to carry out genital mutilation to be punished."
"Report Smet (A5-0275/2001)"
"Mr President, I cannot help saying something about the report by Mrs Smet, who has specified that when women work they get lower wages than men in average earnings."
"Why can I not help saying something?"
"Because I want to uphold in this Chamber the view that it is fair, precisely for this reason, that women in many European Union states draw their pensions five years before men do."
"This happens in Italy, Greece, Germany, Spain and many other states, but not in all of them."
"I think this is fair because it partly makes up for the lower wages women receive when they work."
"I should therefore like this to happen in all fifteen states in the European Union."
"- (DA) After 25 years of the Equal Pay Directive, there are still differences between women' s and men' s pay."
"It is estimated that 15 per cent of this difference in pay is due to gender and not to other factors such as seniority, management responsibility and such like. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value has therefore still not made itself felt."
"An extra effort must therefore be made to ensure that it is the job and the responsibilities, and not the individual' s gender, which decide how much he or she is paid."
"We support the report, which we believe contains a number of sensible recommendations."
"We wish to emphasise that, if unfair differences in pay are to be successfully stamped out, greater openness and transparency must be ensured in the way in which pay is determined."
"We also want to emphasise that individual countries must make sure they have reasonable conditions for women' s participation in the labour market (child care facilities etc), if the goal of equal pay for work of equal value is to be achieved."
". (PT) As you will know, although the principle of equal pay for work of equal value for women and men is laid down in the 1951 Convention No 100 of the ILO and the 1957 Treaty of Rome, as subsequently developed and improved by Community legislation, discrimination continues to take place, as the Smet report indicates, with an average wage gap in the EU of 28%."
"Even taking into account the structural differences between men and women in the labour market, such as age, training, occupation and career pattern, women's pay is still 15% lower, on average, than that of men, which can only be explained by value discrimination mechanisms. This is unacceptable."
"The issue of the wage discrimination which is practised against women in reality, and the underlying mechanisms, have been analysed in relative depth, although there are many shortcomings, in particular in statistical information for the European Union and the Member States."
"However, as the rapporteur states, one thing is clear: this wage gap can only be reduced by means of a twin-track policy."
"We therefore consider it important that this issue should be treated as a top priority, including the Commission's proposal to launch a Europe-wide campaign on equal pay in 2002."
"But it is equally important that a proposal should be brought forward to revise and update the 1975 Equal Pay Directive."
". (DE) We have been discussing equal pay for equal work and for work of equal value since my youth, and that is a long time ago."
"The ILO's Equal Remuneration Convention has existed since 1951."
"In the European Community the principle of 'equal pay for equal work' was laid down in Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome in 1958."
"Yet as is always the case whenever it is a matter of justice for women in any walk of life, in implementing the principle of equal pay, the politicians are dragging their feet, as are the trade unions, unfortunately, which are still male-dominated organisations."
"We have had the Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women since 1975."
"We have action programmes and a Community framework strategy on gender equality."
"We have countless resolutions and guidelines."
"We have the Beijing Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in 1995."
"And now we have this report which - in view of the fact that the average wage gap between men and women in the EU still stands at almost 30% - is by no means unnecessary, for on women's issues in particular, we know that constant dripping wears away stone."
"In the 17 recitals and 19 paragraphs contained in this resolution, which I support, we have put forward a great many sound and useful proposals designed to eliminate this wage gap, which continues even after retirement and especially affects women with lower pension provision, thus resulting in lifelong discrimination."
"It is clear that action is required from the social partners in particular. However, what is also required is courage from the women concerned and their representatives, especially the women's organisations."
"In reality, we have sound legal bases on which to act against wage discrimination."
". (EL) The harsh reality of the huge social problems which plague workers, both male and female, not only shows up every pronouncement about equality and prosperity for what it is in practice, and in the harshest possible manner, it also makes them look provocative and derisory."
"The first and the main victims of this miserable market- and competitiveness-based policy are women."
"Unemployment hits women."
"Women are bountifully offered flexible forms of employment, with the result that they provide cheap labour, receive less money for the same job and face worse problems of job insecurity and unequal access to the labour market. It is still mainly women who fill the more menial, unskilled jobs and who rarely hold responsible, higher management jobs in economic, social and political life."
"The severe blows raining down on social rights and social gains will become even more severe with the planned changes to the social security system, putting an even greater burden on women, who have to carry out many duties and fill two or even three roles."
"There can be so such thing as equal opportunities for women within an exploitative society, an underemployed society with no equivalent social prospects and no state welfare."
"We need to provide equal access for women, we need to strengthen and extend legislation to protect unhealthy professions and maternity and we need to introduce measures to safeguard all atypical forms of work."
"Only the workers' struggle can overturn the anti-grass roots polices being promoted and improve women's lot."
"Only the worker's struggle will really improve the position of women in society."
"And we are by their side in this struggle."
"Report Andersson (A5-0283/2001)"
"Mr President, some time ago I met my brother."
"I have a brother called Edgardo Fatuzzo, who lives in Novara, but unfortunately we do not see each other very often."
"When we last saw each other and he heard I was an MEP for the Pensioners' Party, elected to Brussels by pensioners, and that I am the national secretary of this party in Italy, he said to me, ""As you are in politics, do you know that when we work and are over fifty they make it quite clear to us that they cannot wait for us to give up our jobs, and they make us feel we are a burden?"
"This is because there are too many young people and they get lower wages; we, however, are slow to understand progress and earn more."""
"Well, I should like it to be considered harassment when older people are harassed for the sole reason that they have grown old in their jobs, a point which unfortunately is not mentioned in this document."
"The report treats as being on the same level what it terms "" 'vertical' harassment (of a subordinate by a superior, or vice versa), peer-group ( 'horizontal') harassment or harassment of a mixed type""."
"Whilst condemning harassment, the report overlooks the fact that relationships at these different levels are not equivalent."
"The boss has a power over his employees that they do not have over him."
"Those who are at the summit of the hierarchy established by the boss have the right to decide on the allocation of work to their subordinates or even on whether these are employed at all."
"The new expression 'harassment at work' is founded on the old exploitative relationships."
"Our abstention indicates that, whilst we agree with this condemnation, very limited though it is, we do not wish to give the support of our names to these untruths by omission."
". (PT) We voted in favour of this report because we consider that it deals properly with the serious problem of bullying and sexual harassment at the workplace."
"As indicated in the report, according to a survey of 21 500 workers in the European Union carried out by the Dublin Foundation, 8% state that over the last 12 months they have been subject to bullying at work, which if extrapolated to the total workforce means that over 12 million workers are probably victims of this kind of situation throughout the 15 Member States."
"As the report warns us, although the true scale of this phenomenon is unknown, it is a serious problem in working life, and it is equally certain that the general increase in short-term contracts and insecurity of employment, especially among women, is creating conditions that encourage the practice of various forms of harassment."
"We therefore support the measures proposed in the report for combating this phenomenon, including those for preventing it, those for increasing knowledge about it, exchanges of positive experience and the publication of a Green Paper by no later than March 2002, followed by an action programme of measures at Community level against bullying at work."
". (FR) Eight per cent of workers in the EU, that is to say 12 million people, claim to have been victims of psychological and sexual harassment at work."
"This has devastating effects on the physical and mental health of those - most frequently women - who are subjected to it."
"As the rapporteur has emphasised, these practices are due to ""the growing number of short-term contracts and insecurity of employment."""
"Combating harassment at work, therefore, involves restoring to each worker security of status, acceptable working conditions and a decent wage."
"All employees, however, need more rights within companies: the right to organised representation, the right to defend themselves and the right to social security benefits such as occupational health provision."
"There is also a need for uniform legislation specific to this issue to be put in place and applied consistently across all the EU Member States."
"At present, only France has legislated against harassment."
"It is, moreover, equally important to clarify the employer's responsibility in this area."
"This report is a step in the right direction and for that reason we have voted for it."
"- (SV) We have abstained from voting on Mr Andersson' s report on harassment at the workplace."
"We are basically well disposed towards the European Union."
"European integration provides an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems, such as those concerning the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management."
"We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those whom they affect."
"That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone."
"It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU must only attend to those issues which it is best qualified to deal with, namely the cross-border issues."
"Harassment at the workplace is, of course, a problem, and as much as possible must be done in various ways to do away with such harassment."
"We do not, however, believe that measures to combat this problem are best taken at EU level."
"For us, it is important for the EU to concentrate instead on areas in which it can really do some good."
"This is not such an area."
"Report Coelho (A5-0233/2001)"
"Mr President, in this document by Mr Coelho rules are laid down regarding the crossing of the external borders of the European Union."
"We should remember, then, that in a very few years the borders will be extended: the borders of Europe will be moved much further east."
"We therefore need right now, not in 2004, to bring in tighter regulations on access, on crossing the forthcoming borders, which are not the current ones, and to increase the possibilities of really, actually moving around within our fifteen Member States."
"In conclusion: tougher restrictions on the external borders and greater access across the former borders, which are the internal borders of the fifteen and soon the twenty-three European Union Member States."
". (EL) The report contains a plethora of data which reveal how the Schengen Convention has worked in practice in the 10 states which apply it in full and it goes a long way towards substantiating our opinion of it as an authoritarian, anti-democratic, collective agreement."
"To be specific, it admits of omissions and oversights with respect to transparency and democratic control, violations even of the famous EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a lack of transparency on the role of Europol, the absence of information for the European Parliament etc. It is particularly revealing with regard to the Schengen Information System (that is, personal electronic records), in which 89% of personal information pertains to 'unwanted' persons."
"Documents which should be destroyed are used to supplement police records, data is kept on ""persons whose identity has been usurped with no attempt to inform the legitimate older of the identity"" and ""there is a lack of clear criteria for entering data on the system, in particular in relation to unwanted aliens""."
"As far as the free movement of people is concerned, the report criticises England and Ireland for maintaining controls on internal borders and France for checking persons arriving from the Netherlands, due to the legislation of the surrounding countries (and especially Holland) on narcotics, but says not a word about the imposition of controls and the ban on allowing EU citizens to enter France or Sweden in order to take part in demonstrations in Nice and Gothenburg."
"However, Genoa provides the most representative picture of what Schengen means: on the one hand, the restriction on free movement with suffocatingly tight police controls and entry bans and, on the other, full - if not abusive - application of personal electronic records and police collaboration (Euro-police)."
"All this confirms that the Schengen Convention is a tool which is used to make it easier to carry out the job of pan-European suppression, make and monitor suspects and terrorise demonstrators."
"The situation is becoming even worse following the witch hunt unleashed by the USA with the help and forbearance of the ÅU on the pretext of the tragic events of 11 September."
"The aim is to silence every voice which speaks out against or even doubts their anti-grass roots policy, supposedly in the name of fighting 'terrorism' ."
"Some of the proposals in the report are of a technocratic nature (more information for the European Parliament, Council approval for a binding legal framework to protect personal data, approval for the role of the Joint Supervisory Authority)."
"However, they are accompanied by a proposal to introduce a Community information system, that is, a single computer network for data from the Schengen, Europol and Customs Use conventions in order to make personal electronic records even more efficient, again in the name of freedom, security and justice!"
"For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against the report."
"A matter of days after the terrible terrorist acts which struck New York and Washington, the Chairperson of Eurojust, Mrs Michèle Coninsx, who is also a senior Belgian judge, has just made some extraordinary statements in the 14 September issue of one of the major Paris daily papers. To the question 'Is this amorphous collection of Islamicists firmly established in Europe?'"
"Mrs Coninsx replied: ""Europe can be a logistical fallback base for these terrorists."
"This timely assessment of the situation may be added to, unfortunately, numerous others made over recent years in various fields, whether drug trafficking, the theft of works of art, illegal immigration, organised crime..."
"One is all the more surprised when one reads the triumphalist report on the Schengen system, which has been laid before us today."
"For example, in the Council's introduction, we read: ""thousands of travellers have crossed open borders unhindered, without security within the Schengen area suffering any visible detriment."""
"One wonders whether the person who drew up the Council's report was perhaps suffering from hallucinations."
"For its part, the report of the European Parliament not only repeats the same errors, but adds to them an order directed at the United Kingdom and at Ireland, which are invited to participate fully in Schengen and thus to completely abolish border controls on persons."
"This would, of course, be more practical for France, which would witness the dispersal of the tragic groups of illegal immigrants waiting in the north of the country to cross to Great Britain."
"It would not, however, resolve the fundamental question: how did these illegals manage to cross Europe and reach Calais without being seen?"
"Does the Schengen system not bear an overwhelming responsibility for this?"
"The day after the terrorist attacks on the United States, we called for the EU to revise all its policies in order to prioritise citizens' security."
"We certainly heard some fine speeches against terrorism in this House yesterday, but today, we can clearly see the habitual drift starting again without any qualms at all."
"The Schengen system, in the guise of a gradual abolition of controls at the internal borders of the EU countries concerned, reinforces controls at the borders of the Union itself and makes conditions of access stricter."
"Whilst claiming to facilitate the movement of persons, Schengen makes it more difficult for all those who are not natives of the European Union."
"Our vote against this report is an expression of our opposition to both the spirit and the letter of the Schengen Convention."
"The enlargement of the European Union by the integration of certain Eastern European countries makes the Schengen Convention all the more shocking, as the Schengen borders put up additional barriers among national communities living in more than one country simultaneously."
"Finally, even the slight advantages of the Convention, that is to say, the end of controls at the internal borders of the Schengen area, are random, being subject to the discretion of States which are able to re-establish such controls."
"The Coelho report on the development of Schengen cooperation is unsatisfactory from our point of view for numerous reasons."
"For us to propose today the reinforcement of the Schengen system, is to reinforce the exclusion of all those men and women, asylum-seekers and immigrants, who for economic and/or political reasons aspire to live as residents of the European Union."
"This Fortress Europe is shown day by day to be unjust and inhumane by the treatment meted out to immigrants in refugee centres, detention centres and other closed institutions."
"This Europe that Schengen has created is not democratic - as the rapporteur makes clear by putting the emphasis on the ""major and serious shortcomings [which] have existed with regard to transparency and democratic control""."
"There is a need for another policy on the reception of immigrants particularly to regularise the position of those without personal documentation and to respect fundamental rights."
"After all, what credibility is left to this area without borders which permits free movement of citizens, when States arrogate to themselves the right to close their borders to peaceful protesters, as at the Nice and Genoa Summits?"
"Freedom of movement within Europe must be recognised as an inalienable right."
"For these reasons, we are unable to vote for this Report."
". (FR) Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union defined as its objective ""to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured""..."
"To put it another way, the Schengen accords are often summed up too readily as being about the free movement of European citizens, but this can only, according to these same accords, be taken as read when they are guaranteed freedom, security and justice."
"The present, however, when crazed attacks have just struck the United States, brings us back to face some cruel realities: the notion of a Western sanctuary, sheltered from violence and in which nothing more would be needed than to grant rights without demanding duties, whilst maintaining a principled abstention from any coercive action, now lies smashed to smithereens."
"Whilst I would not wish to suggest that our manifest solidarity with the victims and with the American people must necessarily impel us henceforth to join blindly in any crusade decided on in Washington, it is clear that a menace of the same kind is hovering over our European capitals."
"I might well say, Mr Coelho, that your report strikes us as surreal against this backdrop, because, from our point of view, the re-establishment of border controls has never seemed so necessary as it does today."
"(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure.)"
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Thursday 20 September 2001."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, and as you can imagine, it is my sad duty to have to open this session of Parliament with the news of several disasters that have claimed the lives of many people."
"When I have finished reading the statement, I would like to suggest that we observe a minute' s silence to pay tribute to the victims."
"On 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a disaster on an unprecedented scale, in which 29 people died and 2500 were injured."
"We have all been concerned and deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims' families, of the injured and by the grief of the people of Toulouse."
"Following the explosion at the AZF factory, I sent a message on behalf of Parliament, and on my own behalf, to the Mayor of Toulouse, Mr Douste-Blazy and to his fellow citizens, to express our solidarity and deepest sympathy."
"The exact causes of this awful disaster are still unknown, but one thing is certain: France, and all the countries of the European Union, must make a firm commitment to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again."
"It will be held up as an example of what we must no longer tolerate, wherever similar risks exist."
"People' s safety must never be compromised due to negligence, passivity or an overriding concern to save money."
"In a repeat of previous incidents, this time in Northern Ireland, a journalist, Martin O' Hagan, was murdered on European Union soil by terrorists with a single objective - to spread fear by firstly attacking those who work to inform others."
"This appalling act is an attack by its perpetrators on the fundamental values of the European Union, namely the right to life, the rule of law and the freedom of expression."
"Under no circumstances must these acts of terrorism call into question the efforts of all those who, in spite of the difficulties they encounter, are working tirelessly to finally achieve the goals of the peace process."
"On 27 September, a mentally disturbed man carried out a horrific attack on the Parliament of the Swiss canton of Zug, tragically killing 14 members of the local Parliament and government and also injuring approximately 10 people."
"As soon as I heard of these senseless murders, I sent, on behalf of everyone, our most sincere condolences to the authorities and a message of solidarity to the relatives of those killed and wounded."
"Earlier this afternoon, we heard the news that a suicide attack was carried out against the Parliament of Kashmir in India, a despicable act in which 22 people have been killed so far and approximately 30 have been injured."
"The explosion also caused very considerable damage to the area around the Parliament building."
"We are all distressed and saddened by this attack."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose that we pay tribute to the victims of all these attacks by now observing a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Speeches relating to points of order:"
"Onesta (Verts/ALE)."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your words of sympathy and solidarity."
"On the morning of Friday 21 September, I was at home, less than two kilometres from the site of the explosion, and I can tell you that I now know what a tragedy really is."
"We have, all of us here, seen the images of this explosion on the television. I believe, and I can even be sure, that all my fellow Members from my region, such as Mrs Ainardi, Mrs de Veyrac, Mr Rod, join me in thanking all the Members who have expressed their sympathy and solidarity."
"I would also like to show you a damaged and charred metal girder, which I found at the factory site, over a kilometre from where the explosion occurred."
"Now you can imagine the state of the bodies that were found to the south of Toulouse."
"Ladies and gentlemen, having observed a minute' s silence at the beginning of today' s debate, we must now try to restore the confidence of people everywhere who fear these bombs, and, as you have said, Madam President, we must ensure, with the votes we cast this week and by taking bold resolutions, that the disaster that occurred in Toulouse really is the last in a series of already too many incidents of this kind."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with your agreement, I would like to propose to give the floor to the Members who have requested to speak. This is an exceptional case - and I do mean exceptional - and is on account of the scale of the recent disasters."
"Madam President, what you have just said demonstrates that we must now be especially careful about the public statements we make and it is significant that you have spoken about four disasters: two of which have taken place in or around parliaments - in Switzerland and in Kashmir."
"I want to say this because I wish to express my solidarity and that of my group with the statements by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, and in this case I regret that we have not heard him speak - since he always does so authoritatively, bravely and appropriately - in relation to the unfortunate public remarks of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, Mr Berlusconi, on the supposed superiority of Western civilisation over other civilisations."
"I believe it is especially important now for the European Parliament to state strongly once again, that this is not a clash of civilisations, but, rather, that we have to defend values that are shared by all humanity."
"I therefore believe it is important that we, in the European Parliament, clearly express and demonstrate an approach, which is not just the approach of my group, and in this case I would like to address Mr Poettering to say that I was the first to applaud when, at the special sitting we held on the attacks of 11 September, he expressly cited the speech of Anwar al-Sadat in this Parliament."
"I believe that remarks such as those by Mr Berlusconi must be criticised by all of us and I hope, because it is not the first time, that they will not be repeated, since they damage the European cause throughout the world."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Madam President, to continue on the same theme, in the wake of the events of 11 September, Parliament gained a very broad consensus on the need to quash any equation of Islam with terrorism, substantiating the unacceptable and dangerous theory that this is a clash of civilisations."
"On the other hand, we recall Mr Solana' s words, spoken in the same spirit, who had advised - and I quote - that we must not create a rift, as this would be a huge mistake. Mr Berlusconi' s astounding and deeply shameful words show how important it is to issue a very clear response."
"First of all, we must strongly condemn the age-old rumour of the purported superiority of Western civilisation and Christianity. Then, we must decide upon an initiative, along the lines of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, enabling the Council to determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the fundamental principles of the European Union and to address recommendations to that State."
"I therefore suggest, Madam President, that the Conference of Presidents examines what significant political action we would be advised to take in this matter."
"(Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)"
"Madam President, I would like to say again on behalf of our group what I said on 12 September - I believe with the agreement of all in this European Parliament - namely that the terror perpetrated by human beings must not be confused with the peace-loving Muslim faith."
"I refer back to Anwar el Sadat's tremendous speech to the European Parliament on 10 February 1981 - we were meeting in Luxembourg in those days - in which he said: ""Islam is a religion of love and not of hatred""."
"On behalf of our group, I wish again to observe that we oppose the rhetoric which speaks of a clash of civilisations and that we desire partnership and friendship with all peace-loving Arab and Islamic countries."
"It is precisely for that reason, indeed, that I proposed that we should convene the Mediterranean Forum."
"I am given to understand, Madam President, that you too have it in mind to submit a proposal to this end."
"Having been addressed personally, I wish to point out certain misunderstandings which originate with a Member of the Commission."
"We agreed in the Conference of Presidents - Mr Barón Crespo was unable to be there last Thursday - that we do not want to make this the subject of the debate here in the plenary sitting but wish, rather, in the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, to consult with the Member of the Commission about the remarks that have been made."
"On behalf of our group, let me say here and now that we reach out our hands to all peace-loving Muslims, wherever they live throughout the world, be it outside the European Union, in the Arab and Islamic states or in a country of the European Union; we want peace, partnership and friendship with all Muslims of good will!"
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate you on the speech you made the night the heads of government met in Brussels."
"Parliament was represented, I was present, and I think you struck exactly the right note for Parliament."
"Madam President, I think we have a huge responsibility after what has happened and our response needs to reflect the seriousness of these events."
"And that, I think, applies not just to us but to the Heads of State who have applied to become members of the European Union."
"That is why I should like, albeit reluctantly, to refer to the statements made by Mr Ecevit, who is trying to cash in on the terrorist incidents by levying accusations of terrorism against the Republic of Cyprus at a time when he, himself, is illegally occupying Northern Cyprus, as you quite rightly said during your visit to Athens."
"Madam President, I want to say some words about Martin O'Hagan, the journalist murdered in Northern Ireland a couple of days ago."
"He was a fearless journalist who over many years tirelessly illuminated that twilight world where gangsters and political terrorism and political extremism intersect."
"He has paid the ultimate price for his bravery."
"It is an unfortunate fact of our life in this world today that many hundreds of journalists die virtually every year in pursuit of their vocation of serving and informing the public."
"This does not happen so often in democratic societies and it is particularly worrying, therefore, that journalists in Northern Ireland are at risk in this way."
"The few words I have said about Martin O'Hagan are entirely inadequate to convey the shock and the horror that people of all political and religious persuasions in Ireland feel at this horrible deed."
"I should like to link this with other matters we have debated at previous part-sessions - indeed I am sure we will be debating them again this week - and make an appeal about the language we use to describe these terrorists."
"We should stop referring to them as Protestants, Catholics or Muslims: they are political extremists."
"It is important that we make that distinction."
"The individuals concerned adhere to one or other religion, or have no religion, but their objectives are political, and the one common thing that unites them is their contempt for democracy and humanity."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, as a parliamentarian I feel myself to be represented by the President of this House above all others, and so it is to you that I wish to address a very specific query relating to what was said by Mr Barón Crespo."
"The Italian Prime Minister's statement has been criticised by many, including - which may be surprising - by Mr Haider, who found it too xenophobic."
"Madam President, you have always strongly advocated dialogue with Islam, and have also taken definite steps in the direction of such dialogue."
"Your policy stands in contradiction to what Mr Berlusconi has said."
"In view of the fact that you have had very forthright things to say in other situations - which I did not always find easy to defend back home, but I defended you because I have always valued your clear language - I think it important that you should find equally clear and unambiguous words in this connection."
"It is this that I ask of you."
"Perhaps these words have passed me by; perhaps I have not heard them or not read them."
"I would ask you to make this Parliament's position in respect of these remarks quite clear."
"This is a Parliament that has always promoted dialogue and has always engaged in it."
"Our whole existence as a Parliament is bound up with the dialogue between religions and between cultures, and I believe that you, as President of this Parliament, should say so clearly and unambiguously on this occasion."
"(Applause from the PSE Group)"
"Mr Swoboda, I must say that I am surprised to hear your comments, because I do feel that I have made my views well known since 11 September, whether in press releases, or with regard to Mrs Banotti' s speech or what Mr Berlusconi said."
"Had you closely followed your President' s movements and official visits, you would be aware of my views."
"I shall send you some press cuttings, which are extremely enlightening and will, I believe, bring you up-to-date."
"I even believe that I may have been one of the first people - since you are giving me the opportunity to bring this up - to draw attention to the risk of an equation of Islam with terrorism."
"This was a natural thing to do as President and I knew that I was repeating the views of the House by stating this, and I certainly made this very clear in my first statement."
"Perhaps you also recall that I said this at the opening of the exceptional sitting that was held on the Wednesday, the day after the events."
"I will, however, send you all the details."
"Madam President, it is a matter of great surprise and regret to me that the Chairman of a major political group such as the Group of the Party of European Socialists should get caught up in the false, subversive controversy which originated in the Italian political debate and which it is absurd to think could be continued in this House. The issue has already been thoroughly addressed in Italy and it is certainly not evidence of a problem at European level but merely of a misunderstanding or, worse, the subversive interpretation of a phrase which could have been interpreted differently."
"Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has provided ample explanation of what he meant by the statement, which he intended to be extremely positive."
"The difference between the two civilisations is clear, and his intention was merely to highlight and emphasise that there is a great difference as regards genuine freedom, which exists in the West but not in the East, as regards equal opportunities for men and women, which are established in the West but denied in the East, and as regards all those differences in civilisation which - it cannot be denied - are there."
"That was what Mr Berlusconi meant by his statement, but, of course, everyone has read and interpreted it in their own way."
"Madam President, I would go so far as to say that it would be dangerous for this House to focus on a statement such as this now: at such a sensitive time as this, we need clarity, transparency and positive thinking - not a vitriolic debate - and, most importantly, we have to have the ability, which I do not see in the opposition, to extend a hand and interpret what people say in the positive sense intended rather than always placing a negative interpretation on things."
"It is therefore our intention to oppose any initiative seeking to open an interim procedure in this House, as has been suggested."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I said, due to exceptional circumstances, I agreed to move the points of order because I thought that you would like the opportunity to speak about the awful disasters, which were, sadly, the subject of my statement."
"Now that we no longer are speaking on points of order relating to the statement, we shall continue as usual, in other words, the remaining points of order shall be heard immediately after the agenda has been established."
"A number of Members have just asked me about this and I believe that this is a perfectly legitimate request."
"Agenda"
"Madam President, I believe that this Parliament is making a certain degree of progress in dealing with issues which concern our citizens and in which the European Union must have a political profile."
"I believe that in the case of the Toulouse disaster the change to the agenda is perfectly justified."
"I believe that the case of Afghanistan is highly topical for two reasons: the first is the humanitarian tragedy of the people of Afghanistan, who are the principal victims of the Taliban regime."
"Every day there is more and more news about the desperate condition of millions of people. Almost a fifth of the population (more than five million people) have practically nothing to eat."
"The European Union is contributing to the humanitarian effort, but I believe this is an issue on which we have to state our position."
"Secondly, the political issue."
"You yourself set an example, to a certain extent bypassing certain rules of protocol, international law and diplomacy, by bringing Commander Massoud here."
"I believe that we are also currently committed to a political solution which will bring stability to Afghanistan, and it is notable that, when a person who could establish a degree of mediation in Afghanistan, the exiled ex-king in Rome, proposed the calling of a Grand Assembly, the Loya Jirga, which could bring the various tribes together, he did so together with American congressmen, but we were not involved, although the Community troika has visited more or less the whole region."
"I believe that it makes sense for Parliament, with the current participation of the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, and the Commissioner responsible, Vice-President Patten, to be able to hold a debate on such an important issue, which is not just one more urgent subject, but which is an absolutely fundamental issue in relation not only to the fight against terrorism, but also to the stabilisation of Central Asia and the fight to prevent a humanitarian tragedy."
"These are the reasons why my group has proposed this change to the agenda."
"Madam President, I have all due respect for Mr Barón Crespo' s proposal and solicitude."
"However, this week, we have a well-prepared debate on terrorism, the root of which can be found in Afghanistan, among other countries, under the guise of Osama bin Laden."
"I would be surprised if Parliament were now to hold a less well-prepared debate on the issue of Afghanistan, also at the risk of mixing up the two debates."
"I feel strongly about holding a clear debate on terrorism."
"As a final point, for the resolution, we for our part have also drafted texts which give due consideration to the humanitarian problems that have now arisen at the Afghan-Pakistani border, and we also comment on the budgetary implications of our aid."
"I hope that this text will receive broad support."
"In my opinion, it is much preferable to deal with the Afghanistan issue at a later date, should this appear necessary, when we can prepare for it properly, for we are now dealing with an extremely important and complex problem."
"I would therefore ask if we could this week confine ourselves to the debate on terrorism, and only briefly touch upon the humanitarian dimension to which Mr Barón Crespo referred. We could then deal with the policy with regard to Afghanistan on a separate occasion, but not this week."
"I shall now put to the vote the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Madam President, I would very much like to add to what has been said."
"You win some, you lose some - that is normal."
"But we need proper preparation in matters as serious as this."
"Mr Barón Crespo, the right time for calm discussion of this would have been at the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, when you were absent - which is not an accusation, these things happen to us all. It would be a good thing if this House were to have a joint ballot on such important issues."
"I ask you to arrange things in the future so that we discuss such matters in the Conference of Presidents in the first instance."
"(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)"
"Madam President, this is the second time that Mr Poettering, who has been absent from the Conference of Presidents more often than I have, has reproached me for not being there on Thursday."
"I was in Budapest, I know, but it has to be said that Mr Poettering was the only Group Chairman present."
"The others were replaced."
"And the Socialist Group was duly and worthily represented."
"There is therefore no place for this sort of argument."
"Secondly, if this procedure exists at the moment it is because Parliament has sovereignty when it comes to deciding its agenda and in my speech I referred to information and events that have arisen since Thursday. Since I do not have the gift of prophecy that Mr Poettering appears to have, I cannot know on a Thursday what is going to happen on the following Sunday and therefore I think it makes sense that Parliament should reflect and vote when the time comes."
"Madam President, in reference to Wednesday's agenda following the point made by Mr Barón Crespo, last Tuesday I and two other Members of this House had the honour of meeting with the former king of Afghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah."
"At that meeting we discussed the possibility of his playing a role in some form of mediation in Afghanistan leading to the restoration of the democracy which he established in 1964, and which involved free media, free elections and the involvement of women in politics - a very far cry from the current state of affairs in Afghanistan."
"He also asked us to extend his respects to you, Madam President, and to the House as a whole, and hoped that in due course he would be able to visit the European Parliament."
"Yesterday I spoke to Mr Patten on this matter and hope there will be some development in this regard involving not only Parliament but the European Union as a whole."
"On the agenda for Wednesday, it seems to me rather sad that, in spite of the special nature of this international situation, reflected by our solemn sitting the day after the events in America on 11 September and the succeeding week, the Council has made a number of proposals for legislation following the terrorist acts which many of us consider as tantamount to an act of war."
"In this regard, the European Parliament will no doubt be involved in the normal procedures."
"It would be helpful to have a longer debate on Wednesday and not take the Ghent Council with the question of terrorism."
"Secondly, could you give us some indication of when the House will know the procedures to be followed with its committees for the examination, with proper scrutiny, of the proposals now being made by the Council?"
"Mr McMillan-Scott, we shall try to organise this as best we can."
"As regards the former king of Afghanistan, I must also share some information with you. I actually met him on Tuesday 11 September when I was in Italy attending a meeting of 500 young people in Rome."
"I made an appointment and, on behalf of the European Parliament, I went to meet the former king of Afghanistan."
"I believe that everyone will see this as a step in the right direction."
"We shall therefore try to organise everything properly and as you would wish."
"Relating to Thursday:"
"I have three requests to add headings to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance and the item entitled 'Human Rights' ."
"Madam President, last week, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party were agreed that there is only one urgent subject that ought to be dealt with in Parliament in this plenary sitting, and that is international terrorism and the need to build an international coalition to combat this."
"Unfortunately, we were unable to get anywhere with that point of view last week in the Conference of Presidents, and that is something we regret."
"We shall naturally participate in this vote."
"I requested the floor in order simply to emphasise that those of us in the ELDR Group think we should have focused our energies on the one urgent subject which we are all thinking about and which will cast its shadow for many years to come."
"(Applause from the ELDR Group)"
"Madam President, I do not wish to waste Parliament' s precious time on an issue which has already been addressed by Mr Santini and which has already been quite satisfactorily resolved in Italy."
"I would just like to point out that, as always, where Mr Berlusconi is concerned, every event is prey to political exploitation."
"This behaviour towards a Head of State is improper and inappropriate."
"Madam President, I am one of those Members of this House whose cultural background is not exactly Christian."
"There was a statement recently by a statesman, who should speak in a statesmanlike manner, but who, when speaking about Muslims and Christians, actually, in my opinion, dropped something of a clanger."
"I deeply regret that we were unable to deliver a joint response, but had to have a discussion instead."
"I greatly regret this, because we should be counteracting escalation."
"A dialogue is urgently needed specifically between Muslims and Christians."
"The Italian Prime Minister's spoken contribution added nothing, but was highly counter-productive."
"For this reason, I greatly regret that we were unable to counter it with a common response."
"Madam President, I would like to go back to Mr Berlusconi' s statements, not least because it is an issue which extends beyond Italian concern, as is indicated by the reactions of all the Heads of State and Government to these statements."
"I have to say, Madam President, that we Italians - or at least the majority of the Italians sitting in this House - are particularly concerned by Mr Berlucsoni' s statements because these statements, in addition to being in blatant conflict with the conclusions of the Brussels European Council, subscribed to by Mr Berlusconi himself, moreover, reflect the attitude - which I hope has ceased to prevail - of part of the majority supporting the Italian government."
"In matters such as these which, regrettably, can carry such weight as to tip the balance towards war or peace, exploitation for political ends is unacceptable; however, equally unacceptable are superficial expressions which, I am sad to say, appear to mask attitudes of intolerance which must be opposed."
"Without wishing to exacerbate the issue, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that, after 11 September, a major government coalition party held public demonstrations with boards saying 'Immigrants = terrorists' , and that, in recent days, two mayors of cities in Northern Italy from the same party have ordered the closure of the premises used as mosques."
"That, Madam President, is why we will feel more reassured if you too, as President of this Parliament, particularly following Mr Santini' s words, were to confirm a clear message of open dialogue, such as Parliament has already had occasion to send to the Muslim Arab communities and countries with which we intend to work to combat terrorism, together, openly and resolutely."
"Madam President, Mr Berlusconi was certainly wrong to talk of superiority and a clash of civilisations. These are words which do nothing to promote dialogue."
"Nevertheless, at this time when major alliances are being formed, I would like to send out from this House a personal message of great solidarity and support to the Afghan, Saudi, Iranian, Kuwaiti and Chechen women, to the women of all those countries who are currently fighting and will continue to fight in the coming years."
"It is my genuine hope that the formation of this great alliance to combat terrorism will not mean that the issue of these women' s rights will be relegated to second place yet again."
"Madam President, in my view, we could have, when dealing with the points of order, quite legitimately gone back to the absolutely scandalous words of Mr Berlusconi, who has designs on being the future president of the European Union."
"My colleague and the Chairman of my group, Mr Barón Crespo, and my colleague Mr Swoboda were demanding that you condemn outright the words of Mr Berlusconi."
"Every Member of this House is aware that we had a very broad consensus on avoiding the risks of an equation of Islam with terrorism and condemning anything that could be seen to be a war between civilisations."
"But we expect you to condemn outright what Mr Berlusconi said."
"That is my point of order."
"Madam President, Mr Poettering's highly credible words show that he represents only part of his group, for hardly had he come to the end of his speech than Mr Santini asserted the very opposite of what Mr Poettering had described as being the position of the Christian Democrat Members of this House."
"It would, then, be consistent of Mr Poettering to call upon the Forza Italia members of his group to fall in with the group's position, for what Mr Fiori proceeded to say shows that what Mr Poettering expresses here is not the view of the Christian Democrat members, but only the opinion of some of them."
"Madam President, I did not hear your radio and television statement myself, but many of those who were able to do so said that you had taken up an excellent position on behalf of the European Parliament in respect of Mr Berlusconi's remarks and have told me emphatically that Mrs Fontaine's position is exactly that which the European Parliament should take up."
"Let me first congratulate you on it. I would, though, also like to ask you to do the following: as your position is visibly the majority view of this House, you should again expressly communicate this position to Mr Berlusconi and, at the same time, ask him - in order to dispel any doubt - to make a statement in reply."
"For if his cultural relativism were really nothing but a misunderstanding, your letter and an appropriate response from Mr Berlusconi would be decidedly helpful."
"Mr Schulz, I shall certainly send Mr Berlusconi my press release of 11 September, as well as the statement that I made on 19 September following the meeting that I gave."
"The Arab League ambassadors had wanted to meet me personally in order to outline their concerns to me and, at the end of this important meeting, which was both intense and worthwhile, I made a statement that could not be any clearer."
"I shall also send my statement of 22 September, declaring that the European Council is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism, and in which I solemnly confirm the European Union' s commitment to protecting democratic and multicultural societies."
"And lastly, I shall forward my speech that Mrs Banotti referred to, which I gave to the Heads of State at the exceptional meeting of the Heads of State and Government, and which is very clear."
"I could also add the statements that I made on Greek television, as I was on an official visit to Greece at that time."
"Madam President, in my opinion, the words of the Italian Prime Minister have been misinterpreted by some, and exploited for internal political ends by others who have even used the platform of the European Parliament to exploit them for the purposes of European politics."
"Over 200 Members of this Parliament from the European People' s Party took part in the convention in Rome, which included the meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and they can testify that Mr Berlusconi outlined the government' s positions and his own personal position on terrorism and the Middle East crisis."
"The members of the European People' s Party who do not belong to our coalition government in Italy can also confirm what the Italian Prime Minister' s views are. They are not those reported by certain newspapers nor those described by the left in this House."
"(Interruption by Mr Schultz)"
"Mr Schultz, I did not interrupt you."
"I would ask you at least to be polite. Clearly, politeness was not part of your education."
"Please would you refrain from interrupting and learn some manners above all."
"Why are you getting so het up?"
"Madam President, rather than concerning himself with the internal affairs of the European People' s Party, Mr Schultz would do well to concentrate on those of his own group, which has a minority in Parliament and lost the elections in Italy."
"Clearly, this irritable behaviour is evidence of the political difficulties currently being experienced by his group."
"Madam President, the Italian Prime Minister has made a very practical proposal, and I would like the European Parliament to express its opinion on this matter."
"As I said before, the hundreds of Members of the European Parliament from the European People' s Party who were present at Rome can testify to this."
"The proposal is for an incisive European Union economic intervention to support the Palestinian people, so that the economic growth of the Palestinian people can contribute to reducing existing political tension."
"This is a subject for debate, a practical proposal made by the Italian Prime Minister to protect and defend the Palestinian people, who are experiencing economically difficult times, in the clear knowledge that it is only by defusing the crisis in the Middle East that the world crisis can be resolved."
"And the Italian Prime Minister met with both Israelis and Palestinians."
"I would like the Socialist Party to discuss this subject in this House rather than disseminating election propaganda."
"The left-wing democrats are in trouble."
"Madam President, the left-wing Members appear to be extremely restless."
"As I said, they should discuss practical matters rather than using the European Parliament as a vehicle for political and election propaganda."
"In Italy, the citizens decided: the centre-right won."
"Silvio Berlusconi is Prime Minister and the left has lost."
"Madam President, I do not wish to reply to Mr Tajani, but only to make two observations."
"I had not interrupted him, but had listened attentively and - which is exceptional for me - had permitted myself to laugh at the particularly clever things he said."
"God forbid that that should be prohibited in this House!"
"Perhaps the situation in Italy has got so that one is no longer permitted to laugh at the government..."
"I had not interrupted him, and must moreover say that it would not have been worth it to break into his disquisition."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"Following the tragedies in New York and Washington, many other aspects of our lives have inevitably been changed for ever and I would like to ask the Commission to make a statement on the issue of state aids to airlines."
"In a small peripheral country such as my own, the survival of a national airline is of vital importance to the economy and already in Ireland over 700 jobs are threatened at Aer Lingus."
"I would ask the Commission to lift its ban on state aids to national, particularly small, airlines."
"Certainly, Mrs Banotti, thank you for what you said and we shall pass on your request to the Commission."
"Madam President, Mrs Banotti has already raised the matter of the effect of the acts of terrorism on airlines."
"It is more than airlines: the European tourism industry is Europe's biggest industry, and the World Travel and Tourism Council estimates at the present time that two million jobs could be lost in Europe."
"This is a very serious matter."
"I hope the Commission and Council can address this and come forward with some proposals to try and alleviate the situation, because it could be quite drastic."
"I have just returned from the United States where hotel accommodation is currently about 20% of capacity and aircraft are operating at between 25 and 33% of capacity."
"There has been a huge reaction and I hope the Council and, in particular, the Commission can do something to help before matters get really serious in Europe."
"Madam President, I have a point of order on the aviation industry in Europe, and in particular the national airline in Ireland which will be bankrupt within a matter of weeks unless the Commission relaxes its guidelines on state aid for the airline industries."
"There is also a former state company in Ireland, now privately owned, which services and maintains airlines."
"This company is also in serious difficulty."
"As Mr Provan mentioned, the tourism industry is in further severe difficulty too after the crisis which followed the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease."
"I appeal to you, Madam President, to use your good offices to impress upon the Commission the concern of this House about the impact of the atrocities of 11 September in Europe where thousands, if not millions, of jobs are at risk."
"It is extremely important, if this House is to demonstrate its relevance to the lives of the citizens of Europe, that we should use our influence to save these jobs and to ensure that the Commission does not apply rigid, ideologically-based guidelines in the current situation."
"Mr De Rossa, this is an extremely important issue and I shall of course forward this message to the Commission."
"Mrs Wallström might also wish to give a brief response."
"Madam President, of course this has already been discussed at a Commission meeting."
"The Commission has been in contact with European and other airlines and there have been discussions about state aid or insurance and how these should be channelled."
"I have to refer the matter to my colleague, Commissioner de Palacio, who will have all the details and can give you more information, but I assure you this has definitely been on our agenda and we are interested in finding a solution."
"I will raise this issue with my colleagues in the Commission and I hope we can give you, as soon as possible, a complete answer to questions about the airlines and state aid, or help through other channels."
"Thank you, Mrs Wallström."
"I would also point out that the communication refers to the guidelines for trans-European transport networks and so this issue might also be dealt with tomorrow, when we are given the Commission communication."
"Madam President, unfortunately most people have left at this stage but I want to draw the House's attention to the murder by loyalist paramilitaries last Friday of Martin O'Hagan, a journalist."
"This is just one more example of the grave human rights situation in Northern Ireland."
"Human rights lawyers have been assassinated as well by loyalist paramilitaries."
"Only a few years ago, Rosemarie Nelson, the mother of a young family, was assassinated by loyalist paramilitaries because she was a human rights lawyer."
"There is a serious matter."
"We often debate resolutions in this House about human rights lawyers and journalists being assassinated in the exercise of their duty in other parts of the world."
"Here is a situation within the European Union that has been going on for a long time."
"The situation is extremely grave."
"Journalists have the right to expose wrongdoings, human rights lawyers have the right enshrined in international law to represent people in courts."
"Yet they are being prevented from doing so and in fact, those brave enough to do so have lost their lives."
"It is a real tragedy."
"Thank you, Mrs McKenna, for having added to what I said at the opening of the sitting."
"Accident at AZF, Toulouse, and EU environmental policy"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the accident at the AZF factory in Toulouse and the rewriting of the European Union' s environmental protection policy."
"I shall now give the floor to Mrs Wallström."
"Madam President, the accident in Toulouse occurred shortly after 10 a.m. on 21 September at the establishment Grande Paroisse in Toulouse."
"This fertiliser plant is owned by Atofina the chemical branch of the Total/Fina/Elf group."
"Amongst other dangerous substances it held important quantities of liquefied ammonia and chlorine, combustibles, solid ammonium nitrate and fertilisers, as well as methanol."
"The effects of what seems to have been a mass explosion of ammonium nitrate were felt far outside the establishment's boundaries."
"According to the latest reports, 29 people were killed, 30 people are still in hospital in a serious condition and in total around 2400 people were injured."
"The accident also affected two other chemical plants in the vicinity."
"It rendered a large number of houses uninhabitable and affected the electricity distribution system."
"Moreover, the psychological after-effects on the population that first believed it to be a terrorist attack are also important."
"This accident is perhaps the worst of its kind in Europe since 1921, when an explosion at the BASF company in Germany claimed the lives of 561 citizens."
"Last week a representative of the Total/Fina/Elf group met with the responsible services of my Directorate-General in order to provide detailed information on the accident."
"Furthermore, the French Ministry of the Environment has provided information to the Commission."
"However, the exact causes of the accident are still unknown and the three investigations under way by Atofina, the Ministry of the Environment and the Attorney-General might take a long time."
"AZF was fully covered by the Seveso II directive, which aims at the prevention of major industrial accidents and the limitation of their consequences for man and the environment."
"Its classical field of application are chemical plants and storage facilities."
"The directive obliges the operator of these facilities to put in place a major accident prevention policy, a safety management system and internal emergency plans."
"He/she has to prepare a safety report and send it to the public control authorities."
"These authorities have the task of inspecting the site at regular intervals and also of ensuring that its external emergency plans are put in place and tested periodically."
"Furthermore, the public living in the vicinity of the plant must be informed of the risks arising from the facility and the behaviour in case of an accident."
"The directive came into force in 1999 and replaced the original Seveso directive from 1982 that was adopted following major industrial accidents in the 1970s."
"This was the first piece of Community legislation in the field of industrial risk management."
"It is no secret that Member States were late with their transposition of the Seveso II directive into national law."
"No Member State adopted transposition legislation in time or notified the Commission hereof in time."
"Therefore the Commission started infringement proceedings against all 15 Member States for non-communication or incomplete communication of transposition measures."
"In the meantime this resulted in the Commission taking five Member States to the European Court of Justice: Belgium, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Portugal."
"For France, the Commission decided on 18 July 2001 to apply to the Court for incomplete transposition."
"However, I want to make it very clear today that the reasons for the Court appeal being launched against France can in no way be related directly to the Toulouse accident in terms of possible infringement of obligations under the Seveso II directive."
"At the moment, despite rumours in the press, the Commission has no indication that there was either a deficiency on behalf of the operator managing the plant and complying with Seveso II or on behalf of the French control authorities responsible for inspecting the site."
"According to information received from the French Minister for the Environment, risk analysis, including possible accident scenarios, had been carried out by the site operator but these did not include a mass explosion of ammonia nitrate."
"The last updates were made in 2000 and 2001."
"A safety management system was in place and the site was inspected about twice a year."
"The last inspection took place in May 2001."
"Internal and external emergency plans were in place."
"A land use planning policy established by the prefect imposed restrictions on all new construction activities in the vicinity of the plant."
"Let me now come to the follow-up."
"Just over a week after the accident it is still too early to draw any conclusions."
"The regulatory committee established under the Seveso II directive, chaired by the Commission and composed of representatives of all Member States is going to meet on 10-12 October to discuss, amongst other things, the accident and its follow-up."
"What is the repercussion of the Toulouse accident on the foreseen amendment of the Seveso II directive?"
"You might recall that after the Baia Mare accident, the cyanide spill in Romania in January 2000, I created a task force that presented its final report in December last year."
"In parallel, after the disastrous fireworks explosion in May 2000 in Enschede in the Netherlands, my services organised two European expert seminars on pyrotechnic and explosive substances."
"The expertise and the resulting recommendations went into a draft proposal for an amendment to the Seveso II directive, aiming at broadening the scope and covering establishments that were previously not covered."
"The draft proposal has undergone a public consultation process involving all stakeholders and was foreseen for adoption by the Commission in September."
"We should move forward with this amendment."
"This does not mean we should not take due account of the Toulouse accident."
"There is indeed one very important aspect that made the consequences of the accidents in Toulouse and Enschede even worse, that is, the proximity of the establishments to inhabited areas."
"The new Article 12 on land use planning in the Seveso II directive aims in the long term at the separation of hazardous industrial establishments and inhabited areas or other locations frequented by the public."
"Although the inclusion of such a provision in Community legislation for the very first time represents a major step forward, the Commission and Member States still have to gain experience with its implementation."
"Moreover, this provision applies to the planning for new industrial sites, for new housing zones, and does not retroactively apply to existing situations, such as Toulouse, where increasing density of population has led residential areas to continually spread closer to an industrial site that has existed since the 1920s."
"In order to assist Member States with the implementation of this provision, a guidance document on land use planning was published in 1999 and plans for a European seminar on land use planning to be hosted by France were already under way before the accident in Toulouse."
"In the near future my services will increase cooperation with the Member States in order to develop an appropriate legislative and/or non-legislative follow-up to the accidents in the areas of land use planning, harmonisation of generic risk assessment methods and risk mapping."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a terrible disaster which, as Mrs Wallström said, claimed many victims - 29 people died and more than 2 000 people were injured - and considerable damage was caused to housing, schools, hospitals and universities."
"If I may, I would like to pay tribute to the victims and to express our sympathy and support to the injured, to their families and to all those affected by this disaster."
"What helps most in a disaster like this is other people expressing their solidarity."
"The people of Toulouse have been touched by the number and by the spontaneity of the messages that they have received from France and the European Union, from the Parliament and the Commission."
"As Deputy Mayor of Toulouse, I would like to give my sincere thanks to all those who have sent these messages to us."
"This disaster also compels us to consider a number of things."
"The first is the action the European Union can take to help these towns or regions affected by the catastrophe."
"The European Union budget used to include a heading for emergency aid to deal with these disasters, but this was withdrawn."
"I am today requesting that this instrument, which helped to put affected regions back on their feet, be re-introduced."
"Toulouse is a prime example of a European city with its aircraft and space industries and, in the last few days, I have heard many people asking, when they hear of aid being granted by various sources: 'And what about Europe - what is Europe doing to help us?'"
"Since we constantly discuss bringing Europe closer to its people, one of the most obvious ways of doing this would be for Europe to help Europeans in their time of need."
"Situations such as that which Toulouse has recently experienced require the use of human resources, such as the fire services, first-aid workers, doctors, hospital and voluntary staff."
"Without going so far as to propose the utopia of a European civil protection force, I think that every effort should be made at European Union level, as Parliament recently requested, to enhance the coordination of civil protection expenditure."
"We must improve how the system works."
"For example, in the disaster in Toulouse, I would have been pleased to see the fire services and first-aid workers from other Member States supporting the remarkable work carried out by the Toulouse fire services."
"These are distressing circumstances, admittedly, but this would have done much to help Europe' s cause."
"We often talk of 'zero risk' ."
"The recent events, which have plunged the citizens of Toulouse and New York into mourning, show that this certainly cannot be achieved."
"What we can do, however, is to reduce the probability of risk by taking careful action."
"We must do this at a local level, at a national level, and we must ensure this is done at European level."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to take into account the lessons of the disaster in Toulouse when revising the Seveso II directive."
"Almost every day, many demonstrations take place in Toulouse, in which thousands of people take part, chanting 'Never again, never again!' I would like everyone in this House to respond to them with 'Never again in Europe!'"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin talking about the substance of the matter, I would naturally like to express my solidarity with the victims and their families."
"I believe that the House has today shown its solidarity, which, in my view, is also essential."
"Secondly, my thoughts are also with those of my fellow Members who are more directly involved, due to their responsibilities in the region."
"Nor should we forget to praise the efficiency of everyone who immediately rushed to the scene of the disaster to provide assistance, such as the fire services and hospital staff, and of everyone who played a part in organising the support network for the victims and their families."
"We must also praise the extensive measures of solidarity announced by the Prime Minister during his visit last Friday to Toulouse, which will enable life to return to a normal footing - if that were at all possible - by re-housing those who have lost their homes and getting children back into school as quickly as possible."
"There is also an inquiry underway into the causes of the explosion."
"We must have confidence in the French authorities to carry out this inquiry carefully, with a desire for transparency and with a determination to succeed."
"In addition to this, what can we do at European level?"
"In my view, we must all shoulder our responsibilities, at our own level."
"You mentioned this, Commissioner, and I would like to thank you for your comments about France' s responsibility concerning its obligations under the Seveso directive."
"What you said is important."
"You also mentioned the debate that is underway on how to best reconcile land use planning, environmental risk, industrial risk and employment."
"The work that you have carried out with the aim of revising the Seveso directive should take into account every aspect of this balance."
"Many other Members, in addition to myself, will take part in this debate on additional measures which could be envisaged, including at a European level, particularly with regard to monitoring."
"There is, nonetheless, a point that I would like to come back to, which is the issue of emergency aid."
"Admittedly, we all know that this is a difficult debate, one that was opened during the re-negotiation of Agenda 2000."
"But can we just sit back and watch the disasters that have struck France - namely, the sinking of the Erika, the storms of December 1999 and now the explosion in Toulouse - without demonstrating some European solidarity?"
"We must find a way to do this, if not through the use of a heading on emergency aid, perhaps we could see whether there is some leeway within the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) so that, in addition to this strict set of zones that we have put in place, there may be room for a small solidarity package, so that Europe can also manage in difficult circumstances."
"Secondly, I hope that the Commissioner will do everything she can at a European level and beyond to remind everyone of their responsibilities, in order to allow land planning policies to take into account, in their fiscal dimension as well, the difficult balance that we must achieve, and also so that the leaders of industry shoulder their responsibilities when compensating victims and repairing the damage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to join previous speakers in expressing my group' s solidarity with the families, the victims' relatives and the people of Toulouse as a whole."
"Given the latest legal information we have at our disposal, and whilst awaiting completion of the inquiry that is currently underway, which will determine the causes of the disaster, what lessons, Mr President, can we draw from this fatal explosion?"
"First of all - and this is distressing, truly distressing - history is repeating itself."
"It is 33 years since the Seveso disaster, not to mention the other disasters that have occurred, and two European directives seeking to provide the Member States with a harmonised policy in managing major industrial risks will not have been enough to avoid another human tragedy. This is a stark reality that illustrates the limits of a law, even where this is binding and transnational."
"We should avoid responding to this industrial catastrophe with a Seveso III directive."
"The Liberals consider it imperative, and the Commissioner reiterated this, that, first and foremost, all Member States strictly apply the provisions of the existing legislation, particularly the Seveso II directive, which dates back to December 1996."
"And we still have a long way to go before this can be done, with infringement proceedings launched against six Member States, one of which is France."
"You also stated, Mrs Wallström, that all Member States were behind in the transposition of the directive into national law."
"So, did the manufacturer, the owner of the site, update the safety report at any point in the last five years, as specifically laid down in one of the articles under the Seveso II directive?"
"It is worthwhile asking this question, since at a seminar held in France in 1999, the European Union network for the implementation and enforcement of environmental law (Impel) discussed the causes of a massive ammonia leak at the 'Grande Paroisse' factory, which is in the Seveso II category, and the finger of blame was pointed at design faults and equipment reliability."
"We must conclude that the precautionary principle did not prevail in this case."
"Must we reiterate that this risk assessment provides an essential basis for any strategy to prevent and avert all types of disaster?"
"And now I come to the key point of this debate, which is, as Mrs Berès has already said, the monitoring of land use planning in areas surrounding these sites."
"Employees of the factory are of course affected but everyone living nearby is also a victim of the massive chemical explosion."
"The AZF factory was nothing more and nothing less than a time bomb situated less than five kilometres from the centre of Toulouse, a city with a population of 400 000."
"This is not the only example of a city in Europe that has seen a population explosion."
"If you draw two lines on a map of Europe, one from London to Milan and the other from Copenhagen to Barcelona, and 200 kilometre corridors along each side of the lines of this X, you will have 65% of Europe' s population and 80% of Europe' s manufacturing sites, including the dangerous ones, within this restricted area."
"In France, there is a national debate on the issue of risks to the urban population."
"Three hundred and sixty million citizens of Europe expect, here and now, to see a genuine land planning policy resulting from the unprecedented disaster that struck Toulouse."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this debate, as I believe that, despite our political differences, we know that we must pull together in the face of tragedy."
"Mrs Wallström, the title of the statement that you made to us today obviously referred to the accident at the AZF factory, but it also referred to the rewriting of the European Union' s environmental protection policy because, in my view, this is what poses the challenge."
"The accident that occurred at Seveso gave us the Seveso I directive."
"This was insufficient."
"The accident at Bopal was followed by the Seveso II directive."
"I do not wish to see us simply come up with a third Seveso directive, a point that my fellow Member, Mrs Ries, made very well."
"In my view, we must change the way we approach these problems as patching up after each successive tragedy can only achieve so much."
"Obviously, I agree that we need to further strengthen what already exists, but we must also know when to change tack."
"Since today we know that 'zero risk' is impossible - what has happened recently illustrates this, tragically - and so it is also impossible for people to live alongside a chemical time bomb."
"We must therefore move away from risk management towards risk removal."
"The removal of risk will not be an easy thing to achieve, let us make no bones about this."
"We will not be able to do everything in one fell swoop."
"Several things will need to be implemented."
"First of all, we need resources."
"European resources, resources from other Member States, which will be crucial and which must obviously supplement the resources that the manufacturers themselves will have to provide, because these large international firms are making a profit, because the land that they own, due to their proximity to built-up areas, is worth a great deal on the property market, and also because if they relocate, they will undergo restructuring and will make substantial operational savings."
"We need resources, therefore, but we must also avoid causing social problems."
"Over the past few days, the people who worked at the AZF factory have been burying their colleagues."
"I do not wish to add unemployment to their list of problems - let us not add social crisis and social problems to the environmental and human tragedy."
"We therefore must use all our resources to help these people to relocate if the site is sealed off, or help them with retraining if jobs are retained in Toulouse."
"We must also be very careful with regard to relocation."
"The European Union has always been very sensitive to the question of solidarity and I believe that the large corporations are quite prepared to relocate, but they can quite easily contemplate relocating to the developing world, where there is no environmental protection and no social protection."
"In this respect as well, the European Union must make every effort to avoid this type of relocation."
"Let us avoid sending our time bombs and dangers to other parts of the world."
"Lastly, now might be a good time, when discussing relocations, to consider the purpose of the products that are manufactured in the companies concerned."
"The factory that exploded produced fertilisers."
"Is there still a need today for us to flush more nitrates into the groundwater of Europe' s soil?"
"It may also be the time to question whether some production methods are not perhaps obsolete."
"I am calling upon you, Mrs Wallström, and via you I call on the Commission as a whole, because it is Europe' s turn to speak."
"Defining this general framework clearly falls within Europe' s remit."
"Due to the scale, frequency and almost unavoidable nature of these accidents, I believe that a pact of confidence has been breached between the people of Europe and the regulatory framework that we are supposed to implement."
"I think that we must restore this confidence as a matter of urgency."
"We are, I believe, now awaiting specific and firm proposals from the Commission."
"We should not be satisfied with purely cosmetic measures."
"We need political measures."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like other Members from the region, I was in Toulouse at the time of the explosion."
"Since then, I have met with several employees, residents and friends who have been affected by this disaster."
"I wish to point out that when we talk about suffering, trauma and shock, we are talking about men and women whose lives have been deeply wounded and their anger is in proportion to this shock."
"I wish to pay tribute to the memory of the victims and also to the local authority workers, the emergency and medical teams, the Electricité de France employees and all the men and women who, with their skills and goodwill, gave their energies to serve the general interest."
"It is also at times like this that we rediscover the importance of public services and their staff as a tool for serving the general interest."
"Many political leaders have spoken of the absurdity of locating this type of chemical plant near to large urban centres."
"It is worth making the point that wherever this type of industry is located, there are men and women working."
"In a far-off desert or in the centre of Brussels, if the factory blows up, scores of workers will lose their lives."
"The first question we should address is that of making these industries as safe as possible."
"Admittedly, the debate on the location of sites has been opened, but this aspect cannot be considered unless there are major improvements in inspection and safety conditions."
"The entire situation has changed."
"It is my view that the Seveso directives need to be reviewed."
"Let us use what we learn from this disaster to improve regulations on safety and on respecting the environment."
"We must come up with new, much more restrictive regulations on the way these plants are run and, above all, on the resources available to inspection bodies."
"By way of anecdote, a terrifying one, the inspection body responsible for the Midi-Pyrénées region has 17 inspectors to inspect over 2000 companies."
"Amongst the first factors thrown up by the investigation, I know that the investigation is not over, but nevertheless, there are many indications that the company' s management took a rather irresponsible approach to risk management."
"We must draw the obvious conclusions from that."
"Following the disaster, we are discovering serious safety lapses in the chemical industry in other parts of the country."
"This review process must be undertaken in tandem with a mission whose work is open to the whole of Europe and which has the task of carrying out an assessment of European safety."
"Inspection bodies must publish their results."
"The investigation in Toulouse must be transparent and must involve employees and local residents."
"I therefore call on Parliament to state its support for an exceptional risk assessment procedure in Europe and to review the directives."
"Toulouse is today a city in shock, in terms of the physical environment, psychologically and in terms of the direct and indirect consequences for employment and for businesses located near the site."
"Toulouse needs financial and logistical aid."
"The Union must demonstrate its capacity for solidarity at times of crisis."
"Will this require exceptional emergency funds?"
"I am not sure, but the European Commission could, for example, contact the city, the département and the region to sound out their logistical needs."
"In this situation, the mobilisation of European engineers and support teams could, in symbolic terms as well as being effective, demonstrate the commitment of the European Union."
"'Never again!' 'Never again!' is what tens of thousands of Toulouse' s citizens are shouting and calling for."
"'Never again!' was what the communities affected by the oil slick from the Erika shipwreck, demanded."
"Once again, the approach of profit, job cuts and investment has led to a lapse in safety and has caused an ecological and human disaster."
"In order to confront this, we need further public regulation, more rules on inspection and more resources."
"We know that people are initially angry with the company' s bosses, but they will turn on us next and this fury will be unleashed on us, the political leaders. And they would be right to do so."
"Our task is to produce rules that benefit the community, not to bow down to the dominance of private interests."
"Mr President, as our fellow Member, Mrs De Veyrac, deputy Mayor of Toulouse, sadly stated, on 21 September 2001, the ammonium nitrate warehouse in the AZF chemical factory in Toulouse exploded, causing the death of 29 people and injuring 2 500."
"A disaster of this scale requires the competent authorities to provide information on the exact causes of the explosion, out of respect for the victims, their families, and for all communities living near a site with a Seveso classification."
"Was this an accident, a malicious act or a terrorist attack?"
"Before accusing the chemical industry of failing to comply with the precautionary principle, let us consider the results found by the chemists and specialists in ammonium nitrate, which confirm that there is no basis for the theory of a gradual decomposition of the product that caused the explosion."
"Ammonium nitrate is a stable product, and the investigators make the point that this type of product cannot explode unless it comes into contact with intense heat, as proven by the very serious precedents in Silesia in 1921, in Texas in 1947, in Brest, in France, in 1947."
"Furthermore, the staff representatives at the AZF plant vigorously repudiate the description of a sink-factory."
"Whatever the cause, it would be wise to produce a list of the most dangerous sites and to relocate them away from housing."
"On the other hand, it is, of course, inconceivable to prohibit by law the establishment of high-risk chemical industrial plants."
"These would be forced to locate abroad with foreseeable consequences for the economy and business confidence."
"We would certainly have to amend European legislation which, although dating from 1982 and 1996, is not retroactive. We would have to increase the vigilance of inspection services and authorities over industrial sites with a Seveso classification, or even make access to dangerous sites more secure."
"The approach to adopt will depend on the outcome of the investigation, which we hope will be completed with complete frankness."
"Mr President, I would like to join other Members in expressing my condolences to the families involved in the tragedy that has taken place."
"I also share some of the opinions of previous speakers."
"I would like to insist on one point, however: I believe that the system based on prohibition, the Seveso system, is not sufficient."
"The tragedies taking place recently are demonstrating that we are experiencing phenomena which can only be reduced, if not eliminated, by means of integrated treatment."
"The issue today is town and country planning."
"Europe has an old and antiquated system in which all towns wanted to have their industries and it seemed that quality of life was linked to everything being together."
"A town with many shops, many industries and all within an accessible area."
"Nevertheless, the scale, the risk and the dimension of our companies today demonstrate the serious problems that this entails."
"We cannot continue to allow town and country planning to be completely subsidiary."
"We must be capable of selecting basic elements in order to create a European area of security, in the way that is being done in other areas, such as food safety."
"We must recognise the need for an area of security in the field of town and country planning."
"And the countries must accept it."
"And in the same way that any town and country planning accepts protected natural areas, measures of this type will also have to be accepted."
"In this respect, I regret the fact that, in the version of the environmental action programme which we have received from the Council - the sixth - with regard to which we presented proposals on the urban environment and inhabited areas, certain aspects have been removed which our group considers important."
"We believe that it is a matter of urgency to establish environmental strategies, to implement risk studies, also in industrial areas, to create specific industrial areas far from towns, to penalise those builders or local authorities who allow anything for the sake of construction, and of course establish risk indicators which are incorporated into a European policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like us, through our fellow Members from Toulouse who are with us today, starting with the President of the sitting, to express our condolences and our solidarity with all the victims of the tragedy in Toulouse."
"I, like other speakers, would also like to pay special tribute to the marvellous chain of emergency aid workers, both professional and voluntary, that was put together in Toulouse and, in particular, to the enormous dignity shown by the people of Toulouse in these extremely difficult circumstances."
"What happened there is unimaginable."
"The death toll is indeed terrible, but is much lower than it might have been, given the unbelievable force of the explosion and the huge damage caused by this explosion in a heavily populated area."
"I agree with Mr Onesta when he says that, since there is no such thing as zero risk, especially in industry, we must now take stock and change our approach."
"In other words, we must apply the precautionary principle in land use planning. This means, whenever possible - and it will, unfortunately, only be possible in very limited cases - relocating businesses that are at risk, whilst protecting jobs."
"This is a concern that other speakers have also expressed. It would be particularly unfair for workers in industry to face an added risk - a social risk, that of losing their job - in addition to risks at work."
"The problem is also, and, perhaps, mainly, one of controlling urban development because, and we must be honest about this, in many cases, residential areas have merged with industrial areas."
"Near to the site in Toulouse, there was a major shopping centre."
"In my municipality, which has a factory just like the one in Toulouse, building permits are still being issued for communal housing, less than 800 metres from the site."
"Mainly, Commissioner, I would say that the draft amendment to the Seveso II directive must take account of these problems of urban growth, not least by increasing the responsibilities of businesses but also of the elected authorities that issue building permits."
"Lastly, I should like to echo the feeling of helplessness that I experience as a Member of the European Parliament every time that we have the misfortune to encounter this type of event."
"The European Union does not do all it can when faced with disasters of this scale."
"Every time we give the commitment to move closer to the citizens of Europe, we must remember that we are not there when they go through distressing or intensely emotional times."
"I asked Commissioner Barnier this question after the storms in 1999, and it has come back to haunt us."
"I know that the credit line has been discontinued, but since this is the case, let us at least imagine the Utopia, as Mrs de Veyrac said, of a Eurocorps for civil defence, which is happening for the army."
"In other words, a rapid action force could also quite easily exist in the field of civil defence."
"For years we have been warning about risks of accident. For years we have been afraid that a disaster would happen and for years we have fought against the establishment of these plants in the Toulouse area."
"And now, when the explosion occurs, we have the sudden shock that stunned us at a distance of twenty kilometres, the contradictory information, the toxic cloud, a prefect who is asking to have his house proofed for leaks, all the windows shattered, the reflex to go and pick one' s children up from school, the anguish of seeing cars upside down, windscreens shattered, bloodied drivers wearing masks, the joy of finding one' s daughters, terrified and sheltering in the only classrooms whose windows remain in tact, relieved to see us."
"Going home, unable to telephone, no means of communication and finally hearing about friends who are in shock, injured or in hospital."
"Then, after the anguish, the fear and after the suffering comes the time for anger."
"More than 5 000 of us gathered on the streets of Toulouse on Tuesday and more than 30 000 on Saturday, all shouting 'Never again' ."
"The disaster in Toulouse is hugely revealing."
"First of all, it shows the limitations of local democracy and, in particular, of land use planning policies."
"Town councils have not used their land use plans to keep residential or commercial areas away from danger."
"There is no safety programme in place. There has been no consultation with local associations or with residents, despite the dangers."
"Locally elected representatives are equally responsible for what has happened."
"The disaster also lays bare the policy of industrialists who, for the sake of profit, make not only their employees run risks, but also the surrounding community."
"Lastly, the disaster has shown up the loopholes in the Seveso directive and in the policies implemented by the European Union."
"This disaster has shown the limitations of risk management policy."
"An overhaul of European legislation is essential."
"We can no longer put up with the existence of such huge risks."
"We must have a risk prevention policy."
"The legal liability of industry in the event of an accident must be better defined and increased."
"Member States must transpose European Union directives, and also comply with existing directives on environmental protection."
"The liability of policymakers must also be confirmed."
"Inspections must be stepped up and the responsibility of inspectors, who must be trained to European standards, must also be laid down."
"Chemical as well as nuclear bombs are located near to most European cities and yet no assessment of the risks has been made."
"I do not want to play the role of Cassandra, but I would not wish anyone to experience what we in Toulouse went through on 21 September."
"My thoughts go to the victims of the explosion, to the men and women who died working at the AZF factory in Toulouse and who join the ranks of all those who die every day in a work-related accident because their companies have given priority to profit over safety."
"My thoughts also go to the men and women who died in the street or at home because the government and the town hall did not want to impose the necessary measures to ensure that the factory was not a bomb waiting to go off, a danger to everyone working there and to everyone who lived nearby."
"Whatever the initial cause of the explosion, it is unacceptable that it should have turned into such a disaster, all because precautions were not taken."
"To bring down costs, expenditure on maintenance and storage was reduced, jobs were cut and with complete disregard for safety, work was given to sub-contractors who employed under-trained temporary staff."
"The TotalFinaElf Corporation, which already bears guilt for the Erika shipwreck, is fully responsible."
"Putting the requirements of profit before those of safety is a crime. It is murder and the authorities that have allowed this to happen share the guilt for this event."
"TotalFinaElf, which last year made the greatest profit ever seen by a French company, has the cynicism to toss FRF 20 million to the victims to cover damages that are estimated at FRF 8 billion at the very least."
"Not to mention the pain of the victims' families, which cannot be compensated for."
"The material damage must be paid for in full by the Elf Corporation and above all, this must never happen again, in Toulouse or anywhere else in France, or Europe. This will require very strict inspection measures for these types of companies, with the participation of the workers and under their supervision."
"Mr President, the Erika, storms, Toulouse, I hope that we will not have to add Carling to the list, a chemical plant that is 50 km from here as the crow flies and near to my home in Lorraine."
"How many more deadly signs do we need, Commissioner, before we agree to discuss our society' s future? Our society is adrift, like a wayward ship set to a faulty automatic pilot."
"Are we still going to accept as inevitable, in the name of employment and the all-powerful economy that communities should continue to live at risk, as they do in Toulouse and elsewhere?"
"Were these communities informed of the risks that they faced?"
"It would appear not."
"On the other hand, the communities that are aware of the risks, with ecologists at the top of the list, have been calling for drastic measures for years, such as improving factory safety and of course, the closure of the most dangerous ones."
"Unfortunately, in Toulouse, the worst imaginable scenario occurred."
"Of course, no chemical factory, no nuclear power plant, particularly following 11 September and the appalling terrorist attack on the United States will be out of bounds, the appalling now having become possible."
"This must by no means prevent our countries, with the European Union leading the way, from being able to adopt the measures necessary to guarantee the citizens the highest level of safety in their workplace and in their everyday lives."
"The Seveso I directive represented a huge step forwards."
"Seveso II is an improvement on this but has yet to prove itself, since it has not yet been fully implemented."
"The investigation will tell us whether, in Toulouse, its provisions were being implemented, but this looks unlikely."
"Did those responsible not consider such a disaster to be highly improbable?"
"What Europe needs today is more than just a Seveso III."
"First of all, however, I hope that we do not give in to populism by giving the impression that with one wave of a wand, we could transfer these high-risk factories to another place, a more distant and safer place."
"No high-risk factories should be relocated to developing countries, in the same way that it would be a mistake to consider transplanting these factories into the countryside."
"Secondly, specific industrial sites must be defined, while - let us remember, Commissioner - large amounts of money and European funds have been provided to regenerate industrial wasteland and convert some of it into theme parks."
"It would have been more appropriate to use these places to build factories with stricter regulations."
"Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial that the Commission present, as rapidly as possible, its draft directive on environmental responsibility, which is the only solution that will force negligent or even unwilling factory owners to comply with restrictive regulations."
"Lastly, we need to ask: what kind of society do we want to build?"
"If we carry on as we are, we will be authorising production of chemical molecules whose impact on health or potential risks when transported or manufactured we do not know."
"This is our social model, which must be completely changed in order to guarantee future generations a life free from terrible accidents and danger."
"Mr President, the Total/Fina/Elf group is already guilty of committing a crime against the environment through the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika and has acted criminally, once again, with the explosion of the AZF factory in Toulouse: 29 people are dead, more than 2 500 injured and a whole community ravaged."
"Like my fellow speakers, I fully share the pain of all men and women in Toulouse and most particularly, the pain of the victims' families."
"It is our duty, however, to ensure that everything is done to clarify responsibilities."
"First of all, the responsibilities of TotalFinaElf, who allowed the stored fertiliser to turn into a chemical bomb by cutting costs on production, inspections and safety."
"TotalFinaElf must pay. It must compensate the victims and guarantee the salaries of its employees given that it has the cheek to announce aid for the community that totals one year' s salary for just one employee: its managing director."
"Next, there is the responsibility of the public authorities, the local council which, for the sake of business taxes, allowed a chemical plant to exist in a working class residential area."
"Also the government itself, which waited until 1999 to implement the Seveso II directive, which was voted for in 1996, and was a clearly inadequate directive."
"Legislation must be strengthened and its implementation must be verified by independent inspectors from within the public service."
"The safety of people and the environment is too serious a matter to be left to shareholders and speculators."
"It is for communities, employees, unions and workers' associations to determine, through a public and democratic debate, which types of production are socially useful or are considered to be too dangerous."
"This kind of choice cannot be left to the discretion of people who have proved to be unable to guarantee people' s safety."
"It is the responsibility of a public system of management, under the control of the community at large and the employees."
"Let us not allow the law of profit to pollute and murder again."
"Indeed, Never again!"
"Mr President, firstly I have to remind you that we do not yet know the exact causes and the series of events."
"It is estimated that it may be a year before we know all the details relating to the causes of this accident."
"It is important to remember that first of all we have to look at exactly what happened and what caused this terrible accident in Toulouse."
"Secondly, I would like to talk about responsibility, which, first and foremost, lies with the operators of hazardous facilities."
"Legislation cannot solve all of these problems."
"Responsibility here has to be clarified - and it lies with the operators of this plant."
"One of the basic problems is the so-called urban sprawl - the problem of land use planning."
"This plant was established in the 1920s."
"As you know, the Seveso II directive concerns new facilities, as well as the rules on informing the public, etc."
"You also know that this is an extremely sensitive issue with the Member States, and until now responsibility for land use planning has rested at national, regional and local level."
"This is, then, a very sensitive issue and we are not yet empowered to take decisions on all relevant aspects."
"So what can and must we do in a situation like this?"
"We have to ensure that our legislation is updated and try to make provision for and anticipate the improvements required to our legislation in order to prevent these accidents from happening again, although we are aware that we will never be able to prevent all accidents."
"Unfortunately, we will probably be faced with accidents again, but everything we can do we must do."
"That is why, once we have established the causes of this accident, we will also enter into an open and transparent process of consultation and discussion with Member States and with all involved stakeholders in order to see what we can do to improve our existing directives and make them more effective in trying to prevent this type of accident."
"We should also move ahead with what is already on the table - the amended Seveso II directive - because of previous accidents."
"We should not delay in moving forward with the amended directive, but we should definitely be involved in following up this accident to ensure that we have done everything to our existing legislation to prevent it from reocurring in the future."
"Mr Savary's idea to employ the precautionary principle in land use planning is an excellent starting point, and we will definitely follow up that particular proposal."
"I should also like to inform you of what happens when an accident like this occurs in one of the Member States."
"As you know, we have a Civil Protection Unit that is immediately activated to offer the Member State in question the help and assistance of the network of different experts in all Member States."
"France did not ask for any such assistance from our Civil Protection Unit."
"We have tried to bolster our civil protection activities in order to have, for example, joint training and a much more effective network of experts of every kind."
"For example, I was in Brittany after the Erika oil spill, when France needed help with bird cleaning."
"Cooperation in such a specific area in Europe to establish such a unit that can be activated immediately is possible."
"In an accident like this, France was offered all possible expertise from other Member States."
"If we use a strengthened Civil Protection Unit in the best possible way, it can play the so-called 'green-helmet' role as a force that can be put in place immediately to help and act when accidents like this happen."
"So we will definitely follow this up in a careful and coordinated way, in cooperation with the Member States, in order to see what more is needed as regards prevention."
"As you have all said, our thoughts are with the victims, rescue workers, relatives and people in the Toulouse area."
"We will continue to offer our help and assistance."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Environmental noise"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0296/2001) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise [6660/1/2001 - C5-0245/2001 - 2000/0194(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our citizens are increasingly affected by noise."
"Ten years ago, the European Commission estimated that the lives of a quarter of our citizens were disrupted by it."
"These days, the European Environmental Agency notes that thirty percent of Europeans suffer from noise pollution."
"That is an increase of twenty percent over a ten-year period."
"In my own country, the Netherlands, the number of people burdened by noise is as high as forty-three percent."
"More than ten million citizens in Europe have sleeping disorders."
"All citizens in Europe are entitled to the same protection against unhealthy noise levels."
"Unfortunately, our Environment Ministers do not share our opinion."
"Unfortunately, the Council has not backed the proposal of the huge majority of the European Parliament at first reading to establish four daughter directives."
"These daughter directives pertain to motorways, air traffic, railways and factories."
"That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes four daughter directives yet again."
"What the European Parliament wants is an all-round approach."
"The intention is to reduce aircraft noise at European level and to prescribe the same noise standards around busy airports in order to protect our citizens."
"To bring down the noise of lorries and cars at European level and prescribe the same noise standards along busy roads."
"To curb the noise of trains at European level and prescribe the same noise standard along busy railway lines."
"To decrease noise in factories and ensure that only a small proportion of this noise penetrates into the outside world."
"The Council has adopted the same opinion as the Dutch Environment Minister, Mr Jan Pronk, namely that noise is only a localised problem."
"Our Environment Ministers expose our citizens to increasing levels of noise."
"With regard to noise generated by road traffic, aircraft and trains, the Environment Ministers propose only a weak declaration but no binding legislation."
"There are now only a few European noise standards in place which relate to, for example, household appliances, lawnmowers and high-speed links."
"We desperately need European noise standards pertaining to aircraft."
"Far greater steps are possible technically speaking, and Europe must render these compulsory."
"European standards for lorries and cars are either non-existent or far too weak."
"The tyre directive is a case in point."
"Low-noise tyres may be available on the European market, but they are not yet a compulsory requirement."
"By means of low-noise asphalt, an enormous noise reduction of ten to thirteen decibels can be achieved."
"These technical advances must be incorporated in European policy."
"In addition to European standards for high-speed trains, we also need standards for ordinary passenger trains and for goods trains."
"The Council did agree to harmonising the measurement and calculation of noise."
"There are currently fifty-one different methods used in Europe."
"These are reduced to two by means of the same directive: Lden and Lnight."
"Unfortunately, the Council dropped a few stitches in the process."
"The Environmental Committee has offered to pick those up."
"Similarly, most members of the Environment Committee have dropped a few minor stitches."
"That is why the Group of the Greens, in tandem with the Socialist Group, is tabling four extra amendments."
"Somewhat less high noise levels should also be measured."
"The European Commission shares that opinion, and I invite the Commissioner to confirm this in public."
"The common position states that the goal of the action campaigns is to mitigate noise."
"In plain English, this means noise screens and double-glazing."
"But that is not enough."
"The action campaigns must also aim to reduce noise."
"The majority of the Environmental Committee have adopted the Council' s position that a Member State must be able to establish its own noise indicator Lden."
"That means that measurements no longer need to be harmonised but that the extra protection of the night can be reduced by a factor of ten, namely from eight to six hours."
"That is pandering to the lobby and has nothing to do with the cultural discrepancies that exist between our peoples."
"Precisely that eight-hour period of sleep is essential to everyone."
"That is why we have tabled another common amendment in this instance."
"I call on all my fellow MEPs to give this matter some more thought, and not to allow themselves to be used by the lobbies on Wednesday but to give priority to the health protection of our citizens."
"Mr President, environmental noise is a very old problem that for a long time, has not in fact been taken seriously."
"But it is a problem which is affecting many European citizens on a daily basis."
"Furthermore, the economic damage it incurs is enormous, running into the tens of billions of euros annually."
"I therefore welcome the proposed directive with open arms and certainly also embrace the rapporteur' s suggestions to turn it into a framework directive."
"There has been much debate about the directive in this House, and unfortunately I have recently doubted on occasion whether all those taking part in the debate had actually read the proposal properly."
"Indeed, and I will repeat it once again, this is not about laying down the same noise standards in Europe."
"It is true that Europe boasts great cultural diversity, which means that what is experienced as disturbing in one country is not necessarily considered to be troublesome in another Member State."
"I do not want to go into that diversity, for that is not what today' s debate is about."
"So what is it about?"
"It is about measuring noise."
"That should be done in a uniform way across the European Union."
"For that purpose, a formula will need to be established on the basis of which maps can then be drafted."
"The population will subsequently need to be informed of what would come under noise pollution."
"On the basis of that information, which is measured everywhere in Europe in the same way on the basis of the same formulas, action campaigns can then be developed at local level."
"I therefore repeat once again, and I would like to cite the European Commission in its explanatory statement, it is not the intention to establish limiting values which apply to the entire European Union."
"What we will need to do, however, is to avoid situations we have at the moment, for example, in my own living environment."
"For surely it is unacceptable that in one part of Europe, my region of Maastricht, an airport is not allowed to expand, while less than thirty kilometres down the road, in Belgium, based on more flexible requirements, a new airport is being opened without the slightest problem."
"The population has everything to do with this."
"In my opinion, 'shopping' distorts the market and should be prevented by the European airline companies."
"Measuring methods are harmonised on the basis of a formula which takes into account - and that is something that needs to be explained to my fellow MEPs once again - the differences between 'day' and 'night' , the population density, but also the cultural diversity, which means that in Portugal or Spain, different 'day' and 'night' hours can be established."
"The people in the south worry about the disturbance of the pace of life, but that is not a constant."
"I should like to express a personal opinion on one other point."
"All the other opinions I have expressed were on behalf of the group."
"A great deal has been said about whether military airbases should or should not fall within the scope of the directive."
"Although that aspect has meanwhile been removed from the directive, it has been revived by the rapporteur."
"What I need to get off my chest - and I cannot explain it in any other way - is that I believe that military airbases should also be measured."
"Especially in this day and age, everyone is of the opinion that military aviation should be given free rein."
"I, too, am in favour of this, but that does not mean that they should not be subject to measurement."
"That has nothing to do with offering slots."
"Most proposals have been re-instated from the original Commission proposal."
"That should in itself not be problematic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the line taken by the rapporteur, as indeed it did at first reading and also in the discussions and votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The most contentious points, namely environmental noise around airports and also military airbases, are no longer on the table at this reading."
"The Joint Statement lags behind the precise formulations of the Commission's proposal, but a long way behind Parliament's requirements for the European noise abatement policy."
"For example, the Joint Statement has deleted all the fixed dates indicating the deadlines from which the noise maps have to be worked out and approved."
"The same applies to the action plans."
"My group therefore considers that all amendments which reintroduce these precise dates should be agreed and accepted as a matter of urgency."
"Information is another point."
"Amendment No 22 says that the Member States must ensure that the noise maps and action plans are posted on the Internet two months at the latest after being approved."
"We think this is very important."
"I believe that we can have general debates about how we bring Europe and its citizens closer together if we do not then shy away from very definite political proposals for putting information policy into action."
"It is my view - one shared with both the speakers who preceded me - that the key question is whether any request by us for subsidiary directives will be successful."
"I consider it to be progress in itself that there are harmonised methods of noise measurement and common noise indicators."
"Such things can, though, be only the beginning."
"What are we to say to people if we point out the problem but take no definite steps to solve it?"
"I believe that a time limit is needed here."
"We cannot wait indefinitely for the next steps in this field to be taken."
"It is for this reason that my group has joined with the Greens in signing the request for such subsidiary directives to be presented within three years."
"Mr President, it may well be that 100 years ago our cities resounded to the noise of iron wheels and iron hooves bouncing off cobbled stones."
"I suspect that made a hell of a din."
"Nonetheless the impression is that our society has become noisier with more machinery, hi-fis and stereos, planes, trains and, above all, motorways."
"I am all in favour of cutting noise and making life more pleasant, peaceful and calm."
"I support the Commission's proposals for common measurements so that we all know what we are looking at and what we are hearing across the European Union."
"I support the idea of noise mapping and I support legislation under single market rules to introduce limits on noise from new equipment being introduced and sold throughout the European Union."
"But I am opposed to the Union seeking noise limits on installations in any individual Member State."
"I do so, as I have argued strongly in committee, on the grounds of subsidiarity, in the belief that decisions should be taken at the lowest practical level."
"In almost every case in the Committee on the Environment, we deal with issues which should rightly be dealt with at European Union level, because they concern matters which affect more than one Member State - transboundary issues."
"But today I arrived in Parliament, I opened my window in the office in the Tower and I could not hear Strasbourg airport, I could not even hear the railway."
"All I could hear was someone shouting down in the courtyard."
"I do not regard noise from airports as a transboundary issue and I am pleased that the committee rejected a number of the amendments which were tabled."
"I will be urging my group to reject Amendment No 34 here because it still implies that noise limits should be introduced."
"Mr de Roo commented on Amendment No 36 that the eight-hour sleep limit is essential for everyone."
"That may be the case."
"It may also be the case that a cup of cocoa and a bedtime story are essential for everyone but this is not something which should be done at EU level."
"We should not be setting standards for these things."
"What is fascinating about this debate, as it was in committee and here now, is that for the best possible reasons - the improvement of health and enhancing the environment - measures have been suggested to us which represent a sort of creeping centralisation which, at the end of the day, makes the European Union seem bossy and interfering to far too many of our constituents."
"We should take this opportunity, and indeed every opportunity, to put into practice our belief that wherever possible we should be applying strictly the principles of subsidiarity and making sure that when we take measures on behalf of the environment at European Union level it is because they will genuinely make a difference to individuals and cannot be done by individual Member States."
"Mr President, European policy that tackles environmental problems is justified since air and water pollution are issues which extend across our national borders."
"Fortunately, that is quite a different story for noise pollution."
"I am pleased that I, in the Netherlands, am not affected by the noise produced in Milan or Athens."
"In other words, noise pollution is a local, or regional, problem."
"The internal market justifies environmental policy at European level, in order to promote fair competition."
"This means, therefore, that European requirements can be prescribed for the safety and environmental friendliness of products and processes."
"Clear examples of products are emission requirements for cars, lorries and machinery, while waste incineration and energy generation typify processes."
"In relation to fair competition, European noise standards can also be prescribed for products, such as cars, motorcycles, lorries, machinery, trains and aircraft."
"This is not appropriate for processes since the effects do not transcend borders."
"In other words, I am in favour of European standards for low-noise tyres but am opposed to the requirement that the cobblestones be removed from the streets in Brussels on account of European policy."
"The Council has already taken things very far in the environmental noise directive."
"Parliament' s amendments, however, go even further, and I cannot back most of these as a result."
"In addition, I cannot see the additional benefit a European noise pollution map would afford."
"The Member States can map out noise pollution themselves if they so wish."
"Moreover, if such a map were to exist already, I would still be opposed to a European policy on environmental noise."
"A separate problem is aircraft noise."
"Last week, I attended the ICAO Conference in Montreal on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Unfortunately, it appeared that outside European, there is little support for stricter noise standards for aircraft."
"Stricter noise standards for airfields are also a moot point."
"Nevertheless, I remain of the opinion that airfield authorities must be able to pursue a powerful policy of their own by refusing large noise-makers."
"Noise pollution caused by aircraft is mainly a problem for people who live near the airports."
"In principle, this problem should therefore be solved locally, that is to say by the competent airport authority."
"In various airports, this is already the case in that flight bans are issued for the noisiest aircraft or for certain night flights."
"The disadvantage in this respect is that the problem could be transferred elsewhere."
"In addition, airports in border regions can cause extra problems."
"The latter must be solved mutually by the relevant Member States."
"In this matter, I should also add that we must not inflate the issue."
"If I want to fly to Strasbourg, I do not drive to Rome first because, due to competitive advantages, the flights there are cheaper than from Amsterdam."
"As for the aircraft themselves, the problem is not that major technically speaking."
"Thanks to modern technology, it is possible to produce aircraft which produce six times less noise than aircraft built thirty years ago."
"Since the life of aircraft is about thirty years, the effects of these technical improvements, however, are taking a long time to kick in."
"The question is whether this long wait is desirable."
"I do not think so."
"If we really want to do something about aircraft noise, technical improvements must be carried out more quickly."
"The extra cost this entails obviously falls to the traveller who must be fully aware of the actual cost of flying."
"Noise policy is a very new thing in an industrialised society that moves ahead simply by means of a great deal of technology and a lot of noise, and, as for the question as to whether noise policy is a subsidiarity issue, one is in two minds when answering it."
"Mr Davies and Mr Blokland, if I were from your countries of origin, I too would adduce the argument from subsidiarity, but, my dear Mr Blokland, I know only two airports in the Netherlands whose flight paths, however, are located above my constituency."
"All this is relative, and so I believe that we here must talk about whether we can find an air corridor to serve as a model for the compilation of fundamental criteria, and I believe that our views on noise maps are by no means so divergent."
"I advocate comparable rules of measurement within the European Union as a matter of principle, and I also believe it to be self-evident that the action plans we arrive at on the basis of these measurements must be drawn up by the member countries, which must also implement and supervise them."
"I take a great interest in the question, at what actual point such a regulatory mechanism takes effect, and here the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has without any doubt gone too far."
"One could get the idea from reading the Committee on the Environment's text that, in future, every country lane will have to have its own noise map."
"The wording is doubtless much too vague, and what the Council proposes is quite simply boring."
"If you are only to draw up such a noise map when the figure of six million cars per annum is reached, then I suggest you abandon the whole operation."
"So, in my view, a good mean value would be a good solution."
"As far as the measurement of noise from railway lines is concerned, it would have been good if we could have had another parameter for this, as noise from railways is perceived differently to that from motorways or airports."
"Unfortunately, that idea foundered at the committee stage, something which I particularly regret."
"I wish to contradict Mrs Ria Oomen, whom I otherwise greatly respect, by saying that I think it almost courageous to state the belief that politicians like us, who concern ourselves with the environment, can decide in an environmental directive whether military pilots fly or not."
"Quite apart from the present situation, this Parliament does not have the right to regulate the times of practice flights by the French or the British."
"I believe that military aviation should have no place in this directive and nor will it find its way into it."
"In other respects, I believe this debate to have been basically necessary."
"I wish we could take this document to the Conciliation Committee; then, Mr de Roo, we would get away from your rather exaggerated demands and arrive at realistic ones that would get us somewhere in the overall scheme of things."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Florenz, I think these directives require us to consider in principle whether we want further exemptions for many governmental bodies, as the individual citizen does not, of course, care whether the aircraft causing the noise are civilian or military."
"This is not, then, about ruling on what measures in terms of military tactics should be under discussion, but only about arranging flights in the context of a noise indicator and an action plan in such a way that overall noise does not exceed the level tolerable by individuals."
"I believe that we should steer our joint efforts towards finding out what people find acceptable or intolerable and decide on that basis what steps to take."
"There is a need for more research on this."
"It has, for example, not yet been ascertained whether an average noise level is dangerous, or individual very high levels."
"We therefore need even more understanding of causes, effects and connections."
"Hence, too, our demand that we should not immediately announce a framework directive to which we attach specified noise indicators and limit values. Rather, we should say that we want to obtain the land registers first and then, in three years' time, to adopt appropriate subsidiary directives with quality standards for noise policy."
"Secondly - and in my view this is at least as important - we should also be carefully re-examining individual noise emission sources in order to find out how, at European level - and perhaps more quickly and more effectively than by means of local action plans - we might achieve a reduction in the noise from aircraft and motor vehicles caused, for example, by their tyres."
"So we also need noise reduction at the emission sources."
"Mr President, noise pollution is, of course, a reality. Furthermore it is increasing in most countries of the European Union."
"It is aggressive not only to the hearing but also to the whole nervous system of citizens and in many cases it alters not only the personality, through reactions such as irritability and insomnia, but it also produces pain in the auditory system."
"I come from a southern country and to tell you the truth I have very often thought: 'Who could silence that lawnmower next door!"
"Who could make the traffic on this street quieter!"
"Who could stop the music coming from that discotheque on the other side of the block from reaching my windows!'"
"And on all those occasions when a citizen such as me has said, 'Why is there nothing or nobody that can stop this noise?' , it should be possible for most cases to be regulated, either by the local council, the residents association or the regional authorities."
"In other words, at a local level rather than a national level."
"As numerous speakers have said, realistically speaking, it seems to me that there are practically no cases in which noise, at the level most citizens suffer it, should be dealt with in a cross-border fashion."
"Airport noise has been mentioned, but it apparently affects 1.7% of the population of a country, while road traffic noise affects far more."
"It seems to me that to concentrate on airport noise and not deal on a local level with road traffic, in particular, is a rather absurd form of discrimination against airports."
"I am not going to go into that, however."
"Above all, I wanted to make it clear once again that there is a difference between the various countries of the European Union in terms of noise and perceptions of it."
"In this respect, Mediterranean countries are more noisy, we have a climate which allows us to be outdoors and, in this sense, eight o' clock in the evening is for us a time for socialising, to be out and to be professionally active."
"We could never approve or support a directive which discriminates against other people' s cultures in this way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Alexander de Roo on his tenacity in the fight against noise pollution."
"Noise pollution is very disturbing and can form a threat to health."
"Health is tied in with the environment and with the way in which we pollute the environment."
"The Sixth Environmental Action Programme is right to devote much attention to this aspect."
"This attention must lead to specific measures."
"The guiding principle is to reduce noise to a level at which it does not threaten public health."
"In this connection, the guidelines and opinions of the World Health Organisation should be taken into consideration."
"Noise pollution is local and certainly does not transcend borders."
"Solutions must be found by local, regional and national administrators."
"We should be careful not to regulate too much at EU level."
"Excessive ruling from Brussels is in most countries not appreciated - with good reason - but in few cases, European attention is certainly justified."
"First of all, Europe must step in when the noise source exceeds limits, for example in the form of products."
"There are already European rules in place for noise pollution, for example pertaining to the noise standards for lawnmowers."
"Noise emission standards for certain products, such as cars, pleasure boats, lorries, trains, aircraft and industrial equipment are essential."
"A second reason for European intervention is the making available of reliable and verifiable data."
"The European Parliament pointed at the lack of data on various sources of noise a long time ago, and a common method must be found for measuring and assessing noise."
"And this forms the very essence of the Commission' s proposal."
"Thirdly, general principles must be formulated, such as: the polluter, or noise-maker, pays."
"This kind of principle must be transposed in our legislation."
"Citizens must - and that is, in fact, the most important point, in my opinion - have clear rights."
"In the case of serious complaints about noise pollution, the right to investigation should exist and, if necessary, action should be taken."
"Mr President, we all agree that noise pollution disturbs the everyday lives of the people of Europe."
"I am however, rather surprised."
"We are simply asking Europe to compensate for errors in land use planning that have been made in all of our Member States."
"Why, then, should we appeal to Europe, since each Member State can decide for itself what it should do on its own territory?"
"We have already adopted measures on tyres and aircraft engines and we can do the same for road surfaces."
"This is indeed a huge task, but why should we lay down regulations which, in reality, concern not only Member States but must also take account of differences between these countries and, above all, encourage local authorities to adopt the necessary measures in line with their local situation rather than us deciding for them?"
"This is the principle of subsidiarity and I am particularly keen to see it implemented in this area."
"Locally elected representatives are responsible for deciding on what needs to be done in each town, county or region."
"These are decisions for locally elected representatives."
"I am one of them and I know very well what is involved in drawing up a strategic noise map."
"We are told about airports, for example."
"There are international airports, and there are national airports and there are considerable differences between airports."
"The impact of noise is, therefore, different."
"Why, then, should we impose standards that will not apply to all of them?"
"It should not be forgotten that airports are crucial to the areas in which they are located."
"Infrastructures for air transport are a crucial factor for industries, which often choose where to base themselves on the basis of communications links and airports."
"Is it worth emphasising that an exception absolutely must be made for military airports?"
"I agree with Mr Florenz."
"The current situation clearly shows the importance of this provision."
"I shall conclude by reminding you that the title of this directive is 'Assessment and Management of Noise' ."
"Management is, therefore, preceded by an assessment."
"How can we attempt to set limits without a detailed and wide-ranging study, based on commonly established assessment criteria?"
"We would need to have precise maps on noise and then ask every Member State to implement effective action plans."
"It is also crucial that we involve the public in these exercises, although this can only be done with the agreement of each country and each local authority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is no exaggeration to say that a significant proportion of the inhabitants of Europe are forced to live with levels of noise which have a serious impact on their health, which is why I think it is important for the Union to launch an integrated strategy to combat noise."
"We are currently at second reading and we need to focus on the main issues, as set out by the rapporteur."
"If specifications are to be introduced for noise, a matter that concerns the Member States and industry, the Union needs to make specific proposals on broad guidelines, technical assistance for research and exchanges of information, on how to raise the awareness of the various parties and on how the proposed measures are to be applied and controlled."
"As far as noise indicators are concerned, I agree with the Council's position allowing the Member States to move the night period by up to two hours because the southern countries have a different climate from the northern countries and I think this arrangement is essential."
"As far as the proposed timetable is concerned, I think the Commission's initial proposal is feasible and that the Member States should set the administrative process in motion as quickly as possible so that the proposed directive can be put into practice."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his sterling work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more and more Europeans are affected by environmental noise, but despite this, the European Union has been slow to implement a common policy in the field of noise."
"I therefore agree with the ambitious options proposed by the rapporteur, Alexander de Roo, and I congratulate him on his work."
"I supported his report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I support it again now."
"I should like to highlight a few aspects in particular."
"Firstly, I agree with the idea of transforming this directive into a binding framework directive to be followed by specific directives on noise caused by cars, motorcycles, trains and aircraft."
"Secondly, I also agree with setting common noise limits in the areas surrounding all of the European Union' s civilian airports."
"Not only because the noise caused by night-time air traffic is more responsible than any other for depriving the general public of sleep, but also because, as a result of the lack of common regulations in the European Union, we have seen terrible distortions of competition between airports and a lack of fairness towards the citizens of the various Member States."
"Thirdly, I welcome the amendments proposed for the joint position on noise indicators."
"With these amendments, the Member States can move up to two hours of the evening schedule to the daytime or night-time period, which will enable legislation on noise to be implemented without this affecting the habits and traditions of each country, especially, those of southern Europe."
"This new legislation must be implemented as rapidly as possible, but in order to ensure that it is complied with, Member States need to invest very quickly in the technical and human resources that are essential to monitoring and supervising its implementation."
"Unless this is done, we will have yet another law that is good, but ignored."
"Mr President, this is the first directive that deals with ambient noise, as distinct from noise from a particular common source."
"Indeed it is to be welcomed."
"I also welcome the recent decision of the Committee on the Environment to restate that this draft directive should be strengthened into a framework directive out of which further, more detailed and specific legislation can follow, in other words, daughter directives."
"A one-size-fits-all policy in relation to environmental noise and the different transport sectors, not to mention differing circumstances in Member States, is not satisfactory legislation."
"I would like to mention another point."
"I do not agree with the views of my colleague, Mr de Roo, in the specific amendments he has introduced on noise at airports and in the environs of airports in this piece of legislation."
"That will be for another day as far as I am concerned."
"I would like a response from the Commission in view of the opinion of the Advocate-General, delivered on 20 September last, on the preliminary ruling on the invalidity of Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 925/99 on restricting the use of aircraft at European airports in the interests of protection against noise."
"This regulation was based, curiously and questionably, on design criteria rather than performance criteria."
"I am referring to the controversial hushkits legislation, an example of how not to do something."
"I would appreciate a Commission response."
"Could the Commission indicate whether it will be proposing the repealing or amending of this regulation, because this is a most important issue."
"We cannot pursue design criteria, as distinct from performance criteria, which favour one jet engine manufacturer over another."
"That has got us into difficulties on this issue."
"I would appreciate persistence in pursuing the issue of Mr de Roo's amendments."
"In the light of what has happened with the hushkits legislation I would like a response from the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to make a couple of general points and a couple of specific points about this report."
"Firstly, generally, I support the common position - it is a useful compromise - but I would not support going any further than that."
"This is useful as a framework directive but I would not like to see lots of further directives springing from it."
"We need to be very careful in applying the principles of subsidiarity, a view which is being widely expressed across the Chamber."
"I am not sure that we would have any credibility whatsoever as a Parliament or as a European Union if we started to dictate to our citizens what hours they can or cannot sleep."
"This is a matter that should be determined for them at a local level."
"If an airport, for instance, is located in the centre of a city, then the limit values that should be acceptable there are completely different to those at an airport located out on a peninsula in a quiet rural area."
"Why should not a particular community seek to set up an airport, for instance as a cargo hub, that can experience noise pollution in excess of what a large city should produce?"
"This is a matter for local authorities and for national governments and should not be a matter for this Parliament and for Europe."
"I should like to ask those people who wanted to include military aircraft and military airfields within the scope of this directive, whether they are really saying, as Europe is, at the moment, in a state of war, that our airforces cannot operate at night or with planes that are too noisy, that they cannot defend our freedoms against terrorist attacks if their aircraft are too noisy."
"I suggest that if that proposal is being made seriously, it would be laughed out of court across Europe."
"I am in favour of legislation laying down noise limits for specific projects, but we really are going far too far in many aspects of the amendments proposed in this directive."
"Mr President, first of all I should say that we are not trying by any means to suggest that people across Europe should go to bed at a certain time or laugh in certain places only, or to harmonise any of the different customs and cultural traditions in Europe."
"The proposed directive on the table today, following on from our 1996 Green Paper, aims to develop a new noise policy to tackle noise which affects people, and not only noise from individual sources."
"This will be done by drawing up harmonised noise maps to assess the noise exposure situation across the Community; informing the public about noise exposure and its effects; requiring authorities in Member States to develop action plans to achieve the required noise levels; and providing the European institutions with information on environmental noise, in order to assess the situation and develop further action."
"There are 51 different ways to measure noise, but could we not agree on the means of measuring it within the Community?"
"That is the first step - actually drawing up these noise maps."
"With regard to this last topic, I understand the concerns expressed by some Members who have tabled amendments making the case for proposals for daughter directives as of now to set new limit values for sources and environmental noise."
"However, the success of the innovative noise policy we wish to develop relies notably on the quality of the data we will be able to gather."
"At the moment, the lack of such information is obvious, notably due to the lack of harmonisation of the assessment of noise exposure within Europe."
"The Commission believes that it would be premature at this stage to come up with proposals setting new limit values for noise."
"We already have a raft of market access legislation which sets limit values for different kinds of road vehicles, for example."
"It will be simpler and quicker to tighten the noise standards in existing legislation than to introduce new daughter directives."
"We will consider what these standards need to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps and will, of course, report back to the Council and Parliament."
"For these reasons, we cannot accept the amendments introducing daughter directives and limit values, but we are willing to propose further actions as soon as possible, which is why we wholeheartedly accept amendments strengthening the timetable."
"The directive does not concern specific sources such as aircraft engines and hushkits."
"The Commission has not yet had time to reflect on the ICAO decision last week, but we will of course come back as soon as we have had a chance to do so."
"Moving on to the detail of the 36 amendments adopted by Parliament's Environment Committee, we are able to accept 28 of them, in full, in principle and/or in part."
"We can accept Amendment No 1, which alters the title, to make the proposal a Community framework for the assessment and management of environmental noise."
"However, as I said earlier, we believe that it would be premature to set new limit values, and thus we cannot support Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6 and 33."
"As for the timetable for implementation of the proposed directive, we welcome Amendments Nos 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23 and 25, which propose restoring the dates of the original Commission proposal, and in line with these amendments we can also accept in principle Amendments Nos 15 and 16, which seek to reinstate tighter deadlines, although we would have more reservations on the deletion of the two-phase approach for roads and railways."
"In this respect, we cannot accept Amendment No 20."
"Several amendments also help clarify the text, and, furthermore, we accept Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8, 14, 27, 28 and 29."
"We can accept in principle Amendment No 5, which introduces four important principles, though we would not wish other principles to be excluded."
"With regard to Amendment No 9, which seeks to reinstate the definition of human health, we support the first part of this amendment, while the reference to the World Health Organisation seems superfluous at this stage."
"On the harmonisation of the common noise indicators, Lden and Lnight, Amendment No 11 makes the case for the compulsory use of these indicators for acoustical planning and noise zoning, while Amendment No 34 reintroduces the definition of an action plan being 'designed to reduce noise where a limit value in Lden or Lnight is exceeded'."
"Within the Council an agreement was reached to use common indicators only for the purpose of strategic noise mapping, while the need for further harmonisation of indicators was postponed for consideration in the review proposed in Article 11."
"Therefore, I am afraid we cannot support Amendments Nos 11 and 34."
"However, since the directive now limits itself to strategic noise mapping, it is logical to support the principle of Amendment No 12."
"Besides this, we also welcome Amendment No 36, which seeks to reduce the flexibility and the definition of the Lden noise indicator, thus making for more comparable results."
"On public information, Amendment No 22 requires that the information to the public be published on the Internet within two months."
"We welcome the principle of this amendment, but the dissemination of information to the public should not be limited to the Internet."
"As for the review clause under Article 11 of the proposal, Amendment No 24 seeks to delete the reference to 'different climates and cultures'."
"Owing to strong concerns expressed in the Council by Member States, we cannot support Amendment No 24."
"In the annexes, we can support in part Amendment No 26, which seeks to make compulsory the provision of financial information on action plans."
"Of the three types of financial information concerned, we would support the provision of budget information being made compulsory, while the others are more difficult to obtain."
"Finally, we support Amendments Nos 30, 31, 32 and 35 to Annex VI, which partly restore the original provisions proposed by the Commission on the technical specification of strategic noise maps."
"I thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for the detailed consideration given to this proposal and the helpful amendments which have been contributed."
"They have undoubtedly strengthened the proposal and also improved its quality."
"Mr President, I should merely like to clear up a misunderstanding."
"An amendment to measure military noise has not been re-tabled, as was wrongly assumed by some MEPs."
"That is therefore no longer a point of discussion."
"We have taken note of this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery"
"The next item is the report (A5-0287/2001) by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery [COM(2000) 840 - C5-0742/2000 - 2000/0336(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very long title essentially covers machines with which we are all familiar, such as lawn mowers, chain saws, hedge trimmers, drills, all of which are mobile and to which environmental legislation has perhaps given too little attention in recent years."
"We know, for example, that nowadays a four-stroke lawn mower emits exactly as much in an hour as a car in European category 4 travelling at 150 kilometres per hour. Or we know that, on some days in June this year, 40% of carbon monoxide emissions originated from these mobile machines, 40% of the ozone precursors."
"That is why we have to do something about this."
"The proposed directive is all right in so far as it goes, but we made a number of critical observations in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"One point was that we wanted to move the timetable forward a bit, in much the same way as legislation in the United States takes place."
"We wanted to see if the 'averaging and banking' model was perhaps after all unjustifiable in European terms, being something of a bureaucratic monster that would be hard to keep a check on in Europe and which, to that extent, would tell us little about whether we could achieve the reductions we were aiming for."
"We tackled this issue very ambitiously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"As the decision was made in July - in other words, quite some time ago - we were able to negotiate with the Council about this legislation."
"I can now present a compromise package which the Council is prepared to accept by a large majority, if not unanimously."
"It is my opinion that we should in this case go down this route and complete the legislation in its entirety in one reading."
"On the one hand, that would help take the burden off the bureaucratic processes here in the European Parliament and in the Council, and on the other would also, of course, help the environment if the legislation could enter into force more quickly."
"What is this compromise about?"
"Firstly, we want to move the date of entry into force forward for certain categories."
"It is about midway between what was decided by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and what was proposed by the Commission."
"Secondly, we want to dispense with the 'averaging and banking' system because of the bureaucratic difficulties involved in it."
"In order, however, that environmental legislation should not produce distortions in competition which are not justified in terms of environmental policy, we want to make exceptions possible for small manufacturers producing 25 000 units per annum, and we also want certain products, the SH2 and SH3 machines, to be subject to transitional rules for a period of five years, for example certain chain saws used high up in trees or certain two-stroke motors that drive drills."
"That is contained in Amendment No 30, so that these machines can be granted extra time - something which, incidentally, corresponds to what industry too has suggested."
"I cannot therefore go down the road of excluding certain machines from the directive altogether, but I will say: let us give these machines more time if this is justified on technical grounds."
"I would again remind you how, when we were very ambitious in legislating for cars in categories 3 and 4, we ended up in the Conciliation Committee reaching a reasonable compromise which, of course, met with little approval from the industry at first but which in the final analysis is now appreciated by everybody, because it improves air quality in Europe."
"I think that the compromise package that I am able to present to you today points in the same direction, the only difference being that it is on the table already and not only after a conciliation procedure."
"In this respect, what lies before us on the table today is not a 'chain saw massacre' , which one newspaper called it but, rather, a durable compromise to improve air quality in Europe."
"Mr President, a rhetorical question often rhetorically asked is: which came first, the chicken or the egg?"
"In the case of new clean air technology, it is usually the case that government must first lay the legislative egg from which is hatched the technology to give us cleaner cars or lorries."
"In the case of this report, however, the situation is reversed, because in the main the technology is available to clean up the small engines which, as Mr Lange says, can produce more pollution in one hour than a car travelling 150 km. In many cases cost is the only reason for which we do not have cleaner engines already."
"In fact, Honda can produce overhead valve four-stroke engines that easily meet these requirements."
"However, there are some important exceptions to this general rule."
"I am pleased that Mr Lange has withdrawn his suggestion that the small-producer exemption should be set at 10 000 units per year - which would not have covered any European manufacturers - and supported the Commission's position of 25 000, which covers 7 manufacturers."
"However, we have some particular problems with this piece of legislation, and in particular with chainsaws and the like."
"These are machines which have to be light because they are carried by people; they cannot be hot, to avoid burning the user; and they have to be multi-positional - in other words they have to work when upside down."
"For those particular uses, two-stroke technology is the only viable option."
"We remember seeing those Trabants and Wartburgs coming across East Berlin; these types of two-stroke engines are dirtier but, in the case of chainsaws, there is no alternative."
"The solution put forward by the Commission is to use a system of averaging and banking, whereby dirty engines can be set off against clean engines and clean technology can be saved up for the next year and used to produce some dirty engines the following year."
"I do not like this system."
"In many ways it is dishonest, because people will be buying engines which they think meet the regulations, when in fact they are dirtier."
"Only the big manufacturers who produce a wide range of engines can benefit from this."
"This system should not be supported."
"However, we need protection for these particular applications and that is why I have tabled my amendment - No 29 - giving a detailed list of exemptions: strimmers, chainsaws, brush cutters, machines for drilling holes in the ice and so on."
"I am very disappointed that Mr Lange has not seen fit to support that amendment, because without the protection of this detailed list of exceptions, Mr Lange's amendment - No 30 - does not go far enough, relying only on some technical committee, some Commission assessment of the alternatives."
"Mr Lange should think very carefully about my amendment, and then we would have a deal that both sides of this House could accept."
"Mr President, this legislation has often been referred to as the lawnmowers directive."
"The fact that MEPs are spending their time discussing lawnmowers will no doubt confirm the impression which too many of our constituents have about the value of our work."
"If so, they should think again."
"The blue smoke from generators, lawnmowers, pumps and so on tells its own story."
"The cumulative effect contributes significantly to air pollution."
"So, in contrast to the last debate where I argued strongly that we should emphasise the principle of subsidiarity, this is a matter which is clearly trans-boundary and for both environmental and single market reasons should be dealt with by this Parliament."
"On the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we all get used to industry representatives coming up to us and saying 'don't do that, the time-scale is too short, the technology is not available' ."
"So it has been a pleasure while this directive was passing through Parliament to be lobbied by one company - Honda, to which Mr Goodwill referred - which believes that the standards being proposed by the Commission do not go far enough."
"I realise it has its own reasons for this position."
"It has made the investment."
"It can meet the standards and it wants a competitive advantage over those who have not done the same."
"But is that not what we want overall?"
"Is it not a good thing for manufacturers to be competing on the basis of setting the highest possible environmental standards?"
"I am sorry the committee has not accepted some of the amendments I tabled at an earlier stage."
"I am sorry also that too many companies in my own country have failed to look to the future and want to continue producing dirty, polluting equipment instead of investing in the future and setting the highest standards so that they can compete properly across the world."
"Here in Europe we should be aiming to set these higher standards subject to the available technology."
"I agree with what Mr Goodwill said about chainsaws and the difficulty of reaching those standards insofar as that piece of equipment is concerned."
"But I also want to resist, as Mr Lange said, the Commission's proposals for averaging and banking."
"So far as I am concerned it allows manufacturers to continue to produce engines which do not meet the highest air quality standards and perhaps to even put new ones on the market."
"After all, we are not saying that the changes have to be made now."
"A transition period is built into the proposal to give time for re-equipment."
"Amendment No 18 suggests that some financial support and incentives might be given to manufacturers."
"I look forward to hearing the sound of my neighbour mowing her grass - and indeed my grass too, I hope - knowing that the air will be free from pollution and that the birds will not cough and splutter in the trees around my home."
"Mr President, I wish to express my concern about the Environment Committee's amendment, listed as No 2, which seeks to remove what seemed to be the rather sensible averaging and banking option."
"Now I note that the committee believes itself to be tackling pollution from leisure machinery which, it claims, accounts for a considerable proportion of the output of ozone precursors, especially on Saturday afternoons in the summer months."
"Does the committee understand that a whole range of professional equipment is involved here?"
"We have heard about chainsaws, but there are many other examples."
"Chainsaws are vital for managing woodlands."
"Manufacturers say that if this amendment goes through, they will no longer be able to manufacture these goods."
"The net effect of this, according to the practitioners, would be an adverse effect on the environment, and so I urge the House to reject the amendment."
"However, knowing how enthusiastically this House embraces all or any legislation, no matter how insane or restrictive, perhaps I will not be sorry if the amendment is actually accepted because, given the amount of damage it will do, it will at least show Parliament and the European Union to be the mad legislative machine that it really is."
"Ordinary people have suspected this for many years."
"Perhaps in this case you will prove it to them."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lange and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an exhaustive and comprehensive report."
"I also want to express my gratitude for the amendments tabled."
"We have a basis for achieving a rapid and effective agreement."
"Emissions of pollutants from normal motor vehicles have, of course, been subject to regulations within the European Union for more than three decades."
"As a result, emission levels are now less than 10 per cent of those that existed before we introduced these limits."
"Consequently, the relative importance of other emissions has increased and, at the same time, we can see, as we also can from the Commission' s Auto-Oil programme, that the problems of air quality in the Community require further measures."
"The proposal we are discussing today concerns emissions from engines used in lawn mowers, power saws, leaf collection machines, pumps, generators and similar equipment."
"Approximately 25 million machines of this type are manufactured in the world each year and, even if the statistics are rather unreliable, it seems as if such machines account for approximately 10-15 per cent of total emissions of hydrocarbon within the Community."
"We have already heard this expressed in another way: that one hour' s use of a power saw releases as much hydrocarbon as does driving a modern private car more than 2 000 kilometres."
"These emissions contribute to ozone formation, which is one of the air pollution problems we have still not solved."
"Obviously, we must do something about the emissions from machines of this type."
"Products of the type affected by the proposal are sold to the very largest part of the world market, and more than 90 per cent of them are manufactured by large companies active in this market."
"It has been important to the Commission to bring about a harmonisation of the legislation so as to make it easier to introduce the legislation quickly, provided of course that this can be done in a way that is in keeping with a high level of ambition in environmental terms."
"The only existing legislation in this area is that in the United States."
"We consider that this legislation effectively satisfies the environmental requirements, and it has also been a big influence on the way in which our proposal is designed."
"At the same time, I must alert you to the fact that there exist not only these big companies in the world market, but also companies which are not active in that market."
"Even if these companies account for only a small part of total production, the products are often used in small specialised areas."
"Many of the companies are small and therefore have limited resources for developing the technology needed to comply with the emission limits."
"We have therefore proposed certain special rules exempting these products and companies, and these are the same types of exemption found in the American legislation."
"In my view, the Commission' s proposal is an excellent example of a win-win situation since we are meeting the needs of industry at the same time as having brought about environmental benefits which would not have been possible if industry had needed to divide its resources to take account of different forms of legislation."
"The Commission is able to accept those amendments which enable the Member States to mark products which meet the stage II requirements and to use economic instruments of control to stimulate production and sales of such products even before the limit values become compulsory."
"The Commission is also able in principle to accept an earlier time for introducing stage II but is opposed to introducing stage I any earlier because it would put unreasonable pressure on small manufacturers who do not sell their products on the world market."
"The Commission is also opposed to changing the definition of small manufacturers."
"With regard to the so-called averaging and banking system, we are broadly sympathetic to the questions that have been raised concerning how this is to be used in practice."
"However, we think that it is an important feature of the attempts to harmonise this area and that, if it were abolished, European legislation would differ from American legislation."
"The reason for introducing such a system is that, where certain products are concerned, it is difficult to comply with the stage II values and that the particular products concerned vary from manufacturer to manufacturer."
"In this context, it is important, if the necessary environmental impact is to be achieved, not to exempt products which in reality could meet the requirements."
"Through averaging and banking, we have therefore introduced a flexible system which places the administrative burden on those manufacturers who wish to use it and which has a sound impact upon the environment."
"If, on the other hand, use is made of the facility to exempt certain products, there is a risk of drastically reducing the impact upon the environment because these exemptions are not offset, as is the case with the averaging and banking system."
"We must also be clear that the exempted products we are talking about are equipped exclusively with two-stroke engines, which are the most polluting."
"The Commission therefore wishes to emphasise the importance of retaining this instrument as a part of the legislation and opposes the amendments in question."
"At the same time, I wish to emphasise that what is essential is not the averaging and banking system as such but bringing about the flexibility, harmonisation and environmental benefits provided by the system."
"Exemptions of certain types of equipment should therefore be accepted only after a careful analysis of the consequences, environmental and otherwise."
"For that reason, the Commission is opposed to introducing exemptions right now but is able to accept that this will become a possibility through making use of a committee procedure in the future."
"We also oppose amendments that exclude the use of two-stroke engines for generators and snow-blowers."
"The Commission is prepared to look into the need for further legislation in this area, especially when it comes to particle emissions from two-stroke engines, and wishes to coordinate it with corresponding demands concerning particle emissions from motorcycles and mopeds."
"The Commission is able to accept, or in principle to accept, Amendments 1, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 28 inclusive, together with Amendment 30."
"The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15 and 17, but is open to studying solutions that can bring about flexibility, harmonisation and environmental benefits."
"The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 4, 5, 9, 16 and 29."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Expiry of ECSC Treaty"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the framework proposal before us establishes the succession of the European Community to the ECSC."
"According to the proposal, the net revenue deriving from the investments of the assets of the Coal and Steel Research Fund would constitute revenue in the EU budget."
"This revenue would be earmarked for a specific purpose, namely for financing research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry."
"The Research Fund would be managed by the Commission. Out of the amounts yielded by the Fund, 27.2% would be allocated to the coal sector and 72.8% to the steel sector."
"This breakdown could be modified only by a unanimous decision by the Council."
"Lastly, the proposal states that the administrative expenditure resulting from the liquidation, investment and management of the Research Fund will be covered by the general budget."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this brief summary I have not forgotten our role: quite simply, in its future form, what was the first European Treaty, the first stone set in place for the creation of a united Europe, completely abolishes our institution."
"I am firmly opposed to the approach of the Commission, whose framework proposal provides for Parliament merely to be consulted on matters concerning the fund' s financial and technical guidelines."
"Such a passive role is envisaged for us that it is completely contradictory to the present-day requirements of transparency and accountability, and Parliament would have even less power than it does in budgetary matters."
"In my report, I made a number of demands to the Council: firstly, I asked for the codecision procedure to be applied; secondly, I requested the full budgetisation of the annual interests of the fund as preallocated revenue, through the creation of a specific budget line in the revenue and expenditure side of the budget following the principles of budgetary specificity and neutrality, in line with the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation; thirdly, I requested that the related administrative costs, estimated at around EUR 8.4 million, should be included in this budget line, for otherwise they would have to be met from the general budget."
"In addition, I included the possibility of revising the ratio of appropriations dedicated for coal and steel research respectively, as production will increase as a result of enlargement."
"I have noticed that the resolution tabled before the House still contains a reference to the ECB, which I would ask you to disregard: this is an amendment which I have withdrawn and which has remained in the resolution due to a technical error."
"With regard to the request for the codecision procedure to be applied, I would stress that the Commission' s legislative proposal is based on the Treaties and on the Nice Protocol, which states that the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission after consulting the European Parliament, is to adopt all the necessary provisions for the implementation of this Protocol."
"In practice, Parliament is deprived of any power, despite the fact that the administrative expenditure of the Coal and Steel Fund would have to be met from the general budget."
"This means that Parliament would have to approve this additional expenditure and give discharge to the Fund without having any influence at all over the implementation of its activities."
"My request for the codecision procedure to be applied is not, therefore, a request for a different legal basis to be used, just for reference to be made to a different article."
"Indeed, the Commission' s document refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community, without specifying any particular article, and to the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice, Article 2 - under which the European Parliament has consultation powers only - a Treaty which, however, is not yet in force and which it is highly unlikely will become effective before July 2002."
"Consequently, we are in a very fluid situation which has never occurred in the past and will never occur again, since the ECSC Treaty is the only Treaty to have an expiry date, and I would stress this."
"Moreover, even if the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice does come into force, it only refers to the procedure for approving the package as a whole and makes no mention of the multiannual decisions."
"I therefore propose to request that the codecision procedure be applied, as laid down in Article 2.5.1 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in this I believe and hope I can count on the same support from this House that I received in the Committee on Budgets."
"Then, with regard to the full budgetisation of interests and the possibility of the administrative costs being met from this budget line, Parliament gave its consent in 1998 for all the interests of the Fund to be used for research."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I said before, the situation which we have to address is highly unusual and will certainly never be repeated: we are dealing with the only Treaty to have an expiry date, the succession of the European Community to which depends largely on a Treaty which has not yet been ratified and may well not be ratified in time."
"In my opinion, and in this I am supported by the coordinators of the political groups in the Committee on Budgets, if the line I have taken in the legislative amendments is endorsed by this House, before expressing the European Parliament' s opinion, we should enter into negotiations with the Council and the Commission, seeking to increase our institution' s role."
"Therefore, when we have voted on the legislative amendments, I will ask the presidency to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament' s role can be verified."
"I hope that you will agree with this line of approach."
"Mr President, Mr Turchi deserves our agreement."
"What the Council is offering us is a bit rich."
"In Nice, fundamental democratic values were invoked, and in the same breath the ECSC Treaty is annulled and a research fund established, without the possibility of Parliament having any part in deciding the matter."
"I must say, they really have a nerve!"
"Back to the matter in hand."
"We are, in fact, funeral orators here, for we are burying a treaty which, almost fifty years ago, was the prelude to the European Union, but whose death is a remarkable one."
"It is a death and a rebirth together, for other treaties arose from this one, and at the end of the day, the European Union is based on what it had in mind."
"In this context, I would like to point out that Robert Schuman at the Paris Conference in 1950 - held on 9 May, which is of course our Europe Day - observed that this was the first stage of European federation."
"He did not speak in terms of a coalition of nation states but of a European Federation, showing himself to be much more far-sighted than many of our statesmen and stateswomen and, indeed, than those among us who cannot yet bring themselves to utter the word 'federation'."
"I am just pointing this out; I assume that it will be mentioned in the history books."
"Secondly, this treaty is now to give birth to a research fund."
"Mr Turchi has pointed out that the money is not simply being returned to the Member States, but is being invested in a fund which is in future to finance research into coal and steel."
"This is sensible, but it does create problems."
"One is that Parliament has no control over this fund."
"I mentioned this contradiction at the outset."
"A second is that it creates difficulties for the research framework programme."
"What demarcation is there between the research framework programme, which we decide on democratically, and the Research Fund?"
"Thirdly, what is to happen to the acceding countries?"
"Every one of them wanting to belong to the Research Fund must in fact make an initial contribution to it in order to take any part in it."
"Even that creates more than one class of research in the European Union."
"What I suggest - something which has been taken on board by the Research Committee - is that we should resolve this conflict, and, moreover, in a positive way by, in the course of the next few years, creating from this Research Fund a Research Foundation which would develop alongside the research framework programme. Funds could be paid into it by Member States, but also from private sources - it is above all the private sources I am thinking of - in order to finance research projects other than into coal and steel."
"In the meantime, we are fortunate in having many affluent people who do not know what to do with their money when they reach a certain age, and who make donations."
"Trust funds come into being, and this Foundation can be built up by donations of this sort and so be able to concern itself with subject areas far more wide-ranging than coal and steel."
"I hope that Parliament will agree to this recommendation."
"The consequence would be that the Commission would reconsider and would perhaps present a report on how this could be translated into action."
"We have some experience of this in Germany."
"Parallel with State support for research, we have a research foundation which has functioned well ever since the 1920s and uses a minimum of bureaucracy in putting wind in the sails of German research."
"It would be no bad idea to do that on a European scale."
"Let me finally observe that proposals 1 to 5 in my report are founded on an error."
"I recommend that we should not vote on them."
"They are in any case covered by their inclusion in the Turchi report and in the amendments."
"I therefore recommend that there should be no vote on them."
"I might add that they were not voted on in committee either."
"This really is a mistake."
"Apart from that, I hope that this research fund really will give rise, in the next five to ten years, to a second support for research in the European Union."
"We would thereby be making good this undemocratic error which is, in this day and age, really intolerable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group is going to vote in favour of the Turchi report on the two amended proposals for Council decisions and the communication from the Commission on the financial activities resulting from the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and those resulting from the creation of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"We also agree, like all the other coordinators of the political groups - we have already done so in the Committee on Budgets - with the strategy proposed by the rapporteur."
"From a budgetary point of view, the report proposes certain innovations which, after discussion in our parliamentary committee, have been accepted by all the political groups in that committee."
"In particular, the rapporteur accepted the suggestion to extend the list of advisory bodies by adding the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and other European institutions that are relevant and competent in this field."
"Furthermore, the original conditions on the financial programme which should be presented to explain the activities of the Research Fund were also relaxed."
"The original idea of producing annual financial plans seemed excessively restrictive."
"Basically, however, the Turchi report requests parliamentary control of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and that request is totally coherent with this Parliament' s role."
"We would not be representative of European citizens if we accepted being left out of the control of research funds."
"We in the Committee on Budgets do not question where the ECSC reserves should end up, and neither do we enter into whether or not those companies maintain differential treatment in relation to other strategic sectors."
"We simply ask that co-decision be applied here, which the Council is repeatedly denying us."
"If, as Mr Linkohr said, a European policy on coal and steel is going to continue to exist after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and if that policy is going to be developed largely by means of this Research Fund, the European Parliament must naturally be involved in the processes of management and control of that fund."
"We therefore ask that the income of the fund be included within the general budget of the Union."
"More budgetary control, more parliamentary control, means more transparency and more responsibility."
"We cannot understand why our institution should be left out of such an important area."
"We are therefore voting in favour of the Turchi report and the whole strategy it proposes."
"Mr President, I support the proposals in the Linkohr report."
"The situation in which we are seeing the Commission and Council fail to give Parliament codecision in relation to this Fund and the technical guidelines which will be produced in relation to it is not acceptable and there should be a change of attitude in relation to that."
"It is a great pity that we are moving away from the social policy aspects of these Funds, which provided some relief for companies and, in particular, the workers of companies who were being restructured."
"ISPAT in Cork, Ireland, which was formerly a state company, was bought over some years ago by a private company and is now in liquidation."
"The 400 workers there are in receipt of statutory redundancy - a few thousand pounds for literally a lifetime's work - and yet when government and trade unions sought support from the social policy aspects of this Fund they were refused."
"It is quite extraordinary that we have this situation."
"It is even more extraordinary because ISPAT was a plant which recycled scrapped steel: the objective of the new Research Fund is to improve environmental standards and the impact of the steel industry on the environment, and here was a company that was actually doing that."
"It must be emphasised very strongly that, insofar as this Research Fund has any impact, it must be on safety at work."
"In January this year there was an unfortunate case where a man lost his life in this steel factory."
"The company had failed to invest in fire-fighter training and to provide for escape hatches and this man lost his life as a result of the company's negligence."
"We need to ensure that health and safety regulations are strictly enforced."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome and endorse my colleague, Mr Linkohr's report, particularly his comments on the involvement of Parliament and on the evolution of European Union democratic structures."
"This Treaty, along with the Euratom Treaty, remained outside the treaties establishing the European Union and therefore outside democratic scrutiny and control."
"This is totally unacceptable, particularly at a time when energy installations, both nuclear and non-nuclear, could be a focus of terror attacks."
"Therefore health and safety should be our foremost concern."
"As other colleagues have pointed out, the lack of parliamentary scrutiny has made the Commission's proposals unacceptable and the Greens cannot, therefore, agree to the Commission's proposal on the expenditure for the research fund."
"For how could Parliament's Committee on Budgets discharge the budget without exercising its function to scrutinise the financial management and allocation of funds?"
"Finally, the expiry of the ECSC Treaty after 50 years reminds us that the Euratom Treaty, which has also existed outside the democratic scrutiny and control of this Parliament, is an anomaly as more and more Member States are moving away from nuclear energy and towards new forms of energy and that this anomaly, which happily will end with the Coal and Steel Community, still continues with the Euratom Treaty."
"Mr. President, over the previous decade the European Coal and Steel Community has borrowed money from the markets and in turn has loaned funds for research activity in the coal and steel sector."
"With the Coal and Steel Community now ceasing its operations, it was found during the winding-up proceedings that it still has a surplus of 1.1 billion euros."
"Now, rules of the game are being created to govern how the yield on this money will be used for research activity in the coal and steel sector."
"I regard the setting up of the Research Fund as a positive thing, while on the other hand the ending of funds for use in combating social ills is a bad thing."
"According to the Commission proposal, the management of funds investment activities is being handled and research projects are being prepared by an army of about thirty officials, the maintenance of which will cost three and a half million euros; this gives the impression of an oversized bureaucracy, and therefore Parliament must take another look at the matter when it discusses the questions of releases of liability."
"According to the revisions contained in Mr. Linkohr's report, a special European Research Foundation should be set up; the activity of the Coal and Steel Research Fund should be extended to other areas; and funding from the private sector should also be accepted."
"Mr. Linkohr, this is a dubious proposal."
"We already have the EU's Joint Research Centre and a framework programme for science and research."
"I understand Mr. Linkohr's positive approach to research activity, but we must not create a new bureaucracy."
"It is necessary to set up a Coal and Steel Research Fund, since the ECSC is winding up its operations."
"It is justified that its funds be ploughed back to the sectors from which they were accrued, but the idea of a Research Foundation which would be funded by the money of the EU's taxpayers and of firms will increase the amount of inefficient bureaucracy."
"It would be better for Parliament to demand the codecision procedure for the science and research sector, and to leave all aspects of implementation of the programmes to the Commission."
"We do not question Mr. Linkohr's good will towards science and research."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a treaty expires, but the foundations remain, for the foundation, the ECSC Treaty, has long been part of the structure of the European Union."
"We still, too, have the day of commemoration of 9 May 1950, that day when Robert Schumann presented the brilliant plan of Jean Monnet from the South of France and thereby laid the foundations of what we today call the European work for peace."
"The ECSC Treaty has two successors: the subject of our speeches today and, as regards future coal mining, the aid issues with which we will deal later on."
"I would like to make four brief remarks about the two reports before us."
"First, the procedure proposed here is distinguished by pre-democratic conceptions."
"This was tolerable in 1952, but it is of course no longer acceptable to let the Council alone decide when, in the meantime, the Union's citizens have elected us to be their fifth democratic Parliament."
"We must be clear about that."
"Second, it is right to use the annual revenue of EUR 45 million to support coal and steel research."
"One could say in legal terms that it is an anticipated form of reinforced co-operation among a few."
"It is of course just as right to consider how the committee recommends, on the basis of Mr Linkohr's presentation, to progressively make the fund into a foundation, because then the problem of new members will be easier to solve than if they had to have a share in the old members' contributions."
"Third, the Commission has done the right thing in subordinating the Research Fund to fundamental rights, for the Charter of Fundamental Rights recapitulates the laws in force."
"That means that everything that is to be organised at a European level must be measured against the yardstick of fundamental rights and is bound by them."
"I find it objectionable that the Council, in its deliberations, struck out these three proposals by the Commission and wants to remove the text's reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That constitutes an incredible legal scandal, which we must denounce, and for that reason I call it by its name."
"So I come to my fourth point, and am particularly curious to know how you, Commissioner, will respond to it."
"Your Commission originally rested on a different legal foundation."
"You now refer to the protocol to the Treaty of Nice, and that is pretty breathtaking, as the Treaty of Nice is not expected to enter into force before 23 July 2002."
"On that day, however, the ECSC Treaty ceases to have effect, and we can hardly allow a lawless state of affairs."
"So I would very much like a reply from you as to how you intend to proceed and as to what you intend to propose, so that there will be no state of lawlessness from midnight on 23 July 2002, for then the gripping question would arise of to whom this money, which would then no longer have an owner in law, actually belonged."
"Mr President, I agree with the many speakers who have criticised the lack of democracy in the continued administration of the funds."
"As has been pointed out, the treaty expires on 23 July of next year."
"This treaty formed the basis for the European Union as we know it today."
"It launched the concept of the 'Common Market' and, with the introduction of the High Authority, a common assembly, a special Council of Ministers and a court, those institutions were established which now operate as the Commission, the European Parliament the Council and the Court of Justice."
"I think it is worth mentioning this."
"Where the political objectives are concerned, it has of course to be said that these have been fulfilled in many areas."
"When we debated the future employment of the funds to be administered, it would have been desirable if a larger proportion of the budget could have gone on coal, and I am certain that the Commission will bear this in mind when the future arrangements for the Research Fund are discussed."
"I think there is cause here today for expressing appreciation for the work done in those institutions, bodies and companies which, for 50 years, have been responsible for the ECSC' s activities and, specifically, for the contributions from the Commission and the advisory committee."
"As has been said, more research will take place, and this research will be of benefit to the environment, industry and our electorate in the European Union."
"First of all I thank Parliament's responsible committees and their rapporteurs."
"These proposals are the final product of a long discussion process initiated by the Commission ten years ago."
"The concept proposed by the Commission is to revert the ECSC assets to the remaining Communities upon expiry of the Treaty and to use the resources produced from these assets for the sole purpose of funding research in the sectors related to the steel and coal industry."
"This concept has been discussed with industry, the social partners, the European Parliament and the Member States."
"Eventually all stakeholders endorsed it."
"The Member States have been very closely associated in this discussion, which is completely justified since together they are the owners of the ECSC assets."
"If there were no agreement on the Member States' side these assets would simply revert to them, in line with the principles of international law."
"The European Council has provided us with detailed guidance on the subject, firstly at the Amsterdam European Summit in 1997 and more recently at the Nice intergovernmental conference last year."
"On this latter occasion the Member States adopted a protocol attached to the Nice Treaty which details the arrangements regarding the expiry of this Treaty."
"The Commission is bound to respect the decisions taken in Nice."
"It is in this context that the Commission has to address your amendments."
"You have requested that all three decisions should be adopted through the codecision procedure."
"I regret to say that the Commission cannot accept this request."
"In the case of the framework decision, the decisional procedure has already been agreed upon by the intergovernmental conference in Nice."
"For the two decisions on the financial and research guidelines respectively, the Commission has followed the same line as for other, similar proposals in research policy or regarding our financial regulation."
"For example, the specific programmes of the European Union Research and Development Framework Programme are submitted to Parliament for its opinion, as is the case for the Financial Regulation."
"If the Commission departed from this line it would not be consistent."
"On the other hand, I would like to stress that Parliament's involvement in the proposed arrangements is much stronger than it was under the ECSC Treaty."
"As regards the budgetisation of the funds after the expiry of the Treaty, the Commission agrees that the resources and the expenditure will be incorporated into the general EC budget."
"However, they will consist of earmarked revenue which, according to our Interinstitutional Agreement, is not covered by the financial perspectives."
"Therefore we could not go along with the proposal to simply incorporate the resources and the expenditure into Chapter III, internal policies of the budget, and to delete any reference to earmarked revenue."
"You also suggested that within two years, by 24 July 2004, the Commission should make proposals to enlarge the post-ECSC research fund into a European research foundation covering all research sectors over and above steel and coal."
"Indeed, I am aware that such a foundation has been suggested to us on several occasions."
"I have noticed that the corresponding amendment refers to the draft decision on the research guidelines only."
"From a legal point of view the research guidelines lay down the technical provisions related to the implementation of the research activities, but they cannot cope with an issue of an institutional nature like this one."
"More generally speaking, the proposal to set up a research foundation has already been made to the Commission on several occasions, in particular in the course of the discussion in the Council, but it was rejected."
"The first reason is that the management of the ECSC funds after 23 July 2002 will involve three aspects: firstly, the management of the ECSC commitments existing on that day until their expiry - and in some cases they will continue for 20 years or more; secondly, the financial management of the ECSC assets; and thirdly, the management of the research fund financed from the resources produced from this financial management."
"The three elements are therefore closely interlinked and it is not possible to isolate any one of them."
"Furthermore it is clear that a majority of Member States oppose the implementation of the research fund through a foundation."
"Finally, the very small amount involved in the proposed research fund would not justify the creation of a foundation."
"Therefore the most sensible solution is that the Commission, which has managed all ECSC operations so far, should continue to manage them all."
"Finally, I have taken note with particular interest of your request that environmental considerations should be given priority in the operations of this coal and steel research fund."
"I am pleased to say that current research projects financed under the ECSC Treaty already put much emphasis on cleaner technologies, energy saving and the protection of the environment in both the coal and steel sectors."
"I can assure you that we will continue to attach great importance to these considerations, as well as the issue of safety at work, in the research guidelines which we are now proposing."
"To conclude, let me answer Mr Mombaur's question on the specific issue concerning the legal basis of the three-year Commission proposals."
"As you know, they are based on a protocol annexed to the Nice Treaty and we will now have to reflect on how to deal with the uncertainty surrounding the entry into force of the Treaty."
"The Commission's services are currently exploring this issue and considering alternative scenarios."
"So the answer is that we will have to continue to look at that particular issue."
"Thank you once again for the careful analysis of the Commission proposals, your contributions to this debate and for your attention."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"White paper on reform of European governance"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the White Paper on Reform of European Governance."
"Without further ado I will give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 September, I presented to this House the White Paper on Reform of European Governance."
"Some Members gave me their immediate reactions then, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have started to analyse our proposals."
"Today' s debate is therefore taking place within the context of a wider discussion that is already well under way."
"I would like to make a few preliminary remarks in order to clear up some misunderstandings that have emerged during this debate - and I will, of course, be happy to reply to any further comments you may wish to make during this morning' s discussion."
"As you know, the overriding aim of the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is to renew and reinvigorate the institutional triangle, which operates according to the Community method under the present Treaty."
"This complements and reinforces the Commission' s and my own ongoing commitment to institutional changes that will strengthen the role of the European Parliament."
"Indeed, the Commission has always maintained that this House, which directly represents the people of Europe, should play a central role in the institutional triangle, on an equal footing with the Council, representing the Member States, and the Commission, which represents the European public interest."
"The Commission also supports the work of the Court of Justice to ensure that the European Union is based on the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"We have been pursuing this commitment constantly and consistently."
"It remains our objective to strengthen the legitimacy of this House and thus to consolidate representative democracy."
"It was this same desire to consolidate representative democracy and to ensure that it functions correctly and efficiently that inspired our White Paper on Reform of European Governance."
"In the past few weeks, a number of people have criticised that part of our proposals that seeks to clarify the distinction between the legislative and executive functions. These criticisms are, it seems to me, the result of a misunderstanding."
"I have, for example, heard it said that the Commission is asking for a 'blank cheque' so that it can perform its executive tasks without the legitimate scrutiny of Parliament."
"This is simply not true, as is clear from the White Paper itself."
"What the Commission is suggesting, in fact, is that Parliament, the Council and the Commission should all take a step backwards and start concentrating once again on their institutional tasks."
"The Commission, for its part, should table fewer proposals and target them better, concentrating on its executive function."
"The Council should play its legislative role and not become an executive."
"Parliament has primary responsibilities in monitoring the way policies are implemented and with regard to the Community budget."
"It is thus much more than simply the co-legislator."
"Their aim is to ensure that the existing rules are fully applied at last, and to give Parliament an equal role with the Council. This goes far beyond the power to 'call back' responsibility for executive decisions, on which some Members of this House have focused much attention."
"The 'call-back' option is too limited, in that it merely allows Parliament to partially change the current system - which, we all know, is seriously deficient - but without making good the deficiencies."
"As the White Paper shows, what we really need is a structural change that clarifies who is responsible for putting policy into practice."
"This is vital if we are to know who is to be held answerable for policy implementation. After all, the principle of accountability is an essential part of the way democratic institutions operate."
"The White Paper contends that the Commission should be responsible for implementing policy. It questions the need for the current system of regulatory and management committees."
"The prospect of enlargement makes it all the more urgent to review our commitology."
"However, the paper also states very clearly that the terms and limits of the Commission' s executive role must be laid down in the new legislation that you will discuss on the basis of the Commission' s final proposal."
"It also states that we need a simple legal mechanism to allow Council and Parliament, on an equal footing, to monitor and control the actions of the Executive."
"We are already giving thought to how this mechanism might work, but at this stage, before proposing anything, we want to listen."
"We are expecting a major contribution from the Member States' advisory committees as well as from this House."
"In the White Paper, the Commission has also committed itself to improving its consulting procedures when drawing up policy proposals."
"Some have suggested that this would undermine the role of Parliament."
"I sincerely believe this is not the case, and it is certainly not our intention."
"Quite clearly, we have never proposed - and we never will propose - that Parliament or other democratically elected institutions be replaced by the voluntary civil associations we call 'non-governmental organisations' ."
"These associations play an important role in raising public awareness and integrating our society, and we therefore wish to enjoy a useful relationship with them."
"This relationship, which, I repeat, has absolutely no connection with the role of democratically elected institutions, is, at the moment, unclear and lacking in transparency."
"We therefore need to bring some order to current practice."
"In particular, we need guidelines that make it transparent and more structured than now."
"We also need guidelines on how to use expert advice in formulating public policies."
"All this will improve the way in which the Commission exercises its right of initiative."
"What we want, then, is a more structured and comprehensible system for interacting both with democratically elected local authorities and - in a quite distinct way - with civil society. This will ensure our consultation practices are more open and efficient than at present."
"In any case, the Treaty will remain unchanged, all the decisions will continue to be taken by the appropriate institutions in accordance with the current democratic rules."
"The White Paper thus opens the way for an inter-institutional dialogue on how all the institutions can improve their consultation."
"We do not consider our proposals to be final and we are open to alternative suggestions, provided they are intended to achieve the same results."
"I also understand there is some anxiety about the new forms of regulation proposed in the White Paper."
"Some people fear they might weaken the role of Parliament."
"A closer look at the White Paper should, however, convince you that, like you, the Commission is determined not to diminish but to increase Parliament' s role."
"That is precisely why the White Paper proposes new forms of regulation such as self-regulation, among principles and practices that ensure democratic control."
"The creation of regulatory agencies - which can only take technical decisions on a case-by-case basis - will, of course, need a legislative act."
"Parliament will thus be fully involved in drawing up the rules and the necessary guarantees for adopting such an act."
"We therefore have to find the right balance between the need to lay down essential elements and objectives in European legislation and the need to remain flexible and able to react to rapid social and economic change."
"So the White Paper proposes, for the first time, to involve Parliament in the complex process of introducing the open method of coordination."
"These forms of inter-governmental cooperation on matters that lie on the fringes of Community law must, of necessity, follow a logic that is compatible with the way the institutional triangle works."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main challenge facing the Union today is political."
"The Laeken Summit is approaching, and it should give us a roadmap towards the next IGC."
"Governance is already a part of that debate."
"Changing the way the institutions work (which is the subject of the White Paper) and changing the institutions themselves (which is the subject of the future proposals to amend the Treaty) are obviously two different issues which are, however, closely related."
"That is why I have said that the debate on the options set out in the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is the first phase in the debate on the future of the Union."
"This phase - which will take place within the current legal framework and thus within the restraints this entails - must not be reduced to a mere academic discussion. It must lead to specific proposals for action."
"This is the way to give the citizens of Europe greater confidence in the way the EU works."
"This is essential. We urgently need to win back the trust of our fellow-citizens by applying the present rules correctly and efficiently."
"If we do this, we shall have greater legitimacy when it comes to asking for the necessary Treaty changes later on."
"However, swift action does not mean rushing. We need the kind of mature reflection that is characteristic of this House."
"Clearly, therefore, I do not intend to make proposals until you have drawn up your opinions on the subject."
"The Commission realises that the renewal process the White Paper has begun can be brought to a successful conclusion only if the European Parliament and the Council find the political will to start changing the way we work under the existing Treaty through a collaborative effort."
"I would therefore welcome dialogue of different sorts between the European institutions, if necessary by setting up a joint working group Commission, Parliament and Council working group to look in greater detail at our proposals on governance."
"I would like to thank you, most sincerely, in advance for your commitment and support."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in the 51 years of its existence, since the beginning of the European unification process and since the Robert Schuman Declaration, the European Union can lay claim to a considerable success story."
"In addition to establishing the common market, the single currency and the beginnings of a common foreign and security policy, we have also become an area of peace, justice and security, and in this we are a model for many regions of the world."
"But why is it that our citizens do not see the actions of the various institutions of the European Union in a proper light, as we might expect?"
"Why is it that they so often fail to evoke a positive response?"
"The question that immediately comes to mind is of course why the European Union has such a poor external image and why it is so bad at initiating and implementing its policies."
"These questions of course provide the basis for the Commission's White Paper of 25 July of this year, and we are delighted that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is here to discuss this issue with us for the second time today and has just offered us cooperation within an interinstitutional working party."
"I think this is an excellent suggestion that we should accept promptly and in a constructive spirit."
"Another question is why our public image in the EU Member States is so patchy - I do not wish to say dismal - yet it cannot really be said that the European Union stumbles from one failure to the next."
"I think that a key point here is what the Commission says at the beginning of the White Paper: it should go back to concentrating on its core activities."
"The Commission should not allow itself to get tangled up in a mass of individual proposals and decisions so that in terms of overall policy strategy you cannot see the wood for the trees."
"As I see it, there are a few more questions that we need to consider in some depth before we will find the appropriate answers."
"We certainly recognise that the Commission - and I think that all the institutions need to do this - has subjected and is continuing to subject its actions to a critical review process, after which it can then adopt any changes necessary after discussion with us."
"We also support the Commission's intention to focus on particular areas, but we have to say that the Commission should in that case undertake appropriate work with the press."
"It should make it very clear to the public what European legislation consists of and how it has to be implemented."
"There is also a second important issue here."
"There is no point in the Commission setting up its own substructures in various fields, and I believe that it has in fact largely ceased to do this."
"It should make use of existing public agencies at national, regional and local level to implement Community legislation."
"There is no need for the Commission to arrange direct involvement in every local district and in every medium-sized town."
"Although it is important to keep citizens informed, suitable forms of interaction should be used."
"Framework legislation produced by the Commission should provide for implementation at regional and national level, and it seems to me that the Commission's first proposal in the 25 July White Paper blurs the distinction between the various levels too much."
"So what is needed? Joint regulation?"
"Open coordination?"
"To what extent are European agencies needed?"
"We need to address all these questions in our interinstitutional working party."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am very grateful for today's report."
"We are moving ever closer and our views have more and more in common, but there is still a way to go, and there is one particular point on which I believe that we still differ."
"Firstly, you have today clearly declared your faith in a form of parliamentary democracy that of course has important consequences for our work as a whole, and in particular for the role of 'civil society' ."
"That is another of those rather nebulous concepts rather like 'governance' , but 'governance' is used in contexts where there are no parliamentary democracies or cannot be, as in the case of 'global governance' ."
"In the case of civil society, and I think you were very clear about this, we need to stress that although it has a consultative role and a supporting function, it is the European Parliament and of course also national parliaments that are at the heart of democracy as we know it."
"As you said yourself, they are an expression of the will of the people, and we must insist on that point."
"The key point on which there are still differences between us is the issue of alternative forms of regulation."
"We are not so presumptuous as to think that only Parliament can regulate and that only Parliament can create appropriate regulations, including detailed regulations."
"However, the difficult thing is to decide on the framework, details, a political objective and technical implementation."
"So I must insist that this Parliament is always consulted on this issue and that it is not the Commission that decides, but that there should be a joint decision, a kind of Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"This applies in particular to the issue of call back that we have also been discussing today."
"Let me make this crystal clear: we need both things."
"We need a Parliament call-back procedure in connection with alternative forms of regulation, and we need to reform comitology."
"We have nothing against the reform of comitology proposed in the White Paper, but it is not enough."
"It is necessary if the decision-making process at parliamentary level is to become more democratic, but it is by no means enough."
"Mr President, I hope I have understood you correctly in understanding that you will not present anything to the Laeken European Council unless it has been discussed with this Parliament beforehand and the views of this House have been sought."
"You said this in general terms, and I welcome that, and I can see from your nodding that that is indeed your intention."
"That represents a great step forward compared with the last time, and I would like to thank you very much indeed for that."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to make one more thing clear. This is not about Parliament getting involved in the Commission's executive powers."
"However, we very much reject any attempts on the part of the Commission - and they have been made - to get involved in the legislative process and to arrogate legislative powers to itself."
"This emerges from many sentences and passages in the White Paper, and we must reject this."
"The Commission has executive powers, but legislative competence is a matter for the Parliament and the Council and we absolutely insist on that!"
"Madam President, support for the European Union is decreasing in just about every Member State."
"In the candidate countries, enthusiasm for enlargement is in decline."
"There is little confidence in the European institutions, and the individual citizen can feel that the gap between 'those in Brussels' and 'those of us at home' is extremely large."
"We are all painfully aware of this, and I am very pleased to find such a large measure of self-criticism in the Commission' s White Paper."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the White Paper on Reform of European Governance."
"These changes are an important part of the major work of reform we are facing over the next few years to make the EU more easily accessible, efficient and democratic."
"We are very well disposed towards the start made by the White Paper."
"It points out the problems and shows where changes are required."
"Some of the overarching proposals are entirely in line with what the Liberals have been pressing for over a period of quite a few years."
"There must be an increase in openness and public control."
"The new rules adopted earlier this year in accordance with Article 255 are a first step on the way."
"The decision-making processes must be simplified and made clearer."
"There must be regional, as well as local, involvement at an earlier stage of the decision-making process, and we must discover mechanisms for regular consultation at these levels for it is, after all, regional and local authorities that will be implementing the majority of the EU' s decisions."
"It is also very encouraging that the Commission wishes to work more with framework legislation and strengthen the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"There is little that is very specific in the White Paper, however."
"What, precisely, can be done about this?"
"How is the individual citizen to be made to feel more involved in decision-making?"
"And how, in particular, is the Commission to set about promoting the change of attitude or cultural revolution that has to take place in the Commission if all the reforms are to become a reality?"
"We are aware that many of Mr Kinnock' s proposed reforms have come up against pretty formidable resistance."
"Bureaucracies - and the Commission is a large bureaucracy - change slowly, and many people are impatient to see results."
"We cannot afford to fail."
"The White Paper is now under consideration."
"I hope that many will feel prompted to respond and present their views before part two appears."
"Parliament will produce a report."
"In this connection, it was, moreover, extremely encouraging to hear Mr Prodi propose a joint working party, made up of representatives from the institutions."
"I hope that the Commission, together with Parliament, will also be active in making the White Paper more widely known and not expect people just to find it accidentally on the Internet."
"Thank you for this first part of the White Paper."
"We look forward to seeing part two."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, almost everyone who has spoken has asked - as you yourself have also done - why the EU's image is not what we expect, and why people have ever less faith in it."
"I am always surprised that this is commented on in a wounded tone as if we were misunderstood, as if all this were unfair, and even the answers on this subject have a very paternalistic ring about them."
"They say that it is all about explaining things better to the public and presenting our policies to them more clearly."
"Unlike Mr Swoboda, I do not think that we have really made any progress in this area."
"The concept of good governance is very vague, and people do not really understand what you are promising them."
"You are promising transparency, openness and consultation, but that is not what is at stake here, Mr Prodi."
"The major misunderstanding - I might almost say a misunderstanding of historical proportions - is that this Commission does not have any conception of European democracy."
"It has no conception at all of democracy at supranational level."
"All these paternalistic ideas that you have presented here miss the point that you do not have the courage - and have not had the courage for years - to highlight the democratic deficits of the European Union with sufficient clarity, and to recognise that the Commission must forego some power if such a thing as European democracy is to exist, and that you need to work alongside this Parliament on many key issues, for example on preparing a constitutional process and the main elements of that process."
"No, genuinely tackling the dissatisfaction that exists would mean addressing the state of crisis which exists as regards legitimacy."
"We govern people with regulations because we do not have the courage to say that we have been making laws for years now."
"We call them regulations because the democratic legitimacy of these laws is very fragile, because the separation of powers has not been achieved, because the principle of openness of legislation has not been achieved, because the process of committing the administration to laws has not been achieved, and because instead there is disproportionate scope for discretion, which cannot be reconciled with democratic principles, because we have an irregular administration in many areas, such as the committee structure. It is not regular, there are no staff regulations, there are no clear loyalties, and the processes for appointing staff in these areas are by no means transparent and are easy to manipulate."
"Mr President, you cannot reconcile the idea of a good technocracy with a debate on democracy. Just as there is no such thing as a good dictatorship, there is also no such thing as a good technocracy."
"You will have to address the issue of a European democracy and the position of the Commission in this process."
"Madam President, Mr Prodi, I am very pleased that we have another opportunity today to discuss the White Paper together, because European governance is indeed a pivotal theme and I would like to make it very clear that I believe that the whole future viability of the European Union depends to a large extent on this issue."
"I am bound to agree with Mr Voggenhuber on this point: as far as I am concerned, the issue at the centre of the whole debate around governance is the question of democracy - strengthening democracy and above all strengthening the public's rights, especially under the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I say that because one thing is clear: the very best policy will achieve nothing if it does not impact on the public or if the present state of affairs continues, in which the public believes that what happens in Brussels is far removed from them and their day-to-day concerns."
"I believe, Mr Prodi, that the public quite rightly expects two things: the first is transparency in decision making and the second is clarity as regards political responsibility for decisions."
"I believe that this has to be the focal point from which our joint deliberations start, both for the Commission and of course also for the other institutions."
"I would like to talk about transparency for a moment."
"The White Paper talks about a cumbersome system of almost 700 consultative bodies supporting the Commission."
"If I remember correctly, you yourself picked up this point in the White Paper on the reform of the Commission, and announced back in June that a list of these consultative bodies would be published."
"In the White Paper before us, you promise that details of these bodies will be published by the end of the year."
"I am very much in favour of that."
"This is a question of transparency, and it could help to remove some of the prejudice against the work of the Commission and the other institutions."
"However, publishing details of consultative bodies is one thing, and, as I see it, accepting political responsibility for decisions is quite another."
"A second point in the White Paper that I would like to mention is the 'culture of consultation and dialogue' ."
"I certainly regard that as a very good proposal."
"I think that the Commission on the one hand and the Council and Parliament on the other would be well advised to jointly consider how a new culture of consultation and dialogue can be achieved in terms of greater involvement for civil society."
"I think it would be better if the Commission did not propose a code of conduct on minimum standards for consultation for itself, but rather if we could jointly consider whether there is not some scope for all three institutions to make a joint commitment under an Interinstitutional Agreement."
"You spoke earlier about a dialogue of this kind, about the possibility of setting up a working party, and I am keen to accept that suggestion."
"Madam President, President Prodi, I speak on behalf of the radical Members."
"Mr Prodi, what impression do you think the citizens of Europe can have if, after the attacks on New York and Washington, they have seen Chirac, Blair, Fischer and all the European leaders marching off to Washington, and then the President-in-Office and President Prodi a good last, or nearly so - through no fault of their own, of course - and it even seems on Monday - and that is saying something - even Berlusconi may go?"
"All this in itself reveals a deep-seated problem for as long as we give that impression (and we either give it or not)."
"Therefore, in my opinion (and here I agree with Mr Voggenhuber), the Commission should stop talking so much and risking being misunderstood, especially in view of the Convention - which we hope will be a positive step and will give a boost to this Union. Instead, it should concentrate on crucial problems like representation abroad, which is its own role; it should reassume its role as the driving force behind European integration, something it is losing and may lose forever."
"It should also be daring and make ambitious proposals, such as asking, for instance, what face Europe is showing to the outside world, since we cannot really have ten different faces on such international matters."
"This, then, is my message to you, Mr Prodi: more concrete proposals, stronger proposals, particularly in view of the post-Laeken meeting."
"Madam President, is not the real reason for this glossy brochure and this debate today the fact that the Treaty of Nice is dead?"
"The Irish people saw to that, and you know that if you ask them again they will reject it a second time."
"It is interesting to note that they were the only people who were asked whether or not they wanted the Treaty."
"That is why we have European governance and why you are seeking to push through the institutional changes, choosing a different method."
"The only way that you will achieve the participation in this European project that you want is through consent."
"By that I do not mean the consent of a House like this, but of the ordinary voters in Europe."
"Let us have more referendums in all Member States."
"That is the only way to achieve democratic legitimacy."
"The way to address the democratic deficit is to give people a chance to express their opinions."
"Madam President, there is every reason for developing ideas around the subject of how Europe is to move forward, but there is also a need to know what it is that has to be developed."
"Not everything has to be included, but just those things that cannot better be taken care of at national, local or individual levels, such as the internal market, the common currency, external and internal security, borders, customs and certain environmental issues."
"So far, the proposals relating to democracy are not sufficiently concrete."
"We therefore need cooperation across the institutions in order to move forward."
"We must build upon a clear division of power in which political responsibility can be insisted upon."
"The objectives need to be clarified and the initiatives adapted accordingly."
"It is necessary to be able to hold people to account in a democratic system governed by law, and the prerequisite for this is a common basis of values with clear guidelines."
"An effective European democracy requires discussions across linguistic and national borders, together with an education system and media adapted in the light of these."
"The proposed multi-level democracy can contribute to legitimacy and greater confidence in the institutions, but it must not degenerate into a democracy characterised by bargaining or corporatism and which is so often marked by corruption."
"Cooperation with civil society can make political measures better suited to their purpose, but the role of politicians must be clearly distinguished from civil society."
"We now hope that the Commission will in future comply with the values in the proposal and, faced with each new initiative, ask four questions: Is the measure proportionate, that is to say appropriate to the problems that are to be solved?"
"Is the solution in keeping with European democracy?"
"Is the proposal in line with the EU' s vision and basic principles?"
"Can people be held to account?"
"The more people are involved in European cooperation, the better."
"Do not imagine, however, that legitimacy in itself creates democracy. Rather, it is democracy which creates legitimacy."
"Madam President, Mr Swoboda has clearly formulated the stance of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and has presented a clear proposal to the Commission."
"In my capacity of shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group for the White Paper on Reform of European Governance in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would now like to explain our position from my point of view."
"We welcome your proposal for efficient governance by setting up autonomous agencies, the proposals facilitating co-regulations and self-regulations, the will to consult representatives from specific sectors and the proposal on citizens' and the civil society' s right to information, participation and consultation."
"We object, however, to a deal between the interested sectors and the European Commission without any parliamentary control."
"That is not our idea of democracy."
"We want to decide beforehand, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, when detailed legislation is necessary, when framework legislation suffices and when we can sanction a form of co-regulation or self-regulation."
"It goes without saying that in many cases, it will be useful to delegate technical details to the comitology procedure, provided they are technical details, and the political component has been extracted completely."
"Furthermore, the call-back mechanism, to which the European Parliament can refer, should this prove necessary, must be regulated in advance."
"It is possible that the deployment of the social actors in the case of self- and co-regulation is a much more efficient way of working."
"Not only should we consult the sectors about the decision-making process."
"In certain cases, even social non-profit organisations could also play a role in the implementation."
"But if the sectors are allocated certain tasks, the monitoring role by the European Parliament must always remain clear, and the European Commission must carry its responsibility."
"Clarity always remains condition No 1."
"The dialogue with social actors must be concrete and yield results, and must not become a talk shop which thrives on repetition."
"For what the citizen and the PSE Group want is result: democratic control and recognisable political priority by the European government."
"At present, decision-making in the EU is too diffuse and too sluggish, which leads to alienation."
"The PSE Group, also in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is now offering to break this cycle."
"That is possible and should be done before the Laeken Summit."
"The Commission should then reach an agreement with the European Parliament which can be implemented by the end of the Spanish Presidency."
"The ball is now back in the court of the Commission."
"We count on you, Mr Prodi."
"Madam President, President Prodi, at first sight the White Paper might seem tied down to its essentially technical content."
"If, instead, we consider the reasons why it was drawn up - reasons that should have been given greater coverage in the text itself - we realise that it has a very solid and highly relevant political core."
"In the G8 debate here in this House, I pointed out that, while globalisation is proceeding apace in all fields, it is hard for it to involve politics, which thus remains inadequate and slow compared with what is happening in other sectors."
"This is undoubtedly one of the basic reasons for citizens' widespread mistrust of institutions at all levels, from local to European to worldwide."
"Besides, what do the people of Seattle, Gothenburg or Genoa, leaving aside the more extreme positions, want of politics, if not to control globalisation?"
"What answer are we in a position to give, today, apart from our own inadequacy?"
"The European Union project is, of course, still the only concrete example that can meet these demands, but it has not yet expressed its democratic potential to the full."
"The White Paper is thus a valuable instrument, provided Parliament shows the same willingness to specify those substantial organisational reforms that will enable it to reconstruct and revive European democratic citizenship."
"Madam President, I would like to move the debate on to ground which has not been much talked about and to the remarks Mr Prodi made in his introductory statement about the regional element."
"I would like to do so particularly from the standpoint of my own constituency, Scotland, but not only from that point of view."
"It is interesting to note, when you reflect on Scotland, that about 80% of the competences exercisable by the Scottish Parliament concern domains in which the European Union has a shared competence."
"When we make laws here, the Scottish Parliament and government are bound by them and have to put them into effect; that is quite right and it is the same across other similar regions."
"But sometimes it can produce ridiculous results, for example when environmental laws are too detailed to allow sensible local discretion in adapting common principles to local situations."
"The water problems of the Island of Islay or the Glen of Strathspey are hardly comparable with those of the Rhine basin."
"A one-size-fits-all approach to water law can have absurd results, for example in respect of the Scotch malt whisky industry, despite its established environmental friendliness over 200 years."
"The White Paper says, as did Commissioner Prodi this morning, that the Commission will consult regional and local government early in the policy-formation process and will seek to legislate so that local knowledge is effectively deployed in the implementation process."
"That is quite right and very welcome, though it was a pity he only devoted one sentence in his opening speech to it."
"Many of us had expected that the White Paper would contain a far stronger statement, especially in relation to the so-called partner regions exercising their own constitutional powers of legislation."
"Europe will fail to regain or retain the affections of the citizens of the Union - and that includes the people in Scotland and our counterparts in many similar lands such as Catalonia, Flanders, Wales, Galicia, the Basque country - unless the regional and local governments with whom people there finally identify are fully respected partners in the governance of Europe."
"We are the same size and population as many of the existing Member States, the same as many of the adjoining States and we are bigger than quite a few of them."
"It is often said that big, important regions of large countries do better in the Union than small Member States."
"I doubt it and nothing in the White Paper has yet persuaded me that is true."
"Mr Prodi, your paper on European governance is an important milestone, but on a technical issue my colleague, Mr Dell'Alba, pointed out to you in a previous debate that, while the word 'governance' may be very common in the English and French languages, in Italian political culture it is to some extent opaque."
"If that is the case, it may well be that we have to get the message through in each of the EU languages."
"Perhaps attention could be paid to those languages in which the word 'gouvernance' , first used by Sir John Fortescue in England in the fifteenth century when the English political class spoke French, is less clearly understood than in English and French."
"We ought to look at that point."
"Reading your paper, it struck me that in a sense the first stage of recovery in the building of Europe is for the Commission itself to recover its self-confidence and poise."
"I pay credit to you Mr Prodi, and to your colleagues Mr Patten, Mr Barnier and others, for having succeeded in restoring this poise after the resignation of your predecessors."
"However, as you know - and you drew attention to this in your speech - there is concern in Parliament about giving respect to the institutional triangle."
"There are fears about your use of civil society, which we all know really means consulting lobby groups."
"The most effective lobby groups do their job, which is not to represent society at large - that is this elected Parliament's duty - but to represent their own vested interest."
"So I am afraid the fact that you drew attention to this concern has not allayed our fears and we will continue to insist that it is we, the elected Members of this House, who represent the interests of society at large and you should not set up groups meeting directly with the Commission, evolving policy and then handing it down to us to rubber-stamp."
"That is not our understanding of parliamentary democracy."
"I am sorry that Mr Farage has left."
"He obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy."
"He wants a referendum every five minutes."
"It is absurd that in my own country, once the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, summons up the courage to confront the Chancellor, Mr Brown, we will be asked in a referendum to decide whether or not to join the single currency."
"Can you imagine our financial and economic future being discussed in public houses up and down the country?"
"This is a job that elected politicians should do."
"As regards your paper, the European Parliament and the Commission should be partners in the construction of Europe, not rivals."
"If we remember the days of Jacques Delors, your predecessor, he had a clear programme, a vision: the 1992 single market."
"He set out a time frame and turned that vision into reality."
"We must do the same with enlargement and constitutional reform, widening and deepening."
"Lastly, Mr Prodi, will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU?"
"I know you have already met the new Polish leader, but the public at large needs to be able to see in practice that we have a vision of a fully complete, united Europe and that you, Parliament and the Council are working together to achieve this."
"Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Beazley on his excellent speech."
"Mr Prodi, I would like to thank you for making it clear here today that you will not be bringing forward any proposals to amend the constitutional position unless you have the consent of the European Parliament and without a clear vote by Parliament as a directly elected body."
"That is more than we have been told so far, and I am delighted about that."
"At the same time I would like to thank you for trying to clear up any misunderstandings."
"However, there are some things I am still not clear about."
"I hope that you will be able to deal with those in your reply as well."
"You said that fewer proposals would be emanating from the Commission."
"There can be no objection to that, as long as you can tell us how this new vacuum is to be filled, because you know - just as my fellow Members and I do - that the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice stipulated very clearly the legislative role of the European Parliament and the roles of the Commission and the Council."
"If you are now telling us that the Commission will be making fewer proposals, one of the implications of that is that you will be presenting framework proposals."
"If that is what you intend, Mr Prodi, then you will have to ensure that there is a call-back mechanism and a comitology reform."
"This is not just a drawback of the present system, as you just suggested, but rather an absolute necessity in the context of the ideas or proposals that you have for the future."
"No one in this House wants framework proposals, but if you want them, then you must make sure they go hand in hand with proper democratic measures that do not adversely affect Parliament's rights."
"You say that you want more modern measures such as voluntary commitments; no one in this House wants that."
"However, if you still want that, you will have to protect democratic rights within the European Union and ensure that there is an Interinstitutional Agreement that leaves the rights of Parliament, the Council and the Commission intact."
"You also said that the White Paper opens up the way for an interinstitutional debate."
"It certainly does that."
"But I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to state clearly before us that you do not intend to go back on the Treaties of Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam, and that you share the views of the majority of the Members of this House about what I have said."
"Not a single piece of legislation should go through without the European Parliament being involved. There should not be any voluntary agreements and there should not be any framework agreements unless democracy is protected."
"Mr President, I have three points."
"Firstly, this paper is slightly more modest than its title suggests."
"When you first titillated us with the prospect of presenting this White Paper over a year ago, we were all very excited at the idea of having some great constitutional blueprint."
"In fact, you have very wisely produced a paper on good administration rather than a blueprint on governance or constitutional government as a whole, and that pragmatic and focused approach has much to commend it."
"Secondly, I very much welcome your announcement today that you wish to establish an interinstitutional working party."
"I have always felt it was a mistake to try to treat governance as if it were a piece of legislation which was first presented by the Commission and then batted between the institutions."
"This is not normal legislation, but an intensely political debate that requires an intensely political and cooperative approach between the institutions."
"My final point is one that you touch upon quite politely in the White Paper."
"I will be less polite: we can do as much as we like at European level - in Strasbourg and Brussels - to improve administration and governance and make our decisions more comprehensible, legitimate and understandable."
"However, as long as national political institutions and national political cultures remain frozen in the 19th-century mould and pretend that either the EU does not exist or is some far-off spaceship, we will never make great advances in this honourable enterprise of improving governance."
"Governance can only be built brick by brick from the bottom, from the ground floor, from our nations and regions."
"That is where we should all start."
"Mr President, I think that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has expressed Parliament' s concerns in her main point."
"Parliament does not think it is a bad idea for the Commission to set up all the consultative bodies it wants, that it should meet with all the non-governmental organisations it wishes, that it should consult everyone through the Internet, or that it should talk to all citizens on a personal level."
"This seems like a good idea to us and we should probably do the same thing."
"What worries us is the second part of the White Paper; or to be more precise, the proposals to improve Community regulations."
"The Treaties of the European Union - as Mrs Roth-Behrendt pointed out - are based upon the principle of the division of powers."
"Article 6 of the Treaty makes reference to national constitutional principles."
"All national legislations are based upon the principle of the division of powers, by which legislative prerogatives are under the control of bodies elected by the people."
"In the case of the European institutions there are two such bodies: the Parliament, directly elected, and the Council, comprised of Ministers responsible to their own national Parliaments."
"The role of the Commission of the European Communities is to be the Community executive, and the role of Parliament is to support and strengthen the claims of the Commission to be an authentic Community executive."
"However, if the Commission enters into the regulatory framework and endeavours to take on competences or powers that have been conferred or that should be conferred on the European Parliament by the Treaties, in these areas - as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Roth-Behrendt have stated - the Commission must remain in close contact with Parliament."
"To be precise, Mr Prodi' s suggestion that the Commission could present the Laeken European Council with proposals on improving Community regulations, without waiting for Parliament to deliver its opinion, seems to me to be a dangerous thing."
"I hope that the Commission, before putting forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council on improving Community regulations, enters into close contact with Parliament with the aim of listening to our point of view and in this way conveying to the Laeken European Council the Parliament' s concerns and interests in this matter."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the Commission's White Paper on European Governance in some ways comes at a bad time, and in other ways at a good one."
"It is a bad time because any debate on the internal structure of the European Union and the way it functions, and on the legitimacy of the European Union itself will at present be dwarfed by the need to protect Europe's citizens against international terror and violence, with more arcane subjects being overshadowed."
"However, it is also a good time for the same reason, by which I mean that the European Union has an opportunity at this precise moment to respond to people's fundamental need for safety within the EU, and for legitimacy combined with an ability to act outside its own borders."
"Transparent, open and accountable decision making can accordingly help to make Europe's citizens more aware and at the same time conscious of the added value Europe can bring."
"Your White Paper is a contribution to that added value, Mr Prodi."
"Against this background, I particularly welcome those proposals in the Commission's White Paper that aim for a systematic dialogue at regional and local level, at a more active role for the Committee of the Regions, and the proposal that from 2002 onwards there should be an annual report on the implementation of the Amsterdam Protocol on Subsidiarity and Proportionality."
"Subsidiarity and the Community method are not after all mutually exclusive."
"The division of tasks between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament must be clear, just as a balance between the Member States, the regions and the EU needs to be struck under their institutional triangle."
"It is obvious that the European Parliament and the national parliaments should play a central role in the public debate on the future of Europe."
"That is why I find it amazing that in its White Paper the Commission does not consider the idea of a convention as requested in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"An open convention which works out the decision-making basis for the Council, with representatives from the Commission and from national parliaments and from the European Parliament, together with representatives of the Member States and the candidate countries and from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee sitting as observers, is an appropriate and essential forum for bringing the Union closer to its citizens and achieving transparency, and it must supplement and support internal reforms."
"Mr President, it is indeed a shame that Mr Farage is no longer with us."
"He obviously has learned nothing about public policy if he thinks that we can run the whole of Europe on a series of referendums."
"This discussion is probably one of the most important that we will have before enlargement."
"It is neither as hallowed nor as sexy as an IGC, but until we get the actual delivery mechanisms of democracy and public policy right, the boring, tedious administrative detail, then we do democracy an injustice."
"We have to reform our governmental processes."
"There are many proposals in the White Paper that cause nobody any problems, but issues like co-regulation and the delivery of public policy by external agencies do cause problems."
"We cannot afford not to address these issues."
"Our institutional overload, as we all know, is quite dramatic in the Union and with enlargement it will get worse."
"We need to ensure, however, that when we reform those processes - whether it be issues concerning co-regulation or external agencies - we see democratic control as the key factor, democratic control in a democratic framework. This will not be a resource-free exercise."
"It will also require significant person power to deliver it, at least in the early stages."
"The Commission has to face this."
"It will not be a cost-cutting exercise by any means."
"Finally, if there is a criticism that has to be made of the Commission, and I am glad it has realised the importance of this criticism, it is that its White Paper did not address the role of Parliament."
"Now I realise that the Commission might be sensitive about doing so, in case it brings the wrath of this House down on it."
"That represented a fundamental failure in the early discussions between the Commission and Parliament."
"So I am very pleased that this has now been rectified and we can move forward to produce the sort of governmental structure which we require."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in support of what Mrs Stenzel has just said, I would like to add that it is never too late and never too soon to hold a debate of this kind."
"At this particular point I believe that the events of recent weeks have brought more seriousness into politics and that the public is making greater demands on politicians."
"This provides an opportunity to contribute to a renaissance of political matters and also to a significant renaissance of cooperation between leaders, those in positions of responsibility and the representatives of the people, that is to say the parliaments."
"That is how we should approach this debate."
"When you say in the introduction to your paper that the public feels greater distrust, more apathy and more powerlessness, I agree with you. However, in your second paragraph you say that this problem is acknowledged by national parliaments and governments alike, and that it is particularly acute at the level of the European Union."
"I have a problem with this wording."
"We - Parliament and the Commission - are acting as if national governments and national parliaments were on one side and the European Union on the other."
"The public is particularly aware of this contradiction, with the Member States and the European institutions apparently on opposite sides."
"We need to make it clear for once and all that we collectively are the European Union!"
"There is virtually no such thing as a European decision without the participation of the national governments, but there are a good many European decisions without codecision by the European Parliament."
"Codecision leads to transparency and openness and facilitates dialogue, and is therefore the starting point for a clear separation of powers and allocation of tasks."
"Your report talks about leadership."
"I wish to call for more Commission initiatives based not so much on a minimum Council consensus but rather on what Europe needs."
"It talks about cooperation with the regions, yet in the Belgian Presidency's proposal for the convention the Commission of the Regions is not even a full member of that convention."
"Yet that is what we need."
"We talk about more information, but our actions are limited to giving the Member States more money for their information work, while the Member States do not give their own parliaments sufficient information about their decisions in the Council, and therefore exclude their citizens from European decision making."
"By way of conclusion, I wish to call for proposals for sanctions in the case of misuse of EU funds, because that leads to distrust about the institutions on the part of the public."
"Wherever the EU is involved, that must be made evident, from the European institutions themselves to the smallest local council."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, the White Paper calls on Parliament to enhance its role in feeding the views of its electors into the political debate."
"But this means, Mr Prodi, and I must stress this point, that in the twenty-first century democracy will continue to be associated with the word 'parliamentary' and not with the word 'consultative' ."
"We do not want to go back to the pre-parliamentary democracy era and the White Paper should not be associated with that idea."
"Framework legislation and the use of other regulatory mechanisms can only be something positive if they are linked with appropriate guarantees."
"In the case of framework legislation the effect of these guarantees should be to ensure that the power to define is not handed over to some agency or other, but is reserved to Parliament."
"It is not only Parliament's privilege to insist on this, it is Parliament's duty."
"You say that you want more transparency and consultation, but whom are you excluding and whom are you including?"
"Associations and non-governmental organisations that can pay for expertise will be better off than those who do not have these resources."
"And in practice some people will surely be better able to make their voice heard than others."
"Will this not mean that we are making the playing field for the various parts of civil society in the European Union still more uneven?"
"I believe in a level playing field for the various actors and institutions."
"I believe that the White Paper is not clear enough about this."
"I call on you to make this clear, because I have to say that when it comes to financial market legislation, the implementation of the Commission's financial action plan tends to give one co-legislator a stronger position than the other co-legislator, the European Parliament."
"That does not seem a very promising road to go down."
"This imbalance needs to be rectified, and at the next intergovernmental conference Article 202 of course needs to be amended by creating a call-back right."
"However, the Commission could also demonstrate its good will at this stage and make it clear that it does not intend to surreptitiously change the balance between the institutions."
"We, as a parliament, owe that much to society, because parliamentary activity does not just mean controlling things, but also shaping them."
"I do not want to leave that task to a variety of committees chaired by people without any democratic legitimacy and who are not co-elected by Parliament, as is the case in the United States for example."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am very glad that you are being very tolerant on time this morning."
"It is a well-known saying that 'if you don't know where you're going, then you won't get there' ."
"First and foremost we need to be very clear in Europe about what we are doing; our aim is not to create a single State of Europe, but to have a union of sovereign States that are cooperating when and where necessary."
"Unlike Mr Farage, I believe there are many occasions when it is important that we cooperate in Europe."
"Equally we all know that the none of the institutions are held in high regard."
"That is not because they are bad."
"It is because they are complex, remote and not understood."
"Frankly, we will continue to face the same problem, whatever specific reforms we come up with, if they remain obscure, complex and unexplained."
"I say to my colleagues in this Chamber that one thing the people of Europe do not understand is why we oscillate between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"It is up to us to listen to some of the problems that people express to us."
"I was disappointed in President Prodi's White Paper."
"He virtually neglected the role of the ombudsman."
"After all, the ombudsman is in the front line of dealing with the complaints and concerns of citizens."
"I was also disappointed last month by the response of Commissioner de Palacio, whom I normally respect, who was quite dismissive about the code of good administrative behaviour."
"We must make sure that we have good administration."
"That means that we must have an enforceable code common to all of the institutions."
"The Committee on Petitions has asked the Ombudsman to report to us on the problems that citizens are presenting to him."
"We want to listen to citizens."
"I extend an invitation to President Prodi, if he really wants to understand what the citizens of Europe are finding difficult with the European institutions, European rules and regulations, to give up one afternoon and come along to the Petitions Committee to listen to what citizens are saying."
"He would certainly have an afternoon's entertainment hearing what people really think."
"In brief, what I am saying is this: listen to people; listen to those who know what they are talking about; be clear about your objectives; and then explain yourselves in clear and simple language."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi for having clarified in his speech certain points which, from a reading of the White Paper, could have given rise to misunderstandings."
"Today' s debate on governance is important because it aims at encouraging broader discussion on the meaning of European integration and its goals."
"It complements the debate on the future of the Union, and thus it should concentrate on the connection between general objectives and the concrete actions seen by the citizens."
"As we all know, what really lies at the basis of this deliberation is the realisation that the long-term credibility of European integration is undermined by the lack of mutual recognition between public structures and civil society."
"We must therefore involve numerous sections and expressions of civil society to the greatest extent possible, because in this way the citizens will also be playing a greater part in policy- and decision-making. This is an important task that the institutions of the European Union must all make a real effort to carry out together."
"To this end, I would recall that during the last Parliamentary term the European Parliament itself, and in particular the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, recognised the need to initiate and formalise a dialogue with civil society."
"To do this an effort must be made to identify the most representative groups, so as to avoid an excess of consultations and overlapping."
"We therefore ask for an Interinstitutional Agreement on this, which will lead to a division of labour and, at the same time, collaboration between Commission, Parliament and Council."
"A second important point, which has already been hinted at, is the need to simplify Community legislative procedures, distinguishing, that is, between political and legislative decisions, which must not become detailed technical instruments; and distinguishing between Parliament' s prerogatives and competences that belong to the executive."
"Something that you, Mr Prodi, have mentioned is therefore important: the need to specify a call-back mechanism for secondary legislation which can safeguard and strengthen the role of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, as the last speaker from my group and as coordinator of the group, it falls to me to try and summarise the positions that have been expressed."
"Listening to the debate I feel that our group's views are very much the centre of gravity of Parliament as a whole on this question."
"If I could try and summarise this in two sentences, it would be to say 'yes' to better information, consultation and more systematic consultation of non-governmental actors and so on, but 'no' to delegating decisions to a sort of cosy deal between the Commission and industry."
"We would say 'yes' to delegating technical and implementing legislation, but only if there is an adequate procedure to bring things back if they go wrong."
"In other words, there is considerable sympathy in Parliament for much of what the Commission intends to achieve in its White Paper but genuine concern about what might be the real effects of some of the proposals therein."
"Let me take the example that has come up recently of the self-regulation on pedestrian safety, where the Commission has made a deal with the automobile industry."
"This is a very good deal in many ways and a lot of what has been agreed is a good step forward for pedestrians' safety."
"But what if it were not very good?"
"What if it contained some outrageous things that would not be acceptable to this Parliament representing the citizens?"
"We represent all the citizens of Europe not just those who are organised in NGOs."
"What if the automobile industry subsequently does not apply the deal, because it is not enshrined in legislation?"
"What can we do to remedy the situation if one or the other manufacturer does not respect the deal?"
"That is the sort of concern that is being expressed in this Parliament."
"I welcome the commitment of the Commission only to take this forward once Parliament has given its view and to explore these issues further in an inter-institutional working party."
"That is a very welcome development."
"I am very glad you gave that undertaking today and I look forward to taking this matter further."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased with today' s debate, since it has shown that our positions are converging, we agree on most points and, most importantly, we share working methods."
"I would say we have laid the groundwork so that, together, we can conclude this period of reforms under the present legislation."
"A common concern has also emerged which, even though it was not part of today' s debate, is closely associated with it: a common concern for a Europe that should speak with a single voice and interpret people' s growing anxieties about the institutions."
"In this respect, many criticisms have been raised concerning the plurality of the voices of Europe, a plurality which Europe took to Washington after the tragedy."
"Let us not confuse this with plurality of presence."
"The content was absolutely identical: in Washington we spoke with a single voice, and after the discussions we left President Bush with the European position, which was a highly operational position, with specific areas for collaboration in justice and internal affairs and the financial problem of money recycling, fields in which we proposed lines of action on which Europe should come together."
"I believe part of the citizens' anxieties derive from the complexity of our working procedures and the fact that they are hard to understand, problems that the White Paper attempts to address - partially, at least - through enhancements to the democratic system and transparency and through greater efficiency and speed in decision-making, while fully respecting or rather increasing the prerogatives of Parliament."
"I confirm, then, at the end of this short debate, that we intend to arrive at a clarification of our respective functions, but no one questions the role of the European Parliament and the Council in holding political control over the Commission' s executive work."
"Not only do we acknowledge this control but - I recall what Mr Corbett said in the last speech - we believe this control is absolutely essential."
"I also confirm - and here I must confess that the misunderstanding arose from a mistake by the Commission, something it expressed poorly - that the Commission does not intend to take any decision, either prior to Laeken or at any other time, without first listening to Parliament."
"We had insisted on the need for decisions to be made quickly, but in every case we must first consult Parliament fully."
"Anyway, today we have made some progress."
"Mrs Kauffmann and others have made some extremely useful suggestions."
"The idea of organising a joint Parliament-Council-Commission working party to establish a code of institutional behaviour in the framework of the existing rules is a path I think we should explore."
"We need to be clear about this aim; that is, we must set up a procedure to streamline the decision-making process, because, I repeat, it is slow and poorly understood."
"The new procedure must make it unnecessary to systematically resort to committee procedures without detracting at all from the powers of Parliament and the Council, but rather enhancing their political responsibility."
"The Commission is willing to examine this path."
"With all honesty and without any ulterior motive, I wonder whether the Council will be willing to do so; we, in any case, are."
"For this to happen, I ask Parliament to be politically determined and insist on this approach."
"This discussion also prepares for the debate on the future of Europe, which is to be organised by the Convention."
"If we start out now in the directions outlined here, I believe it will help us later to find the institutionally most appropriate solutions."
"Today there was one point of formal divergence that we should discuss in the area we have described, which is the procedure termed 'call-back' ."
"I believe the current committee system is a distortion of democracy, which is why we have looked at it critically."
"It mixes legislative and executive functions, without there being any real political control."
"The call-back proposal apparently improves the situation, but in fact it makes the system more confusing because it makes it more difficult to separate our functions and see the difference between them."
"I think this is an area we should focus on in a future meeting of the bodies we have proposed, in order to clear up this point: we must work together for a system in which the Commission executes and the European Parliament and the Council exercise political control before measures are adopted."
"If there is always this possibility of call-back, Parliament will obviously end up taking on a strictly executive function."
"I repeat: let us work on it, because not only am I being perfectly sincere but it is absolutely clear in my mind that this is an extremely delicate point of democratic control."
"We should use the same methodology with the agency problem."
"The Commission believes that in some cases they are necessary, but we must not multiply them ad infinitum."
"We should turn to them only when there are highly complex technical roles and they have an autonomy of their own."
"We agree with you that democratic control over these agencies is needed, control that should take three forms: when the agency is set up, and Parliament plays a fundamental part in this decision together with the Council; when its budget is checked, and it is Parliament that checks it; and when a check is made on the workings of the Commission, which is the body responsible for these agencies."
"This, then, is the Commission' s position."
"Two other points have emerged here: these are points included in the White Paper or connected with it although not actually included in it."
"They are participation by civil society and the problem of participation by the regions and autonomous local areas."
"I believe it is essential for the regions and local administrations to play an active role, and in the forthcoming Convention too."
"If we really define Europe as the Europe of subsidiarity, we must be consistent to some degree at least, and on this I have no reservations at all."
"On the problem of consulting with civil society, if we read the White Paper carefully there is no expropriation of Parliamentary, democratically elected bodies."
"On the contrary, there is a different discourse: whereas now civil society is consulted privately and indirectly, we are proposing that such consultation should be transparent and in the open, so that everyone can see where particular ideas and positions arose or where certain suggestions come from."
"This, to me, is a step forward."
"I understand I may have created concern because, when faced with such clear evidence of a process, Parliament may say, 'But that is our job!'"
"I can assure you that we have the opposite objective: we must consult civil society because it is useful for us and it is useful for you, but consulting means consulting; it is absolutely unacceptable that this should be seen as an alternative form of decision-making that could be confused with or compared to that of Parliament."
"I say this quite clearly because you will never have heard the Commission proposing, for instance, to bring civil society into the Convention in a role involving decision-making aspects."
"I do think, however, that transparent, clear consultation is a step forward that we really should take."
"I repeat: it has never been our intention to attribute an institutional or constitutional role to consultations with civil society, even though we are concerned to understand what is happening within that society, and thus to keep our eyes open and ears tuned, ever alert to whatever is happening."
"In a certain sense it is like the suggestion made by Mr Perry to attend the Committee on Petitions, in order to keep our eyes open."
"In any case, please remember that the Commission' s proposal has two objectives: first, a more parliamentary democracy; and secondly, a more efficient democracy."
"In the discussion on the relationship with Parliament, the call-back problem lies in this context."
"We want a more parliamentary democracy in which the role of Parliament is clear and precise, but also more efficient, one in which the executive role is not continually called into debate by procedures."
"I believe this could be clarified with the proposal of working together on these issues over the coming months. This may be beneficial and lead to progress in future in our way of working, under existing legislation for the time being, in expectation of the great institutional reform process which should start after the Laeken Summit."
"Thank you very much, Mr Prodi."
"If I may, I would like to add that with the Charter of Fundamental Rights we had very positive experience of involving civil society, but we did not have any Members in the Convention."
"Mr President, there has probably been a translation problem."
"I shall repeat the sentence which is the key to the latter part of my speech: we have never said - and I confirm this today - that civil society can play a decision-making role."
"That is reserved for Parliament and the Council - our institutions."
"We simply want consultation to take place more transparently, more clearly and more comprehensively."
"Thank you very much, Mr Prodi!"
"I think that really does make things clearer."
"A few Members were actually somewhat surprised, but I think that we all know what was meant now."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you now have the floor."
"As you know, if the Commission President wishes to add anything else, we will of course be happy to agree to that."
"Asylum and immigration"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and a great honour for me, in my capacity as chairman of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, to report to you on the work which we are doing on asylum and immigration, but also to inform you of the initiatives planned by the presidency for the coming weeks."
"The fact that I have been given the opportunity to speak on this particular day is all the more appropriate given that your Parliament is being called to vote on two reports, which are of a very high quality and which are particularly important for our future work in the Justice and Home Affairs Council: Mr Pirker's report on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy and Mr Evans's report on the Commission communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for persons granted asylum."
"When I introduced the presidency' s programme to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I mentioned the fact that our presidency had made these two areas - asylum on the one hand and immigration on the other - a priority, and said that there were several reasons for our doing so."
"First of all, I note, echoing my European colleagues, that the public have a genuine expectation here, a legitimate expectation, and it is our duty as politicians to respond to this urgently, of course, but also, I believe, to provide some reassurance."
"This implies managing migratory flows effectively and it also means that we need to take measures to prevent the asylum procedure from being abused."
"We have to recognise that there is widespread concern about the upward trend in the figures which we are seeing more or less everywhere in Europe."
"Secondly, the evaluation of Tampere, which will be carried out at the end of our presidency, should allow us to identify the areas in which progress has been made in the field of justice and home affairs, but also to propose measures with a view to remedying any shortcomings revealed as soon as possible, and we have to admit that there are some."
"To avoid the regrettable consequences of these shortcomings, we think that it is necessary to relaunch the political process at the Laeken Summit."
"To do this we will need to resolve several issues which, though in the guise of technical difficulties, are in fact the subject of political dispute."
"I must in addition thank Commissioner Vitorino who always puts forward very sensible proposals, but has also proven to be very open-minded in his concern to make progress and who is willing for his proposals to be challenged if this moves the issue forward at European level."
"With these two points in mind, the Belgian Presidency wanted even now to create the necessary political impetus to provoke a substantial debate on issues such as establishing a common and balanced immigration policy and setting up a European asylum system."
"In other words, we are working with our colleagues in this presidency to ensure that the Council of Ministers is once again able to play its role as architect of the European edifice and thus focus on settling a number of political disputes."
"Its legislative work should lead to visible operational activity and cooperation on practical matters between the law enforcement agencies and the immigration authorities."
"I have to tell you that for my part I am convinced that a common European approach, based on solidarity, is the only viable approach to these matters."
"We should remember that for a long time many Member States believed that they could tackle this problem on their own."
"They have to admit, however, that the results have not come up to expectations."
"Let me take asylum first of all."
"The right to asylum is, of course, a priority for all of our countries."
"Europe' s dignity would not, I believe, allow otherwise."
"We still wish to see the Geneva Convention applied in full and compliance with it reaffirmed."
"It seems to me that in this respect our countries have nothing to be ashamed of."
"The efforts which we are making to meet our international commitments cannot be challenged or called into question."
"However, it is also apparent to all of us that large numbers of people are using this procedure as a way of entering the territory of our Member States for reasons other than those laid down in the Geneva Convention."
"I therefore think that we ought to consider what action we might take in the light of these two observations."
"In just a few months, the Commission has completed a significant task, producing the proposals for directives which we now need to examine and which concern: harmonising the conditions for the reception of applicants for asylum; harmonising the procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status; revising the Dublin Convention; harmonising refugee status and, finally, subsidiary forms of protection."
"Although we need to see all of these texts as part of an indissociable whole, there is good reason to be self-disciplined about the order in which we examine them."
"Bearing in mind the timetable set by the Commission scoreboard and the Commission communication on asylum which provides for a two-stage approach, the presidency has decided to focus as a priority on the three following directives: harmonising the common minimum conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers; the Community instrument to succeed the Dublin Convention and harmonising procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"The first two documents have had their first reading, which I might describe as encouraging and from which it was clear that Member States wish to make progress in this field as quickly as possible."
"As far as harmonising procedures is concerned, I organised an exploratory debate at political level during the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 September, based on specific questions which required specific answers."
"For example, the Member States had to give their views on how the directive should be structured, and in particular on the criteria to be used to distinguish between admissible applications and manifestly unfounded ones, the number of bodies involved in assessing these criteria, their nature, the appeals mechanism making it possible to refer the matter to them, and how precise to make the qualitative standards for the decisions and the authorities making those decisions."
"It was proposed to ministers that the same working method be used to examine the directive on family reunification."
"This exercise made it possible - although it is certainly difficult - to make some progress, particularly on defining the notion of the nuclear family."
"It is clear that the diversity of the national systems in place in our Member States means that any moves to bring them into line with each other will indisputably and necessarily require significant efforts to be made on all sides."
"None of the Member States can hope that the uniform system will correspond to what it has been familiar with at home."
"Above and beyond these national differences, however, I did note with satisfaction that we are all working towards the same objective: establishing procedures which are fast and effective - this is very important - but which of course respect the rights of refugee applicants."
"The presidency will, moreover, continue to make every effort, working in collaboration with the Commission, to meet this objective as soon as possible."
"In addition, I welcome the recommendations made in Mr Evans' s report, which seek to flesh out the provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions with a view to implementing this common European asylum regime."
"Our response to this issue has to be a joint one, based on solidarity."
"Europe needs to toe the same political line where admitting refugees onto its territory is concerned and needs to act together to stamp out the underground activity which this provokes."
"If we ascertain that procedures are being abused, we obviously need to find solutions to situations of human distress."
"Europe needs to work along these lines to improve conflict prevention, and also, through its cooperation programmes, to establish better living conditions throughout the world."
"Organising information campaigns in the countries of origin should make it possible to combat illegal immigration, but also to thwart the plans of criminal organisations which are at the origin of this modern form of slavery and which do not hesitate to have recourse to any means, in particular violence and terror, to achieve their ends."
"Exploiting these flows of refugee applicants for criminal purposes is an additional concern for the whole of the European Union and it is our duty to respond to this by adopting emergency measures to act as a deterrent."
"It was with this in mind that we raised the issue of trafficking in human beings during the open debate with the accession countries at the Council meeting of 28 September and decided on measures to take in this field by adopting operational conclusions."
"This package of measures can and must range from measures to protect victims to police-related measures such as reinforcing checks at Europe' s current and future external borders, while safeguarding the possibility for those who are fleeing persecution to find asylum in our countries."
"Finally I agree that we need to draw a clear distinction in the measures which we put in place between asylum-seekers looking for international protection and those who want to enter the European Union for other reasons, which are incidentally sometimes legitimate."
"At a time of openness and mobility, this is certainly not about transforming Europe into a 'fortress' but about reflecting on how we can manage immigration in a transparent, realistic and balanced way."
"I do not have any ready-made answers to these questions; instead we have elected to organise - in collaboration with the European Parliament and the Commission - a European Conference on Migration, which will be held on 16 and 17 October in Brussels. I should like, Mr President, to take advantage of the fact that this event will soon be upon us to thank you for the considerable support which this Parliament has given us in organising this meeting, which is, I believe, unprecedented, and which will bring together expert observers of these phenomena which are a real problem in today's society."
"The Brussels hemicycle of the European Parliament is a prestigious venue and symbolises the fruitful collaboration between the European institutions, which, on an issue such as immigration, is quite obviously vital."
"In addition, I hope that many Members of this Parliament will attend the conference, thus fostering a rich and productive debate."
"This event, to which we will have the honour of welcoming ministers, senior officials from international institutions and politicians, will provide an opportunity to hold an in-depth political debate on migratory flows, the issues at stake and their consequences."
"It will allow us to get a general idea of the way in which migratory flows should be addressed within a common European policy."
"At the conference the floor will be open for contributions from all participants which should help us - and this is our political objective - to make some essential choices at the Laeken European Summit."
"The idea is to reinject momentum into the search for a global approach towards migration."
"Furthermore, we are all aware that these questions of principle conceal a certain tendency for people to exploit the phenomenon for economic and even political ends and we cannot ignore this."
"Significant migratory flows head for Europe, either abusing the procedures which were designed for completely different purposes or, even, entering Europe completely illegally, which is of course just as reprehensible."
"A large number of these illegal migrants also benefit from criminal help, both abroad and in our own countries."
"Obviously these abuses of the system sustain those who try to exploit the migratory phenomena for economic purposes or to achieve political aims and we cannot remain indifferent to this."
"I was pleased to see that the issues which will be debated during the conference are the same as those raised in Mr Pirker' s report on immigration."
"How can we manage migratory flows successfully?"
"How can we draw a clear distinction between asylum and immigration?"
"What impact would relaxing the conditions governing the entry of immigrants have on illegal immigration?"
"Do our Member States need a new wave of economic migration?"
"Is this need felt to the same extent across the Union?"
"What consequences does the fight against the shadow economy have for illegal immigration?"
"What are the undesirable consequences of the migration of qualified labour and how can we counter them?"
"In which areas do we work together with the countries of origin?"
"What instruments can we put in place to establish a genuine policy of integration?"
"The presidency believes that this is not simply a question of resolving technical issues: everyone knows that these matters are highly charged, economically and politically, but also at a purely human level."
"We need to take account of many phenomena, including underground ones, which makes establishing a common immigration policy particularly complex, especially from an economic point of view."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before drawing to a close, I should like to remind you of our desire to work in full institutional collaboration with you, the European Parliament, within the rules laid down in the treaties, in the hope that together we will be able to take further steps towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice which will benefit Europe and the people of Europe."
"This is already the third time that I have had the pleasure of addressing you."
"This is not an onerous task; it is an honour, and I am delighted to be able to work together with you."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, today' s debate has come at a crucial time: we are two weeks away from the European Conference on Migration, which has been organised by the Belgian Presidency, and two months from the Laeken European Council, which is tasked with carrying out the mid-term review of the Tampere agenda."
"Both of these should be essential stages in the process of drawing up common immigration and asylum policies."
"In adopting the two resolutions which are on the table today, whose quality and balance should be saluted - and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Pirker and Mr Evans - the European Parliament will, I am sure, express clear and forceful priorities in good time."
"Since the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union has been confronted with a new political agenda in the fields of justice and home affairs."
"Thanks in particular to the determination of the Belgian Presidency, it has so far been facing up to this remarkably well."
"The European Council of 21 September sent out a very clear message to us."
"We should adopt as a matter of urgency the measures necessary to reinforce the internal security of our Member States and their nationals while making the fight against terrorism a priority."
"At the same time, however, the European Council of 21 September emphasised that neither should we stop working on other issues set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam and thus towards our objective of safeguarding and developing an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I am delighted that the European Council underlined the need to strike a political balance between stepping up police and judicial cooperation with a view to combating crime and terrorism, on the one hand, and establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, that is protecting the fundamental rights of the public, on the other."
"I have always stressed in these debates here with the European Parliament, but also with the Council, that we need common immigration and asylum policies more than ever."
"The relevance of both the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions has been repeatedly reaffirmed."
"I am convinced that the public genuinely expects, and even demands, the addition of European value to national policies whose limitations are becoming ever more apparent, whether they be security policies or policies to protect civil liberties."
"To achieve an objective of this kind and identify the European added value which we can bring to national policies, I believe that we should take into account both the security imperatives and the respect for values which are the common defining values of our European Union, including the freedom of movement which is guaranteed by the Schengen Agreement."
"The Council has asked the Commission to evaluate its proposals on asylum and immigration in the light of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America."
"We have already buckled down to this task."
"The political will to move forward on these matters which was reaffirmed by both the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council should give us new hope."
"As the Minister emphasised just now, it is true that the slow progress and the difficulties which we have encountered on certain dossiers could cast serious doubt on our ability to take substantial decisions within the very strict deadlines in the Commission timetable."
"This new momentum should benefit all aspects of our cooperation on justice and home affairs, provided that the Member States recognise that it is impossible to have European legislation which is a faithful copy of fifteen national laws and that they will each have to give some ground in the search for a common solution from which they will all benefit."
"As far as the substance of today' s debate is concerned, I note that there is broad convergence between the Commission' s views and those of Parliament, as reflected in the two excellent reports by Mr Pirker and Mr Evans."
"Whether they concern the principles on which the common European asylum regime should be based or the components of a coherent approach towards the migration phenomenon, we do not have any difficulty in going along with most of your recommendations."
"In some cases we have even anticipated them and several of your requests are already taken into account in our proposals on the legal status of long-term residents and on admission for employment purposes, or again in our communication of last July which followed on from the one of November 2000 and went into more detail on some of the guidelines."
"In other cases, we are preparing to follow them up, for example in the communications which I intend to propose to the Commission for adoption in the coming months, the first of which concerns the fight against illegal immigration and the second repatriation policies and external border checks."
"I also share your concern about the need to develop practical proposals to build a real partnership between the Union and the countries of origin and transit."
"We have started work on this by setting up a high-level group, whose mandate will be extended thanks to the implementation of a new budgetary instrument with the strong backing of the European Parliament."
"Nevertheless, people may feel that this work and the implementation of the action plans adopted by the Council are not bearing sufficient fruit."
"I therefore agree that in general we should recognise the significance of these migratory phenomena by giving them greater consideration when we are formulating the European Union' s external policy."
"To a certain extent we have to recognise that we are hostages of the division between the second and third pillars, which is completely unjustified because on closer inspection the very close links between the European Union' s development and migration policies become apparent."
"I should also insist on the fact that a genuine European policy on immigration and asylum will not exist - over and above the legislative framework - unless national policies also converge in practice and in pursuit of common objectives."
"This, then, is the aim of the Commission's proposed open coordination policy, which is similar to the method already used - incidentally with success - for employment, for example."
"An open coordination method of this kind seems to me to have the advantages of flexibility and transparency as well as respecting subsidiarity, while providing a powerful incentive to harmonise legislation and national practice - even spontaneously I would say - and being a good indicator of the areas in which Community intervention is really essential."
"It requires the Member States to agree in the Council on common guidelines proposed to them by the Commission after a broad process of consultation."
"They will then have to implement them at national level using the national legislative and administrative means at their disposal."
"The Member States will be invited to draw up national reports every year in which they will have to take stock of the progress which they have made in implementing these common guidelines."
"The Commission's summary of these reports should make it possible to identify, on a case-by-case basis, the weak points in the essential convergence exercise and, if necessary, to refine and add to the common guidelines."
"In July, we put forward a first set of guidelines concerning the management of migratory flows, the admission of economic migrants, partnership with third countries and the integration of third-country nationals into our societies."
"Further proposals will be made for asylum when we publish the first report on the follow-up to our communication of November 2000, which will be sent to you in the coming months."
"The Commission hopes that the Council and the European Council will give these new guidelines their blessing so that implementation can start immediately and a first complete round be conducted in the course of next year."
"In conclusion, I should like to come back to some fundamental principles which in the current circumstances it is, more than ever, important to reiterate."
"First of all, asylum is a right which is guaranteed and regulated by international instruments and confirmed by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"No one will dispute the fact that it may be abused."
"And it is up to us, as politicians, to put a stop to this, not by further weakening the position of those who really need international protection, but - and this is a better bet - by aligning the procedures and criteria applied at national level and making them more effective."
"The introduction, in the medium term, of a one-stop shop, which you support in your resolution, would, therefore, unquestionably be a significant step forward in my opinion."
"In the meantime, it would seem to be essential to endeavour to improve the quality of initial decisions, as recommended in our proposal on asylum procedures."
"Secondly, we cannot deny that immigration occurs."
"It would be eminently regrettable if some people were to take advantage of current feeling to revert to a policy of slogans."
"Slogans will not resolve the immigration problem."
"Above all, name-calling, which is an accessory of racist and xenophobic sentiment, must be avoided."
"What we do have is a genuine policy to manage migratory flows at both national and European level."
"And the terms of reference would appear to me to be obvious."
"Legal immigration channels need to be clearly identified and the possibilities which they represent need to be quantified, not on the basis of the unexpected whims and uncertainties of the economic cycle, but on the basis of a realistic assessment of our societies' structural needs and how many immigrants they would be able to accommodate."
"A dialogue with the countries of departure is necessary and it is important to take into account the different types of immigration with which we are faced."
"Some immigrants are long-term and are expected to stay in their host societies for good, but others - and there are increasing numbers of them - are part of cyclical migration flows, which implies - and this should be encouraged - that they will maintain a stronger link with their region of origin."
"Finally, the credibility of a proactive immigration policy must be consolidated by an effective campaign to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings which is associated with it."
"We should give serious thought to creating a major new Community instrument, alongside those which are designed to combat exclusion, which might, for example, address the specific problem of integrating immigrants."
"Today, cultural pluralism is becoming a characteristic of our societies, particularly in urban areas, which raises very serious challenges."
"It may inject real dynamism into society if it is based on genuine mutual tolerance."
"But it may also be the source of confrontation and social division."
"This mutual tolerance and respect will be one of the keys to social balance and cultural progress in our European societies."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament for helping to enrich this debate, which I sincerely hope will be brought to a positive conclusion."
"Through the impetus given by the Belgian Presidency and with the personal commitment of the Minister, Mr Duquesne - whom I should like to thank and whose efforts to reach compromises in a true European spirit I can vouch for - I hope that Laeken will constitute a major step towards establishing the area of freedom, security and justice."
"This is not a dream; it is a reality which the public is increasingly keen to experience."
"Mr President, as we all know, the last few weeks have been very difficult and we will continue to live in challenging times for many months and years ahead."
"Therefore, this is a very important debate, and I am delighted that not just the Commissioner but the President-in-Office, Mr Duquesne, are here in person, recognising the importance of this issue."
"As Mr Duquesne implied in his contribution, if the recent happenings have shown us anything, it is that we cannot turn a blind eye to events around the world and hope that they will go away."
"The problems of people wanting asylum, the situation and the plight of the people of poor and troubled countries all over the world are our concerns and they manifest themselves on our doorsteps, on our shores and in our parliaments if we do not address them."
"At one level these problems manifest themselves as debates in this and other parliamentary assemblies."
"At the worst level we find bodies in lorries at Dover, on the beaches of Spain and other countries."
"This is the plight of desperate people seeking desperate measures to start a new life."
"But these people are not resorting to this sort of action lightly; they are escaping from terror, war, torture, rape, vile regimes posing as governments and, of course, in some cases, poverty."
"So there can be no more appropriate time for countries to be working together to confront these humanitarian challenges."
"I congratulate the EU Heads of Government for having brought asylum into the Community competence and setting a progressive agenda at Tampere."
"I congratulate the Commission on these proposals, which have started the debate on how a common asylum policy should be shaped."
"In my report before Parliament today I am asking for a common and wider interpretation of the Geneva Convention of 1951, a clearer definition of who should be recognised as a refugee and one that is consistent across all 15 countries."
"Let us also harmonise the treatment asylum seekers receive; let us establish Europe-wide common standards and then make sure that we enforce them."
"If we adopt this report we can start to establish minimum basic rights, as the Minister and the Commissioner have said, for refugees, for access to welfare, housing, education, health care - things that we in the privileged world take for granted."
"In recent years it sometimes seemed that EU countries were competing to become the least attractive to potential asylum seekers."
"Common, Europe-wide standards will inevitably create a more balanced distribution of asylum claims throughout the EU."
"That must help my city, London, and all the major cities of Europe."
"It must also stop countries being able to lower their standards, which will be good for asylum seekers, who can be more confident of a fair hearing."
"That is something of which we should be proud and not ashamed."
"In addition and crucially, Europe must collectively do far more to address the root causes that lead to people seeking asylum and becoming refugees."
"Governments must make concerted efforts to help create peace in the troubled parts of the world, however difficult, and to increase aid to developing countries - strong measures that in time will work towards countering the pressures that force people to migrate."
"It is for the same reasons that we must press ahead with the enlargement of the European Union."
"As Commissioner Verheugen said recently, we cannot ask ourselves the question: can we afford enlargement of the European Union?"
"Instead we should put the question: can we afford not to enlarge the European Union?"
"In committee, many centre-right and right-wing Members voted against my report in whole or in part."
"I challenge those Members who are sitting opposite today, not to just give a prepared speech or ignore what I am saying now but to tell us why they are opposing certain parts of it and why they want to diminish the rights of a fair appeal, which is Amendments Nos 6 and 8 by Mr Schmitt."
"How will this make the system better?"
"To those - perhaps the British Conservatives - who will vote against this report in its entirety, if they were here I would ask them to explain to Parliament how we can address the current asylum situation in Europe without Europe-wide policies."
"They must recognise that this is a global issue and one that cannot be dealt with on an individual basis in each country."
"I sympathise with Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Green Group, but I cannot support them."
"We could support them in another report dealing with those escaping from hunger or environmental disasters."
"However, this is a compassionate report, one with which we can be satisfied but not complacent."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank my colleagues from my own and other groups for their help and support for this report and for their cooperation."
"I thank my own group staff for their hard work and I pay tribute to the NGOs that have contributed valuable ideas."
"I commend the report to Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to start with I would like to say, Mr Duquesne, that I regard it as very positive that you are taking part in this debate yourself as the Minister for the Interior and are not being represented by your Minister for European Affairs."
"We have noted that you have a good grasp of the issue and are interested in really achieving something here."
"If this can be done in conjunction with the Commission and Parliament, then we can look forward to some real progress."
"The European Union is now clearly taking things seriously and is for the first time making a genuine attempt at a systematic approach toward migration policy. We have accordingly clearly established that there are three groups of migrants requiring different measures and different legal arrangements, and that there are also issues which cut across the three groups."
"Let us look at the three groups first."
"We have economic migrants, and my report addresses how they are received in the individual Member States, depending on the facilities and needs of those Member States."
"Then we have asylum-seekers, who are recognised as refugees under the Geneva Convention."
"I firmly believe that the Geneva Convention should on no account be watered down or departed from, either by extending or by diluting the grounds for granting refugee status."
"What we need are swift and safe decisions for refugees and European minimum standards for the procedures involved."
"The third group covers war refugees, that is refugees who come to us temporarily and need a different kind of help again."
"Issues which cut across the three groups include family reunification and combating trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration."
"That means that we have a complicated system before us."
"My report is concerned exclusively with immigration on economic grounds and was adopted with six votes against, so that it achieved a fairly broad consensus."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks for the extremely constructive and positive cooperation between the wide variety of political groups in this House, which made it possible to create a broad basis for a new approach to immigration into the European Union on economic grounds."
"What is at stake here is controlling the immigration of workers and maintaining social, economic and political stability in the European Union."
"However, in view of the events of 11 September, we also need increased vigilance when it comes to the hospitality, aid and freedoms offered by the Union, to make sure that these are not abused by individual elements to breach the security of Europe's citizens or of the world as a whole."
"It should also be clear to us, as I stated at the beginning of my report, that we cannot counter demographic trends by means of immigration alone, but that the only really good and meaningful approach is, of course, an enhanced education policy and family policy."
"It must also be clear that we have to give the integration of third country nationals living here legally higher priority than new immigration."
"What are the core issues in my report?"
"It is evident that when it comes to immigration the European Union can only take on certain tasks and that a great deal must remain a matter for the Member States."
"Another issue that must remain in the hands of the Member States is what workers and how many workers should be given residence permits and work permits for a particular Member State, depending on that State's needs and facilities."
"It is also evident that if integration is to be successful, factors such as the availability of suitable work and housing must be taken into account."
"Another important issue for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is what we expect of immigrants, by which I mean their willingness to integrate and to recognise the Community of values."
"Conversely, there should also be an obligation on the Member States to provide an appropriate level of support for integration."
"At EU level it is a question of determining conditions for the entry and residence of these migrants and drawing up a coherent system for granting visas, of regulating the ability of third country nationals to move between Member States and the introduction of measures to counter trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration, and also cooperation and information campaigns in and with the countries of origin."
"The committee in principle welcomes all the Commission's proposals on the immigration of workers."
"I hope that the broad consensus that we achieved in committee will be repeated when we vote here in the plenary."
". (NL) Mr President, when the report by Mr Evans was being written, we were still oblivious to the tragedy of 11 September."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Defence Policy to this report, however, a number of recommendations were made which, precisely against the backdrop of 11 September, are very pertinent indeed."
"This Parliament has often called for a common and unambiguous policy on evaluating whether or not countries are safe."
"It is not acceptable that some Member States should declare countries safe, therefore refuse to receive refugees and asylum seekers, while other countries do."
"The security services and embassies of our Member States should join forces in this respect."
"Since 1992, there has been a structure in place, comprising CIREA and the High Level Working Group, but they do not operate well together."
"And they certainly do not work well with the Member States."
"We are therefore asking for an improved and transparent structure to be introduced in this field."
"In addition, in a Union with open borders, discrepancies in admissions policy are untenable, and a joint foreign policy is also totally inappropriate if we fail to sing from the same hymn sheet."
"In that sense, I would make an urgent appeal to the Commission to do something about this."
"Afghanistan is, in fact, a good illustration of how things can work."
"A second observation pertains to the aid to those countries that receive large groups of refugees."
"We should provide far more aid to those countries, and especially the UNHCR."
"In principle, it is better for people who flee to remain in the vicinity of their own country, so that they can return quickly."
"But they do need support."
"However, the UNHCR resources have been cut back drastically by the European Commission, and we believe that this situation should be improved promptly."
"Moreover, we also believe that people should receive more education in the camps so that they do not fall victim to radicalism and crime."
"Finally, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to point at the need to be a lot more pro-active in terms of conflict prevention."
"It would be of great benefit to us if we could close the ranks better in the EU in this respect."
"In that way, conflict could be prevented."
"The recommendations made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have been adopted unanimously in the committee."
"It would be unfortunate, in my opinion, if Mr Evans' report would lead to diversity."
"I would like to dare him to work closely with the other groups in order to reach unanimity."
"We would then, at least, be able to support his report."
"Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy welcomes the Commission' s communication on Community immigration policy and unanimously saw fit to recommend the inclusion of a set of measures based on five premises:"
"One, to take on Europe' s shared historic responsibility for this problem."
"Two, to consider immigration as a positive and irreversible phenomenon."
"Three, to consider the harmony that should exist between the free movement of capital and goods on the one hand, and the free movement of persons on the other."
"Four, the application of the whole range of human rights in political, social, economic and cultural terms to all people, including, of course, immigrants."
"Five, to take advantage of the opportunity for the European Union to play a positive role in eliminating international inequalities, strengthening the economic links of countries in which immigration originates."
"From this, again briefly, the Committee drew five main conclusions:"
"One, to have an EU immigration policy based upon human rights and mutual benefit with countries from which migratory flows originate."
"Two, to promote multiculturalism, respect and positive regard for the contribution immigrants bring to our society and economic development."
"Three, to speed up the legalisation of all immigrants and in this way fight against the mafias involved in the illegal trafficking of people."
"Four, to have a coordinated common European foreign policy that serves as an instrument for eliminating poverty in countries in which immigration originates."
"Consequently, five, to increase the B7-667 budget line and its effectiveness with the aim of limiting illegal immigration and strengthening democracy and the rule of law, in addition to launching integrated development aid programmes."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"(ES) Mr President, I think the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have given us two very good speeches."
"The President-in-Office of the Council told us in all honesty that Council is at present rather confused about asylum and immigration policies."
"Commissioner Vitorino, who has undertaken magnificent work in this field, told us that, in the area of immigration and asylum, Community institutions currently find themselves caught between two stools: that is to say between the first and the third pillars."
"That is to say that immigration and asylum policies, at this moment in time, appear on the one hand in the Treaty establishing the European Community and yet there is no clear Community competence in the field of asylum and immigration."
"Also, it is very strange that the Heads of State and Government in Tampere made grandiose statements about a European immigration policy, but we do not know if these will actually be converted into Community Law."
"We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, have highlighted the inconsistencies between the declarations by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere and the commitments given in the Community Treaties."
"I think that the Conference on immigration, which the President-in-Office of the Council informed us would take place within the next two weeks and at which I think there will be significant participation by Members of the European Parliament, will be an opportunity for the three Community institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - to formulate, or to at least start to formulate, the need to give a Community legal basis to the problem of immigration, for, in this case, we have a genuine Community-wide problem."
"With regard to immigration we cannot talk of subsidiarity."
"The problem of immigration is, at this moment, common to all European countries, and Commissioner Vitorino, in carrying out the work on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy, is moving in the right direction."
"I think that the Commission' s strategy is suitable, but we need to strengthen it from the constitutional angle with the appropriate modification of the Community Treaties."
"Mr President, as the Vienna Monitoring Centre showed last year, there is a need for a progressive policy and leadership in both areas under debate today."
"I welcome the recognition that a restrictive approach to immigration has not worked and is counter-productive."
"We have only to look at the increase in trafficking and the difficulty in recruiting skilled professionals to demonstrate this."
"It is obvious that there is work available in the European Union for people from third countries."
"In many of our countries they are crucial to agricultural production and many major companies employ third-country nationals in senior executive posts."
"Yet there is still an attitude around that we are doing such people a favour by allowing them to enter the EU to support our economy and our social security system."
"Let us be honest: we want them to help maintain our standard of living."
"If we get it right, it should be a mutual benefit."
"As part of that, we need to ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals, not least in the workplace."
"The implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination is also crucial."
"Why work here, if you then face racism and xenophobia?"
"Business tells us that recruitment needs to be made easier and more flexible at all skill levels."
"This calls into question work permits attached to a particular job and company."
"Unfortunately, the lead committee did not take this on board."
"Recruitment is also hampered by restrictions on family reunion, business tells us."
"My political group has tabled amendments relating to that human factor. The working rights of partners also need to be improved."
"We have also to recognise the fact that some migrants will wish to stay and settle. This is important in terms of continuity and stability for individuals, society and business."
"A constant turnover is problematic on many levels and we have to remember that we are human beings, not cogs in an economic wheel."
"Mr President, immigration over recent decades, which is measurable in millions, has taken place largely despite the arrangements put in place by the Member States."
"In most cases, the hallmark of national policies on immigration is a lack of vision and creativity and a fear of domination by foreign influences."
"However, there is now no disputing that immigration has taken place on a substantial scale and that immigration will and must take place in future."
"The detailed reasons for this are to be found in the 28 pages of the Commission communication."
"The Commission's shift to an active immigration policy is very much to be welcomed."
"The Commission recognises that pressures to migrate will continue and that regulated immigration can be advantageous for the EU, for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin."
"This change in policy does, however, also mean that decisions will have to be taken and that it is not sufficient merely to administer immigration by hiding behind general political guidelines, or, in the words of the rapporteur, on the basis of the cornerstones of immigration policy."
"That would mean that we would never achieve a Community migration policy as laid down in the Tampere conclusions. Instead, immigration would remain a national responsibility for Member States, with all their shortcomings, with just a basic framework at Community level."
"Overall, a long-term immigration policy can reduce the pressure from illegal immigration, from trafficking in human beings, from illegal employment and from the economic exploitation of migrants."
"Third country nationals must be given the same rights as EU citizens, as the Commission assumes in its communication, and they should be able to contribute to the local economy through their work; only in this way will the sort of integration we want take place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy with common standards and a common status for recognised asylum-seekers has provoked a much-needed debate and you deliberately arranged for an open debate at the outset, Commissioner Vitorino."
"Various possible scenarios have been presented and the possibilities for a common procedure and common principles have been investigated."
"I deeply regret that in contrast to the Pirker report it was not possible to achieve a broad compromise in committee."
"Unfortunately, in the case of the Evans report, instead of a reasonable consensus emerging, it was ideology that won the day."
"It is intended that both the grounds on which asylum is granted and the procedures involved should be extended across Europe. This is despite the fact, as you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that at present some 90% of asylum-seekers apply for asylum on purely economic grounds and are therefore rejected, and despite the fact that the present checking procedures can take up to eight years."
"I am sure that it is only possible to agree to extensions of this kind if you have totally lost sight of the position in your own country."
"What will the impact on us be if arrangements of the kind Mr Evans is presenting to us today become a reality, and if in future persecution by non-State agents and gender-related persecution are recognised?"
"In practice this would amount to granting an unlimited right of residence in the EU to most families in the Islamic world."
"Why is that?"
"Let me explain."
"No one would deny that in every Islamic country there are fundamentalist groups that use Islam to discriminate against women's rights, from the perspective of our system of values."
"Which means that any woman in an Islamic State can make a valid claim of persecution by non-State groups."
"If this were to be recognised in the EU, she would then be able to bring her entire family to join her."
"So the question we need to ask here is this: do we want to and are we able here in Europe to solve the problems of the Islamic world and the problems of the Islamic view of women?"
"I have a clear answer to that: no!"
"And the picture is even clearer now that we are all aware of the problems and risks that have arisen over the last few weeks."
"At the same time, Mr Evans, contrary to his original statement, wishes to abolish the concept of a safe third country and thus burden the in any case protracted procedures with additional checks."
"My own conclusion is therefore that in its present form the Evans report is irresponsible."
"It gives the Member States sufficient arguments for refusing to give us the right of codecision when further EU reforms in this area are being considered."
"It is evident that there is a majority in this House that is not yet mature enough to be given such responsibility."
"Mr Evans, if you are advocating an extension of the right of asylum here, then I would ask you what steps your own party, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, has taken in this direction in recent years?"
"I can tell you that it has certainly not dealt with things in this way."
"That is because it does not have the support of a majority of the population for such steps and Labour could otherwise expect to be voted out."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to be quite explicit about this, and it is obvious in any case: if we try to standardise every detail of the right of asylum across Europe in future, we will be unable to achieve agreement on this in the Council of Ministers."
"That is why I am specifically asking you and advising you to limit harmonisation to the necessary minimum standards."
"Mr President, Europe is experiencing tension between low population growth and a genuine demand for manpower in the labour market, on the one hand, and a population that is distrustful of immigration on the other."
"Faced with this situation, political decision-makers can react in two ways: either by exploiting people' s fears to their own advantage, at least in the short term, or by attempting to manage the different aspects of immigration as best they can, bravely explaining the reasons for this phenomenon, the benefits it brings our societies, its more problematic aspects and the policies that are necessary."
"We have seen some examples of this first approach right here this very morning."
"In its two communications, the Commission has, fortunately, positioned itself firmly in the second camp, and we can only congratulate the Commissioner for this and show our approval."
"It has also achieved this - I would like to stress - in accordance with the agreements and mandates reached at the European Council in Tampere."
"Whilst I fully subscribe to everything my friend and colleague, Mr Evans, said about asylum, I would like to focus during the short speaking time available to me on the communication on immigration and the report."
"Both define a clear path to be followed."
"The communication discusses, and the report also focuses on, the external and internal causes of immigration, the need for codevelopment policies and a new partnership with the countries of origin, a common European legislative framework to organise entry in a fair, transparent and straightforward way, residency and integration, which to me means rights."
"Only after this does it talk, once these standards have been established, of addressing the subject of illegal immigration, because we need legal channels to do this."
"Lastly, the report speaks, and we shall be discussing this here in detail when we see the legislative proposals, of establishing new immigration policies in the twenty-first century for a new society and a new economy, that cannot simply be a rehash of guest worker policies from the industrial societies of the 1960s."
"I hope that the Council will also align itself with those politicians who want to broach this subject clearly and courageously."
"I really hope this will be the case and I say this in the full knowledge that, on the subject of immigration, we are speaking with both our minds and our hearts - I say this knowing that listening to me today are EU citizens, some by birth and others through choice, all invited by my colleague Mr Aparicio, and who have high expectations of this debate."
"Parliament will try to prove equal to events, and, despite the fact that on occasions events make things difficult for us, we are going to try, and this is something that has never been done by the PPE-DE Group with regard to asylum, to give strong support to this Commission communication and we hope in exchange, Mr President, that the European Council at Laeken will be able to once again initiate a dynamic and robust policy that will allow us to tackle this much needed common immigration policy."
"Mr President, my group strongly supports the report by Mr Evans and welcomes its call for a high-quality common asylum policy."
"It is a curious feature of the construction of Europe that more opportunities for cross-border cooperation have been taken by commerce and criminals than by civil servants, and it is about time our national public administrations made a real effort to get out of their bunkers."
"The situation at Sangatte, near Calais, has featured often on television screens in my home country in recent months."
"The UK can reflect on why so many people wish to come to our country and especially to my city, London."
"I like to think, at least in part, that this is a compliment to our free and diverse society, but we cannot just have an open door, and maybe the French authorities need to reflect on whether their system could be improved."
"There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and 'pass the parcel' by Member States."
"We also need consistency."
"It is illogical to be dismissive about people fleeing Iraq or Afghanistan, implying that they are undeserving scroungers, when by common agreement the regimes of those countries are deemed brutal and depressive, and even deserving of military attack."
"Even if not everyone from such countries can be judged refugees under the strict Geneva Convention criteria, but only as escaping mere misery, there is no call to demonise them."
"We must also be consistent about our attitude to women."
"If we think, as we do, that women's human rights in Afghanistan are grossly denied, we must take account of that in deciding asylum claims."
"Finally, we must not weaken or lower the standards of our asylum systems under the guise of fighting terrorism, as the British Home Secretary is threatening to do."
"There are adequate powers to detain and deport if security is threatened."
"Speedy decisions are those based on high-quality procedures and efficiency such as that offered by the functioning immigration service computers which the UK lacks - not on removing appeal rights for all applicants."
"Mr President, when a Community competence in immigration and asylum was enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam it certainly raised hopes, chief among them that of seeing a policy on immigration and asylum founded on values associated with democratic freedoms and respect for human rights, especially fundamental rights."
"In this respect, we welcome the two Commission communications, which examine these complex issues in great depth."
"Thus, instead of ineffective, inappropriate immigration policies which make illegal immigration an inherent part of the system, they propose a flexible approach with provisions for managing flows and integrating third-country nationals."
"It is regrettable that our rapporteur on immigration should have focused on exploiting the management of migratory flows for the economic and demographic ends of the countries in the Union, without showing concern for the human factor."
"To implement these proposals on an intergovernmental basis, as Mr Pirker wishes, would not only be a step backwards compared with the Treaty of Amsterdam; it would also show contempt for the need to make immigration and asylum policy a Community instrument and above all it would be a refusal to recognise what is really happening on the ground, which can be seen every day at Sangatte and elsewhere."
"Furthermore, we urgently need to correct the misconception that, 'immigration equals workers' ."
"The notion of a 'migrant worker' does not actually take account of what really happens when people immigrate with members of their family, including students or retired people."
"Let us remember that the right to live as part of a family is a fundamental right which no country can deny."
"There is therefore a strong case in favour of talking about 'residents' and - why not - 'European citizens' , assuming that they participate fully."
"It is the Member States' duty to take the necessary measures to ensure that all European residents are fully integrated; they achieve this by making sure that everyone has the same rights, including political ones."
"As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, the only solution that we know of is for the Member States to be responsible for legalising their situation so as to combat all forms of crime, including that committed by traffickers and unscrupulous employers."
"Mr President, while stating that our Group is fully in agreement with the Evans report, I should, however, like to highlight two aspects."
"First, the procedure for examining refugee applications needs to be speeded up."
"Member States should be aware that many of their problems, but especially many of the immigrant refugees' problems, would be overcome if these applications were dealt with quickly."
"A great many refugees - a great many people who have every right to be recognised as such - wait for months or years without receiving aid, deprived of work, gradually sliding towards illegality and often sucked into areas of organised and other crime."
"It is therefore necessary to shorten these excessively long time periods."
"Secondly, it is important to understand and establish the fact that the notion of a 'safe country' is one that may be overturned by specific evidence of the treatment an individual receives in his or her country."
"I mean that the notion of a safe country must be a relative assumption, because many refugees flee from a safe country because they are personally persecuted."
"This notion must not, therefore, be an absolute notion, but the conditions to which the individual refugees have been subjected - in other words, the conditions that have led them to flee to another country - should be examined on a case-by-case basis, and they may lead to the above-mentioned notion of a safe third country being overturned."
"Mr President, I should particularly like to thank Mr Pirker for the work he has done."
"Now more than ever, as the rapporteur has stressed, it is essential to reformulate Community immigration policy: not just aseptic rules allowing or forbidding entry, but a broader and more responsible approach based above all on economic and demographic assessments and evaluations of social and cultural integration."
"We therefore need to lay down a strategy for a sustainable immigration policy in which national and local institutions can play a major part in using objective criteria to identify occupational needs and the availability of jobs, accommodation, social services and training for all those who ask to come and live and work in our Member States."
"Setting limits and strict rules means ensuring they get the best possible welcome and are fully integrated, with mutual respect and benefits for both European citizens and the immigrants."
"It means avoiding painful social conflict, and it also means being tough on illegal immigration, which all too often is associated with crime and exploitation."
"Above all, Europe cannot confine itself to taking a passive role and attitude towards immigration as if it were just a traffic policeman directing traffic."
"Europe must act with greater political awareness so that it can also interpret fully the strong motivations underlying these phenomena."
"Very often, or almost always, people from third countries come to Europe out of desperation, poverty, hunger or marginalisation."
"Their desperation is such that there are mothers who leave their own children and come to our countries in order to earn something for them."
"For this very reason, and also because of its geographical situation, Europe cannot play a merely bureaucratic role, encouraging or limiting immigration."
"Europe must choose to play a strong, responsible, political role, aware that behind the policy choices to be made regarding immigration there lies the possibility of also being a player in the serious international crisis we are going through."
"We must be aware that it is only by making greater efforts through Third World development programmes and by preventing the so-called brain drain that we can implement the best peace policy of all, which is the fight against poverty and injustice."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we must be aware that well regulated immigration can bring great benefits to the European Union, to the immigrants themselves and to their countries of origin."
"But we must be wary of the demagogy of those who propose too permissive an immigration policy, a policy that would encourage Europe to open its borders indiscriminately, reduce controls and extend the right to asylum to an absurd degree, but then to selfishly close our eyes - as we have been doing for years - towards what is happening in the Middle East and the southern countries, as if it had nothing at all to do with us."
"September 11 showed that what happens in those parts of the world affects us closely, and so we should really be convinced, with a little consistency..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, seeing as there is no rule guaranteeing to the inhabitants of one country the right to enter another if the second country is opposed to this, I would like to voice some considerations and one deep concern on the subject of immigration."
"This concern springs from having seen communities, and individuals belonging to communities of immigrants, celebrating after the tragic attacks in the United States, and from the knowledge that terrorist cells have been sheltered and supported by certain communities on ethnic and religious grounds."
"At this point, with the greatest respect for the majority of immigrants who are respectable and honest, I feel that it would be appropriate, in future, to adopt more stringent criteria when assessing immigrants, based on the precautionary principle, in order to avoid even just the potential risks which some immigrants could introduce into our Europe."
"With regard to Europe, in Italy, we are preparing a fairer, more severe, more appropriate law on immigration."
"We need to prevent European legislation conflicting with our national laws because we do not want left-wing permissiveness, which was rejected by the Italian electorate, to penetrate our legislation via Brussels."
"In Denmark, it has recently become public knowledge that Danish authorities have provided residence permits to outright war criminals, in particular the General responsible for the massacres of the Kurds under Saddam Hussein in 1988."
"This is, of course, scandalous, as the Danish right wing also acknowledges, but ought not the right wing to be content with the fact that the Danish NATO government has obtained military and political benefits from giving shelter to a war criminal?"
"Ought not Saddam' s General to have earned his fare home long ago?"
"Naturally, he has been debriefed by the CIA."
"That goes without saying."
"Very discreetly, of course, just as more and more crucial aspects of political life take place in ever more hermetically sealed rooms."
"This baroque situation reflects one of the ambivalent features of Mr Evans' s report, which is otherwise full of engaging features."
"The report endorses and further develops the finest legal principles we know."
"The Evans report centres upon persecuted human beings in a way that Mr Pirker' s, which is of course an expression of undisguised worker imperialism, does not."
"This is appealing and necessary."
"The problem is that these sound principles are part of political and legal contexts which will in practice reduce them to ideological window dressing."
"The common asylum and immigration policy is being used first and foremost as an engine for homogenising countries' extremely different legal traditions by creating an area of freedom, security and justice that is the crucial link in the European superstate."
"The loser in this disagreeable game is democracy, and the benefit for refugees is doubtful unless one is a general in Saddam Hussein' s army."
"Mr President, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy is extremely disappointing."
"I am talking about the written communication, because both the oral statement which Commissioner Vitorino has just made and that given by the Council were very interesting and much more balanced than what we are accustomed to hearing in this House, and they give us hope that there will be a change in policy following the attacks of 11 September."
"The written communication in any case is marked by a certain lack of a sense of what is really happening on the ground, the same shortcoming which is responsible for discussions in the Council on the proposals on family reunification being at a standstill today, a fate which may well be reserved in the future for the proposals on asylum which I have criticised, in particular during our last part-session."
"The written communication focuses on legal immigration, but - apart from a few allusions - it minimises or forgets illegal immigration and the essential fact that today one in every two people emigrating to the industrialised world does so illegally."
"Of course, I am aware that papers have already been tabled on illegal immigration, in particular on trafficking in human beings and on the liability of hauliers, but these are specific texts, tabled, moreover, for the most part by Member States by virtue of their right of initiative, which they still have for the time being. These texts do not show any evidence of an overall grasp of the problem; they are not equal to the challenge."
"The Commission has just announced that it is going to table further papers following the attacks of 11 September."
"So much the better."
"In the meantime, however, if anyone wants to read a good document which clearly sets out the real problems associated with immigration and their possible solutions, they have to refer not to the Commission communication which is being examined today, but to the strategy paper on asylum and immigration, the amended version of which was tabled by the Austrian Presidency on 19 November 1998 - yes, I did say 1998."
"I would invite listeners of good faith to compare the two texts; they will be staggered by the differences in approach."
"For example, reading from the Austrian document: Generally speaking, it is no longer only issues related to asylum and the problems of temporary protection but also, and especially, general migration issues, the problems posed by the fight against illegal immigration networks and issues related to expulsion which are at the heart of the political debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ought to read it to you in full, but time does not allow and this sentence on its own shows what the real priorities are."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, taking as a starting point the reports by my esteemed fellow Members Mr Evans and Mr Pirker, I would like to talk about the communication from Commissioner Vitorino which is at the heart of this. He is a colleague whom we hold in extraordinarily high regard on the basis of our joint work in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and whose opinion I have very little in common with!"
"A fundamental debate is taking place about asylum and immigration in Europe."
"It is about guidelines for asylum and immigration in Europe."
"We need to be clear about two things: first about the quotas to be applied and secondly about the content."
"As far as the methodology is concerned, European directives on asylum and immigration can only set minimum standards."
"It is only possible to oblige the European Union as a whole to accept minimum standards."
"Anything going beyond that will not be accepted."
"One example of this is that Commissioner Vitorino's proposals on family reunification may suit some people, but it is not possible to stipulate a binding solution for the entire Union."
"Some revision is needed here."
"As regards content, we need to limit and control immigration."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the concept of 'fortress Europe' ."
"It is precisely because we do not want to erect a fortress Europe and could not do so anyway that we must control and limit immigration."
"The approach proposed by Commissioner Vitorino does not meet these requirements."
"A couple more examples: by adopting the concept of the safe third country, we in Germany have been able to reduce the number of asylum-seekers from some 450 000 to well under 100 000."
"Commissioner Vitorino has virtually given up this concept, by making its use dependent on conditions which make it almost impossible to apply in practice."
"My second point is that binding material grounds for granting asylum are laid down in the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees."
"It would be giving asylum-seekers an incentive if we go beyond the binding framework of the Geneva Convention, as in the case of persecution by non-State agents for example."
"There are some very worthy individual arguments in favour of this, but we cannot allow a higher level of asylum than at present."
"The problem of asylum is with the procedure."
"It is still a fact that 90% of all asylum-seekers in Europe are not victims of political persecution."
"So we need to get the procedure under control."
"If we can manage to bring the procedure to a rapid conclusion, we can be more generous when it comes to grounds for the granting of asylum."
"However, this does not sit well with the three-stage asylum procedure that Commissioner Vitorino is proposing, for example."
"Commissioner Vitorino, if Mr Schily, the German Minister for the Interior, who as you know does not belong to the same party as I do, behaves in the same way in Council as he does in Germany then your proposals have no hope at all!"
"Mr President, notwithstanding the events of 11 September, the Commission communication on asylum basically remains not only appropriate but more necessary than ever."
"The Evans report, for its part, is no less topical or relevant."
"This is not the time to step back and it is, therefore, crucial to work towards a solution common to all the Member States with regard to the criteria for assessing requests and to cooperation between national administrative systems."
"I can see that we will have to confront certain challenges in order to come up with effective regulations."
"This effort must not only involve the European dimension, however, but also cooperation with third countries, specifically with the asylum seekers' countries of origin."
"In order to avoid the 'Kafakaesque' situations often described in the European press, it is crucial that we adopt - and we are not asking for much - minimum standards that will ensure faster and simpler procedures for granting asylum so as to prevent the demoralisation and uncertainty that beset asylum seekers."
"The creation of a space of freedom, security and justice will inevitably involve the need for the mutual recognition of judgments. In order to reach this stage, however, we must first of all harmonise asylum procedures."
"Mr President, this communication, for which Commissioner António Vitorino is responsible, is making a timely appearance on the agenda."
"On the basis of the framework defined in Tampere, we are committed to create a common policy in the field of asylum, which I am sure will have the support of the Council and of Parliament."
"Through a joint effort by the Community institutions and civil society we will achieve a platform of understanding, so that by 1 May 2004 the objective outlined by the European Council will be complied with."
"Mr President, we have a historical responsibility to take this decision and there is no time for hesitation."
"I wish you the best of luck, Commissioner."
"Mr Wiebenga, we wish you all the best, and I am sure that the State will be in good hands if you are a member of the Council of State!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you to stick strictly to your speaking time, as we are dreadfully behind schedule!"
"Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino, because I believe that it is thanks to his tireless work that today we are able to draw a clear distinction between asylum-seekers and immigration, and this is to be welcomed."
"I would also thank the representative of the Belgian Presidency, who has just definitively abandoned the idea of a fortress Europe, which it is neither feasible nor desirable to achieve."
"Finally, I should like to thank our colleague, Mr Evans, for his painstaking work."
"I believe that it is by applying clear, fair and precise standards that we will not only ensure that refugees are protected but also fight to release them from the grasp of criminal organisations."
"In my opinion, Mr Evans's painstaking work is in stark contrast to the partisan vision presented by Mr Pirker."
"Mr Pirker poses some complex questions, but the answers are inadequate and even dangerous."
"This internal report by Mr Pirker, comprising reflection, analysis and proposals, is one of the weakest which we have had to discuss in this Parliament."
"Firstly, it contains a series of commonplaces."
"After a time, it says, immigrants adopt the birth-rate pattern of the host country."
"As I see it, this is a sign of integration and proof that attitudes change."
"Instead of being delighted about this, however, Mr Pirker expresses concern about the fact that the destiny of women from the third world, female immigrants who have come from the South, is not confined to having children."
"He also recommends a policy to recruit a set number of workers which, he says, is supported by the Member States as a way of reducing the labour shortage in certain sectors."
"For him, immigrants are like Kleenex: you use them and when you no longer need them you throw them away."
"This is a vision of the human being, more particularly black and African, or dark-skinned, human beings who come from the South, which I do not share."
"Mr Pirker's report deplores family reunification. Mr Pirker's report does, I believe, in many respects, stand in total contradiction to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice."
"Faced with an issue of this complexity, instead of saying that the tragedy in Dover opened our eyes to the possible consequences of immigration, we would have preferred him to consider taking measures against the hauliers who are the real proponents of modern slavery and against the slum landlords ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like to do something that I rarely do for reasons of time, and congratulate Mr Pirker on his well balanced report, although I believe that he is at present not in the Chamber."
"Social integration of economic migrants in the Member States is, as he stressed, absolutely essential if we are to avoid social tensions."
"And a greater degree of contact between immigrants and the indigenous population will perhaps also help us to recognise 'sleepers' and so help to fight terrorism."
"I also believe that in view of all the measures proposed it is important to give the Member States the option of fine-tuning the entry and residence of third country nationals in accordance with the requirements of their own labour markets and demographic trends, because these questions in particular can only be dealt with at local level."
"It will also be important to take into account the imminent enlargement of the EU when planning immigration policy."
"The rapporteur took all this into consideration."
"I wish his report every success, and we will certainly be supporting it."
"Mr President, for the first time ever in this Parliament we are talking about economic migration and asylum in distinct and separate terms, which could be considered to be a wise move by the European Commission in its respective communications for it will help us to give the debate a sense of order and clarity."
"This was one of Parliament' s requests that has now become reality."
"I would like to briefly share two thoughts with you on the issues that are the subject of this debate: firstly, that the migratory movements toward Europe we are now seeing correspond to a mass exodus of citizens who, in their own countries, do not enjoy the minimum conditions necessary for survival and who are being tragically exploited by the organised mafias who traffic in them."
"This has already been discussed here in Parliament."
"The cases in Dover and on our own Andalusian coast are clear examples of this."
"However, illegal immigration of this nature is fertile ground for the social exclusion of this immigrant population and for the exploitation of their labour, in addition to the outbreaks of xenophobia and racism that are taking place in certain parts of Europe."
"This problem can only be resolved by close cooperation and collaboration with the countries of origin, otherwise, any policy in this field will be condemned to failure."
"Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS, MEDA, or the immigration and asylum action plans themselves are absolutely necessary."
"Yet at the same time, and I would like to put particular emphasis on this point, it must also be stressed, from a political angle in particular, that the countries of origin should make the most of their natural and human resources and, most of all, guarantee political and social stability so that their citizens can have confidence in their own leaders."
"This is, therefore, an issue of shared responsibility and not only the responsibility of the Member States or of the European Union itself."
"Countries such as Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia are an example of what I have just been referring to."
"On the other hand, with regard to the communication on the common asylum procedure, the main problem with which Member States are confronted is that of asylum seekers whose claims are unfounded. The Commission and this Parliament should, therefore, make a great effort to remove the major obstacles blocking the standardisation of solutions between Member States."
"On this subject, it does not seem to be the right occasion to talk about a common procedure, distinct from the mandate contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam that refers to a common asylum procedure."
"It is not the same."
"Furthermore, both the communication and the Evans report fail to define concepts such as persecution by third parties, persecution in cases of conflict or gender related persecution, for example, given that the difficulty sometimes lies more in the definition of the concept of the refugee than in the process of identifying it."
"To be precise, we are on the right track: faced with a phenomenon such as asylum and immigration, a concern for many of us, cooperation, solidarity, clear legislation and realism are the necessary prerequisites for addressing one of the major challenges for the European Union in this new century."
"Mr President, at a time when we have all, I hope, been scandalised by Mr Berlusconi' s statements, demonstrating as they do such suspicion and hatred of foreigners, I believe that now, more than ever, it is time to combat racism, and to combat it in all its most insidious forms."
"The Commission' s communication on a Community immigration policy, and the vote on the Pirker report, give us an opportunity to do just that."
"In that respect I welcome Mr Vitorino's statements."
"We must not forget that for Europeans the Tampere Summit in October 1999, which sought fair treatment for nationals of third countries in comparison with citizens of the Union, was a very important event."
"We must start from one important established fact, which we were reminded of just now: the myth of zero immigration can no longer be a realistic concept, and in any case demographic problems and labour shortages will have to make us change our ideas about immigration."
"This is why, today, we must give our strong support to the Commission' s communication, because this future Community policy on immigration has a great many virtues, in particular that of combating all forms of criminal activity."
"It has to be said that the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, has adopted a rather critical position regarding the Commission' s communication."
"Unlike Mr Pirker, we socialists are convinced that our approach to this question must be a humane approach rather than an economic approach, because we are talking here about the fate of human beings, not about common merchandise."
"We must also remember, and we can never remember it enough, that if people emigrate and suffer the pain of separation from their country and their loved ones, it is because they are obliged to do so. They are not simply doing it for pleasure."
"The Commission' s position is fundamental inasmuch as it proposes a framework."
"I shall end by saying, in addition, that in a European Union which is constantly becoming more integrated, and which now has the benefit of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, no Member State can now claim that its policy on admission is nobody' s business but its own."
"I therefore reiterate my full and wholehearted support for the Commission' s proposal, at the same time taking a critical view of the content of Mr Pirker' s report."
"As far as I am concerned, I defer the vote of the French socialist delegation on this report."
"Mr President, I wish to discuss Paragraph 15 of Mr Pirker' s report which says, among other things, that immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate."
"How is this to be interpreted?"
"A wave of Islamophobia is passing over Europe at present."
"In several EU countries, Muslims have been persecuted."
"The most rancorous debate I have been able to follow is taking place right now in Denmark."
"Quite a few politicians have made astounding statements."
"Mr Camre, a Member of this House, has said that all the countries of the Western world are being infiltrated by Muslims and that, while some of them are friendly enough with us, many of them are in favour of getting rid of us - in Danish, få os fjernet - that is to say, removing us."
"That is a prejudiced and irresponsible statement."
"My concern, as I address this House, is that the wording of Paragraph 15 might be in danger of creating further scope for this type of inflammatory statement."
"Is Europe not in danger of losing its diversity?"
"Are we not in danger of tampering with freedom of religion and freedom of expression?"
"Could not Paragraph 15 be understood as saying, 'Adapt, full stop. Otherwise, gather your belongings together and go!'"
"I wonder if Mr Camre might respond to this."
"Mr President, I want to begin by fully endorsing both Mr Olle Schmid' s description of the political situation in Denmark and the request with which he concluded."
"I also want to say that I think there are an incredibly large number of good things in the Commission' s proposals in this area."
"It would of course be marvellous if we were to use our cooperation to strengthen the principles we talk so much about - democracy and human rights and, I might add, humanitarianism - instead of dragging each other down to the lowest common denominator."
"I think there are quite a lot of good things in Mr Evans' s report. I intend to support it and shall call for a vote in favour of it."
"I think, however, that there are still a lot of problems with Mr Pirker' s report."
"It was improved quite considerably by the committee' s reading of it."
"It is also, of course, reasonable to hope that it will be further improved in the course of today when we vote on it."
"However, a lot more is required before I shall support the report, which is based principally upon the EU' s wanting to show solidarity with itself."
"Mr President, Mr Evans has put a great deal of thought into his report."
"Quite rightly, he raises the issue of the safe-country concept being based on human rights considerations, not on diplomatic links."
"He underlines the lack of common approach between the Member States with regard to the concept of safe countries."
"This is no longer acceptable."
"Mr Evans concludes that the concept of safe countries needs to be defined unequivocally."
"Although I agree with his motivation, we must admit that this approach is not a safe one."
"I recall that our colleague, Mr Pasqua, as France's French Minister of the Interior, once said that 'La démocratie s'arrête là où commence la raison d'Etat.'"
"Mr Evans: as long as la raison d'Etat exists, there is no safe country."
"Mr President, I am really sorry about this, because the debate is an interesting one which I believe demonstrates not only the complexity of the issue, but also its political dimension."
"It would be unreasonable to think that it is merely a question of settling technical problems in the context of a generalised consensus, and I believe that these difficulties also demonstrate the urgent need to reach a consensus, at European level, on a certain number of essential measures."
"First of all I think that it would be unreasonable and irresponsible to deny the extent of clandestine immigration and the fact that it is getting worse."
"I believe that that would be unreasonable and politically tactless."
"It is therefore very important, in addition to having measures of a regulatory nature, to develop an active policy of combating trafficking in human beings, because such trafficking constitutes, above all, the exploitation of a great deal of misery, poverty and fear, by organisations which are highly efficient and who not only traffic in human beings but also engage in other criminal activities."
"For this reason, policing measures, and in particular the intensifying of border checks, are essential if we are to remain one step ahead and ensure that our future external borders will be protected."
"I would remind you that the largest police operation that has ever been undertaken in Europe is now underway, on our future external borders."
"Thirty countries are involved, from Finland to the Mediterranean."
"I am sure I do not need to tell the European Parliament that, to us, asylum is a sacred concept, that it constitutes the dignity of Europe, and that is why, throughout the world, Europe still acts as a beacon and an example."
"We cannot preach in favour of democracy and liberty if we do not set an example ourselves."
"However, at the same time we cannot ignore the fact that this important value is being abused by a considerable number of people, who probably have, in human terms, legitimate reasons for doing so, but who do it to the detriment of those who are fleeing real persecution."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency that we should first of all agree on the conditions for receiving would-be refugees into our territory, and not add still further to the attractive prospect which our prosperous and - though we tend to forget it - happy countries pose to those who know only wretchedness and poverty."
"We must therefore agree quickly on the rules for allowing people to come in, if we want to avoid the phenomenon of asylum shopping."
"Asylum is, of course, a right, but is it necessary, in order to have legal guarantees, that things should be complicated, thereby allowing procedures to be dilatory and resulting in a situation in which, in some countries, even after four, five or six years no one has proved capable of taking a decision, so that it is necessary to take measures to regularise the situation?"
"Respect for the law is not incompatible with rapid and effective procedures."
"These were the questions we raised at the last Council, and I was pleased to find that, among the Fifteen, there was a very broad consensus on the need to reach a consensus on this issue."
"Finally, of course, we must define a certain number of rules at European level."
"I was going to say minimum rules, but I shall not do so because to some people that would mean 'no improvement' ."
"What I am trying to say is essential rules which do not necessarily go into matters in detail but which translate into practical terms the fundamental political consensus that there has to be on this subject if we are ever to succeed in overcoming this problem."
"We need to do this quickly, and that is why I said that we must, at the Laeken Summit, try to re-launch the European dynamic, because otherwise the outcome would be negative and not a true reflection of our opinions."
"We must also decide how much solidarity has to be agreed on at European level because the mere fact that one country happens to be situated at an external border should not mean that that country should necessarily have to bear the whole burden of any measures that are agreed on."
"It is true that immigration is another problem, but it is also true that we cannot claim that if we had a more or less unrestricted immigration system all our problems would be solved; nowhere in the world is there any example of such a policy being implemented, and even where the system is the most liberal, it is still not possible to solve all the problems, especially those that are still linked to illegal immigration."
"It is therefore necessary to ask a certain number of pertinent questions, and this is what we shall be doing at the conference which will be taking place in a few days' time in Brussels."
"How is Europe' s population going to develop?"
"Do we still have any requirements at economic level and if so, of what kind?"
"Will the situation be the same everywhere?"
"Does immigration have to be subject to conditions?"
"Is it to be permanent or for a limited period?"
"Should we demand a certain number of qualifications, risking savage consequences for the countries of origin, which often have a need for precisely those qualifications?"
"Would there not be the risk of an increase in the number of unemployed people, at least in the long run, which would only make budgeting more difficult?"
"If we want to find successful solutions to all these questions, we must have the courage to ask them clearly and to come up with some serious answers, and I hope that that is what will happen at our conference."
"Finally, I must tell you that the Belgian Presidency - we may be a small country but we are, I think, a realistic one - would like to draft proposals that bear the stamp of realism, because we believe that such realism is the only thing that will enable us to make the progress that is so essential."
"If we get lost in ideological or technical considerations, we shall still be debating the question fifteen years hence and we shall still not have made any significant progress."
"However, there is an enormous risk, because the people of Europe are waiting for some answers."
"They have confidence in Europe. They believe that this is a useful, perhaps even essential, dimension in the solving of such problems."
"If we do not succeed in finding answers for our people, I fear that there is a dangerous risk that they will take matters into their own hands, and I am also afraid - and I hope that we in this House share this feeling, at least most of us if not all - that Europe may not be able to remain a Europe of rights and freedoms, a Europe that is welcoming and open, and also, because this is what our fellow citizens are concerned about, a Europe that is prudent and takes precautions, and a Europe that expects all those who find themselves in its territory to respect the rule of law."
"Mr President, I am aware that the subject before us is extremely sensitive, particularly at this moment in history."
"We have been working - and I refer to this legislature, of course - over the past two years to establish positive relations between citizens and immigrants, to make equal opportunities possible and to create a form of social cohesion."
"Now, everyone can see the need to revise certain parts of the agenda we have been working on and, in particular, to identify how the revision of these points can be converted into positive Community legislation allowing us to grow into the kind of Europe we all want."
"I would now like to make three points."
"Firstly, we need to focus more on defining framework legislation to promote actions at regional and local levels, always in agreement with the Member States, in situations where an initiative is certainly needed to make it easier to balance the three factors which have always been the basis for our analyses of the issue of immigration and asylum."
"These factors are migration flows, which must be regulated and continuously monitored, integration, and the fight against illegal immigration which is often, sadly, a source of the more major concerns of crime and the exploitation of human beings."
"Secondly, we need a thorough debate at European level on the issues which we consider to be vital for our policies such as cooperation between police forces, judicial cooperation, common forms of control and common information systems."
"We must make it quite clear what financial resources we should consider adequate and quantifiable in these areas."
"Thirdly, we may well have disregarded or underestimated the importance of one of our tasks."
"We must insist on the need for the major educational programmes which are the foundations of our culture, and of multiculturalism, in particular: there must be schooling and education starting with foreign children, especially, irrespective of their legal position."
"These programmes are fundamental for the policies of integrating and building the societies we want."
"In my opinion, we must establish a substantial educational and cultural programme, a major part of which promotes communication between cultures, for that would be the first step along a path which will certainly bring about the sort of integration we desire."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Vitorino."
"Commissioner, you have listened seriously to the demands made by many experts on migration and NGOs and have made it clear in two communications how policy on refugees and traditional migrants is to be handled."
"With your communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for persons granted asylum you have brought forward some excellent proposals for harmonising asylum policy."
"Your proposals will now help us to find some concrete solutions."
"The rapporteur, Mr Evans, has made a fine job of this."
"I regard the additions he proposes as enhancing the current debate on concrete directives."
"You have also succeeded, Commissioner, with your communication on a Community migration policy, in making it clear how important it is that future migration in the European Union should be jointly controlled and regulated throughout the Union."
"However, we will probably have to carry on debating the wishes of the Nation States, which I take very seriously."
"They want to arrange the fine tuning of migration themselves, although their strategies have already been a failure at national level for decades."
"I trust that we will soon manage to persuade our colleagues at national level that there is no alternative to Union-wide control of migration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that after the tragic events of 11 September, asylum and immigration policy will be undergoing drastic changes."
"In the light of this, it may have been more appropriate to postpone the discussion of these reports because they do not take into consideration recent international developments."
"Particular attention should be devoted to the formulation of Paragraph 15 in the Pirker report."
"The present document emphasises that the Member States are obliged to respect the rights and duties of third-country nationals."
"In my opinion, this is a bridge too far."
"Two-way integration is not feasible as long as there is no reciprocity and mutual recognition."
"In other words, only if reciprocity and mutual recognition are secured in third countries can two-way integration take place."
"The Pirker report has the merit of being frank."
"It presents immigration as a simple problem of merchandise linked to the needs of the capitalist system."
"In effect, the report regards as positive the view that immigration should be envisaged from an economic viewpoint, as a function of the needs and capacities of Member States."
"Article 23 could not be clearer."
"Each Member State has the freedom to define the skills profile and number of workers required on the basis of the needs of its labour market."
"In other words, the proposed Community policy on immigration is a quota policy."
"By adopting such a position, Europe shows that it is still a long way from recognising the right to immigration."
"What we have here is residence permits restricted by the requirements of the bosses and the fantasies of the demographers."
"Even the issue of keeping families together is going to be subject to different rules for each group of immigrants, which is the exact opposite of freedom of movement, freedom to select one' s place of business, and the right to live with one' s family."
"Massively overexploited, immigrants are the victims of liberal deregulation."
"I shall end by saying that only the general regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants plus citizens' rights will enable us to combat effectively the modern slavery which we are being invited to support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are fully aware that this debate addresses one of the most important and 'hottest' issues at European level: Common asylum and immigration policy."
"This situation is the result of two separate factors: firstly, it has come about because the Treaty of Amsterdam granted new competences to the Community, opening up new possibilities for action on a European scale; and secondly, because there has been a considerable increase in migratory pressures from third countries, the devastating effects of which have been highlighted by certain recent tragic events, such as the massive influx of refugees from the Kosovo crisis and the tragedy at Dover."
"It is therefore necessary, for both humanitarian and economic reasons, to define a global policy that is able to effectively manage these migratory flows, which currently constitute a legal vacuum, to which the European Union cannot fail to provide a response."
"We must take account of the fact that three different types of people are involved in this problem: asylum seekers, temporarily displaced persons and economic migrants."
"Although the symptoms are similar, it is important to distinguish the causes and find different answers."
"Confusing the status of these people does not help to solve the problems we are facing, and actually makes them worse."
"We also know that this external pressure adds to the internal pressure felt by States that are facing a decline in their own population, caused both by a slowdown of population growth and a reduction in the population of working age, with an increasing population of those over the age of 65. Concern is also growing about the sustainability of social security systems."
"The answer cannot be to make vain attempts at preventing and halting immigration at Europe' s borders."
"The answer lies, instead, in managing and freezing it at current levels."
"Hence the need for a carefully thought out, clear and coherent common European policy for the management of migratory flows."
"In order to prevent new problems emerging, we will have to consider the real labour needs of each Member State and the resources available for the reception and integration of these immigrants."
"It must be understood that we incline more to the approach advocated by Mr Pirker."
"I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on his announcement today that, within a month, he will be presenting two initiatives on combating illegal immigration and on repatriation."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise that we need to adopt a prudent approach to a sensitive issue that requires intelligent answers."
"It makes more sense, for example, for us to give priority to legalising immigrants who can be integrated into the labour market and who are already on Community territory than encouraging a new wave of immigration."
"Mr President, at this stage, the European institutions and this Parliament in particular are fully aware that due to the complexity and importance of the subject we are dealing with today, a legislative programme is needed that will only be effective within the framework of a common and coordinated European approach."
"There are many points of agreement between the Commission communication and the reports we are debating today."
"We need to develop a more proactive policy which recognises that pressure from migration is set to continue and that properly planned immigration can bring benefits to Europe, to the migrants themselves and also to their countries of origin."
"Our aim is to improve the management of migratory movements within the framework of close cooperation with countries of origin and of transit, strengthening the fight against illegal immigration and combating the criminal networks involved, guaranteeing, at the same time, the rights of victims."
"What is required is a more open and flexible policy which, in addition to providing greater coordination of policies aimed at reducing migratory pressures and strengthening border controls, could have the benefit of achieving a reduction in illegal immigration that would be advantageous to those very people who truly need the protection that refuge and asylum affords."
"We should maintain these levels of protection at all costs, as envisaged in the Geneva Convention, for this is also a sign of European identity that fills us all with a sense of pride."
"I would encourage Commissioner Vitorino to continue his good work and to keep to the timetable that has been fixed, and the Council to be equal to the position adopted at Laeken, thereby fulfilling the commitments made at Tampere."
"It is time to take practical decisions and not to make statements that are only balanced because of their ambiguity."
"These are the hopes and needs of Europe' s citizens."
"Mr President, we cannot talk about immigrants and immigration without distinguishing between the different types of immigrants."
"There are at least three different types of immigrants: political refugees, refugees from war zones and economic migrants."
"Once this distinction has been made, it immediately becomes clear that a single asylum law cannot cover all three categories, as Mr Evans proposes."
"Not only does this document fail to correspond to reality, it even goes so far as to demonise the Member States which demand the right to decide whether to recognise the right to asylum on a case-by-case basis, depending on the way the society of the country in question is structured and the adequacy of the reception facilities available, without incurring negative repercussions for anyone."
"Instinctively, all of us have always been supportive of those who find themselves in the dreadful situation of being forced to leave their own country and apply for asylum in another, but the level of danger to which the rapporteur would have it conceded that all applicants are exposed in their countries of origin is not always acceptable."
"He is compelling governments and Member States - to put it in colloquial terms - not to make a fuss and to open their gates without delay, invoking the Geneva Convention as if it were a magic password, a skeleton key, rather than what it actually is, a series of guarantees that place those seeking and those granting asylum on an equal footing."
"Mr Evans' proposal to establish a common minimum standard - as he calls it - actually invalidates this principle by making it too permissive."
"The same may be said of the proposal to introduce a single procedure - as it is called - which, in practice, takes away from the host State any possibility of verifying the suitability of the applicant, who cannot be denied any right, mind you, and whose only obligation is to produce his credentials, as happens among respectable people."
"The problem is that refugees and exiles often provide easy cover for decidedly undesirable guests such as drug dealers, traffickers in human beings and terrorists who pretend to be immigrants and then train as pilots and destroy skyscrapers and all the people working inside."
"The caution and controls that the rapporteur is denying the States are the fundamental elements of basic, legitimate protection of the States and their citizens."
"The Pirker report, which I do support, on a common immigration policy, is much more responsible, not least because it is more balanced, does not make concessions to cheap populism and respects safety measures."
"Lastly, to those Members of the left who have attempted once again to bring up the usual controversy against Mr Berlusconi today, I would point out that they are at least a day late."
"They should read the Arc-en-ciel; although they have missed the debate, they are still on time for the train of cheap populism and pointless political speculation."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor after such a long and full debate."
"I believe that there is no doubt at all that the two reports we have seen today prove that we need a common policy on migration and asylum."
"I should like, in passing, to pay tribute to the Commissioner' s statement and to all the work that Parliament has carried out, which shows that we attach real importance to these issues, particularly in the current circumstances."
"I believe that here today we have been able to make our different views clear, and perhaps we have also made clear the difference between asylum and economic migration."
"I am not sure, however, that we have entirely avoided confused thinking."
"On the subject of migratory flows and the right of asylum, we must make it clear, in the face of all opposition, that rights and obligations have to be shared, by both migrants and host Member States."
"We must not have a situation in which certain people can take advantage of the loopholes in our harmonisation in order to create an underclass of Europeans by introducing second-class workers or deferred citizenship."
"It seems to me to be important that the rights of workers, of whatever origin, should be asserted and given tangible expression in order to combat the trafficking in human beings, by which certain people exploit misery and distress."
"As for our asylum policy, it will gain in terms of quality and justice if we can agree to recognise that it needs to be supplemented by other compulsory cooperation policies which enable everyone to live with dignity and self-respect in their own countries."
"In all cases, asylum policy should reject arbitrary criteria linked to the current situation."
"I should also like to ask, simply, that we should also give political rights to those whom we welcome for their work."
"Mr President, I would ask Members to ponder one question: is it viable in today's world for all matters of asylum policy to be decided within the parameters of the Geneva Convention?"
"The Geneva Convention drafted in 1951 was conceived as a temporary measure."
"It was negotiated in a very different world - a world still haunted by the shameful failure of Western countries to offer sanctuary to the victims of European fascism."
"It was designed first and foremost to ensure that refugees from communist tyranny would have access to safe havens."
"But the world has moved on."
"Mass air travel has facilitated unprecedented migratory flows."
"The great majority of those seeking better lives in new countries are actuated by understandable - indeed laudable - economic motives."
"But the terms of the 1951 Convention, and specifically the requirement to assess all claims individually, even if the applicant is manifestly coming from a safe country, encourage economic migrants to seek entry as refugees."
"This clogs the system to the disbenefit of those genuinely fleeing from injustice and wrong."
"I support, as Mr Pirker's report does, a degree of controlled primary immigration."
"All countries can benefit from the energy and enterprise of people who are prepared to cross whole continents in search of a better future."
"For such a policy to gain public consent it must be fair and transparent and it must be open to account."
"It cannot be right for the judiciaries of our Members States, by applying a peculiar interpretation of the 1951 Convention, to operate an immigration policy beyond the control of elected politicians."
"If we want to manage a sustainable policy of legal immigration and, at the same time, protect the rights of those most in need of sanctuary, we must take back control of our asylum laws from the judges."
"Far from enlarging the scope of the Geneva Convention, as Mr Evans suggests, we should scrap this outmoded accord and replace it with something more suited to the modern world."
"Mr President, today's debate on asylum and immigration is extremely topical, what with insecurity and fear about military operations in the Middle East giving rise to mass movements of desperate people."
"Waves of refugees have already reached the European Union, their first port of call being Greece, which is the European Union's closest border with the Middle East."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Greek islands are under pressure from an unprecedented influx of refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan."
"Greece is having to shoulder a burden which is out of proportion to what it can cope with, which is why the European Union urgently needs to take its share of the responsibility, in this specific case by helping Greece to draw up an integrated joint plan to protect the right of asylum and ensure that the Geneva Convention is fully applied."
"Obviously, the sacred right to asylum must not, under any circumstances, be undermined by the measures needed to combat international crime and terrorism."
"In any event, mass movements of people will be dealt with under a fairer global policy to reduce inequalities and resolve differences using peaceful means."
"Mr President, the increase in the number of asylum seekers over the last few years is causing grave problems for Member States, which are having serious difficulty in coping with the situation."
"As Deputy Mayor of the city of Lyon, I see this problem every day. In my city, the number of conventional asylum seekers has doubled in a little less than a year."
"The two Commission communications that we are debating today are certainly an important step forward."
"However, we must go further and put an end to the current situation, in which some Member States allow in refugees coming from certain countries whereas others do not."
"We must ensure that the countries that receive refugees really do have the means to do so."
"In recent times, however, those means have been reduced."
"We can no longer receive asylum seekers with dignity."
"In our cities we have families living under canvas. This is absolutely unacceptable."
"Winter is approaching and we are heading for a catastrophe."
"In order to make progress, however, I invite, above all, the governments of Member States and the Council to take the courageous decisions that are necessary."
"Insisting on maintaining positions which are too national will end up becoming indecent and irresponsible when the lives of thousands of refugees are at stake and when certain districts in our major European cities are at risk of turning into ghettos."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, because I know that voting time is approaching."
"First of all, I wish to thank you for all your contributions to this debate, including the critical contributions, and clarify two points of criticism I think are important."
"First: with regard to the comment by Mr Nassauer, the Commission has not abandoned the principle of the safe third country."
"It has not abandoned this principle at all and in fact we are working, in Council, on a definition of a safe third country and I am sure that, as Mr Nassauer said, Mr Schilly will continue to be as tough a negotiator on this matter as he always has been."
"With regard to the second aspect, I should like to remind you that the Commission has given itself the task of reviewing its proposals in light of the international situation that has arisen following the terrorist attacks in the United States of America."
"The review is now underway."
"We shall undertake this task with the utmost rigour and the results will be submitted to Parliament. The Commission does not take a positive view, however, of the implication that there is a link between terrorism and immigration."
"The Commission has put forward proposals that respect rights and seek to manage migratory flows. There are also proposals on combating illegal immigration."
"Any attempt to portray the Commission as having no initiatives on fighting illegal immigration is unfair."
"The proposal for a framework decision against trafficking in human beings adopted by the Council last week is a Commission proposal."
"The communication on illegal immigration, the communication on repatriation policy and the communication on the joint policing of borders have been on the 'scoreboard' since May 2000 and are part of the Commission' s work programme that was submitted for debate in this Parliament this year."
"These are not the result of emergency measures arising from the terrorist attacks; they are an integral part of this Commission' s coherent and consistent immigration policy."
"Lastly, I wish to thank Parliament for its support."
"I hope that, with the clear ideas that have emerged from this debate, the Laeken European Council will be able to take a step forwards."
"These measures provide added value at European level and I thank the European Parliament for its contribution."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I feel I must request the floor because I find this situation intolerable and wish to protest at the great number of speeches from large political groups in this Chamber that have sought, this morning, to link terrorism with immigration, asylum seekers and, more than once and in a direct manner, immigration of Islamic origin."
"This seems a very irresponsible attitude to me, a time-bomb threatening peaceful coexistence, and I would like to remind you all that many a terrorist with white skin has been born to the world from our own European continent."
"Mrs Terrón i Cusí, I am afraid that was not a point of order."
"I will not permit any further discussion of this."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"VOTE"
"Then I suggest that you make an exception and sit in another seat; perhaps the device there works."
"I again request the House's services to send a technician to you."
"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0303/2001) by Mr Turchi on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty concerning:"
"1. Amended motion for a Council resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0165/2001 - 2001/0061(CNS)] on the adoption of provisions for the implementation of the Protocol to the Treaty of Nice concerning the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and concerning the Coal and Steel Research Fund"
"2. Amended motion for a Council resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0166/2001 - 2000/0363(CNS)] on the adoption of the multiannual financial guidelines for the administration of the assets of the 'ECSC in liquidation' with, following completion of the liquidation, the 'Assets of the Coal and Steel Research Fund'"
"3. Communication from the Commission to the Council [COM(2000) 518 - C5-0204/2001 - 2001/2095(COS)], the European Parliament, the Advisory Committee of the ECSC, the Committee on Economic and Social and the Committee of the Regions - expiry of the ECSC Treaty: financial activities after 2002"
"Before the final vote on the first proposal"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the reasons I expressed yesterday and considering the fact that you have adopted my legislative amendments, I call upon you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolutions until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament' s role, pursuant to Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, can be ascertained."
"I therefore call upon you to vote on the motion which is not a legislative resolution, to make the political positions of this House on the matter quite clear."
"We now come to a proposal, in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to adjourn the vote, and we shall now proceed to vote on it."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal) President."
"The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible."
"Before the final vote on the second proposal:"
"Mr President, I repeat what I said just now, that is, I call upon you not to vote on the legislative resolution but to vote on the following motion, which is not a legislative resolution."
"We now come to a proposal, in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to adjourn the vote, and we shall now proceed to vote on it."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal) President."
"The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible."
"(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution)"
"Report (A5-0297/2001) by Mr Linkohr on behalf of the Committee for Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the research programme of the Coal and Steel Research Fund on the amended Council motion for a resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0167/2001 - 2000/0364(CNS)] on the adoption of the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Coal and Steel Research Fund."
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, in view of the Commission's response to the debate last night and, in particular, to my colleague Mr Mombaur's point on the expiry of the Coal and Steel Treaty, the protocol attached to the Treaty of Nice and the legal uncertainty now surrounding that, I would ask the rapporteur to comment on this point. Would he be in favour of referring it to our own legal services as the Commission is apparently about to do?"
"Mr Linkohr, as rapporteur, has the floor."
"Mr President, as rapporteur I cannot but agree with that."
"Not being myself a lawyer either, I would be interested to know what the Commission's position would be in the event of Nice not being ratified before the Treaty expires, for then, or so my reasonable human understanding tells me, a legal vacuum results, and that is something we should have looked into."
"In that respect I would like to support Mrs Ahern in what she has said."
"Having already, however, been called to speak, I wanted to point out to you that Amendments Nos 1 to 5 are founded on a misunderstanding."
"We did not vote on them at all in committee."
"They may well be substantially included in the Turchi report - there is no need for anybody to worry about that - but I recommend that we should not vote on them today, and, insofar as I am entitled to demand such a thing, I demand that."
"I would gladly submit that to this House's decision."
"I shall call for a vote on Mr Linkohr's motion, but not on Amendments Nos 1 to 5."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.) Before the final vote:"
"In this instance, I ask for a vote on the legislative resolution, in particular because of items 8 and 9, on which we have just voted."
"In my judgment, it is sufficient if we proceed to examine the Turchi report, but because of items 8 and 9, I would really attach importance to us now actually voting on the resolution."
"I ask you to vote in favour of it."
"(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution.)"
"Explanation of vote - Turchi Report (A5-0303/2001) and Linkohr Report (A5-0297/2001):"
". (FR) The two reports on the expiry of the ECSC Treaty state - and deplore the fact - that the Council is asking Parliament to give it discharge regarding activities which it has no means of controlling."
"In other words, Parliament may vote for what it wants but it will be the Council who decides."
"That is certainly one way of recognising that Parliament serves only to give the stamp of democracy to decisions which are not democratic."
"These two reports also state that the so-called social aspect of the ECSC is to be abandoned, precisely when we are envisaging the accession of countries on which the European Union intends to impose the restructuring of their coal and steel sectors so as to make them profitable, profitable, that is, to possible Western investors."
"In spite of this 'social aspect' of the ECSC, the restructuring of coal and steel in Western Europe has resulted in the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of workers, a disaster for many people."
"Some regions, such as Lorraine, have taken years to recover from the companies that were closed down and the jobs that were lost."
"We can imagine what it will be like for the workers of Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary, who will not even have the chance of compensation or early retirement."
"Rather than using the balance from the liquidation of the ECSC as a research fund, which will in one form or another profit the bosses, the sums released in this way should be used in their entirety to continue to pay the wages of the workers who will be thrown out onto the street as a result of future restructuring programmes."
"We have therefore voted against these two reports."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.24 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Arms exports"
"The next item is the report (A5-0309/2001) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's Second Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports [13177/1/2000 - C5-0111/2001 - 2001/2050(COS)]."
"Mr President, 11 September showed us that the world we live in is very insecure."
"We discovered that the world's security, stability and economy are much more fragile than we previously believed."
"Wherever we look - whether at the fight against terrorism, the horrors of the Balkans, the nightmare of a small town in Switzerland, the virtual anarchy in parts of Africa - one common theme emerges everywhere: the huge number of weapons which are freely available."
"That is one of the main causes of instability in the world, and we must act before the tidal wave of weaponry overwhelms us all."
"The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was a significant development in controlling this trade."
"It is clear from the second annual report that there is rapidly growing cooperation between Member States, both in terms of implementing the code and of achieving greater mutual understanding of the interpretation of the code."
"It is also clear that arms export policy in relation to security is becoming more closely aligned."
"There is much greater transparency in arms controls policies."
"Most EU States, except for Austria, Greece and Luxembourg, now produce their own annual reports, albeit with a huge variance in the quality of information provided."
"It is worth noting that the NGOs' Safer World holds up the UK's annual report, first introduced by the then Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, as an example for other countries."
"The code's influence goes beyond the EU: all the accession countries, the EEA, EFTA States, Canada and Turkey now subscribe to the code's principles."
"Member States are also seeking to apply those principles in wider international fora."
"It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of what has been achieved or the considerable mindshift that is taking place among Member States in this field."
"Nonetheless, there are areas where the code needs to be strengthened."
"The principles of the code will be constantly undermined if action is not taken to control and license arms brokers."
"It is beyond belief that in many countries you need a licence to own a shotgun but not to trade in weapons of any type."
"Some arms brokers are legitimate businesses; many, however, are little more than merchants of death."
"Action in this field must be an absolute priority."
"Similarly, controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU."
"We further need a more harmonised system of end-use data provision, certification and enforcement."
"Controls of official exports are important, but the illegal trade in arms is our biggest problem."
"I welcome the work of Member States towards a UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, reminding Parliament that the definition includes things like shoulder-carried, anti-aircraft missiles."
"I very much regret the attitude of the USA to that conference and the influence of its gun lobby."
"We can only hope that recent events will cause the USA to reflect on the need for global partnerships to remove the causes of insecurity."
"We must have a global crackdown on this illegal trade."
"Greater transparency is the guardian of our security in this field."
"Despite the rapid advances made, I would like to see all countries producing publicly available annual export reports in a commonly agreed format."
"The Council's annual report ought to be more detailed, as I have set out in my report."
"We would naturally encourage greater scrutiny of arms policies by Member State parliaments."
"I was delighted that last year Member States agreed a Common List of Military Equipment to which the code applies."
"We now need a common list of non-military security and police equipment, and I am happy to accept the amendments on that subject."
"The list, however, has to be meaningful and provide the basis of effective action in this field and not be a statement of general intent."
"We will not win the war on terrorism - which we are all talking about at the moment - unless we control arms, the tools of this deadly trade."
"That is the challenge confronting us now and it is even more important today than it was this time last year when we debated the first annual report."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Titley on his very sound and constructive report."
"His efforts, as well as useful contributions by other fellow MEPs, have enabled this Parliament to reach more or less consensus on an otherwise very sensitive issue: the control of the arms trade."
"In light of the attacks in America, there is growing awareness of the fact that the vast distribution of arms worldwide leads to unstable countries which form the breeding ground for terrorism."
"The Titley report rightly points out that the 1998 EU Code is a major step forward towards a more coherent and transparent European policy on arms exports."
"At the same time, however, a number of shortcomings and flaws have been flagged, five of which I should like mention."
"First of all, the annual reports of the Member States are not harmonised."
"Some countries, including Great Britain and Ireland, give a detailed account of the permits issued and of the amount and value of exported arms."
"Other countries, such as Austria and Greece, give no information whatsoever about the licences issued."
"In that way, an efficient, effective assessment is, of course, difficult."
"The annual report would, therefore, need to meet a number of standards."
"Each permit issued should be accompanied by a detailed description of the material, the addressee and end user."
"For permits refused, the reason for refusal should be explained in more detail."
"Secondly, in my opinion, the monitoring procedures concerning the end user of the exported arms should be stepped up. In Africa, Togo and Burkina Faso are officially the end users of arms supplied from Bulgaria, whilst in reality, these are passed on to Liberia and the rebels of Sierra Leone."
"Embassies of EU Member States could play a more supervisory role in situ."
"Penal measures should also be introduced for transit countries that violate arms embargos."
"Thirdly, I am of the opinion that tighter controls should be in place for the production of military equipment under licence abroad by EU companies or in the framework of industrial joint venture agreements."
"It is not acceptable for a certain country to be refused a licence for weapons and for arms manufacturers to be able to circumvent that ban by supplying arms components which are then assembled on site."
"A fourth shortcoming is that there is no control whatsoever on private arms dealers, the number of which is rising all the time since the end of the cold war."
"Of the five hundred million light arms in circulation worldwide, forty to sixty percent of these are illegal, according to the UN."
"A final serious shortcoming of the EU Code of Conduct is that it is not legally binding."
"At the moment, it is a no-strings-attached gentlemen' s agreement."
"Sanctions cannot be imposed on those who breach the Code."
"Finally, I should like to express the hope that the EU Code of Conduct will form the basis for a worldwide code on the export of arms."
"It makes no sense whatsoever for Europe to be committed to controlling the arms trade, while China and Russia continue to export weapons to crisis areas without any restrictions."
"In that sense, the UN Conference in July was a missed opportunity, and I believe that this topic must remain a permanent feature in the transatlantic dialogue."
"Mr President, Mr Titley has lived up to his reputation and has produced an excellent report on the Code of Conduct concerning arms exports, on which we would like to congratulate him."
"Needless to say, the report receives the full backing of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"That is why I should not so much like to confine myself to the technicalities of the report, but rather to a number of general observations."
"On 11 September, the first reports rolled in about the horrific attacks in the United States during the vote of the Titley report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"The European Union has reacted adequately and coherently."
"All available means are being deployed right across the pillars."
"One would wish for the same promptness of action in other areas too."
"The EU can do anything if it puts its mind to it."
"Where the arms export is concerned, we have to make do with a Code of Conduct which is considerably restricted by Article 296 of the EC Treaty which protects national security interests."
"That is such a vague concept that Member States, if they so wish, can more or less do their own thing."
"In fact, it has never been clear to me in what way national security interests can be different from those of the European Union."
"The arms export agreements are also typified by a large degree of voluntariness, but also, for example, by inconsistent agreements on the end use of exported arms."
"That is why an EU-wide and effective approach is lacking."
"Not all relevant information is made available, which obstructs the transparency of the policy."
"Annual reports are useful, but joint action is preferable, of course."
"Mr Titley' s report mentions a few areas which require attention, such as the destabilising distribution of hand-held weapons."
"That causes great chaos in some parts of the world."
"The trade in these weapons also sustains phenomena such as child soldiers."
"My group would like to turn this into a priority, also in cooperation with the candidate countries, the countries of the Stability Pact and countries such as Ukraine and Russia, for we know that many of the hand-held weapons which are in circulation in the world originate from those countries."
"The EU must make every effort, together with those countries, to tackle the often criminal trade in weapons."
"Here too we require a new international coalition."
"In the light of 11 September, it is important to tighten the agreements on the export of so-called dual-use goods."
"I am curious about the discussions which are undoubtedly already taking place behind the scenes."
"The citizens would like to know how the export policy will be adopted to prevent the wrong expertise from falling into the wrong hands."
"I would quote the reports on terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction in this connection."
"Here too, better cooperation with Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States is necessary."
"What will happen to the export of encryption software?"
"Will new arrangements be made in this connection?"
"The least we can ask from the Council and the Commission is to indicate the role which can improve the organised arms export policy in the fight against terrorism."
"As far as I am concerned, the debate on Article 296 can be re-opened."
"Arms export must form an integral part of the new EU security policy."
"Only then will it be truly effective."
"Mr President, I welcome much of what is in the report, particularly the need for transparency, the issue dealing with the end use of weapons and the illegal trade in arms."
"As Mr Titley mentioned, the control of small arms is important."
"It is a major problem, as we have seen from the tragic events in Switzerland."
"There needs to be a mechanism to control non-military security and police equipment."
"But I do not support the idea of a European defence industry and we need to look at getting rid of the defence industry."
"The recent tragic events in the United States have actually given a shot in the arm to the arms industries."
"I will mention one in particular because it is relevant to Ireland, and that is Raytheon."
"This company has seen a 40% jump in share prices as a result of the events of 11 September and thereafter."
"We must look at the whole issue of arms production in the first place."
"I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that, in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland, Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon, one of the world's biggest arms manufacturing companies."
"It is appalling to encourage manufacturers of weapons, or their components, into a place where people are killing each other every day with weapons so that these products can then be transported to other parts of the world to cause havoc and deprivation."
"We do not want peace here and wars in other parts of the world."
"We should look at ending the trade in weapons completely and the idea of government support for an industry that is responsible for death and destruction around the world is unacceptable."
"As regards torture weapons, we have a situation where these weapons are being sent to certain parts of the world with an EU stamp on them."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"In my own country, Ireland, there has in recent times been an increase in the arms industry, mainly involving US-based arms manufacturing."
"This manufacturing comprises mainly components, but irrespective of whether components or end-use weapons are concerned, we should not accept the production of weapons."
"There are far more beneficial ways of creating employment for people in a given area than the production of something that is used to kill another human being."
"Mr President, in principle our group agrees with the report by Mr Titley, who has done an excellent job in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"There are some aspects of the report that we do not agree with, such as that referring to the defence industry, but, generally speaking, this effort to achieve transparency and for the EU to play a crucial, I would say leading, role in the process of world disarmament and also in achieving peace is positive, and, for this reason, we think that it is a good report."
"However, there are various aspects that could be improved, especially following the sad events of 11 September, since when North America has been promoting the indiscriminate sale of arms to all those it considers to be potential allies in the fight against terrorism."
"We think that this is an appropriate moment to adopt clearly transparent behaviour that would avoid these double standards, and for this reason we, through our colleague Mr Brie, have tabled several amendments which seek specifically to prevent such problems - such as cases, for example, in which arms are indirectly sold to countries that contravene EU agreements through third countries, as is the case, for example, with Turkey, or Israel, bombing or attacking the Palestinians, or Pakistan."
"For this reason it would be a good idea to have more control over these sales."
"We also think that it is important - as stated by Mr Titley in his speech - to include terrorism as an objective."
"Lastly, we also think it imperative, in order to improve transparency, for the Commission itself to draw up a report that clarifies this series of measures so that the role of the EU can be much greater and more decisive in achieving a world at peace and without arms."
"Mr President, those who declare that they are dedicated to fighting terrorism need to cleanse themselves of all hypocrisy and must condemn those who carry out the worst acts of bloodletting under the guise of freedom fighters."
"In Dublin this weekend, Gerry Adams boasted that the IRA campaign of atrocities were the acts of freedom fighters and not the acts of terrorists."
"No wonder The Wall Street Journal the other day carried an article with Adams and bin Laden linked together."
"Actions, not words alone, can cleanse the hands of those nations in Europe which have both armed and furthered the aims of terrorists and have then refused to extradite those criminals for proper trial."
"Mr President, until a few weeks ago, the distinction between conventional weaponry such as light and heavy arms, on the one hand and weapons of mass destruction on the other, in other words, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, seemed relatively clear."
"Now the very concepts of what constitutes a weapon are in doubt, when a civilian aeroplane can become a missile when guided by a murderous ideal."
"We may be tempted to adopt an attitude which is at once relativist, with regard to the means, and ultra-safe, with regard to actions."
"I would say, however, that there is now a greater need than ever to prevent tendencies that are not firmly anchored in politics."
"Particularly at a time when, as is becoming obvious, we need to speed up the construction of our common foreign and security policy, which must be given the appropriate resources and be supported by an effective shared commitment."
"This policy must go ahead on the basis of cohesion, which also means trust between Member States, and of coherence between the ideas that are put forward and practical action."
"We are today discussing an issue, arms exports, to which these principles must be applied, today more than ever before."
"It would, of course, be better if there were no need to discuss weapons, but, unfortunately, the world we live in is not like that."
"The European Union' s Code of Conduct on arms exports adopted in 1999 is a key instrument for harmonisation and control in this field."
"With regard to the Council' s second annual report, on implementing this Code of Conduct, the rapporteur himself welcomes the greater transparency and the convergence between Member States arms exports policies and the adoption of common principles by third countries. He also, however, highlights the need to go further, putting an end to illegal sales and exercising greater control over arms dealers' fees and on the destination of arms."
"I therefore support the thrust of this report, although once again, I wish to emphasise the need for coherence and cohesion in this field."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is naturally useful to have a report on arms trade."
"That is also true of a European Code of Conduct."
"But I hope that the tragic circumstances in which we find ourselves will also galvanise us into action, for example in order to render this Code of Conduct compulsory, as Mr Titley rightly pointed out in his report, and finally to also make progress in supervising the arms trade."
"For although that is what we intend to do, if we have no control over the end-user certificate, it is impossible to check whether that arms trade is legal or not."
"Similarly, the production under licence by EU countries in third countries is another one of such issues."
"Ultimately, we will need to reach the stage where we have black lists of countries to which we do not under any circumstance supply weapons. This will need to be monitored and sanctions will need to be put in place."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Titley on his work and acknowledge his endeavours to include the point of view of civil society on arms exports."
"I would, however, mention certain negative points: firstly, light weapons."
"The UN Conference in July was a failure: in my opinion, the EU should commit itself resolutely once more to enforcing a reduction."
"As regards transparency, I feel that this is still too superficial and that Parliamentary scrutiny should be obligatory for arms exports."
"Then there is no reference to the OCCAT Agreement which actually protects industrial cooperation and is the basis for laws such as Italy' s which make it possible to export arms without infringing human rights rules."
"Then there is an arms exports control policy which must be in line with European common foreign policy."
"In short, I consider the Titley report to be important, but I feel - this is my point of view and is not a criticism of the Titley report - that the European Union should, in these tragic times, set itself the target of disarmament, not rearmament."
"You will excuse me, Commissioner, for addressing you alone, but the Council benches are empty."
"I would like to say that I find the Council report very interesting."
"This Code of Conduct is also of major importance and this debate is very dignified, although we should ask ourselves how much we are actually achieving."
"We must have the courage to go deeper into certain complex issues which are still to be resolved."
"The first of these issues, which has already been mentioned by all those who have spoken, is the need to make this code law, that is to convert it into a legally binding instrument, seeing as, nowadays, everything depends on the good will of the Member States of the European Union, which are even free to decide whether or not to submit an annual report, which not all the Member States have chosen to do."
"Another complex issue which has yet to be resolved is that of a Community system of controlling the end use, the final recipient of the arms exported and the brokers who, in the arms trade, in arms trafficking - the word trafficking may be more appropriate, more to the point - are the real money-makers."
"It is a matter of serious concern that all this is not happening, that we do not have such a control facility, bearing in mind, for example, that the Taliban will probably be fighting in Afghanistan with arms supplied by the West, including some of the countries of the European Union."
"Lastly, the candidate countries."
"What guarantees will we have that the candidate countries will be able to respect this Code of Conduct properly?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as regards these questions, there is only one risk, which is engendered by our hypocrisy in disregarding - as has been pointed out - the great difference between a gentleman' s agreement and a law."
"I will therefore close by reiterating that, until the Code of Conduct becomes law, we will be at fault, and this report' s due reference to the values of democracy and the protection of human rights is likely to be reduced to a mere, ineffective appeal."
"Mr President, the report is more critical on the subject of the export of weapons than any previous report by Mr Titley."
"Despite this, we must observe that its demands do not reach their target either as regards parliamentary scrutiny or as regards transparency."
"As far as parliamentary scrutiny is concerned, there is no demand for formal provision for an opinion by the European Parliament, and that is the least we can ask for if we are to have some degree of influence."
"I take an even more critical line on what is said about transparency."
"Here, Mr Titley speaks of transparency in the form of a framework agreement."
"We know, however, that the framework agreement between six EU States to promote the defence of industry and of a global defence market is precisely the most opaque procedure ever, that it clasps tightly what it used to give: no parliamentary scrutiny and no debate, even on the conclusion and ratification of this agreement."
"That must be changed."
"Mr President, one thing for sure is that the excessive profits reaped by multinationals, especially American multinationals, from manufacturing and selling arms far exceed the profits to be made from drug trafficking or crude oil."
"Tensions, armed conflict and mutual genocide are being provoked and fomented in order to promote the production and consumption of all sorts of arms and munitions, thereby increasing sales and boosting profits."
"And governments have no objection; in fact they are doing their utmost here, given that, as we all know, they cream off huge sums of money from manufacturers supplying arms."
"Whatever Mr Titley's intentions as rapporteur, in today's general climate of militarisation and warmongering, with a new structure to NATO, with the militarisation of the European Union and, more importantly, with the shameless exploitation of the terrorist attack in the United States, codes like this, even if they do not pull the wool over the people's eyes, are no more than a hypocritical wish list."
"We believe that strict controls are needed and that the manufacture of all types of equipment - and not just exports as the report suggests - should be denied, if not banned."
"In the final analysis, however, this is a matter for the popular front, for the global and national peace movement which, as we have seen recently, is burgeoning - and thank God it is."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Titley for another excellent and characteristically intelligent report, which we have read with very great interest."
"As his report and his speech have made clear, the issue of arms exports is tremendously complex and close collaboration is required by everyone in order to address its many different angles."
"There were a number of good speeches in the debate, some of which referred to the relevance of the appalling events of 11 September and their aftermath."
"I should like to respond to what Mr Paisley had to say."
"As he is not in his place, maybe my remarks will be borne to him on angels' wings."
"I agree with the definitional point he made."
"It is an enormously important point for us to make."
"Some of us from Spain or the United Kingdom have personal experience of this; some of us have friends who have been murdered by terrorists."
"There is no such thing as a good terrorist."
"There is no distinction between good and bad terrorism."
"What is a terrorist?"
"A terrorist is a man or woman or, alas, a deluded child who sets out in the morning to murder innocent men, women and children to make a political point - the propaganda of the deed."
"That is not justified."
"It is never justified."
"There are never extenuating circumstances, any more than there are ever extenuating circumstances from extrajudicial killings by a State."
"So I hope that when we start talking about definitions we will remember what terrorism really is."
"We will have views about the political roots of terrorism."
"We will have strong views about the importance of trying to find political solutions to some problems."
"However, I hope we will not be morally confused about what constitutes a terrorist act."
"During the debate on last year's report, I stated that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments."
"However, it is also clear that some aspects of the arms trade lie within the remit of the common foreign and security policy, with which the Commission is fully associated."
"The Commission is making every effort to move forward with the implementation of those recommendations which lie within Community competence and we stand ready to collaborate with Member States where joint responsibilities are involved, for example when one is talking about dual-use goods."
"As Parliament is already aware, the associated countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus, Turkey, Malta, and our EEA/EFTA partners have issued declarations through which they align themselves with the criteria and the principles contained in the European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"The Union has continued to assist the candidates in their efforts to bring their legislation and administration fully into line with the provisions of the code."
"Furthermore, the European Union continues to urge the world's main arms exporters to subscribe to the principles and criteria developed in our code."
"We would react most favourably to the idea of drafting an international code of conduct on arms transactions, on the condition that it is based on the same principles as the European Union code."
"The Commission strongly supports the honourable Member's call for the establishment of common rules for European Union control of the legal trade in small arms and light weapons, as well as effective European Union controls to combat and eradicate trafficking in these arms."
"In this respect we welcome the agreement reached at the July 2001 UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons."
"Although the final text falls well short of the Union's initial expectations, it marks an important step forward."
"It represents a delicate and hard-fought compromise, which would not have been achievable only a couple of years ago."
"If all parties involved were to adopt a more positive attitude, the agreement would become a more effective tool for addressing the concerns of all participants in the future."
"For the first time the international community has set out some principles for national and international measures which might curb the illegal trade in small arms."
"They aim to establish reliable controls on the production, export and transit of weapons; to apply reliable markings to them in order to trace their origin more successfully; to criminalise their unlicensed production and trade; to regulate the activities of brokers; and to destroy surplus stockpiles and all confiscated weapons."
"A new conference will be held no later than 2006 - I suspect that recent events may bring that date forward - and in the intervening period, biennial meetings will consider the progress made on turning the objectives of the conclusions into tangible reality."
"We will work hard with the Member States to ensure an active and ambitious follow-up."
"The European Union's commitment to concrete action in the field of small arms is illustrated by a number of projects currently under way or under consideration in different parts of the world."
"In Cambodia the European Union gives technical, administrative and financial support to the government and selected NGOs for actions aimed at promoting the collection, control and destruction of weapons."
"We also support Operation Rachel, a joint South Africa-Mozambique project, to collect and destroy arms left over since the civil war."
"We provide equipment to the Georgian and Ossetian police forces as part of a programme which consists of the voluntary handover and subsequent destruction of small arms in the region."
"We also support the UN Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Lima, which works to promote the control of small arms in Latin America and the Caribbean."
"We are also considering further projects in the Balkans, Africa and South Pacific."
"During the past few months Commission services have begun drafting EC legislation on a number of non-military items such as instruments of torture, to which the provisions of the code should, in our view, apply."
"Work is now near completion, and the Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council soon."
"This marks a first step in tackling the issue."
"Compilation of a more extended list, which might include items that also have civilian uses - instruments of internal repression such as riot-control equipment, for example - would require the commitment of significant additional resources."
"If we are going to take on such a task - which involves establishing the eventual end use of the items and, perhaps, the identity of the end user - then we shall need more resources."
"However we will, of course, pay careful attention to what Parliament has to say on that issue."
"Progress in that field is conditional on the willingness of Member States and Parliament to make additional resources available for these purposes."
"So I repeat our gratitude to the honourable Member, Mr Titley, for an important report."
"I hope that year by year we can continue to respond constructively to what he has to say."
"Anybody who looks at the violence around the world, the violence often associated with the breakdown of States, from Somalia to Sudan, to Sierra Leone, to Afghanistan; anybody who looks at the situation created by the breakdown of States knows how much the trade and small arms is responsible for continuing the violence and making the violence far more lethal."
"So this report is an important one, and I hope we can respond to it over the coming months and years with appropriately constructive behaviour."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan."
"I shall ask Commissioner Patten to take the floor immediately."
"I should like to begin the Commission's contribution myself and then at the end of the discussion ask Commissioner Nielson to say something about the humanitarian situation in which he has been actively involved because of his responsibility for ECHO."
"If I have to leave before the end of the discussion it is not for lack of appreciation of the importance of what we are discussing - I believe this issue is going to dominate the international agenda for the next few months - but because I have to attend an important meeting before the EU-Russia Summit with the Deputy-Premier of the Russian Federation to discuss the modalities for beginning discussions on a common European economic area."
"We will try to agree the terms of reference of our work this evening before our summit with President Putin tomorrow."
"There will be other reports on the Troika visit that I took part in last week with the Foreign Minister of Belgium, which holds the presidency, and with the Foreign Minister of Spain - the next presidency - which demonstrated our commitment to the issues we were discussing."
"With my friend and colleague Mr Solana we went to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria, all in the space of four-and-a-half action-packed, sleep-free days and nights."
"I should just like to say two or three words about that visit and make two or three points about the political situation in Afghanistan, leaving the humanitarian issues, which are of such compelling importance, to Commissioner Nielson."
"Then I would like to say a word about a draft regulation which the Commission has today adopted."
"The main purposes of the Troika visit were three-fold."
"First of all, we wanted to make the point clearly to the Islamic countries we were visiting that the campaign against terrorism is not a campaign of the West against Islam."
"It is not a campaign of Europe and North America against the poorer countries of the globe."
"It is a campaign of decent governments everywhere against those who would try to make their political point through murder and mayhem."
"It is a fight, in my judgment, between those who stand up in favour of civilisation, of a number of different religious bases and those who represent the forces which have always been opposed to civilised values."
"We made that point strongly in every country we went to."
"For me, it is very important to recognise that if we are to make the point around the world that human rights are universally valid, including the right not to be murdered by terrorists - if we are to make that point successfully around the world - it is very important for us not to give the impression that we have a monopoly of virtue, that we in Europe are perfect when it comes to talking about these matters."
"It is also exceptionally important for us not to concede that human rights bear a different weight according to the continent you are in."
"It feels exactly the same to be tortured, whatever sort of country you are in."
"It is exactly the same if you are locked up as a journalist or an editor because you disagree with the government, whatever country you are in."
"Those sort of rights are universally valid."
"It seems to me that we dilute the integrity of our argument if we give the impression that somehow different civilisations have fundamentally different approaches to human rights."
"The second point we were seeking to make is that out of the appalling events, out of the atrocities of 11 September, we must hope that it is possible for some good to come."
"Adversity sometimes produces an opportunity to be constructive, positive and to build better for the future."
"One thing we said in Pakistan, Iran and elsewhere is that we have a chance now - taking account of the awful things that have happened - of opening some doors and windows which have been closed for too long."
"Thirdly, we say that it is a cliché, a truism when people talk about 11 September to say - rather like the fall of the Berlin Wall - nothing will ever be the same again."
"But it is actually true."
"Nothing will ever be quite the same again."
"One way in which we have to make sure that nothing is ever the same again is to try to ensure this time that multilateralism, that international cooperation, works a great deal more effectively in the wake of those awful events than it perhaps has since the 1940s."
"That is the challenge to us: to make sure that when we discuss conventions against terrorism in the UN, everybody signs them and everybody implements them."
"Those are the sort of practical challenges that we are going to face for weeks and months and years in the future when these events are no longer on the front pages of the newspapers."
"Those were three points that we - the only four-person Troika in the business - were making insistently at each of our stops."
"Concerning the political situation in Afghanistan, which we were able to discuss both in Pakistan and in Iran, there were of course different views of the situation."
"In Iran, for example, there are very strong views about the Taliban."
"That is not surprising given the number of Iranian diplomats that were killed three or so years ago by the Taliban in Afghanistan."
"There is a general agreement that the political situation in Afghanistan remains extremely fluid."
"There are reports from neighbouring countries that the Taliban are in terminal decline."
"There are also reports that speak of some Taliban military successes and of a return to what passes for a sort of grim normality in Kabul."
"The Taliban continue to show no real sign of being ready to give up Osama bin Laden or forcefully to encourage his voluntary departure from the country."
"The opposition Northern Alliance has declared itself ready and willing to assist the United States and international coalition efforts."
"Following the death of Commander Masood on 8 September - and I know he made an important visit to Parliament not long ago - there is greater uncertainty as to the cohesion of this alliance."
"What is certain is that no wholly military solution is possible in Afghanistan."
"In both Pakistan and Iran, where as I said there are very different views of the situation in Afghanistan, there was agreement that only a broad-based government made up of representatives of all factions and ethnic groups in the country, taking account of the security concerns of neighbouring countries, can begin the process of restoring Afghanistan to normality and pave the way for reconstruction."
"The means of doing this may be through the Loya Jirga or Grand Assembly mechanism."
"It would be for the Afghan people to decide what kind of Loya Jirga process they want and what role different political personages might play in such a development."
"I repeat that there is a shared perception of what the outcome should be: a broad-based government."
"How you get to that broad-based government is incomparably more difficult to work out, but there is also a shared perception that the world outside - even in the shape of the United Nations - cannot impose a political settlement on Afghanistan."
"We can and should aim to facilitate a political settlement, and having facilitated it not then walk away."
"We have to make sure that a better government, which will emerge from that sad, embittered country will be able to count on the long-term support of the international community to rebuild from the ruin of the medieval ferocity which has been unleashed on Afghanistan for the last few years."
"I should like to make one other point."
"We have in the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on specific measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism."
"The draft proposal includes all those individuals and organisations potentially related to the 11 September attack covered by the US Executive Order issued by President Bush last week."
"But it takes the form of a framework regulation which could serve as the vehicle for a wider campaign against terrorist financing."
"There is a considerable urgency to this regulation, which is put forward on the basis of Article 308, for reasons which I am sure I do not have to set out for Parliament."
"In these circumstances we would be extremely grateful if Parliament could consider an emergency procedure, if possible completing the consultation process during this week's part-session."
"We would then be able to put the draft regulation to the General Affairs Council next Monday."
"I know that the President of the Commission will be writing to you on these lines, Madam President."
"We understand the difficulties."
"We do not want in any way to curtail examination of this important measure; but if it could be done very rapidly it would send the right signals."
"It would be an opportunity to demonstrate that in exceptional circumstances the Community institutions can act with real despatch."
"Not only would we thereby signal the strength of our determination to rise to the challenges presented by the 11 September attack, but we would show that the EU institutions are able to respond to crisis situations."
"I will finish my remarks with that point."
"So far, in the proposals brought forward by my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, a couple of weeks ago, we have demonstrated that though we are sometimes the butt of people's humour about the lack of speed of our reactions, when it really matters we are able to react very rapidly and comprehensively and we are able to demonstrate in practice what multilateralism should mean."
"If there is any institution in the world, if there is any group of countries in the world that can demonstrate the benefits of multilateralism, of arguing about fish quotas or budgets, rather than murdering one another, it is the European Union."
"That seems to me to give us a particular responsibility to show leadership in the coming weeks and months and I hope we will be able to do so with this regulation this week."
"Madam President, as Mr Patten stated, with four aircraft carriers heading towards the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, the very least that can be said of the situation in Afghanistan is that it is uncertain."
"Even the President of Pakistan - a country where over the last few days there have been huge demonstrations of support for the Taliban regime - has unambiguously stated that the days of the regime are numbered."
"The offer to open up the government of three Afghan provinces and the exodus of people fleeing the country to avoid being mobilised against potential intervention by the international alliance clearly suggest that this is true."
"If, to this fact we add the decision made yesterday in Rome to create a Supreme Council of National Unity instructed to form a provisional government and name a Head of State, we can truly arrive at the conclusion that the situation in Afghanistan is changing from one day to the next."
"So, Madam President, in this context, what attitude should the European Union adopt?"
"Well, in my opinion, the European Union, faced with the crisis situation in this region, should present itself as an element of stability and moderation."
"The EU should contribute to the establishment of a democratic government in Afghanistan."
"The EU should encourage the full application in that country of respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, which the Taliban regime refuses to acknowledge, as proposed by the mission led by Commissioner Patten and the Troika."
"At the same time, the European Union has to sign up to the international alliance referred to yesterday by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at their General Assembly."
"Lastly, Madam President, the European Union should give its support to an enormous humanitarian task."
"We should not forget that 25% of the 22 million Afghans will survive thanks exclusively to international aid."
"However, Madam President, it is important that the European Union does not commit a series of errors."
"Firstly, that of supporting governments that do not have sufficient popular support, as happened in the first Afghan crisis a decade ago."
"Secondly, the European Union should not commit the error of carrying out indiscriminate actions and of not pursuing tangible objectives."
"For we should not forget, Madam President, that our objective should not be to dominate a country that certainly holds a strategic position, but not to encourage the action of extremist elements that could cause the overthrow of regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Egypt that would make Bin Laden a martyr or a political military leader or, something that would be far more serious, a religious or spiritual leader."
"I think that in conclusion, Madam President, we need to give our total support to Mr Patten' s proposal and behave with maximum diligence and efficiency to support the Commission' s proposals today."
"Madam President, Afghanistan is a country with an average income per inhabitant of USD 800."
"This statistic makes it the poorest country in Asia and the world' s fifth poorest country."
"There are some five million people who rely on food programmes."
"Millions of people live on the Iranian side of the border, millions of others live on the Pakistani side."
"The borders are now closed, but it is expected that another million people will end up fleeing."
"The hands of the WFP and UNHCR are tied, for they cannot work in that country."
"There are a few other international NGOs which boast sound structures and can offer aid."
"Over the past few years, the Commission has granted a great deal of aid via the ECHO programme."
"I should like to hear Commissioner Nielson give us an extensive account on this in a moment."
"We know that we are extremely limited in what we can do."
"We, as Europe, must do more."
"We cannot cross the borders."
"We can use the structure in the country to some extent."
"UNHCR and WFP are in the same boat."
"I would actually like to echo Mr Lubbers, the High Commissioner of UNHCR who stated that 'in fact, we also need a new coalition which can cope, as it were, with the huge humanitarian tragedy which is unfolding before our eyes' ."
"I am consciously disassociating myself from tomorrow' s debate on security issues that is much broader still."
"I should now like to home in on this particular region, however."
"We will need to take action in Iran."
"We, together with UNHCR, will also need to take action in Pakistan."
"We will need to do this as Europe."
"To date, each of our Member States has failed to earmark sufficient funding."
"They are dallying and dithering."
"The European Union has taken sound initiatives in that respect, for which I should like to praise Commissioner Nielson and the Commission, but now is the time to build this coalition."
"For if we are not able to tackle this humanitarian issue jointly, we will be presented with the political bill in due course."
"You are dividing the world into two."
"You are on your own side but not on ours."
"It is not 'them' or 'they' , but it is our joint responsibility to act in that region."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group, I hope that the Commission, in close cooperation with all those involved, the international NGOs, UNHCR, WFP, in Iran, in Pakistan, with the political initiatives which Commissioner Patten indicated a moment ago, manages to send out that signal on time: a new coalition for humanitarian aid in the region."
"Madam President, Commissioner Patten correctly said that we have no quarrel with Islam."
"I say that we have a quarrel with those who abuse Islam and who turn the principles of Islam into weapons against the innocent."
"In the same way, we have no quarrel with the Afghan people."
"Our quarrel is with bin Laden who shelters in Afghanistan and with the Taliban, they seem to be almost one and the same, and we pity the situation of the Afghan people."
"They are already one of the poorest nations upon Earth."
"Two million Afghan refugees are sheltering in the Islamic Republic of Iran and they have been for some years now."
"It is sad to see how little international help has been given to those refugees or to their hosts, the Iranian government."
"These refugees fled acute starvation and utter brutality in Afghanistan to find a haven in Iran and there are huge numbers of new refugees now on the move."
"The psychological terror that our new alliance has properly caused against terrorism in the region is causing the new flight of so many new millions of refugees."
"We must ask ourselves, how we can save lives?"
"We have always supported NGOs."
"We have perhaps given less interinstitutional support."
"I plead here to the Commission to look closely at how best to involve our work with that of the United Nations, particularly UNHCR and the World Health Organization, for only the UN, can command the volumes of support that are needed in such a situation, in terms of food, clothing, shelter and the provision of basic needs."
"I ask the Commission to assist the refugees who have already fled and are in situ elsewhere."
"May I also include the 3.5 million Iraqi refugees in the region."
"We must do all we can to help."
"Madam President, with regard to the humanitarian dimension of this disaster, I fully concur with Mr Van den Berg."
"However, I would like to add one more aspect, which is at the same time a question, a question to the Council, who are not here."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a question instead."
"A special area of concern when granting aid is the protection of the aid workers."
"It is extremely dangerous to grant the necessary aid."
"Is the Commission aware of any European countries being prepared to provide those aid workers military back-up?"
"Next, I should like to turn my attention to the political relationship between the EU and Afghanistan."
"What is that relationship not?"
"Let us be clear about that too."
"It does not aim to arm the Northern Alliance."
"Neither does it aim to overthrow the Taliban by military force or play the role of Florence Nightingale, caring for the wounded and displaced once the American big brother has smashed everything to smithereens."
"So what is - or what should be - the role of the European Union?"
"Allow me to quote three examples."
"Firstly, I believe it would be beneficial if the European Union, as in the past two, three weeks, were to exercise its moderating influence on the United States, so as to prevent any unnecessary civilian victims from being claimed when the Taliban are brought down."
"This is an extremely important condition for any broad coalition in future."
"Secondly, I strongly urge the United States and Europe not to make the same mistake as we did fifteen years ago, when we supported the mujahedin in the fight against the Russian presence in Afghanistan by filling the country with arms and then walking away."
"That is not acceptable."
"Mr Joschka Fischer, Germany' s Foreign Affairs Minister, put this across very articulately, in my opinion, when he said that we can no longer afford any black holes on the global map."
"Next, I should like to move on to my most important point."
"In my opinion, any aid, whether it be military, financial, political or economic, now and in future, to the Afghan opposition, whether it be royal or not, should be typified by at least one aspect, namely that this aid should be conditional."
"It is not acceptable for Afghanistan to be lumbered with another regime which fails to observe democracy and human rights."
"As far as I am concerned, the lesson we should draw from the cold war is, or should be, that not every enemy of our enemy is our friend."
"It is friends, in particular, that need to be alerted in an open and critical manner to respecting democracy and human rights."
"And that should therefore apply to any aid to any Afghan opposition."
"Finally, if the Taliban are fought or overthrown in the name of fighting a strange regime which has been repressing human rights for the past five years, for example where women' s rights are concerned, then that is a fair motivation for this fight in my view, but we then also need to be consistent, and this must also apply to other countries in the region."
"It is unacceptable for a country such as Saudi Arabia to escape our attention, because it now forms part of our coalition, for that country too violates human rights and operates an anti-democratic regime."
"In my opinion, the real consequences of 11 September can only be drawn if we display the honesty to tackle that country and that region. Only then will we have a truly justifiable argument against the objection which is currently being heard in that region that our anxiety with regard to Afghanistan would be one of selective indignation."
"Madam President, I am able, as it were, to take up where my esteemed fellow MEP, Mr Lagendijk left off."
"Who is it we are cooperating with when we wish to strengthen democracy and combat totalitarian regimes, and what is it we are cooperating about?"
"In the course of the next few days, we shall no doubt become much clearer about what is possible."
"We still do not know, of course, how the United States will react."
"We still do not know whether the United States will choose to use violent methods and first and foremost seek revenge, or whether we shall in actual fact be given the opportunity to engage in a radical fight against terrorism following the terrible events of 11 September."
"With regard, however, to the issue of whom we are to cooperate with, I would urge us to focus upon the very special circumstance that what we have here is a population exposed to violent oppression and that we must be alert to the fact that half of this population is doubly oppressed."
"I am talking about the female portion of the population."
"I should like to emphasise that there are in actual fact women' s organisations which are still attempting, in Afghanistan too, to fight for women' s rights."
"One of these organisations, RAWA, is trying to create the opportunity for both boys and girls to go to school, and we know of course that illiteracy is very high in Afghanistan - 96% in the case of women and 72% in the case of men - so that this is in itself a useful thing to fight for."
"They are also attempting to put some documentation together and to do some fact-finding in Afghanistan so that those of us outside the situation have a chance of actually knowing what is going on."
"When we find out, it is up to us to use that knowledge, and I should like to call upon us to do just that: to use the knowledge that there are courageous women, committed to democracy, and to cooperate with them in our attempt to eradicate the breeding grounds for terrorism in, for example, Afghanistan."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the response to recent events must be broken down into several different parts, and I will not focus on internal security or military solutions, seeing as I clearly do not have the necessary 'intelligence' , nor will I concentrate on humanitarian responses, for I am sure that the European Union and the international community as a whole will be able to respond generously, effectively and competently, as they have always done in the past."
"The problem is not one of humanitarian efficiency or effectiveness, which have been proven for a long time now, but rather of deciding what political response to make to the matter at hand."
"I am happy to be able to say this here in this Chamber because Parliament and the European Commission have been the only, rare exceptions among the institutions to pay constant attention to the issue of Afghanistan: in recent years, Parliament has been able to present to the Member States and the Council of Ministers a whole range of political and other suggestions."
"We can only lament the fact that we were never heeded and our suggestions never taken up or even considered."
"We have been trying to draw attention to the indisputable problem of the tragic violation of human rights for years and, since 1997, the Commission and the European Parliament have also been reiterating that there is a problem of terrorism and drugs in Afghanistan, that is, a major geopolitical problem."
"All we can do is lament the indifference shown by the major international institutions."
"At the present moment, however, I feel that we have to make a choice: there are moments in history when one has to stop hesitating and take sides, and if we are to do so we must not side with religious fanaticism, dictatorships or some other form of nationalism, but with the liberal democracies - with all their failings and imperfections, admittedly - but also with all their power and their capacity to operate systems which are better equipped to protect human rights in the world."
"My concern is the political response."
"I fear that it would be a mistake to think that our only enemy is terrorism and, in particular, possibly just Osama Bin Laden."
"The issue is much more complex than that: our current enemy is that explosive mixture of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships based on religious fanaticism."
"We must make an effort and go deeper into the matter rather than simply believing that if we catch Osama Bin Laden - which would be right and proper and is a legitimate, necessary thing to do - then the problem will be resolved."
"A 'holy alliance' to combat terrorism is being formed, made up of a collection of unlikely, not to say dubious allies: there are a number of regimes which are likely to join this alliance, each for its own reasons, each maybe drawing up a list of its own genuine or alleged terrorists with the aim of suppressing its own dissidents, who may well be non-terrorist, democratic individuals."
"We must be careful not to put everything under the same umbrella indiscriminately."
"I wonder whether it would not make more sense and be more useful to create a world organisation of democracy, of liberal democracy as we know it - and, once again, I do not deny any of its shortcomings - for I feel that this is the institution which we should envisage in the medium term."
"Today, when we talk about women or violation or female genital mutilation, we have no organisation to turn to for help."
"This is the great challenge before us: to create, export and promote democracy and freedom."
"Madam President, the people in Afghanistan, as well as the entire civilised world, stand to benefit from a drastic end to the Taliban regime."
"At home, the Taliban keep the country under a reign of mental terror and prefer continuing the civil war to relieving acute famines."
"Viewed from outside, their prompt departure from the political stage deserves the highest commendation, because the Taliban export terrorism."
"The handiwork of their guest Osama bin Laden is a case in point, as is the fact that they export narcotics on a large scale."
"However, Afghan history and today' s political reality prove that the Taliban can only be driven out by internal opposition forces."
"That is why we deem the present Afghanistan strategy of the American administration to provide financial and material aid to the broadest possible coalition against the Taliban around the king in exile, Zahir Shah, to be the most plausible foreign contribution to this political and military tour de force."
"That is why I call on Europe to lend its unconditional support to this strategy."
"We are also delighted by the fact that President Bush has earmarked USD 100 million by way of aid for the immense damage incurred to the Afghan refugees."
"May this gesture of compassion with the suffering Afghan people be the first step towards a Marshall plan for this country that has been completely razed to the ground by sustained armed violence."
"In that way, the international community can discharge itself from its share of the blame for the present situation in Afghanistan and raise a dam against Muslim terrorism and drugs."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as I take the floor in this debate, I would be failing in my duty if I did not pay homage, as you have done Madam President, to the memory of Commander Ahmed Shah Masood."
"A number of our Members had the opportunity to meet him here just six months ago, at your invitation, and we discovered that not only was he a man of war famous for his tactics and his exceptional charisma, but he could also be a statesman, and a man of peace and reconciliation, the peace and reconciliation for which his country has been waiting for more than thirty years."
"My hope today is that this man, my friend, who said that he was prepared to give his life for the sake of the people of Afghanistan, will not have died for nothing."
"Obviously I regret the fact that he was not listened to sooner when he asked for international aid to rid his country of the iron rule of the Taliban, and when he condemned the development of that totalitarian movement of Islamic fundamentalism flaunting its desire for world domination."
"What Mr Patten has just told us about the political situation in Afghanistan confirms my analysis that Commander Masood' s plan for solving the crisis in Afghanistan could be well underway."
"Now that Pakistan has been obliged to stop giving political and military support to the Taliban regime, that regime should collapse under the pressure of the whole of the Afghan people, as Commander Masood predicted."
"I think that proof of this has been provided by the agreement that has just been signed in Rome between the opposition forces and the former King Mohammed Zahir Shah, whose prestige is still as great as ever in his home country."
"I also see proof of this in the statements made by Mullah Omar himself, when he announced yesterday that he might possibly be overthrown, and finally in the news that has just reached us about the defection, with seven hundred of his militia men, of the Taliban governor of the Javan region on the border with Turkmenistan, which has brought the province of Badghis under opposition control."
"Carried away by the idea of realpolitik, the international community, and with it, I am sorry to say, the European Union, had adopted an attitude towards the Taliban that was at the very least conciliatory, working on the principle that they exercised the real power and that they could not do so without the support of the whole of the Afghan people."
"At the time I compared this attitude with the attitude that the Western governments thought they ought to adopt towards the Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge before their abominable barbarism became apparent."
"Thanks to that same blind tolerance, we have allowed this hornets' nest of Islamic terror to develop on Afghan territory."
"Its evil deeds were denounced by Commander Masood, and it must now be destroyed, something which I hope will happen very soon."
"However, for the sake of destroying a hornets' next it should not be necessary to burn down the whole house."
"On the contrary, it is essential that the Afghan people should be spared, and given all the assistance, of whatever kind, that they need in order to establish a stable regime based on national reconciliation."
"I have the feeling - and Mr Patten has just reinforced it - that this is the direction in which the Union' s efforts are heading, and I welcome this, but I do not forget the disastrous humanitarian situation that prevails in the region as a whole."
"I am thinking of the hundreds of thousands of refugees waiting at the border with Pakistan, and also of the people who for months now have been completely without supplies in the northern provinces."
"I know that the Russians have set up an airlift for emergency humanitarian aid, operating from the airport at Dushanbe in Tajikistan."
"I would not like to see the European Union conspicuous by its absence in this undertaking, in which its assistance is also desirable."
"What these people want is, of course, food, but in addition they want medicines, blankets and shelters, and above all they want us to demonstrate our solidarity."
"In Bosnia, at the height of the crisis, Europe, acting within the Atlantic Alliance, was able to set up a scheme for parachuting supplies into the most isolated enclaves, those that were at greatest risk."
"This is what the people of Panshir are now expecting."
"Have we, and have you, Commissioner Nielson, the will and the means to provide it?"
"Madam President, I am very much in agreement with the majority of what has been said on this matter and I shall, therefore, not repeat what other speakers have said."
"I do think, however, that all of it should be taken into account, given that the whole world is waiting to see the European Union' s reaction."
"It seems to me that, given the condemnation of the situation in Afghanistan that this Parliament has already issued, and given the danger of the reduction in civil liberties, we have to remain united, as Commissioner Patten has said, and present a united front against terrorism."
"I am also worried, however, by something else that has already been said: the tragic situation that has arisen since these attacks."
"On the one hand there is the Afghan population, which is facing a serious crisis, as was very clearly stated by the Joint Committee of the FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) that recently visited Afghanistan, and which has said that, at this moment in time, the country is suffering widespread starvation due to a serious crisis in agricultural production, that could cause the death of a huge number of people."
"To this we must add the continuing danger to the farming population posed by the antipersonnel mines scattered throughout the country and the situation of the thousands of refugees in bordering countries - not only in Pakistan and Iran, but also in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan I would like to point out - that have to be dealt with."
"However, what also worries me - and it is on this that I would like to focus, Madam President - is the situation of the populations in all the other developing countries, particularly the African countries, who will suffer the worst economic consequences of this crisis."
"According to information from the World Bank, the terror attacks condemn ten million more people to poverty, as a result of economic slowdown and, particularly, from the loss of income due to decreased exports, a reduction in tourism, falling prices, etc."
"It is true, Madam President, that the European Union and this Parliament now have to form a strong coalition against terrorism."
"But we should also consider - and this would send a signal to the whole world - an international coalition against the poverty, misery and despair of millions of citizens across the world who very often seek protection from the very fanatics who organise these acts of terrorism."
"I would, therefore, ask that, alongside this coalition against terrorism, we also send a signal, chiefly to the peoples of Africa and Asia, stating our desire to build a coalition against misery, poverty and despair."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the delegation of the European Parliament for relations with Central Asia, I should expressly like to draw your attention to what is happening in countries such as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan."
"These countries have been, and will be, the first to be affected by the refugee problem as a result of what is now happening in Afghanistan and in that part of the world."
"There is, therefore, an unqualified need for European consultation on the provision of emergency aid, something which Mr Morillon was quite right to point out."
"Central Asia is a vulnerable and very fragile region."
"It is a vulnerable region economically speaking, in terms of respect for human rights and in terms of the fabric of the civil society and democratic institutions."
"It is a region which, for years, has required our support in the fight against fundamentalism and the drugs trade."
"That is why we need to ensure that we lend sufficient support to that region."
"And what do we do?"
"In the 2002 budget, we cut back the budgetary resources allocated to that region."
"I therefore urge the MEPs of the Committee on Budgets, together with the entire plenary session, to rectify that budget and to give Central Asia what it is entitled to."
"This is my urgent plea."
"Madam President, we are facing a war against terrorism that all freedom-loving people must embrace."
"As you know, I was born in a country that understands terrorism, with 65 000 dead - please remember that the LTT suicide bombers in Sri Lanka are not Muslims - but the world has so far turned a blind eye on twenty-three years of terrorism."
"The tragedy of 11 September has finally focused the attention of those that love democracy and freedom on the cancer that hides within."
"The cancer of terrorism. A cancer that is fed, not by religion, but by greed, hate, envy and ignorance."
"In Afghanistan, the 1963 Constitution as promulgated by King Zahir Shah is an exemplary document."
"I salute my colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, for taking the initiative to lead a delegation to Rome to initiate a coalition between the King and the Northern Alliance, which I am happy to say has now been signed, as General Morillon has just mentioned."
"I want to congratulate General Morillon on inviting Shah Masood here, so that in April we had a chance to meet him."
"The 1963 Constitution states that liberty is a natural right of each human being - this right has no limitations except the liberty of others, but freedom of thought and expression is invaluable - that every Afghan has a right to print and publish ideas, that education is a right of every Afghan and shall be provided, free of charge, by the State, and that work is a right of every Afghan who has the capability to do it."
"What a far cry this is from the tragedy existing in Afghanistan today, where women are beaten, denied education, kept at home as slaves and with one in eight dying in childbirth."
"It is a State run by ignorance using the stick of religion, of which they know little, to cower and terrorise their own people."
"The war against terrorism is a war to free the people of Afghanistan from the twenty-eight years of slavery."
"I salute President Bush and the British Prime Minister for their determination - shoulder-to-shoulder with a Democratic Party and Ian Duncan Smith, the leader of the Conservative Party who was here in Parliament today - to defeat and eradicate international terrorism."
"But this must not be a purely Anglo-Saxon affair."
"If the EU and this House are to be anything at all, they must have an involvement in ensuring this most basic of human activities; the right to live without being terrorised, the freedom to live without the daily sudden threat of death."
"We should not think that we in Europe are not targets."
"We already know of plans to attack Genoa, Paris and elsewhere."
"When will we learn that is our war too?"
"Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Commissioner Nielson, I would firstly like to pay tribute to the thousands of innocent victims in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, victims of an attack on our principles, on our democracy, on our system of freedoms, on our way of understanding peaceful coexistence, on our economy, an attack, at the end of the day, on tolerance between peoples and ideas."
"The European response has for once been fast and immediate in the case of this Parliament."
"The response of the Commission and the Council has also been quick, as Commissioner Patten has just reminded us with regard to the mission by the Troika."
"This is a response that should be firm, forceful, proportionate and selective, in cooperation with the United Nations, and which requires political, military and police measures by the intelligence, diplomatic, legal and economic services which have, in one form or another, already been or are in the process of being adopted."
"These must be measures that can be adopted and upheld in the short, medium and long term."
"I have to remind you that the magnitude and gravity of events is such that the decisions taken here a few days ago that have still not been implemented have already been superseded by events."
"I remember several opinions expressed here by various speakers on the occasion of the Watson report on the European Union search and arrest order just three weeks ago."
"Mr Massoud, who came to visit us a short while ago, has been assassinated and so will not be able to see to fruition the objectives he spoke to us about here in Parliament."
"As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would call for the implementation of a major humanitarian aid programme that must be put in place immediately to help the millions of displaced persons and refugees in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the region."
"The humanitarian disaster that is on the horizon could be of a greater scale than any that has taken place in the past as a result of human barbarity."
"I shall conclude, Madam President, by stating that the fight against poverty in the world, that we have highlighted on numerous occasions, is now particularly relevant and that we should make it one of our top priorities if we want to solve this problem in the short, medium and long term."
"Madam President, the terrible pictures from New York exactly three weeks ago today have entered our souls to stay."
"The speedy declarations of solidarity by Europe and the NATO allies have not been forgotten."
"Now that the USA has demonstrated that it is not engaging in cowboy politics, but is giving very serious consideration to every step in the fight against the terrorists, we must not leave it to later to convey our thanks and appreciation across the Atlantic."
"But what is being done in comparison?"
"Take us in Germany as an example: we find fault with the USA and make so bold as to set up rules of conduct."
"We are already distancing ourselves from the USA, and an objectionable anti-Americanism occasionally puts in an appearance."
"As a German European, I am ashamed of this, bearing in mind also that around 100 Germans were murdered in New York on 11 September."
"I can understand why the USA, despite the announcement today that this is an issue for the Alliance as a whole, does not want, if possible, to involve its 19 NATO partners in the military counter-attack against the terrorists and their accomplices, with the exception of Great Britain."
"You cannot fight and win a campaign with doubters - and I say that as an officer in the Parachute Reservists."
"This is evidence of Europe's incapacity, all the more so as the wrecked twin towers in New York have their counterparts all over the EU."
"Afghanistan may well be a target for the USA's counter-attack."
"The inhabitants of this country battered over decades are leaving their homeland in droves, eking out an existence in refugee camps in Pakistan."
"These people deserve the complete solidarity of the EU and of our Parliament."
"Aid from the EU should be unbureaucratic and be given swiftly, bearing in mind that winter is very hard over there."
"If we do not help now, it is to be feared that the many young refugees there will be easy prey for one fundamentalist or another."
"The European Parliament should consider the advisability of sending a delegation of members of this Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation to Pakistan as soon as possible."
"Impressions gained directly from experience are always better than voluminous reports."
"Madam President, Afghanistan must be the ultimate example of a tragic and failed State and yet, in spite of this, the will exists for it to remain a unitary State across the ethnic divide."
"It has now suffered 28 years of communist dictatorship, followed by fanatic Islamic theocracy, turning it into a pariah State as the Taliban harbours terrorists and executes thousands."
"There are over 2 million refugees outside the country and some 5 million internally displaced persons, many of whom may flee if hostilities break out between the US and its allies and Afghanistan itself."
"The World Food Programme is hampered by difficult terrain, destroyed infrastructure and Taliban policies which prevent female participation, and which have led to the arbitrary arrest of aid workers on charges of religious proselytising and a ban on communications with the outside world, so essential to an international aid programme."
"In spite of this, some 218 tonnes of food got through to Kabul last week to avert a crisis."
"It is clear that the West must now think of what can be done post-Taliban to bring permanent stability to the country."
"Last week, with two of my fellow MEPs, I was privileged to meet in Rome, the former King of Afghanistan, who has lived in the European Union for much of his life."
"We were the first Western elected politicians to visit the royal household since the crisis."
"He demonstrated a supreme sense of patriotism and duty to his estranged country, and went as far as to say that he would serve Afghanistan in any capacity his people chose through their assembled tribal council, or Loya Jirga, which he has been working on for the last two years."
"He confirmed that he has now received key support from the opposition United Front/Northern Alliance forces and will facilitate an internal settlement appropriate to his country."
"He is the only acceptable Afghan figure who can unite all the warring factions and demonstrated the ability, when he ruled his country between 1933 and 1973, to rule constitutionally with tolerance and moderation, even using the English model of sport as a way to unite the disparate ethnic groups."
"It was clear to me that Zahir Shah, in spite of his advanced age, was both cogent and fit enough to do the job, after conducting a lengthy one-and-a-half-hour interview with myself and my colleagues."
"He has also wisely distanced himself from the restoration of the monarchy as an issue, leaving this to his people to decide."
"I urge this House to support the King's mission in this tricky area."
"Madam President, I condemn without reservation terrorism and murder."
"I agree with my colleagues that there is no reason for it and no-one has a right to carry out such acts."
"Terrorists choose violence rather than the ballot box, inflicting death and pain on innocent civilians, justifying their actions by flying the banner of religion, race or political sovereignty."
"Islam, like other great world religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, is a way of life for over one thousand million people in this world."
"These millions of Muslims, from Indonesia to Nigeria, from Central Asia to the leafy suburbs of California, knew nothing about Osama bin Laden before 11 September."
"For these millions and for Islam there is no place for terrorists like him or any others, whoever they are and wherever they come from."
"These terrorists have no authority to act on behalf of any people, race or religion."
"Therefore, we must fight terrorism and act against terrorists, not innocent civilians who pursue their lives peacefully and who should have the freedom to believe in a religion of their choice."
"Human life is precious and the death of innocent civilians, wherever it occurs, is simply not acceptable."
"Reason without passion is sterile, passion without reason is heat."
"Let us be firm and decisive."
"Let us target terrorism: let us remove the causes that conceive, feed and sustain terrorism."
"Madam President, the situation was already bad and now it is worse."
"I totally agree with what has been said this afternoon on the situation of the people in Afghanistan."
"We put Afghanistan on the list of so-called forgotten crises when we fixed ECHO's programme and priorities for 2001."
"We had a spending level of some EUR 23 million, which would have covered the continuation until New Year of the very last activity that we were funding there."
"In fact we had 29 European NGOs delivering humanitarian aid inside Afghanistan."
"They were all there on 11 September."
"On 11 September I was on my way to a mission to Afghanistan and to Pakistan."
"I was supposed to meet Dr Masood, the Taliban leadership and to go around the whole country seeing the work of these NGOs that we are funding."
"I had to cancel the trip."
"The morning after, we took the train back from London to Brussels but our luggage was already in the aeroplane for Islamabad."
"Now, as I said, the situation is worse."
"Winter is approaching."
"Winter is such a dominating feature of reality there that even in normal years military fighting more or less stops simply because getting around is so difficult."
"So humanitarian aid now faces a really scary challenge."
"The international staff of the different aid agencies and NGOs have all been withdrawn from the country."
"However, it is very encouraging to see that the local staff is continuing to distribute food - if the food has not been taken over by the Taliban - and is still running health clinics and providing education where it is possible."
"Obtaining real, true information is extremely difficult, but we can see that they are trying to keep these activities going even in this situation."
"Of course the threat of an outside attack has resulted in large movements of population."
"This also has the effect that we cannot rely on people accessing the different storage centres for food as they used to, because they have fled into the countryside in their millions and lost the access to food they had in the cities."
"So the internal situation is extremely bad and the people who make it to the border look even weaker than they did before."
"Some six million Afghanis are considered to be totally dependent on food supplies from the outside."
"If no planting is possible before the winter sets in - and this is most probable - we are in for a very serious threat within less than half a year, even if things work out well in terms of stability."
"The very logistics of what is needed down the line, even on the basis of the best case scenario, pose a formidable challenge."
"We have supported the different UN organisations very actively, and participated at the meeting of the Afghan support group in Berlin on 27 September."
"The UN has launched a UN-donor alert in support of emergency assistance."
"The alert calls for some USD 580 million from now until March next year to ensure that delivery of humanitarian assistance and the protection of what is estimated to be around 7.5 million Afghans."
"USD 120 million is required immediately."
"Funding of this appeal would, in fact, seem to be less of a problem than the overall question of accessibility to internally displaced people and refugees."
"There are conflicting views in the discussion as to whether emphasis should be placed on keeping the additional migratory flows within Afghanistan or on encouraging Pakistan and Iran to open their borders, as the UNHCR intends to do."
"My personal analysis of this is that we are only able to influence the choice of these people to a very small degree."
"Things may happen and we will have to be very flexible in order to be able to do what we need to do as things develop."
"We have never had to draw up a contingency plan with so few given elements and so many unknowns."
"The need to keep food aid going was central to the discussion at this Afghan group meeting."
"Everybody agreed on the urgency, but concurred that the prospects for actually delivering such aid were quite poor."
"Most participants argued that food-aid distribution without the presence of expatriates could expose Afghan partners to undue risk."
"My earlier reference to Afghan local staff continuing to do what they did before the expatriates had to leave relates to deliveries of existing food and other stocks."
"It is a far more difficult and demanding task to manage the convoys of new supplies coming in, given the internal situation that exists today."
"Things are different in the north-eastern part controlled by the Northern Alliance and in the rest of the country."
"But from the humanitarian point of view it is quite evident that our activities must be targeted at the whole country."
"That is how it must be."
"We are using three financial tools to fund the aid to the Afghan population."
"First - and this is to set the record straight - over the past ten years we have provided humanitarian aid of more than EUR 400 million to internally displaced persons in Afghanistan and refugees in neighbouring countries: ECHO funds, drought mitigation and response activities like food aid, agricultural rehabilitation, water and sanitation rehabilitation, assistance to internally displaced persons and to refugees in Pakistan, as well as prevention of displacements and support for returnees."
"So this is more than just food aid."
"ECHO and the organisations working with our money have managed to build up a portfolio of meaningful activities that they have been able to continue."
"I add that one unfortunate international case is not representative of the situation of the 29 organisations that the Commission is funding."
"It is a difficult situation but it is important to note that the organisations we are funding cannot be accused of the same kind of activity."
"They were able to work with expatriates until 11 September and to build up a portfolio of activity, which I was very much looking forward to coming to see."
"I pay tribute also to my predecessor in this job for laying the seeds of this kind of good cooperation with the European humanitarian NGOs."
"We have, this year, committed EUR 23 million to ECHO, channelled through NGOs and different UN agencies."
"As I said, this would have covered a continuation of this level of activity until the end of the year."
"Then this terrible act of terrorism took place."
"We reacted immediately with an additional EUR 4 million."
"This is committed for action through the World Food Programme, UNHCR, and the International Red Cross."
"Now our response has to go beyond this."
"We will approach the budgetary authority in order to get the green light for accessing and using funds from the emergency budget reserve, as in earlier years when ECHO's normal budget did not cover the needs that arose because of terrible events."
"We announced EUR 25 million a week ago in the Commission."
"It will form part of this operation and be directed at the immediate situation of the refugees."
"We will be asking for more money. But this is covered by the normal procedure for accessing additional money."
"The second line of support is EC aid to uprooted people."
"Here we fund activities creating environments conducive to a sustainable resettlement of returnees and activities aimed at persuading people to remain in their villages."
"This budget line will commit funds from October for a budget of EUR 19 million in Afghanistan, EUR 3 million in Pakistan and EUR 2 million in Iran."
"Funds are channelled through Afghan NGOs and UN agencies."
"The third line is EC food aid and food security."
"Since the beginning of this year this line has committed 30 000 tonnes of food aid to the World Food Programme and 7 000 tonnes to NGOs."
"A further EUR 7 million is now being requested by the Commission for the WFP Afghan programme."
"Let me address some of the questions that have been asked."
"Mrs Nicholson mentioned that we should do more through UNHCR and WHO to broaden the broad basis and improve the organisation of this assistance."
"In relation also to Mr Van den Berg's remarks, from a commercial management point of view, if you will, the operation in Afghanistan is a good case of cooperation between the UN organisations and those very professional and relatively big and specialised NGOs which, for some years now, have formed part of the operation."
"What we need now are operational plans for concrete action."
"We hear in the media now about a convoy getting through the Khyber Pass and going north."
"This is a 'pilot scheme' , so to speak, which may also progress towards Kabul and on, to try to see what is possible."
"But there is no overall plan in place; this was a response to the UNHCR proposals in the discussion with donors for better planning so as to know what to do and not be burdened down with red tape, as Mr Knolle called it."
"This is not the problem."
"I would go as far as to say that in general this is not the problem with our work in the humanitarian aid area."
"Please keep in mind that the totality of ECHO's budget is used every year and this year we are coming to you asking for more because of this situation."
"The red tape here is minimal."
"Protection was mentioned."
"Here we are in a terrible dilemma."
"We cannot push those voluntary organisations that work with our money into doing something that goes beyond what they want to do."
"On the other hand, we have a problem as a funder, for example if they want to do something very daring that may get them into trouble and we just do what we can on the issue of security, no questions asked."
"Chechnya is a case in point; the Russians are still denying our NGOs access to radios, and this is a real problem for the safety of the people there."
"This is a balancing act and the responsibility that we have as the funder of the activity goes far into the issue of security."
"Again, working with the UN is partly an answer to this, but working to deliver humanitarian aid now to the Taliban-controlled part of Afghanistan under some sort of armed protection is not an option."
"There has to be a very open humanitarian mode of operation where suspicion about how one moves around in their country is not a factor."
"But this is extremely difficult."
"I agree with what Mrs Frahm and Mrs Bonino said about the situation of women."
"This is the most extreme version of a denial and violation of human rights apparent to us."
"It is part of the conflict that they are in the midst of, and one would hope that sanity emerges after what we are about to go through now."
"Mr Belder mentioned the export of drugs."
"It should in all objectivity be noted that the Taliban has made an incredible effort to reduce the production of opium and this may be one of the best cases globally that we have seen where they have done what the international community would like to see done."
"It reflects a totally different agenda, but has in fact taken place, and so I believed I should mention it."
"As regards Mr Morillon's reference to the deceased leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Masood, we have no better answer than the one very well presented by Commissioner Patten as our view of the need for a comprehensive sort of basis for shaping the future of Afghanistan."
"This is the line to take."
"Mr Morillon also asked me if I had the determination and the means to do what must be done."
"We are relying on the international aid organisations to do what needs to be done on the ground."
"We have not been hesitant in mobilising funds and are actively participating in the region with the people representing ECHO who are permanently stationed there."
"We are participating in the debate on how to organise things and to understand the situation as much as possible."
"In response to Mr Staes, consideration for the countries in the Central Asian region bordering Afghanistan to the north will be part of the package I mentioned and we are discussing resources in addition to the EUR 25 million that we have publicly mentioned."
"In respect of the dialogue with the budgetary authority, we are not releasing figures other than this EUR 25 million, but this will be an element in that package which we will be coming back to quite soon."
"Thank you for your patience."
"This is an extremely demanding situation."
"I see this as something that demonstrates to us that, looking back on the history of our own experiment in Europe, we got organised to do what needed to be done in Europe after the Second World War and we did it."
"The problem we are discussing here today and the challenges it involves tell us that Europe now needs to get organised and find a way of achieving what the world needs to achieve."
"Thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"Guidelines for the trans-European transport network"
"The next item is the Commission communication on Guidelines for the trans-European transport network."
"I now give the floor to Mrs Loyola de Palacio, on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its meeting today, the College of Commissioners adopted a proposed review of the trans-European transport networks, as well as the review of the Financial Regulation, which allows for a doubling of the Community funding in these projects, up to a level of 20% of those projects."
"The trans-European transport network has been the backbone of our internal market since it was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht and, thanks to the guidelines which we jointly adopted in 1996, the European Union has a structure of networks of European interest which allows the interconnection of our regions and aids the mobility of people and goods."
"These trans-European networks are Europe' s first attempt since Roman times to treat its infrastructures in a truly global and integrated fashion."
"The review we are proposing today attempts to update the development of this system and add new priority projects which respond to the problems of the challenges which our common transport policy has raised in recent years."
"The liberalisation of transport systems and the increase in demand for mobility have caused an imbalance between the different modes of transport and have contributed to the creation of bottlenecks in certain areas of our infrastructures."
"Both the Gothenburg Summit and the Transport White Paper adopted on 12 September have identified these failings and have demanded that the Commission implement urgent measures to overcome them."
"In today' s proposal, the Commission recommends including amongst the priority projects, as well as the so-called Essen projects, eight new rail, combined transport, inland waterways and intelligent transport - specifically the GALILEO project - networks and withdrawing three of the initial projects which have now been completed."
"The new projects would be: first, a rail crossing for the Pyrenees which would overcome the natural obstacle which separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of the continent."
"Second, the high speed train, East-west combined transport, from Paris to Vienna, which will later be extended to Budapest and will complete our network by opening the door to enlargement."
"Third, the navigability of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which will connect the North Sea to the Black Sea, thereby improving the interconnection between the Danube and the Rhine."
"Fourth, the GALILEO satellite positioning system, which has been recognised as a priority by successive European Councils and by this House."
"Fifth, the road connection between Germany and Denmark via Fehmarn according to the Oresund model, which will improve interconnection between the Nordic countries and the rest of the continent."
"Sixth, the high speed rail interoperability of the Iberian network, by adapting it to the track gauge of the rest of the European continent, which will ease sky and land congestion."
"Seventh, the extension of the Brenner project from Munich to Verona, as far as Naples, adding the Bologna-Milan line."
"Eighth, the extension of the high speed train south as far as Nîmes, which provides a connection between the north and south of Europe."
"The necessary global investment for these projects, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, will amount to more than EUR 66 000 million which must clearly be financed essentially through national, regional, private, public and also, where necessary, Community funds."
"Geographically, they involve the whole of our territory and they will have a decisive impact on the competitiveness of our economy."
"This review also includes in the trans-European networks certain minor technical modifications of existing projects which were left outstanding after the conciliation of the package of guidelines in 1996."
"In the Transport White Paper, we committed ourselves to this review, which is the most urgent priority, being followed in 2004 by another which will include in more detail the projects of the new countries of the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it would be premature to do so now since, despite the preparatory work, which has made good progress, there is a lack of important information which we will only be able to obtain during the final phase of enlargement."
"This Parliament will therefore examine the next review and this is a political commitment which I reconfirm to this House."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to fulfil through this work the mandates of the Council and the new requirements of our common transport policy."
"Now that the White Paper and the review of the trans-European networks have been presented, I trust and hope, within the framework of codecision, that this Parliament will make its contributions, the added value of which is evident."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I know that, while this has been approved today by the Commission, there are currently other topical realities, specifically the consequences for the airline industry of the events of 11 September, which you will possibly be concerned about."
"Of course, I will answer any question which you may ask me on this subject."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for giving us this interim report now."
"We are dissatisfied with the Member States, which have practically left you in the lurch over the last eighteen months."
"The interim report on trans-European transport networks has been overdue since 1999."
"We thank you for presenting it now."
"So, to our first question: in your report, you make it clear that you want to add new elements, but that you also want to insist on existing projects which the Member States are still working on - such as the Brenner Tunnel - now at last being finished."
"I would therefore ask you how we are together to ensure, even with a possible change to the financial arrangements, that older projects as important as the Brenner Tunnel, but also new ones such as the Franco-Spanish link across the Pyrenees, or the fixed Femarn Belt link between Denmark and Germany actually get built?"
"Madam Vice-President, you have already alluded to my second question: when are you going to expound to us in committee or in this House what your policy will be on combating new competition in the form of subsidised air travel?"
"Alternatively, the question arises of how the airlines can be helped after the tragic events of 11 September."
"Mr President, I think we can agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner's main remarks."
"I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said. I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner, whether she is able to concur with our view that we can learn from our experiences to date with the Trans-European Networks."
"One insight we have gained, for example, is that when the Heads of State and Government decide upon a list, it is not necessarily better than a list of priorities drawn up by Parliament."
"Might we perhaps put this experience to use?"
"In any case, I find the Commissioner's approach in the White Paper, concentrating on rail and waterways, very much worthy of support."
"The issue there is whether or not we should check all the financing instruments, not only the money we have for the TEN, with that in mind."
"For if it is only in the TEN that priority is given to rail and waterways, then the other funds - for example the Cohesion Fund and others - will have to be looked at and checked with a view to their perhaps taking these new priorities into account as well for the sake of consistency."
"Those are my two questions."
"Commissioner, a moment ago, you listed a number of projects which will be followed up, for example the high-speed link from Paris-Vienna-Budapest eastwards, and making the Danube navigable."
"I wonder whether the latter actually falls within the scope of such a thing as establishing trans-European networks."
"I can understand why its repair would come under its scope, in a manner of speaking, for there is already a link there at the moment."
"That was my first question."
"Secondly, it has become increasingly clear to me that with regard to links within the candidate countries, requests are mainly made for north-south links, and not only for east-west links from Europe and beyond."
"My question is therefore whether there are currently any plans to set up more north-south links in the present candidate countries?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions."
"Firstly, I will reply to Mr Jarzembowski."
"It seems to me extremely urgent that we present to Parliament and the Council a new system of charging for infrastructures and, in particular, a modification of the current 'Euro-disc' directive with regard to the funding of road infrastructures."
"In this proposed new funding of infrastructures we will undoubtedly consider, amongst other things, that infrastructures should meet not only the costs of their own maintenance or construction, but also the so-called external costs, in accordance with the Costa report which was approved by this Parliament."
"We are talking about costs such as congestion, accidents and certain environmental costs, which are clearly definable and quantifiable."
"Furthermore, in this proposal we will introduce the possibility that in certain cases - I insist, not as a habitual system, but in certain exceptional cases such as the Brenner tunnel or certain large projects which involve very costly work with a significant environmental impact that must be reduced as far as possible - the so-called Swiss model may be applied in the European Union as well, that is to say that tolls, or part of a toll from an existing infrastructure be used to create a fund to finance the construction of an alternative rail infrastructure."
"This is a fundamental issue."
"It is by means of these formulae that we hope the most important projects for the structuring of the whole of European territory may be carried out."
"Secondly, you are going to analyse the projects that appear here in the codecision procedure."
"I wish to say that the fact the project appears in the trans-European networks allows the European Union to promote the idea that States - who in the end have to make the great investments - or regions should also plan their large-scale works not on the basis of national interest, but in the interest of trans-European interconnection and hence with a cross-border vision."
"This is why I said that, since Roman times, the trans-European networks initiative is really the first rational proposal of this type."
"It will be made possible by providing co-funding, up to a current maximum of 10%."
"If the proposals being made here are approved this may go up to 20% for certain particularly important and costly projects, because appearing on these trans-European networks eases access to funding by the European Bank."
"Lastly, I will say to Mr Bouwman that, in this new proposal, we incorporate not only the North-south routes, which are the ones that have essentially been included in the other trans-European networks, because they were the most necessary, but also the East-west routes, above all the basic Paris-Stuttgart-Vienna route, which will eventually provide a link with Budapest; we also incorporate the Danube and its best communication with the Rhine, creating a south-east-northeast route which crosses the whole of the Union."
"There is no doubt that the 2004 review, when the new countries of the Union will also be integrated, will stress this East-west component even more, without forgetting the North-south, which must always be maintained, in any event."
"Exactly, Madam Vice-President, we must not lose sight of the North or of the South."
"Sometimes, in Spain, we say that we should not lose sight of the North, that is to say we should not lose our way, but, on the other hand, we should neither lose sight of the South."
"So that there are no doubts, I will now tell you the order in which you will take the floor."
"The first group of three will comprise Mr Ripoll, Mr Izquierdo and Mrs Langenhagen; the second, Mr Varela, Mr Savary and Mr Rübig."
"And following the reply of the Vice-President, we shall pass on to another item."
"Mr Ripoll therefore has the floor."
"Madam Vice-President, I would like to thank you for being here and ask you two very brief and specific questions."
"Firstly, could you confirm that the whole of the Spanish high-speed network is included in the trans-European networks?"
"And secondly, if the answer is yes, what are the scope and consequences of its incorporation for European infrastructure and from a Spanish point of view?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the merit of providing information quickly is to achieve an effect of surprise when giving good news."
"And I must congratulate you on the news you have brought us today, which was directly related to my first budgetary question, which I now have to adapt."
"However, I would like to stress the importance I attach to moving from 10% to 20% in the projects."
"My question is, 'how have you done it?' ."
"Because this action is of interest to us in terms of future actions and requests by this Parliament."
"So where did you get that 10% from?"
"Can the same be expected for other modes of transport?"
"Secondly, the environmental impact."
"When you appeared before us in 1999, at your hearing as a candidate for Commissioner, you said that you would pay very close attention to the environmental impact."
"Do you intend to maintain this level of attention in relation to these projects and not be mechanically subject to the will of the States, which normally incorporate truly harmful environmental effects into some of these areas?"
"Thirdly, we have still not been able to digest the projects which you have just mentioned to us, but I would like to ask you a question with no ill intention, but simply so that we may know your initial opinion: do you think that your proposal tackles the problems of the peripheral regions and is therefore of a cohesive nature?"
"Mr President, I believe that the terrible experiences in America are causing the European satellite navigation system, GALILEO to be looked at from a new political and economic angle."
"The Member States have in the past supported this good initiative of theirs only with reluctance."
"Do you believe that there is now a new readiness on the part of the Member States to implement GALILEO without delay?"
"Mr President, the whole of the European gauge high speed network of the Iberian Peninsula is, in fact, included in the networks."
"There is going to be an enormous effort to integrate the Iberian Peninsula with the European rail network and this will bring about such interoperability, thereby making rail transport - for both people and goods - a genuine alternative to other types of transport."
"Secondly, what I have just said will clearly serve to integrate the Iberian Peninsula more with the rest of the European Union, just as the Rhine-Rhone project or the Paris-Stuttgart-Linz-Vienna, and, later, Budapest, rail project will serve to integrate the East with the rest of the current European Union."
"The same can be said of the link between the Scandinavian Peninsula and the European continent by means of the new alternative connection to the Oresund Bridge, to the Oresund connection, which is also approved in the new plans."
"Therefore, Mr Izquierdo Collado, it does serve to integrate the peripheral areas with the centre and, in this respect, it is cohesive."
"As for the aforementioned 10% and 20% thresholds, these are financing possibilities."
"It does not mean that 10% or 20% will be granted."
"There are times when 5% is granted and is the maximum limit."
"Second issue."
"We will have to see whether the Council and Parliament support it."
"Third issue."
"It works for all modes of transport, because these trans-European networks do not only include the elements I have indicated."
"Generically, there is the interconnection between ports and their adjacent land area, that is, rail interconnections, land interconnections, the intermodal interconnection not only of the sea ports but also of river ports, the modal interconnections between rail and airport, for interconnection with the air sector, and the interconnection between rail and road, essentially in the freight sector."
"In other words, there is another series of generic elements that I have not expanded upon, which are also included in these networks."
"In particular, we have to solve the problem of bottlenecks."
"In the case of bottlenecks, with much less action in terms of budget, we can achieve multiplier effects."
"Ten per cent of the road network and 20% of the rail network is affected by habitual bottlenecks."
"This does not mean that 20% of the rail network is a bottleneck."
"But there are problem points within this rail network that eventually effect 20% of the European rail network."
"Of course, we will try to ensure that funding is at the maximum level in these cases."
"In relation to environmental impact, I maintain what has been said before."
"We have prepared all of this in common agreement with the department of Mrs Wallström and with the Commission' s Directorate-General for the Environment and we have agreed that we will continue to work jointly on its implementation and promotion."
"Mrs Langenhagen, we are going to hold a debate in relation to GALILEO."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you are aware of my personal interest in this project, which I believe to be crucial in terms of European Union strategy."
"In my personal opinion - although it is shared by the Services and by the Commission as a whole - what happened on 11 September gives us all the more reason to move ahead with this project."
"Clearly, not all of the applications that increasingly depend on the American global positioning system can rely on a single system."
"We need a second system that will complement and strengthen the current system, which is the American one."
"It is not a question of competing with the Americans. It is a question of participating, together with the Americans, in order to make the whole system more secure."
"In any event, you know that Council will have to give its definitive opinion on these issues at its last meeting in December and I hope that on that occasion we will finally clear up any ambiguities and doubts once and for all and we will move ahead with a project which is essential to the future of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate her on having appeared so quickly before this House to give us this important information today."
"Although she gave a general reply earlier in relation to Spain, I would like, if you will permit me, to ask about a specific aspect which has a lot to do with peripheral regions, or rather the most peripheral of the peripheral regions - the Galician Finisterre."
"I would like to ask you whether these new guidelines approved by the Commission, in relation to Spain and the high speed railway, include connections with the Autonomous Community of Galicia and, if so, whether you can explain how."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for this new information on the trans-European networks."
"I should like to mention one issue, and at the same time take the opportunity to say that I welcome the fact that it has been included, and that is the crossing of the Pyrenees."
"It is an issue that has received much less media attention than the Alps, but it is probably a more critical one."
"Even now, the number of heavyweight vehicles which cross the Pyrenees every day between the Iberian peninsula and France is greater than the number crossing the Alps."
"We shall therefore be faced with the development of a very critical situation, because infrastructures on the Atlantic side are lagging behind."
"As for the actual crossing, or central railway tunnel, I believe that this is a very good thing, but we must not forget that this tunnel will certainly not be constructed in the short term, since the Lyon-Turin tunnel and the Brenner tunnel have to be built first."
"I would like to make a personal plea - and I would like to hear your opinions on the subject - for emergency structures at either end of the Pyrenees, particular between the Basque Country and the Atlantic coast."
"It seems to me that it is there, first of all, because that is where the people and the activities are, that we shall free the bottleneck in the road and rail routes leading to the Iberian peninsula."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for your initiative."
"The citizens want enlargement to build visible bridges."
"The Slovak government seeks a bridge in the form of the joining of Vienna and Bratislava airports into a mega-airport with a 'Transrapid' rail line to improve transport links."
"This could well be the first stage of the Paris-Vienna route you have mentioned."
"I believe it would be a very important initiative to take it onward as far as Budapest."
"We also have, however, the shipping junction on the Danube, and in the long run this would become a triple junction."
"Do you think this programme could also facilitate the financing of junctions of this sort?"
"Mr President, many thanks to Mr Varela."
"If we are talking about the Galician stretches of the high speed network, yes, they are included, as are the interconnections with Portugal, insofar as, I insist, it involves adapting and modifying these constructions in accordance with the European gauge, whether they be new lines or adaptations of existing lines, and I should like to make this clear."
"Furthermore, there is another series of projects which affect that part of Europe, such as issues relating to ports and other issues that I will not go into now."
"Mr Savary, I fully share your concern about the Pyrenees."
"When, as the person responsible for transport in the European Union, I look at a map to see what is happening, I see a barrier, a wall, with a pass on the right of the map, on the far eastern side, and another on the left, in the west, and in between there is nothing."
"There is no railway."
"It now seems that there is going to be a pass at Canfranc but, for the moment, there are just those two passes."
"The Commission believes that, between now and 2010, we must provide a pass for a further 100 million tonnes between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European continent."
"We must now begin to discuss, prepare and work on a rail project that will create a great Pyrenean pass, not at the western or eastern extremes, but at the most central part; that will go further than the contribution of the possible creation of the Canfranc pass; that will create a truly significant rail route for goods."
"We are talking about high figures."
"As you say, undoubtedly both the Spanish and the French governments will have to consider alternatives, because for that great central Pyrenean pass we are talking in terms of around 2015 to 2020, that is, in 15-20 years time, and this type of project has to be planned that far in advance and they have to be dealt with and initiated within that timescale."
"Apart from that, in any event, one of the Essen projects is still under way, which included the Basque 'Y' , which also involves a European gauge link via that entrance to the Iberian Peninsula."
"I would like to say to Mr Rübig that the Vienna-Bratislava motorway is included in the projects (I have not mentioned it because it is a lesser issue), which includes the stretch of that motorway within Austrian territory."
"A rail interconnection is not envisaged at the moment, but I would like to say that all of these aspects will clearly have to be looked at with care for the 2004 review, when enlargement has taken place, at least its first stage, if there are to be more stages."
"Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President."
"That concludes this item on the agenda."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0333/2001)."
"We are not going to have an hour and a half. We are going to have an hour and a quarter at the most."
"I would therefore ask Members to cooperate so that we can get through as many questions as possible."
"Mr Vitorino represents the Commission."
"Part I"
"Question No 27 by (H-0700/01):"
"Subject: Illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco What measures will the Commission propose in order to regulate illegal immigration through Morocco, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the kind of tragic events which occurred this summer in Community waters?"
"I am grateful for your explanations, but I wanted to stress the urgency of the issue."
"Specifically, this summer thirty or forty people, that we know of, have drowned as a result of the operation of these illegal immigration networks."
"It is calculated that last year four or five thousand people drowned trying to cross the stretch which separates Morocco from Spain."
"I would therefore like to repeat the question, Commissioner, of whether there is any possibility that, without waiting for the result of the Barcelona process and the broader renegotiations on association, we can reach a very practical agreement in terms of policing and control so that the Moroccan authorities may prevent these deaths, which are reaching frightening proportions."
"Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Medina' s belief that we are facing a human tragedy, that we cannot expect an ideal solution and that we will have to discover the solution as we progress."
"In order to progress, however, the two sides must agree on the mechanisms to be applied."
"This is something which is yet to reach a point which I consider acceptable."
"We therefore have great hopes that at the Association Council next week progress can be made on the identification of specific cooperation mechanisms, including police cooperation on border control."
"In any event, I would like to stress that in 2001 a very substantial proportion of the budgetary line which I mentioned has been dedicated to actions for cooperation with Morocco, increasing that country' s administrative capacity in the management of illegal immigration, which is not just a human problem: it is a political problem, especially for Spain."
"But it is also a problem for Morocco, because Morocco is today a transit country in which there are many sub-Saharan illegal immigrants, with very harmful social consequences for Morocco."
"I believe that after next week we will have better cooperation perspectives, which I hope will be the result of the meeting of the Association Council."
"Question No 28 by (H-0730/01):"
"Subject: Release of Mr Albin Kurti and other Kosovars still being held hostage by the Belgrade authorities Of some 2000 Kosovars who were kidnapped and held hostage by the military and paramilitary forces belonging to the regime then in place in Belgrade in the days leading up to the international police operation in Kosovo more than 28 months ago, 229 are still being held in Serb prisons."
"One hundred of them are being held for common law offences, while the remaining 129, including the student leader Arbin Kurti, are being held for their convictions or for 'political' offences."
"In February 2001 the Serb and Yugoslav parliaments passed an amnesty law allowing the release of 30 000 Serbs and some 400 Kosovars."
"At the end of April 2001, 143 prisoners were released from Jakova prison."
"The Serb judicial authorities had stated that the cases of the remaining Kosovar prisoners would be the subject of a rapid judicial review followed by release."
"Despite these commitments given by the Belgrade authorities, however, and despite the Council and Commission's repeated promises to intervene forcefully in order to put an end to this intolerable situation, the matter has still not been resolved."
"Has the Commission decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue?"
"If not, what initiatives will it take in order finally to bring about the immediate release of Arbin Kurti and the 129 Kosovar hostages and the transfer of the 100 Kosovar prisoners still being held in Serbia for common law offences to the UNMNIK, which is the only competent body in this connection?"
"The European Commission remains concerned by this issue and I can assure the honourable Member that we are taking every available opportunity to exert appropriate pressure on those in a position to take decisions on this issue."
"As the honourable Member recognises, considerable progress has already been made and we welcome this."
"The remaining prisoners' cases are being reviewed and where convictions cannot be supported by evidence the prisoners are released."
"Where there are grounds for conviction, appeals are being launched."
"The ICRC monitors the condition of individual prisoners and maintains contact with their families."
"As regards the transfers of prisoners from detention in Serbia to the United Nations' Mission's facilities in Kosovo, this matter is being discussed by the appropriate authorities."
"Simultaneous reform of the judiciary with the help and advice of international organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which are now both present in Belgrade, is under way."
"The rule of law and respect for minority rights are key conditions applying to relations with and assistance for the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you."
"Having said that, however, I should point out a certain number of things."
"On numerous occasions, your colleagues at the Commission have talked about priority with regard to the transferring of the Kosovar hostages from Serbia to Kosovo."
"They did so when the criminal Milosevic was still in power."
"That was almost a year ago, and there has been a change of regime in Belgrade, so it is even more incomprehensible that these problems have still not been solved."
"You talk about grounds for conviction, you talk about appeal procedures, but it has been established and confirmed, by this Parliament itself, that the Belgrade authorities were not competent, that only UNMIK was competent to deal with these cases, that the transfer had therefore already been accomplished, in law, and it was simply a matter of implementing it, and that has been the case for the past two years, Commissioner."
"Well, that is quite a long time for us, but I think it is an extremely long time for those who are still incarcerated in the gaols of Belgrade."
"In the case of Mr Arbin Kurti in particular, who was a student leader, I really do not understand what objections or other factors can still be preventing his transfer."
". (FR) On specific cases, I would say that direct responsibility for monitoring trials lies with the ICRC."
"The Commission raises the question from a general political viewpoint, and I can assure the honourable Member that when speaking to the authorities of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia we have always urged the need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible."
"I must emphasise that there are some cases in which crimes have been committed."
"In those cases, it is up to the law to decide what should be the fate of the accused, to charge them and to launch appeals so that justice will prevail in the end."
"As far as political relations are concerned, I can assure the honourable Member that we have never ceased to urge a rapid resolution of all the situations that are being assessed, and I must point out that some progress has been made, but of course, any period of time is too long when one has been charged with an offence, especially when the charge is unjust, and the Commission, for its part, will continue to urge as rapid a solution as possible in those situations which are still being assessed."
"Question 29 by (H-0737/01):"
"Subject: Trials in Kabul The trial began in early September before an Islamic court in Kabul, Afghanistan, of four citizens of a Member State of the Union, Germany, together with two US and two Australian citizens, all of whom are aid workers with Shelter Now International."
"In accordance with the Islamic law of the country, the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for conducting Christian missionary activities."
"At the same time, 16 Afghan citizens have been charged with converting from Islam to the Christian faith, for which the prosecutor is also demanding the death penalty in accordance with the Islamic law of Afghanistan."
"What representations has the European Union made to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to secure respect for the legal rights of all the accused and their protection in the context of the European Union's endeavours to promote religious freedom as an integral part of human rights, as enshrined in the UN Charter, the Council of Europe Convention and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German government has specifically requested that the European Union should neither adopt positions nor take action in relation to the eight humanitarian aid organisation workers, specifically from the 'Shelter Now International' non-governmental organisation, who are currently on trial in Kabul, in Afghanistan, accused of attempting to convert Afghan Muslims to the Christian religion."
"The governments of the three countries whose nationals are involved in this situation, Germany, Australia and the United States of America, have decided to act jointly at this stage and have stated that they would prefer to find solutions to this problem on a strictly bilateral level."
"The honourable Member will be aware that the trial of these eight people is under way."
"Given the current situation and climate, the Commission does not consider it to be appropriate, or even helpful, to make any further comment on this situation, since the decision must fall to the governments of the nationals involved. I can assure you, however, that both the Commission and all of the European Union' s Member States will, of course, continue to follow developments carefully and closely."
"Thank you for your answer."
"Mr Vitorino' s reply made no mention of the sixteen Afghans brought before the courts and accused of having converted from Islam to Christianity."
"These people are threatened with the death penalty under Islamic law."
"My question to Mr Vitorino is: have we in the European Union, in our fight against the death penalty and in support of religious freedom, in any way acted on behalf of these people who are in actual fact threatened by the death penalty?"
"In what way is the European Union taking action against all those Arab and Muslim countries - in practice, almost all of them - in which converting from Islam to Christianity is in actual fact punishable by death?"
"Irrespective of what happened in the United States on 11 September, we must be tireless in our campaign against the death penalty."
"My question is: What has happened to these sixteen Afghans who are in danger?"
"Mr President, I do not think that the honourable Member can doubt my position or that of the Commission on the death penalty or on freedom of religion."
"If he had the opportunity to hear what I said, for example, in the debates on the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, he will find the answer there, not only in rhetoric, but also in clear and unequivocal laws."
"I admit that we do not have any specific information on the situation of the sixteen Afghans to whom he refers. Apparently, however, these sixteen Afghans will be committed to trial at a later date, in other words, not at the same time that the eight citizens of Germany, the United States and Australia are to be tried."
"We support, of course, the statement by the troika, the 'Afghan Support Group' , a joint contact group, currently chaired by Germany which has issued an unequivocal statement of support for these non-governmental organisation workers, whether they be citizens of the States I have mentioned or Afghans caught up in this situation."
"Thank you very much for your presence and participation in this Question Time, Mr Vitorino."
"We will move on to the second part."
"We have twenty minutes per Commissioner, not a minute more."
"A very good afternoon, Mr Bolkestein."
"Part II"
"Questions to Commissioner Bolkestein"
"Question No 30 by (H-0707/01):"
"Subject: Community trade mark courts When is action going to be taken against Member States which have not set up courts and tribunals to deal with matters relating to the Community trade mark?"
"Mr President, since the honourable Member, Mr Berenguer Fuster, raised a similar question last December, the Commission has addressed a letter of formal notice to Spain, France, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece in which it recalled the need to fulfil obligations regarding the designation of Community Trade mark courts."
"The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that the relevant regulation, which designates the courts of justice for Community Trade marks, was approved in September."
"France has stated that a decree on this matter will be approved before 31 October 2001."
"The Commission services are currently checking this information."
"As regards the three remaining Member States, Spain, Luxembourg and Italy, the Commission does not yet have any information proving that these Member States have adopted the necessary provisions."
"The Commission is, therefore, considering launching infringement proceedings for failure to comply with Community law according to Article 226 of the EC Treaty."
"Thank you for your information, Commissioner."
"I am obviously referring to the case of Spain, since I clearly do not have sufficient knowledge of the cases of Italy and Luxembourg."
"On 13 December 2000 the Commissioner responded to me in saying that, in the case where there was no satisfactory response, the Commission would open an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty."
"Today you have told us that the Commission has no news of these three countries including Spain which, to make matters worse, is the location of the headquarters of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, having begun any procedure to create what they committed themselves to, and that they have been non-compliant since November 1996."
"If this is the case, if it was already taking place a year ago, if there has been no satisfactory response for almost a year, why is the Commission waiting to begin the infringement procedure?"
"I can well imagine the impatience, or shall I say irritation, of Mr Berenguer Fuster with the fact that the government of his country has not yet taken the desired steps in order to set up this court."
"Indeed, it is true that this is an infringement."
"May I point out that the Commission does not hesitate to pursue infringement proceedings, but only, as the Latin expression goes, as an ultimum remedium; in other words, only when all the avenues and possibilities of settling matters in an amicable way have been exhausted does the Commission take that step."
"I take Mr Berenguer Fuster's point that his own patience, like that of the Commission, is close to being exhausted."
"We shall indeed do what he proposes, and what the Commission is also intending to do."
"Let us make a last effort to convince the Spanish government - particularly in view of the upcoming presidency, when it would not do if the Commission were to open such proceedings - to do so now before the Commission takes that ultimate step."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 31 and 32 will be taken together."
"Question No 31 by (H-0728/01):"
"Subject: Letter of notification concerning implementation of Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece In reply to my question E-1336/01 on the recognition of diplomas under Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece, the Commissioner responsible, Mr Bolkestein, stated, among other things that 'A Commission decision on the matter is expected in the coming months, and in any case in autumn, following some supplementary details that may need to be checked with the Greek authorities.'"
"In fact, the press reported on 9 August 2001 that the Commission had sent a letter of notification to Greece which identified a problem with the Presidential Decree transposing Directive 89/48/EEC into Greek law."
"What are the legal arguments on which the Commission bases its view that the failure to recognise diplomas awarded by educational establishments of another Member State under 'franchise' agreements in Greece is contrary to the Community Directive, and on which points is the Presidential Decree transposing Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece inconsistent with that Directive?"
"Has the Greek government answered the points set out in the letter of notification or are there any indications as to what its legal arguments might be?"
"Question No 32 by (H-0750/01):"
"Subject: Implementation of Directive 89/48/EEC in Greece The Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled against Greece for its failure to implement Community Directive 89/48/EEC on a general system for the recognition of higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration."
"Will the Commission say whether Greece has complied with the judgment of the Court and, if not, what steps it intends to take to bring Greek law into line with Community legislation?"
"Mr President, in reply to the Oral Question by Mr Alavanos, the letter of formal notice sent to Greece to which the honourable Member refers, concerns a recently initiated infringement procedure regarding the failure of Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to comply with Directive 89/48 in certain areas."
"On the other hand, the procedure referred to in question E-1336/01 earlier more specifically concerns problems surrounding the misapplication of Directive 89/48 to the psychology profession."
"The Commission considers that diplomas awarded in Greece by another Member State and the refranchising agreements do not relate to training provided from or by Greece, but to training provided from or by the other Member State, since the Greek establishment in which the training in question has been provided is merely an intermediary without any autonomy."
"In other words, it is not the Greek establishment that awards diplomas, but rather the university in the other Member State, and consequently, if those diplomas relate to professional training within the meaning of Directive 89/48, they are covered by that Directive."
"The purpose of the letter of formal notice is to obtain the Member State's observations on specific questions."
"Greece has not yet replied to that letter of formal notice and, therefore, no firm grounds for infringement procedings have been established as yet."
"Consequently, the Commission is not able to reply to that part of the question from the honourable Member."
"Given the similarity of the subject matter, I shall now continue, if I may, by answering the question by Mr Hatzidakis."
"In the judgment to which the honourable Member refers, the Court of Justice of the European Communities condemned Greece for its failure to communicate measures taken to implement Directive 89/48 - the Directive I referred to in my reply to the previous question."
"The Commission thus initiated a new infringement procedure against Greece with a request for the fixing of penalty payments."
"This second procedure was closed when Greece complied."
"It complied with the Court's judgment by forwarding Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to the Commission."
"As I pointed out in my reply to the previous Oral Question put by Mr Alavanos, the Commission considers that certain provisions of Directive 89/48 have not been implemented correctly."
"The Commission has also received complaints from individuals who, even since the implementation of the directive, have not seen their rights respected."
"The Commission has, therefore, initiated a new infringement procedure, this time for incorrect implementation and application of the directive, and the letter of formal notice to which I referred just now has been sent to Greece."
"We expect to receive the observations of the Greek authorities very soon."
"A specific procedure for recognition of the psychology profession is currently being introduced, and that profession, together with a number of others, has been the subject of specific implementing legislation on problems concerning the application of Directive 89/48 that have also been drawn to the Commission's attention in that context."
"That is my reply to the question put by Mr Hatzidakis."
"I should like to make a point of thanking the Commissioner for what was a very detailed reply, including from the technical point of view."
"All that remains to be seen is what the government's response will be to the Commission's move."
"As the Commissioner knows, I have raised this matter on numerous occasions, I should just like to inform him that the Minister of Education's public response is that I am asking the wrong questions of the wrong Commissioner and obtaining the wrong replies."
"So now I am waiting to see what the Greek government's response will be."
"However, my question to the Commissioner is this: why confine ourselves solely to the psychology profession and, more to the point, to psychologists who have graduated from French universities when numerous complaints have been lodged with the Commission by other disciplines and by students studying in other faculties and graduating from foreign universities, even though they have taken part of their course in Greece?"
"I can assure Mr Alavanos that the Commission has looked at this whole issue in the broadest possible sense and has not confined itself to the matter of psychologists."
"The basic issue is the question of whether a degree awarded by another Member State, following a course of studies which takes place physically in Greece, is or is not assimilated to a similar degree issued in Greece itself following studies at a Greek university."
"So it is the equivalence between a purely Greek degree and a degree awarded by a university of another Member State, but where the study has been undertaken at a Greek establishment."
"That assimilation, that equality is the purpose of Directive 89/48, to which I have referred at various times this afternoon."
"The Commission is taking that into consideration and has asked Greece to explain why that directive has not been transposed and applied accordingly."
"The directive does not confine itself to psychologists and, to that extent, I can assure Mr Alavanos that his fears are unfounded."
"Commissioner, as I am sure you are aware, the question at issue is not a question which just concerns a few citizens in Greece, it concerns thousands of graduates from European universities whom the Greek State sends abroad to study, because we have what to me is a crazy educational system, and then refuses to recognise their qualifications."
"This question in fact concerns several thousand young people who are denied a career because of the mindset of the Greek State."
"This being the case, I should like to say that I welcome your finding that the Court's judgment is not being applied properly and, because the Greek public is listening to what we have to say, to ask you: if the Greek government continues to take this view, what are the legal implications?"
"What will the Commission's next move be?"
"Just so that our citizens know where they stand."
"I am very conscious of the fact that the number of young people involved is large."
"I must confess I have not counted them, but if Mr Hatzidakis says that thousands of young people are affected, then I am certain he is right."
"That underlines the importance of this issue."
"Whether the educational system is absurd is a qualification I must leave for Mr Hatzidakis."
"I am sure he has political friends in his country who can raise this matter in the national parliament of Greece."
"But we are in the European Parliament."
"It is quite right that Mr Hatzidakis draws our attention to this untoward state of affairs and I thank him for his contribution to our debate."
"As regards the legal instruments, as I said earlier in my reply to Mr Alavanos, the Commission will use all the legal instruments at its disposal."
"The Commission has no particular desire to take Member States to court but if European law is not respected then it has no alternative."
"Therefore I say to both Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Alavanos that, if the Greek government does not apply the rules correctly, as should be the case, the Commission will, in a well-considered and very deliberate manner, make use of the instruments it has and start legal proceedings."
"Question No 33 by (H-0738/01):"
"Subject: Illegal car taxation in Finland In 1998 the Commission asked Finland to amend its system of car and motorcycle taxation."
"Commission officials have admitted that Finland has in fact failed to remove the discrimination to any significant degree."
"Most recently, in September 2001, Parliament' s Committee on Petitions received a petition signed by me and 17 000 of my compatriots, demanding an overhaul of the illegal tax regime."
"Finland has been an EU Member since 1995; when will the Commission take action to force it to toe the line and start implementing single market rules as interpreted by the European Court of Justice?"
"Will the Commission take independent legal action, because waiting for new rulings by the Court of Justice will hardly bring any additional clarity especially after the recent ruling on Portugal (C-393/98)?"
"The tax on removal vehicles also hinders people' s freedom to move within the Community."
"Will the Commission see to it that this illegality is remedied in the near future?"
"Questions to Commissioner Verheugen"
"Mr President, my answer is as follows. The Commission is currently considering initiating a procedure against Finland under Article 226 of the Treaty, which will supplement the one initiated in 1998."
"This case will be dealt with at a Commission meeting in the near future."
"The new procedure is also likely to cover problems in implementing Directive 83/183, which deals with the tax exemptions granted when people move house."
"At the same time, Commission staff have written to all Member States, drawing their attention to the judgment by the Court of Justice to which Mr Vatanen' s question refers, namely the Gomez-Valente Judgment of 22 February 2001, and the Commission shares the honourable Member' s opinion that the judgment in question will have implications outside the context of the dispute in question, and will open up the way to second-hand vehicles being treated in a manner which is more in line with the requirements of the European internal market."
"However, the Commission wishes to point out that the procedure intended to ensure that the above-mentioned judgment is complied with must remain independent of any other procedure which it has initiated or is intending to initiate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your efforts."
"I feel reassured to hear your answer and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission officials for their work."
"Commission officials have admitted that Finland is blatantly violating Community and single-market rules."
"The Finns are desperately waiting for those EU rights that they are entitled to and which they were promised."
"Mr Commissioner, I hope you do not find this too heavy, but their hopes are lying on your shoulders."
"We know we can count on you."
"First of all I should like to thank Mr Vatanen for his very kind remarks."
"I feel the weight of all those motorists in Finland on my shoulders - a very heavy load indeed."
"One complicating factor is that this is an area which has not yet been harmonised in the European Union."
"The Commission's legal basis for its actions is Article 90 of the Treaty on the one hand, which prohibits tax discrimination, and on the other hand two directives adopted in 1983."
"Article 90 gives the Court of Justice the opportunity for abundant jurisprudence."
"Since interpretations of the judgments of the Court are not always unanimous, it is time to create a synthesis of all the various interpretations in order to determine clearly our future action."
"That need for a synthesis is one of the reasons that led me to include in the Commission's working programme for this year a communication on motor vehicle taxation."
"It is my intention that this communication, which I hope will appear around the end of this year or the beginning of next year, will cover all the problems in connection with vehicle taxation and vehicle pricing, so that we can take a broader approach to them and settle the problem in Finland to which Mr Vatanen has referred."
"I hope that will be to his satisfaction."
"Thank you very much for your great cooperation with Parliament, Mr Bolkestein."
"Question No 34 by Mrs Anne E.M. Van Lancker (H-0765/01) will not be replied to since it is included in the agenda of this part-session."
"Question No 35 by (H-0695/01):"
"Subject: Law on the use of minority languages in Slovakia From an official position paper of the Foreign Ministry of the Slovak Republic, sent to us by the Slovak ambassador in Brussels, we understand that the law of 1999 on the use of minority languages in Slovakia gives minorities certain rights."
"When 20% or more of the inhabitants of a village speak another language, they can receive official communications in their own language."
"We have personal experience of how this law operates in practice."
"In villages where more than 20% of the population is made up Slovaks, the inhabitants can receive all official communications in Slovakian."
"The law thus appears to work satisfactorily."
"However, when it transpires that in the same village 75% of the population is Hungarian and they can obtain official documents concerning births, marriages and deaths only in Slovakian and the mayor of the village may not speak Hungarian during public or official functions, then we must have serious doubts about the implementation of a language law which appears satisfactory on paper."
"In connection with Slovakia's accession to the EU, is the Commission investigating whether the law is being implemented, how this is being done and what progress is being made?"
"Mr President, the Commission is paying very careful attention to the use of minority languages in Slovakia."
"It takes the view that Slovakia has made considerable progress in developing a positive policy on minorities and in drawing up the necessary legislation whilst putting in place and supporting the relevant institutions."
"The enacting of the law on the use of minority languages for official business was, in this regard, an important step."
"It brought domestic law into line with current international standards and complied with the specific recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Commission."
"A further important step was the ratification of the European Charter on regional or minority languages."
"It should be noted in particular that Slovakia desires to concede the greatest possible freedom to the Hungarian minority in accordance with the flexibility that the Charter makes possible."
"The Commission nevertheless observes that considerable efforts are still required for the practical enforcement of all the existing legislation."
"In some areas, minorities do not avail themselves of the rights guaranteed them by the law on the use of minority languages for official business, above all, it seems, through ignorance of them."
"This seems to be the case above all in communities with a large proportion of Roma among the population."
"The Commission will continue in future to urge Slovakia to continue its efforts to implement the provisions of its laws, improve policy in this area and make the necessary budget funds available."
"The observations which you, Mrs Maes, have made in person come as no surprise to me."
"They prove only that the difficulties with implementation, which I have described, continue to prevail."
"We will be discussing this topic further in the next progress report on Slovakia, which is due to appear in November."
"I think you are right, some sections of the population will not be fully aware of the existence of new legal provisions."
"But we must still ask ourselves whether there is always the necessary goodwill present in order to allow citizens to translate the legal provisions into practice."
"From that point of view, it would probably be useful if we did not only draw the attention to the very sensitive nature of the subject matter in the reports but also in the contacts with the Slovak authorities."
"In our opinion, a verdict on the minority policy cannot be a verdict on what has been set down on paper."
"It should also concern rights and facts."
"I cannot but agree, Mrs Maes, with what you have said, and can confirm that we address this issue in all our contacts with the Slovak government."
"I have, myself, done so repeatedly in conversations with the head of the Slovak government and with the Slovak parliament and press and also on public occasions in Slovakia."
"The message we are communicating in Slovakia is that we see the way the numerically stronger Slovaks interact with their minorities as an indicator of how strongly democracy and the rule of law have developed in that country."
"Question No 36 by , which has been taken over by Mr Miller (H-0714/01):"
"Subject: Ignalina nuclear power station, Lithuania What is the Commission's current position with regard to the closure of reactor two of the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania?"
"Mr President, Mr Miller, the Commission's view on this issue is at one with that of the Council and - in so far as I can judge - with that of the European Parliament."
"The Lithuanian Parliament adopted a national energy strategy in 1999."
"As part of this, it has decided that Block 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant is to be decommissioned by 2005 and that the final decision on the decommissioning date for Block 2 will be taken in 2004 in the context of the national energy strategy review."
"The Commission stated at the time that it understood that Block 2 had to be shut down by 2009."
"This is a matter of logic: if 2005 is the latest date for Block 1 to be shut down, it follows from the envisaged lifetime of the two nuclear power installation units that 2009 is the latest date for the decommissioning of Block 2."
"As regards Block 1, the Commission took it into account that Lithuania had commenced extensive preparations for decommissioning and shutting down."
"I am working on the assumption that the decommissioning is actually to take place before 2005."
"As far as Block 2 is concerned, the Commission has stated - as I have already said - that the decommissioning is to take place by 2009 at the latest."
"Over and above that, the Commission and the Member States believe that the timetable for the decision on decommissioning should be compatible with the timetable for Lithuania's accession to the European Union."
"I spoke about this in depth only a few days ago with the new Lithuanian government in Vilna - it was actually the main topic of conversation in Vilnius - and I got the impression that the Lithuanian parliament and government had well understood the message that they now have to think about how the timetable for the decisions about Ignalina Block 2 has to be revised with a view to their own timetable for joining the European Union."
"Let me take this opportunity to point out that it is precisely with regard to Ignalina that the Commission views compromises as impossible."
"Ignalina is a nuclear power plant of the same type as Chernobyl, one that experts are generally convinced is not retrofittable and cannot be brought up to acceptable safety standards."
"It is our firm conviction that this Chernobyl-type nuclear power plant is a source of real danger to human beings, and we will therefore be unable to withdraw our demand."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I especially liked what he said about there being no room for compromises."
"Is the EU position absolutely fixed, with no likelihood of it being altered in the near future?"
"I should also like to raise the point about international funding for decommissioning."
"Is that to come from the Commission's own budget?"
"What happens if there is insufficient money for that decommissioning?"
"Mr Miller, I can answer your first question with a definite 'no' , which seems to be what you desire."
"The European Union's stance on this issue will not change."
"The situation as regards the second question is as follows: an international fund for the decommissioning of Block 1 of the plant was created."
"These EUR 220 million I mentioned were the result of an international conference of donors which I convened jointly with the Lithuanian Prime Minister last year in Vilnius."
"I must however add - and this clouds the picture a little - that EUR 165 million of this sum comes from our own budget, so that the amount that the international community was prepared to raise in addition looks modest in comparison."
"Nonetheless, the funds available suffice to start on the shutting-down process as planned and to finance all the tasks connected with it."
"I must draw it to your attention that the shutdown of such a nuclear power plant is a project lasting decades and the financial obligations resulting from it for us will last for the same period of time."
"The situation with regard to the plant's Block II is rather more complicated because the Lithuanian parliament has not to date fixed a definite date for it to be shut down."
"During the discussions I have mentioned, I have however informed the Lithuanian government that the Commission is of course prepared to provide the necessary help in this aspect too, and is moreover willing to organise international aid."
"A country like Lithuania can quite clearly not manage the huge task of shutting down a power plant like this one by its own resources alone."
"It would, by the way, also be quite unfair to demand that of them, for it was not Lithuania that wanted the plant."
"On the contrary, the Lithuanians even resisted it at the time."
"It was the former Soviet Union that built this plant on the spot where it stands today, and certainly not in order to provide Lithuania with electricity, but, in the main - we believe - for military purposes."
"It is, then, part of the legacy of the former Soviet Union, burdening a poor country like Lithuania."
"It is in our interest that this legacy should disappear."
"Mr President, does the Commission intend to issue a common safety standard for nuclear power plants which will be binding on the EU's Member States and applicant States, or, alternatively, to start drafting lists of power plants in the area of the Union on the 'name and shame' principle?"
"Mrs Korhola, you will be aware that the Commission is not competent in matters of nuclear safety."
"There are no EU norms for the safety of reactors, which I myself greatly regret, but it has not to date been possible to change this situation."
"The Council has worked intensively on this issue, precisely because the Commission has no competence in reactor safety issues."
"The Council's working party on nuclear issues has applied itself to the safety situation in Eastern European nuclear power plants and presented a report just before the summer recess, which is no doubt available to Parliament."
"I recommend that you study this report, which does not of course state that we have laid down European norms, but from which it is clear that the European Union, as regards the safety of Eastern European nuclear power installations, makes demands that it believes to be justified."
"A list of nuclear power stations, such as you have proposed, resulted from investigations carried out much earlier, at the beginning of the nineties to be precise."
"These installations, which in the view of the European Union are not capable of a retrofit - that is, they cannot be made safe - are situated in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"We have, as you know, made it a condition for the commencement of accession negotiations that the issue of the shutting-down of these nuclear power stations should be finalised."
"Question No 37 by (H-0743/01):"
"Subject: Alleged statement According to media reports in June and July 2001, EU Commissioner Verheugen is alleged to have stated privately that if former Czech Prime Minister and current Chairman of the Czech Chamber of Deputies, Mr Vaclav Klaus, became premier again, the Czech Republic' s EU entry chances would be harmed."
"Does the Commission stand by or does it repudiate this alleged statement and does it not consider that such statements are inappropriate and do little to build confidence between the EU and the applicant countries at a time when understanding and support is needed during the integration process?"
"Questions to Commissioner De Palacio"
"Mr Crowley, the event to which you refer is of purely domestic political significance in the Czech Republic; it is an expression of an internal political dispute between government and opposition."
"In such instances, the Commission can do no other than refrain from taking up any position, because it strictly refuses to be drawn into internal political disputes, whether in Member States or in acceding countries."
"Mr President, first of all the Commissioner is being very facetious with his answers."
"The quote is directly from him."
"It is not an internal matter, it is something that he got involved in when he admittedly, privately, that if Mr Vaclav Klaus became premier again, the Czech Republic's EU entry chances would be harmed."
"The Czech Prime Minister said on a radio interview shortly afterwards, and I quote directly from what he said, 'I again repeat those words were not uttered publicly, nevertheless they have not been embargoed.'"
"Commissioner, do you deny that you made such a statement?"
"Also, on matters exclusively for the Czech people - electing their leader, what stance they should take with regard to negotiations with their accession to the European Union, and particularly at a time when confidence building is required both within the EU and within the accession countries - do you think it is right that you as an official and a Member of the College of Commissioners should be interfering with the democratic wishes of the Czech people, or indeed the people of any country?"
"We would all like to see certain outcomes from elections because of our own political beliefs, but some of us have to temper our language and our thoughts because of the positions we hold."
"Therefore I would ask you, once again, to specifically either deny or admit that you made the statement and also to explain why you interfered in such a way?"
"Mr Crowley, I had always believed that a gentleman would not wish to know what two other gentlemen had discussed privately."
"If you want to change that, then that's up to you."
"I will neither confirm nor deny anything in this matter."
"Stony silence is the only way the Commission can avoid being involved in internal political disputes."
"I will, however, quite gladly say something about the actual substance of your question."
"The president of the Czech parliament and I have for many years been able to talk intimately and in confidence with one another."
"The most recent, and, I might add, entirely private, in-depth conversation took place only a few days ago."
"The president of the Czech parliament did not mention in this conversation the event that you have taken as the basis for your question."
"But it means much to me that Mr Klaus, in the many, many conversations we have had, has always made it clear that he, himself, and his political friends desire and support the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union."
"That he occasionally expresses other views, views differing from those shared by the majority in Europe, is well known, but he is quite entitled to do so, and we, as democrats, must accept that."
"My final point must be that it goes without saying that the European Union has the right to tell candidate countries what it accepts and what it does not; to point out that certain criteria are required to be met for accession negotiations to begin and to be concluded, and that the most important of them is the political criterion according to which a country must guarantee that it is a democracy under the rule of law, respecting human rights, protecting minorities and sharing the values and objectives of the European Union."
"It has come about that a country seeking membership has been told, on the basis of this assessment: 'We cannot start negotiating with you about accession, because you do not meet these political requirements.'"
"The question you have asked, whether political intervention of this sort occurs, must therefore be answered very clearly in the affirmative."
"It is precisely what the Copenhagen criteria require."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mr Crowley has the floor for a brief point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"The Commissioner did not answer my question, because he said he would not reveal what took place between two gentlemen."
"He went on afterwards to reveal what took place between two gentlemen - himself and Mr Klaus."
"Therefore he has failed to honour and respect this House by giving a direct answer to a direct question."
"It is a disgrace."
"Question No 43 by (H-0710/01):"
"Subject: Alpine Convention - the environmentally sensitive Pan-Alpine region In its sections on the environment and transport, the Alpine Convention provides a definition of the environmentally sensitive Pan-Alpine region."
"In the Commission's estimation, does that definition - and the transport policy objectives thereby pursued - also form part of EU transport policy for this environmentally sensitive region?"
"Mr President, the Commission is aware of the importance of a suitable definition of the concept of sensitive areas, especially in the case of the environmental integration of transport flows in the Alpine region."
"At the moment, there is a series of definitions of sensitive areas created, in particular, by the United Nations and the Alpine Convention, and also by the Community legislation on the protection of the environment."
"The Commission believes that sensitive mountain areas, especially the Alpine region, as they are normally classified, are clearly priority areas in terms of the application of Community measures intended to reduce the environmental effects of transport and remove the link between increases in transport flows and economic growth."
"Therefore, the White Paper on the European transport policy with a view to 2010, approved on 12 September, pays particular attention to the sensitive areas, especially the mountain regions, within the framework of the policy on charging and funding for infrastructures and the policy on the trans-European transport network."
"The approach largely conforms to the guidelines expressed in the Alpine Convention and its Protocol on transport."
"Commissioner, I wish to put a short supplementary question."
"I was not entirely satisfied with the reply."
"Above all, I am concerned about what we are doing now."
"Are we to wait for technological innovations, for example the fuel cell, to at least partially solve some of the problems we have with traffic across the Alps or should we not now use the truth about the cost as an instrument to force heavy traffic, in the Alps at least, off some of the roads and onto the railways?"
"Mr President, in accordance with what was said in the White Paper on transport policy for the coming years, the Commission hopes, possibly within a year, and perhaps even before next summer, to present to Parliament and the Council of Ministers a new system of charging, specifically a modification of the 'Euro-disc' Directive, which will deal with just this type of issue, in accordance with the Costa report approved by this House a few months ago."
"It will include, in the charges, concepts such as external costs, including certain perfectly quantifiable environmental costs."
"Also cross-subsidisation, that is to say that part of the toll currently charged for existing infrastructures may be used to create a fund to finance alternative infrastructures, especially in the region of the Alps, in projects such as the Brenner tunnel or the Lyon-Turin connection."
"As the authors are not present, Question Nos 44, 45 and 46 lapse."
"Question No 47 by (H-0746/01):"
"Subject: Mont Blanc tunnel and operational guarantees The Mont Blanc tunnel is due to reopen within the next few months."
"In the light of the disaster which led to its closure, what technical guarantees has the Commission obtained as regards the 'new' tunnel's compliance with the relevant European legislation, in terms of environmental standards and sustainable transport?"
"How does the Commission view the new Italian-French management arrangements for the tunnel?"
"Mr President, the Commission does not have the power to give the green light to the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel. This matter does not come within our competence."
"The task of assessing whether the safety level is sufficient falls to the operators and the national authorities, in accordance with their competences in France."
"On that basis, it is for them to decide whether all the safety conditions are met."
"According to the information available to the Commission, tests should be carried out in October to check that the security elements are operating correctly, such as the ventilation system or the electronic control centre, and the degree of training of the staff in charge of operation and emergency services."
"In this respect, one of the main measures to be implemented relates to the distance between vehicles when using the tunnel."
"Furthermore, this measure will contribute to restricting the circulation of lorries via that route."
"With regard to organisational aspects, an important element is the creation by the two original companies, the French ATMB and the Italian SITMB, of a single company to take charge of managing the tunnel."
"With regard to sustainable mobility and the great number of operators who are impatiently awaiting the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, given the serious disruption caused by its closure and the saturation of the routes which have been used as diversions, it should be pointed out that, in the short term, the reopening of the tunnel is going to be very positive from the point of view of sustainable mobility, the environment and safety."
"I insist, however, that the safety measures must be in place as a prior condition for its reopening."
"In the longer term, the absolute priority is to maintain control of the flow of land transport in the Alpine region, without hindering freedom of movement and economic development and, specifically, access from the Italian Peninsula to the rest of Europe will be based on the elements which I mentioned a moment ago, that is, by providing the Alps with major rail crossings which will carry a large proportion of the rail transport burden."
"Commissioner, I reiterate that European legislation does exist on this matter and it must be respected, that the specifications of the new tunnel are practically the same as those of the previous tunnel, that 97% of the community of Chamonix have declared that they are against the reopening of the tunnel - which will inevitably damage all the private businesses, polluting all the typical, customary economic activities of these communities now and in future - and that the Italian government is preparing to reduce the night-time toll, thus increasing the pollution."
"What guarantees does the European legislation protecting the environment offer these communities?"
"Mr President, with regard to safety standards, I refer back to what I just said."
"According to the information available to me, the conditions for ensuring the control and safety of the tunnel have improved and tests are being done, and when all the requirements are met and the reliability of the instruments and systems is verified, the tunnel will be opened."
"This is what I can tell you in relation to safety regulations."
"I must insist, however, that Italy and France are the competent administrations."
"And no doubt within Italy and France, in accordance with their internal institutional organisation, there are probably certain other regional or local administrations which also have a role to play."
"Having said that, I would like to say to the Member that the Community' s fundamental freedoms are the freedom of movement of goods and of persons."
"We must guarantee the interconnection between Italy and the rest of the European continent; which clearly means a better distribution of traffic between the Alpine crossings and between the various modes of transport."
"At this moment, thanks to the agreement with Switzerland, there are other types of possible access for North-south traffic and for traffic between Italy and the rest of the continent."
"The Mont Blanc tunnel is one of the elements, but it is not the only one, and the traffic which has been diverted from the Mont Blanc tunnel is undoubtedly causing an overload in other areas - and I could mention other tunnels which you know even better than me."
"In any event, the important thing is to carry out the work on the Lyon-Turin route and the Brenner tunnel, which are key and definitive elements, but which are going to take some time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand your arguments in favour of crossing the Alps."
"However, I should like to tell you that at the present time, as I am sure you are aware, the public debate on the opening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel is in full swing, and the citizens of Europe, French and Italian, are appealing to us precisely in order to plead for a different cause, for a real sustainable transport system, which is not transport by road."
"Do you really think - and I am asking because you have presented road transport to us as being a sustainable form of transport - do you really think, on the basis of the studies that have been carried out, that the opening of this Mont-Blanc tunnel will be strictly in line, first of all, with requirements, and secondly, with the obligations that we have entered into, in particular with regard to Kyoto?"
"Very briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that the people most directly affected address themselves to you, but I can talk about other people who are asking just the opposite; that the Mont Blanc tunnel be opened as soon as possible."
"As on so many other occasions, there are sometimes contradictory interests."
"With regard to the issue of safety, I will insist on what I said before."
"It is not the Commission which has to make the assessment."
"We have neither the competence nor the capacity to carry out that type of task."
"Thirdly, sustainable mobility. That is the objective of the White Paper I have presented and which the Commission approved on 12 September."
"However, that objective will clearly not be achieved through a statement of will and an approval by the Commission, but it must be approved by this House and by the Council of Ministers and then put into practice."
"It will be efforts of all types over a number of years which will allow us to make progress."
"But we must consider that transport sometimes resolves problems created by other types of decisions."
"Decisions which relate to urban policy, to development policy, to forms of production, to a series of policies on territorial balance and other things, where transport simply offers facilities at a certain moment, resolves problems and makes its contribution."
"In many cases the origins go beyond transport policy."
"Question No 48 by (H-0747/01):"
"Subject: Mont Blanc tunnel and 'piggyback traffic' The Mont Blanc tunnel is due to reopen within the next few months."
"In the meantime, road traffic is causing local communities to incur extremely high public health, economic and environmental costs, especially in the mountains, where pollution levels are three to six times as high as in other environments."
"What specific measures are being taken to obtain an accurate assessment of the road transport costs, including social, economic and environmental costs?"
"What steps have been taken to introduce a special tax (as has happened in Switzerland and Austria) aimed at protecting against and making good the social and environmental damage caused and making rail transport, which has considerable potential for further development, competitive in economic terms?"
"Mr President, in the Commission' s deliberations on the Alpine regions, stress is always placed on the high environmental cost of transport in those regions."
"Considerable work has been done by means of a series of Commission studies and the Fourth and Fifth Framework Research Programmes, which have examined transport expenses in the Alpine regions and other regions, including the project relating to the information systems on Alpine transport and the European strategic multimodal model and the Alp-net project which is currently under way."
"The problem was also dealt with in the reports of the high-level group, which Parliament approved by means of its resolution, contained in the Costa report on charging for the use of infrastructures, which I referred to earlier."
"The new Commission White Paper on common policy not only offers current estimates of the costs of road transport, but also treats as a priority the resolution of the transport problems in the Alpine regions by means of a wide range of measures which I referred to earlier."
"In that context, we are studying the possibility of creating a system for testing charging in sensitive mountain regions such as the Alps as soon as possible."
"Those initiatives should not only have a possible effect on the current volume of traffic, but above all promote the use of less polluting vehicles and thereby contribute to reducing the negative effects of traffic, both on human health and on the flora and fauna of the regions in question and also allow for cross-subsidisation, which I also referred to a moment ago."
"Mr President, as I have said repeatedly, we believe that the modal rebalancing of transport in Europe is a key element not only for the quality of life of our citizens, for the protection of the environment, but also for economic development because, without that modal rebalancing, we will face a situation of gridlock of our road networks and our transport routes."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I imagine that the Member' s question has been answered."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 49 to 82 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Mr Staes has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I have here in front of me a magazine, or at least a newspaper article, which reads as follows : 'I do not approve of the Anti-Slavery Conference in Durban."
"It promotes the feeling of victimisation in people who already have the sense that they are victims."
"I do not feel happy about the entire Conference in Durban, irrespective of the way in which the Middle East was presented there."
"The fact that someone like Castro was cheered, is proof that this was an anti-Western meeting' ."
"These are not my words but the words of a Member of the European Commission."
"In a moment, we will be listening to a statement by the European Commission and by the Council on Durban."
"I would invite the Commission to tell us whether it backs the statements by Mr Bolkestein in the Volkskrant in the Netherlands or not, as the case may be."
"We appreciate the Members' imagination in introducing their issues into the debate, but we are really obliged to follow the agenda."
"Conclusions of the UN Conference on Racism"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on racism."
"Mr Michel, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to let you have an initial account of the results achieved at the Third United Nations World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, a conference which was held in Durban from 31 August to 7 September."
"The Durban Conference can be described as a success on several counts, despite the difficult political context in which the negotiations took place, and despite the fact that this conference had been described as a failure before it even began."
"Firstly, in terms of practical results, this is the first United Nations conference devoted to the task of combating racism which has ended with the adoption, by consensus, of a policy declaration and a programme of action."
"The Durban Conference was, above all, an opportunity to reinforce this essential task of combating racist tendencies, tendencies towards the discrimination and intolerance that constitute a feature of everyday life for millions of human beings, who are all too often the silent victims of outrages against their dignity."
"Even if in the adopted texts, which form the very essence of what we are talking about, little progress was made, the theoretical contemplation of the fight against racism clearly shows a strong, political will to banish racism."
"A call is also made for taking an impressive number of specific measures which aim to fight this scourge globally."
"As such, the lion' s share of the 220 articles of the action programme consist of preventive, educational and protective measures which aim to eradicate racism at all levels, as well as strategies which endeavour to attain out-and-out equality of all people worldwide."
"By way of example, I will list a few measures which should strengthen the national and regional institutions in their fight against racism, and which must encourage them to step up their mutual cooperation."
"Other measures aim to educate people to respect human rights, change their mentality and to grant non-discriminating access to education."
"Still other measures place the role of the political parties in the foreground, allowing them to develop internal codes of conduct which will prohibit their members from making public speeches which incite racism."
"In addition, there are also measures which must help in the fight against racism in the workplace."
"The action programme also contains a number of statutory, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures which must prevent racism and must offer protection against this plague."
"The time was too short to bring all negotiations to a good end."
"That is why it was impossible to complete the discussions on certain important points, such as the caste system or race discrimination in combination with the death penalty."
"However, the European Union did manage to have important themes included in all definitive texts. These themes include the gender issue, better child protection and the fight against the trafficking in human beings, especially women and children."
"Here too, I would like to emphasise the difficulties arising from the use of the concept of 'race' ."
"Today, it is a fact that each theory which supports the existence of different human races is scientifically flawed."
"The European Union would like the use of language to follow this trend."
"(NL) The EU is of the opinion that the use of terms which acknowledge the existence of different races needs to be avoided."
"It is not our intention here to deny the diversity of the human race, but we do want to emphasise its unity, and, as such, fight the present forms of racism which are often based on these kinds of claims."
"But due to strong opposition from certain States, we have been unable to make much progress in this field."
"The European Union insisted on explaining its fundamental viewpoint on this matter in a last speech, which will also be included in the Conference' s report."
"As far as the strategies are concerned, the States are urged to draft a policy and action plan to fight racism, and to implement the Durban action programme."
"They are also urged to continue to cooperate in a statutory international framework, especially with the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which is responsible for the follow-up of the implementation of the texts that were adopted in Durban."
"(FR) I think I can also safely say that the political scope of the compromise achieved on the causes and origins of racism is another important successful result of the Durban Conference."
"Like you, I have read some of the comments."
"I certainly do not want to start a controversial debate on this subject, but I will say, on the subject of the forgiveness and excuses which those who negotiated at Durban seem to have been accused of - I was there and I know I had quite a struggle to obtain this text - that of course people of our generation, like those of the previous generation, are not and were not involved in what was all too often misguided colonisation, or in slavery, but I would ask those people the following question."
"How can we be satisfied with such a banal, factual observation as that, at the same time refusing, by default, to give justice to those people who, even today, still bear the badly healed scars of colonisation and slavery?"
"I should like to reply to what I have been reading in the press by saying that we are not engaged, here, in sanctimoniously and naively cultivating a sentiment of injustice."
"On the contrary, we have to recognise, on behalf of our forebears, that the evil deeds that were committed were morally debatable, if not downright reprehensible."
"We must also tell the victims, past and present, that we know that our history has not always been glorious and that by admitting as much, obviously on behalf of others, we are showing our intention of recognising their right to extenuating circumstances and, having said that, we must propose a true partnership, based on mutual respect, and far removed from the humiliating paternalism and miserly gestures of a self-satisfied and satiated lady of the manor."
"I should therefore like, for a moment, to come back to the result."
"I believe that the result obtained at Durban opens up positive prospects for the continuation of the dialogue between North and South."
"The European Union has recognised and condemned the immense suffering caused by past and present forms of slavery and trafficking, wherever they took or take place, as well as the most blameworthy aspects of colonialism."
"It has recognised that slavery and trafficking were crimes against humanity and should always have been crimes against humanity."
"Durban was therefore an opportunity to look our common past in the face."
"Some people saw that as an act of regret, others as an act of remorse, and still others as an act of excuse."
"The important thing, it seems to me, is, above all else, the willingness to close the darkest chapters of our common history so as to be able to construct a new relationship, based on mutual respect, solidarity and partnership."
"An appeal has been launched so that more funds can be authorised for initiatives taken by developing countries, in particular the new African initiative."
"There is another element which I would not like to pass over in silence."
"In the final analysis, Durban was a success because, throughout this difficult negotiating process, the Member States of the European Union remained united."
"Intensive coordination was implemented with the support of the Council Secretariat and the Associated States were kept constantly informed."
"It was this close cooperation which enabled the Presidency, duly mandated by its European partners, to negotiate delicate compromises with the representatives of the geographical groups concerned, and with the President and Secretary-General of the Conference, Mrs Zuma and Mrs Robinson respectively."
"Regular coordination with the Western Group has also borne fruit."
"The European Union and its external and common security policy have emerged strengthened from the Durban Conference."
"Durban was the proof that the European Union is capable of speaking with a single voice on the difficult question - but one that is vital to the future of humanity - of the fight against racism and for respect for human dignity."
"The European Union asserted itself as an incorruptible negotiating partner and mediator."
"It presented an image of unity and consistency, and it supported the use of firmness, depending on the circumstances."
"As a result, its credibility was reinforced, as was its position at international level."
"The proof of this lies in the extreme flexibility and spirit of openness that the European Union showed in the discussions on the Middle East."
"The burden of those negotiations really did rest mainly on the European Union following the departure of the United States and Israel."
"The re-launching of the Middle East peace process is one of the European Union' s priorities."
"However, it believed that the Durban Conference, based as it was on the fight against racism, was not the appropriate forum for dealing with that question Since, however, the Arab and Moslem countries were insistent that the issue should be discussed at Durban, the European Union agreed to take an active role in formulating a draft consensus which was presented by the South African Presidency."
"In that draft, the European Union was able to retain the principles which it believed to be essential, namely a balanced text with a strong call for negotiations to be resumed and for violence to be brought to an end, while at the same time expressing concern about the increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the world."
"A reference to the Holocaust was retained, whereas the equation 'Zionism equals racism' disappeared, as these were among the conditions and prerequisites."
"That was what was achieved at Durban."
"We must now look to the future and put into practice those commitments to which we universally subscribed in South Africa."
"I must emphasise that everyone should be informed of the positive coverage of this conference."
"Each of us, and Member States in particular, must now redouble our efforts so as to ensure that we make the most of the exemplary success achieved by the European Union at the Durban Conference."
"I believe, therefore, that we can be reasonably satisfied with the outcome."
"I would simply like to say that you get an even better idea of how successful the conference was if you imagine for a moment what it would have represented, in terms of a message or a negative signal, if Durban had not been a success."
"I believe that in the context that we are experiencing now, that would certainly not have helped."
"I think, therefore, that we did our duty, we did exactly what we ought to have done, it seems to me, in extremely difficult conditions."
"I am very pleased to have succeeded, on behalf of the European Union, with the support of the Commission, with the support of the Council, and with the support of the fifteen Member States, but also - which is very important - with the support of the thirteen candidate countries, to have succeeded, in fact, in saving this conference."
"If we had not succeeded in saving this conference, I believe it would have had relatively damaging consequences in the longer term."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Durban Conference represents a major step forward in the endeavour to bring about global understanding, global political agreement on questions of racial discrimination, racism, xenophobia and intolerance."
"I must start by congratulating the Belgian Presidency and because, after all, they do all have names, by offering my special congratulations to the deputy prime minister, Mr Michel, who took centre stage at the Conference and managed to maintain internal cohesion between the Member States throughout and, at the same time, to shoulder the main burden of negotiations at global level."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament and the mission for their extremely important contribution to the Conference and for the important part which they played throughout the negotiations and to say that the Commission is satisfied with its contribution and its efforts to support the presidency."
"I should like to explain to Parliament and to apologise for being unable to appear in person one and three days before the Conference but health problems at home made it impossible for me to travel."
"The Conference was exciting and difficult, with a heavy workload."
"The early departure of the United States left the European Union in the position of main speaker and basically left it to shoulder the main burden of the negotiations."
"I think that the European Union's profile at this Conference was upgraded to a global profile, given that it managed, in a totally hostile environment, to bring important negotiations to a conclusion while maintaining cohesion between the Member States and maintaining excellent relations and cooperation with the candidate countries."
"Of course, we see this Conference as a success, especially if you compare it with previous attempts in 1978 and 1983."
"A global message was sent out and specific, globally agreed proposals were tabled."
"One comment which could be made is that, throughout consultations over the eight days of the Conference, the wrong agenda prevailed."
"The main aim of the Conference was to find a modern definition for racism and to decide on measures to combat it at worldwide level and that would have been a huge success by helping us to deal with the problems of racism today."
"These two issues were way down, if not off the bottom of the agenda."
"On the contrary, the issues which dominated were the Middle East and past wrongdoings."
"Of course, we cannot forget the past."
"We need a thorough knowledge of the past if we are to learn from it and avoid repeating it."
"However, when it poisons relations, cooperation, agreement and future progress, then it really is an enormous obstacle."
"A hostile climate prevailed at the Conference, both at government level and at the level of non-government organisations."
"And it must be said, texts appeared couched in terms of hatred which do absolutely nothing to foster reconciliation, build bridges between nations or build a bridge between the future and the past and should be avoided at all costs, especially at international conferences attended by every country in the world."
"I should like to refer briefly to the question of non-governmental organisations."
"The European Commission has consistently supported the participation of non-governmental organisations at the Conference."
"We value their help in formulating and applying policy."
"A large sum of money, EUR 3.7 million to be precise, has been earmarked to support the United Nations and, more specifically, the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to help fund the participation of non-governmental organisations, especially from countries which cannot meet their expenses."
"We have to admit that there is some scepticism as to what their participation achieved and, I think, there was some disappointment about the final communiqué, the final declaration by the forum of non-governmental organisations which Mary Robinson refused to present because it contained inflammatory remarks."
"Of course, it is important not to put all our eggs in one basket."
"I have to say that the main, important non-governmental organisations working on racism, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organisations failed to agree and publicly fell out in an exchange of inflammatory and awkward remarks."
"Because, unfortunately, the forum was overpowered by very specific and special issues."
"I already understand that certain Member States are re-examining how funding is provided and, of course, the Commission intends to undertake a similar re-examination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that numerous countries, for reasons best known to themselves, were unable to make an in-depth and positive contribution to the Durban Conference, we have to say that an agreement was reached which lays the foundations for further cooperation at global level."
"It sends out a clear message, as the Minister explained, about combating racism at worldwide level and, of course, every country made a commitment to national action plans, national action plans on legislation, the bases of political parties, education, employment and social and cultural life."
"However, we must not rest on our laurels."
"Recent events after 11 September have shown how easily and often how thoughtlessly racism and xenophobia can be revived."
"If we learned anything from Durban, it was that we must avoid stigmatising groups, nationalities, societies or religious minorities."
"We cannot ascribe collective crimes to collective people, but we can condemn specific political or other leaders responsible for political mistakes."
"The Commission will continue to put its efforts into combating racism by cooperating with the Member States and by keeping its eye on a very ambitious agenda; that means all Member States implementing and incorporating the package against discrimination decided last year by 2003, it means implementing the special programme against discrimination, which is already under way, and it means mobilising and guaranteeing the efficient involvement in this issue of the Racism and Xenophobia Monitoring Centre in Vienna."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, there are many people who actually wondered about the usefulness of the Durban Conference."
"Yet the international community must exist, and it must come together to discuss the issues, even if such discussions sometimes reveal contradictory interests, and I do not believe that walking out is necessarily a solution."
"At least the Durban Conference had the advantage of bringing together the international community on an issue which is undeniably a subject of common concern to all countries, because racism is a scourge of worldwide proportions, and no country is free from racism or discrimination in one form or another."
"This conference therefore provided an opportunity to take stock, to make a diagnosis, and what would be the point of such a diagnosis, if there were no treatment?"
"What could we expect from the Durban Conference?"
"I do not yet know, Mr Michel, whether it will constitute a success in the long term."
"What we do know is how it failed, in other words the fact that there was no final declaration, no confirmation of a worldwide willingness to combat racism and to find adequate means of doing so."
"The objective of the Durban Conference was to compile a whole series of worldwide instruments, to draw up a road map, to work out new strategies for combating racism, and action programmes - which you, Minister, have described - which states can exploit, subject to the subsidiarity which is the key to the issue of combating racism and discrimination."
"What lessons can we learn from this?"
"It seems to me that we have been able to avoid falling into three traps."
"The first, which you have already mentioned, is the issue of the Middle East."
"Any reasonable person knows that the problems of the Middle East would never have been solved at Durban."
"Attempts were made to turn this into a major issue, but I think that this trap was, fortunately, avoided."
"The second trap is the issue of reparations."
"Some people would have liked reparations to be the main subject of the debate."
"This was sheer perverseness, if not perversion, because it meant that there was a risk that development aid would be reduced to a form of reparations."
"As Mr Michel has quite rightly emphasised, we are all aware of the burden of history borne by certain parties."
"We must work towards solidarity between human beings rather than perpetual culpability, which in financial terms would have to come to an end one day, because any reparations expressed in terms of money would, of course, be finally paid off sooner or later."
"Finally, the third trap that was avoided was the victim list."
"Some people wanted a list to be drawn up."
"In our case that would have included the Roma, Sintis and Dalits."
"If one draws up a list of victims, of course, there is a risk that the next thing that will be drawn up is a hierarchy of victims, and some may be regarded as being more victims than others, which seems to me to be completely unproductive as far as racism and discrimination are concerned."
"In effect, therefore, the declaration is acceptable and I would like to thank Mr Michel, officially, for the essential role that he played as mediator, intercessor and - if I can risk a neologism - explainer."
"As you have emphasised so well, Mr Michel, Europe was able to make its full influence felt - and I do not believe that it did so only after the departure of the United States - because you showed great personal commitment, and because Europe consisted not only of fifteen countries, but of thirteen others as well."
"In other words a large part of the human race was giving its mind to this subject."
"As the Commissioner has said, some of the NGOs made themselves look ridiculous."
"This raises the issue of how representative they actually are."
"Fortunately, essential partners such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch disassociated themselves from the final declaration, but perhaps it will be necessary to sort out the assistance that we are able to give to the NGOs, many of which, over there, have lost all sense of responsibility to say the least."
"We are very mindful, Minister, of the practical side."
"The European Union is perhaps not at the bottom of the league table when it comes to combating racism and discrimination, but there is still a great deal to be done."
"Let us therefore exploit those 225 articles to find means of action that we can put into practice."
"Finally, and I should like to end on this point, I would simply draw attention to the inadequacy of our Parliament' s representation."
"This point will feature in the joint resolution."
"Briefly, the European Union is represented by the President-in-Office of the Council. The European Community is represented, as an observer, by both the Commission and Parliament."
"That is undoubtedly something to think about if we want the European Parliament to play a better role at international conferences, a role other than that of joint observer together with the Commission."
"Anyway, this point raises the issue of the renegotiation of the Institutional Agreement of 5 July 2000."
"You will find this proposal again in the joint resolution which will very shortly be put to the vote in this House."
"Mr President, at the heart of my political group's approach to the Durban conference is a renewed determination to tackle racism and to discover what was positive about this conference."
"I say renewed because racism in its many forms has reared its head again, with the tragic events in New York and Washington."
"We have now a danger that a renewed wave of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism will come if we do not tackle racism and its root causes."
"That illustrated the tragedy of this conference, because I felt I attended two conferences."
"One was a historic conference where delegations, like our own European Union delegation, were determined to register that racism is a major human rights issue."
"We were determined to define for the first time racism in its many international forms, whether caste, a contemporary slavery, or whether discrimination against minorities within our own European Union and indeed the candidate countries."
"We were determined to do something about racism, to show that with Article 13 we in the European Union had something to say to the rest of the world about how we were approaching our own problems."
"Yet there was a second conference that I attended, full of confusion, of individual national agendas, a determination not to define racism in different countries because of an embarrassment as to what racism represented in those countries."
"The confusion arose over the much misunderstood issue of reparations, and indeed the very destructive issue of Zionism and the problems in the Middle East, overshadowed our conference."
"We have to be determined that the first conference, with the ideals we as a delegation defined for it, are renewed in this House today."
"That requires a united front."
"It requires us not to just say that Durban was chaotic, therefore we will leave it that way for history."
"Instead, we as a European Union united, the Commission, the Belgian Presidency - which did an excellent job - those who attended the conference and all of us within this House who want to tackle racism must unite to go back to the original agenda."
"That original agenda is one which may embarrass some individual countries, but the action programme is now there."
"It is there for us to exploit and it is there for us to do something about. The issue is not whether this is a failure or not, it is about whether we can now make it a success by renewed determination within this House to get back to the action programme and make progress."
"I agree with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that the conference can be described as a qualified success."
"It did get a bad press - in some respects deservedly - but those who say an international conference on racism was not worth holding are wrong."
"For the first time in 25 years of trying, international standards were set on the human rights of those vulnerable to racial discrimination."
"That is something to celebrate."
"We have a basis on which to build in order to tackle one of the great threats to freedom, justice and security in the world, including Europe."
"Admittedly, however, the conference did start badly."
"Firstly, there was the NGO forum."
"Although many of the forum sessions were very worthwhile and indeed inspiring, the NGO voice was hijacked by the proponents of reparations for slavery and those pursuing the line that Zionism is racism."
"These themes also dominated or sought to hijack the intergovernmental conference."
"There was gross anti-Semitic abuse with, for example, cartoons circulating that could have figured in Julius Streicher's publications from the 1930s."
"The document produced by the NGO forum was so bad that the Secretary-General, Mary Robinson, was unable to recommend it to the governments."
"Some NGOs, including Amnesty International, had to disassociate themselves from it."
"This was a great shame, because so many people had travelled to Durban with the serious intent to tell the world of real daily suffering."
"I particularly remember a woman talking about the problems of internal migrants in China."
"There were also individuals from many groups who suffer individual persecution such as Roma and Dalits, sometimes known as untouchables."
"Admittedly there was a degree of cynical hypocrisy shown by some states in hiding behind the demonisation of Israel and America, including some African countries with appalling records of ethnic discrimination or human rights violations, and Arab countries unwilling to come clean about their own role in the slave trade."
"This lack of honesty detracted from the conference."
"Opinions can differ about whether the US and Israel did the right thing in staying away."
"One can say that the position of Israel, at least, was impossible."
"But certainly the absence of the US pushed the European Union into the front line."
"One can ask if the EU was fully prepared for that."
"But, admirably led by Mr Michel, as has been said, it rose to the challenge."
"I have to give Mr Michel particular credit, even if he is my Liberal political colleague."
"He came for two days and stayed for a week."
"He displayed great personal commitment to ensure that the European Union spoke with one voice and a determination - even if sometimes a grim determination - to reach agreement."
"That success was realised."
"On the Middle East the language agreed was, on the whole, balanced."
"I also believe personally that the language on slavery struck the right tone in speaking of it now as being a crime against humanity."
"Clearly reparations were not the right means of redress to talk about."
"The irony of the situation would be that African Americans would seek to claim, not Africans, who were not subject to slave trading."
"Finally, one of my disappointments at Durban was that with the spotlight on international diplomacy rather than domestic records, the European Union struggled to find the space to highlight its own growing and increasingly solid record in tackling racism."
"It is a pity that the EU as such is not represented in the UN system, so that the Commission and Parliament are only observers, although the President-in-Office did a very good job."
"Clearly it was a pity that the Commissioner was prevented from attending for family reasons."
"We have to find a way of strengthening the ability of all the European institutions to carry on taking a leading role in international human rights and anti-discrimination work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, participation in the World Conference in Durban was important, as a solemn proclamation of the renewal of an alliance against discrimination and the rejection of respect for human rights, and above all as an opportunity for reconciliation, the only way to reconstruct the future and future peace."
"As the Minister has already said, the objective of this conference was obvious, its scope was complex, and it was necessary in order to construct the future."
"At the same time, the NGO forum was held."
"Although the final declaration appears to be excessive, it merely reveals, not a split, but a great deal of diversity among the NGOs."
"Noticeable, in fact, is the absence of the worldwide NGOs, and the virtual absence of the NGOs involved in immigration in Europe."
"The only NGOs featured in the declaration are the antiracist NGOs and the solidarity NGOs."
"On the other hand, the dynamism of the international NGOs is also noticeable, in the way they challenge power, assert principles, or, then again, consolidate a power already in place, hence in some cases their lobbying activities and their nickname of VGOs (Voluntary Government Organisations)."
"Yet within this diversity there is a certain amount of logic, the logic of powerful people."
"On the one hand there is the logic emanating from the rich, developed countries, the former colonisers, and then there is the logic of the poor countries, the ones who were formerly colonised, where power remains to this day hardly what one could call democratic, yet all too often still enjoys the North' s approval."
"Words have meaning."
"We have to find the right words to provide a solution."
"The essential question is that of defining the terminology: slavery, colonialism, racism, genocide, apartheid or military occupation."
"All these words tell of daily crises, the consequences, moreover, of discrimination."
"We find that the final text talks of remorse and regrets, but refuses to give any excuses, and still less to envisage the prospect of reparations, or to reaffirm people' s right to live in peace and equality, without having to have recourse to international law."
"Finally, it is perhaps regrettable that the final declaration is a minimalist declaration which seeks to satisfy everyone by preserving a certain amount of equilibrium."
"This declaration not only calls into question the credibility and effectiveness of major international meetings, but also raises the question of direct democracy, because in effect it raises the issue of how representative the limits of participative democracy really are."
"I should like to make one final reference to this so-called hijacking of the conference."
"Who was hijacking whom? Why?"
"For what purpose? Remember that the United States did not want to take part in this meeting, and that they often threatened to withdraw."
"The NGOs' declaration, however hard it might have been, was a good pretext for avoiding any issues with a bearing on the major interests which it was not thought desirable to offend, as well as the issue of reparations."
"Several countries, including European countries, were secretly relieved to see the conference focus on the Middle East question, which allowed them to dodge the issue of excuses and to put off dealing with the colonial debt."
"Do not forget that the rich countries of the North built their prosperity on the negro slave trade and on colonial conquest, and they are not all willing to recognise this fully or to make reparation for their past crimes."
"Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock."
"Those powers are still, all too often, supported, and they too prefer to focus on an issue such as that of the Middle East, where they can make a good impression, rather than be called to account for the human rights situation in their own countries."
"Finally, the essential objective of this conference was achieved, but we must now hope that there will be real follow-up action enabling projects, guidelines and action programmes to be set up and put into practice, with a view to preventing and abolishing those situations in which discrimination occurs, thereby ensuring that our fine words are finally translated into reality."
"Commissioner, Mr President, the final declaration and action programme adopted in Durban was only possible due to the constructive and essential role played by the European Union. It was also due to the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Louis Michel' s diplomacy and ability to draw together many points of view, not to mention his natural gift for reconciling the views of all sides."
"I sincerely believe that the European Union fulfilled its role perfectly, and we can only welcome the work that has been done."
"I deplore the fact, however, despite Mrs De Palacio' s apologies, which I accept, that the European Commission was not present."
"I think that at least one commissioner could have represented you at Durban."
"I also regret the fact that few industrialised countries were represented, and I believe that many countries interpreted this as a lack of interest in the conference."
"Had they been there, it might have prevented the American and Israeli delegations from leaving."
"This is even more of a shame because racist violence and support for the populist and xenophobic vote have increased in Europe over recent years; the Freedom Party (FPÖ) led by Jörg Haider in Austria is only one illustration of this."
"Other political forces masquerading as NGOs have rushed into the void that has been left."
"Since, although the overwhelming majority of NGOs played a decisive role in preparing for the conference, and made several proposals formulating demands, I still do not agree with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who tries to play down what happened."
"This is because a small number of NGOs have been busy trying to equate Zionism with racism, and, even worse, have distributed texts and writings, examples of which I have shown to Mr Michel, in which they patently extolled the merits of the Holocaust."
"And this is something that Parliament cannot play down."
"These NGOs, or so-called NGOs, these pseudo-NGOs, were not at Durban to defend the Palestinians, they were not there to defend the anti-racists, they were not even there in favour of peace between Israelis and Palestinians."
"In my view, it is a positive sign that the final declaration acknowledges the right of Palestinians to their own land and that, at the same time, we reject any equation of Zionists with racists, in the same way as in Durban."
"I must therefore ask, as you did, Commissioner, that we know exactly who these NGOs are, what their purpose is and how they are funded before we hold another conference."
"The over-representation of some delegations leads me to question how they are funded."
"But this conference provided, above all, an opportunity to weigh up the importance of some demands. And in relation to this, I strongly challenge what my fellow Members, Mr Cornillet and Baroness Ludford said."
"I think that acknowledging slavery and the slave trade as crimes against humanity was one of the key aims of the conference, and this is a good thing, and we are merely doing justice by acknowledging that 350 years of deprivation, raids, deportations and humiliations are crimes against humanity."
"This is the least we could have done at this conference."
"And I hope that all countries and former colonial powers follow the example of France acknowledge slavery and the slave trade, or are made to acknowledge it by their national parliaments, as a crime against humanity."
"Personally speaking, I am still dubious about financial reparations, as Mr Michel said, I believe."
"Especially when we know that there are powerful lobbies of American lawyers hiding behind the African Americans' legitimate demand."
"On the contrary, there is in fact a consensus that the continent that suffered most from slavery and colonisation, should be helped with the cancellation of its debt, and by urgently and proactively pursuing policies to combat AIDS and illiteracy."
"We owe at least this to the African continent."
"In addition, we have - and Mr Michel pointed this out - valuable counterparts in Africa, who are committed, through the New African Initiative, to good governance."
"This is, therefore, the time to seize their demand to respond with practical measures and start talking."
"Lastly, I regret that there was no mention of the death penalty in the United States, and part of the reason the United States delegation left was because it did not want to talk about racism in its own country."
"I regret that discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation was not discussed."
"I regret that the concept of castes was not discussed, and I regret that the statement has no binding character."
"The European Union' s task is, first of all, to carefully monitor the use of new technologies, such as the Internet, which can be used to incite racial hatred; to speed up the implementation of Article 13; to explain the annihilation of the American Indians, slavery, colonialism and the Holocaust in our textbooks and history books, and also the Sabra and Chatila massacres."
"I believe that racism and anti-Semitism have one aspect in common with terrorism."
"On the one hand, there are those who carry out the act itself and, on the other hand, there are those who supply them with the ideological weapons."
"We must also combat the group made up of the Vlaams Blok, the National Front, the FPÖ and other parties, which supply ideological weapons to those carrying out the act itself and who themselves end up attacking the physical integrity of individuals."
"We have a responsibility to do this as well."
"Mr President, the resolution of the World Conference against Racism held in Durban is not exactly what many would have hoped for."
"I regret the withdrawal of the American delegation."
"This certainly did not do it a particular service in view of its own record on racism in its own country."
"This compromise resolution makes it very clear that much more needs to be done, especially in relation to our understanding of other cultures and religions. Islam, I have said many times, has in many ways been demonised, mostly by people who know nothing about it."
"Durban was not a failure, nor was it indeed a great success; but it re-emphasised the imperative to make racism a crime, something I have called for many times in this House."
"It helped refocus governments' attention on issues of racism, which is based largely on ignorance and a fear of the unknown."
"European governments have a responsibility to show leadership in the area of racism and xenophobia and politicians and civic leaders are failing to address the issue of racism in their own communities."
"They are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue."
"We have a long way to go in the European Union, but at least we have made a reasonable beginning in Durban. Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit."
"The resolution refers to action against Islamophobia, which I support without reservation."
"I want to state yet again, here in this House, that I am a friend of Islam."
"Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks."
"We must all ensure that under no circumstances is there any sort of backlash whatsoever against the Muslim communities within our Union."
"These terrorists acts were not carried out in the name of Islam."
"They were plainly brutal terrorist acts of a premeditated and determined nature."
"Just let me remind the House that no religion - or political movement for that matter - is without its fundamentalists."
"Mr President, I too would like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Michel, the President-in-Office of the Council, for I feel that the tenacity and determination with which it was attempted to avoid the shameful outcome towards which the Conference was headed are, above all, due to him."
"I feel that the United States and Israeli delegations did well to withdraw from the work of the Conference, just as I feel that you did well, President-in-Office of the Council, to stay on to achieve a result, for, in actual fact, the two things are not incompatible."
"The choice made by Israel and the United States served to show the world public what was in danger of happening, that a group of countries, mostly non-democratic with total contempt for their own people, was attempting to exploit the Conference in order to take sides in international politics."
"This is why I support most of what has been asserted by my fellow Members, namely that, in present times, the most dangerous and widespread form of racism in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere is the conviction that democracy and the rule of law are institutions which are only beneficial for Europe, the West and the United States, and not for some of the other communities in our world, and that they must not be exported and strictly respected in other countries as well."
"The image of dictatorships which oppress their own people, their own race and their own flesh and blood, of dictators and their representatives who have the gall to preach antiracist sermons at the United Nations, is an effective illustration of the obstacles facing the international community."
"None of this can be tolerated, and I feel that the decision taken by the United States and Israeli delegations and the determination of Mr Michel, in particular, and the Council as a whole as well, have served to make this very clear."
"I would like to end by associating myself with those who are calling for a detailed inquiry at this juncture into where, within the non-governmental organisations, responsibility for what happened lies - clearly, as always, we must avoid putting everything under the same umbrella - for there is no doubt that responsibility does lie somewhere and it must be ascertained where, not least in view of the generosity displayed by the European Union and the European Commission towards non-governmental organisations."
"Mr President, the World Conference against Racism, in conjunction with the United Nations-sponsored International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, has been a unique opportunity to consider the challenges and dangers faced by these peoples and all Stateless nations."
"Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the optimistic view expounded by Mr Michel, though I recognise willingly the very important role played by him."
"I was in Durban on that special occasion, and so I can give evidence to this House of a very insidious threat to indigenous peoples running through the provisional agenda of the Durban Summit, paragraph 27 of which states: ""The use of the term 'indigenous people' in the World Conference against Racism... cannot be construed as having any implications as to rights under international law""."
"Through that paragraph the United Nations Summit tried to exclude all these peoples from the right to self-determination recognised by the United Nations itself and international covenants."
"In response to such inadmissible discrimination and intolerance, the NGO forum in Durban denounced very strongly the new expression of neo-colonialists that will, in the long run, provoke the decimation of the cultures and civilisations of these vulnerable peoples."
"This insidious action was prepared at the Conference against Racism with a view to the future. It looks to the future, not to the past."
"As the NGO final declaration clearly suggests, structural racism in the past, current manifestations of neo-colonialism and the denial of the fundamental right to self-determination lie at the root of indigenous suffering."
"Mr President, seldom has a UN Conference been so well-intended and so badly understood as Durban."
"In my view, this is partly due to poor preparation."
"Diplomats and officials should have made more of an effort to reach consensus before the Conference."
"That would have saved the world community a great deal of money, time and embarrassing moments."
"Particularly unfortunate was the fact that a number of delegations ran off, for however well-founded their reasons may have been, those who run away are always in the wrong."
"Against this background, it was all the more surprising that, despite the obstinacy of Louis Michel, for that is how we have all come to know him in Belgium, and now also in the rest of the world, a sound final declaration was obtained after all."
"This final declaration contains a number of important provisions which, if applied, could drastically change the lives of hundreds of thousands, even millions of people."
"Governments are encouraged to allow minorities to speak their own language, acknowledge their own culture and profess their own religion, to stand up to police services who display racist behaviour and are also encouraged to adjust their legal systems so that they do not discriminate against certain groups."
"Roma and gypsy children must be given the same education as other children."
"In the field of migration policy, race discrimination must be banished."
"I also welcome the sound and balanced provisions on the Middle East, which emphasise the right to an independent State for the Palestinians as well as Israel' s safety."
"And finally, two centuries after the events, Europe has apologised for the slave trade."
"After all, we should not forget that at least ten million Africans were transported to America in what is known as forced migration on the largest-scale in the history of mankind."
"Millions more lost their lives during the slave hunt or one of the infamous cargo ships."
"The statements Commissioner Bolkestein made in a Dutch newspaper last weekend are therefore completely misplaced."
"'I am not satisfied with the excuses of the UN Conference in Durban.'"
"He said: 'I myself have never had a slave, so why should I apologise?'"
"That kind of statement bears witness to a Western arrogance which overlooks the fact that American prosperity is partly built on the labour of slaves, and European prosperity is partly built on the raw materials from former colonies."
"Can this serve as an excuse for governments in developing countries to shirk their responsibility and shift all the blame to the past?"
"No, certainly not."
"But rather than giving other people lessons in civilisation, we should have the intellectual integrity to describe this chapter in our history as it was: A crime against humanity."
"The United Nations Conference on Racism is of particular relevance in these turbulent times, when there is bloodthirsty talk and behaviour in the name of a confrontation between civilisations."
"We are witnessing armed conflicts which originate in and are sustained by racial or ethnic conflicts and we are astonished to hear statements whose content and origin are unacceptable, on the superiority of certain civilisations over others."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, Mr Louis Michel, in particular, on his efforts which led to the final success of the Durban Conference, in which I participated on behalf of this Parliament."
"His actions clearly demonstrated the European Union' s firm position in relation to racism and xenophobic attitudes."
"Without ignoring the social, political and economic problems which lead to racial discrimination in Europe, I would like to focus on one aspect - the development perspective - which has been somewhat forgotten in the stagnation of recent events and also during the Conference, in relation to the Middle East conflict and the seriousness of the events taking place there, and to the recognition of the suffering caused by Europe' s history and the perversity of slavery and slave trading, the practice of which we today see as a crime against humanity."
"The majority of ethnic conflicts which involve thousands of victims and regrettable human situations take place in developing countries, mainly in Africa."
"I therefore believe that the success of this Conference will depend on whether we are today capable of realising everything that was contained in its final declaration."
"In this resolution, we ask the Commission for financial support for the administrations of the developing countries for the implementation of national action plans to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, as was agreed at Durban."
"Forums and observatories must be created, observatories in Africa, provincial observatories, regional observatories."
"We also ask for support for the United Nations so that it can carry out the monitoring of the results of Durban, so that the fight against racism may remain on the international agenda until it is eradicated."
"I believe that we must continue working so that the contents of the declaration may be implemented."
"Of course, the United States should not have abandoned the Conference, but it was not the first time that they have abandoned it, since they had abandoned it on other occasions; this was therefore not important."
"The important thing is that we in the European Parliament are able to clearly repeat our message with one voice, to journalists, to the media, against racism and in favour of equality and integration."
"The President, acting President-in-Office of the Council, and the Commissioner will have to excuse me, for one minute of speaking time leaves one very little time to say much at all."
"But great efforts do not necessarily lead to great results."
"A lack of effort, however, can lead to disaster."
"That is why I should like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council for his efforts in Durban."
"Sometimes, it seems as if our Commissioners are looking at a different Conference from the one Mr Bolkestein is talking about, when he states that such a conference promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already have the feeling of being victims."
"That is regrettable, of course."
"Mrs Diamantopoulou, you state that there was actually a hostile atmosphere at that Conference."
"It is all the more important then that we are very aware of the fact that we always carry a level of latent racism and latent hostility around with us, and that we are very careful that people keep track of their sense of identity - and I know what I am talking about, for that is a very important theme in our groups."
"From the moment that identity leads to a sense of more worth than, and underestimation, of others, and that that sense is instilled in an entire group and transferred across to other groups, ethnic and racist tension ensues, which can lead to major conflicts."
"It is unfortunate, but we cannot say that that is not true for Europe."
"This is borne out by the success of racist parties in some of our countries, the conflicts in the Balkans, or the tension in the candidate countries."
"We must employ a great deal of patience and determination to make a difference."
"Durban may be a start."
"It was certainly not the end, for the bulk of the work will need to be done in our own communities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it a very positive indicator that this conference was held in Durban; that there were wide-ranging discussions; that a resolution was drafted; and that there has been a conclusion."
"I find that this discussion, in some respects, looks too little to the future and considers too few definite and preventative measures to combat racism so that, if possible, it does not even come into being."
"I would like to call at this point for the European Union itself to take the lead by good example, and I wish now to refer to two areas of current significance in which we can do something tangible, namely asylum policy and immigration policy."
"If we succeed in what we have set ourselves, that is, in implementing a unified asylum policy with minimum standards and rapid and reliable decision-making, we will no longer have the situation that faces us now, with asylum seekers waiting for years in ghettos, constrained to work outside the law and becoming marginalised."
"Rapid decisions lead to help being made available quickly and to recognised refugees being speedily integrated; it prevents the marginalisation that at present occurs."
"This would amount to the prevention of racism!"
"I seek progress in immigration policy as well."
"If Member States, as far as they are able and presupposing that work, accommodation and educational opportunities are available, accept citizens from outside States and offer help with integration, then that is another step taken against exclusion and discrimination and in favour of integration, and I believe we should grasp these practical tools in order to be really successful in preventing racism and discrimination."
"This is an opportunity for our European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the World Conference on Racism in Durban was overshadowed from the outset by a political strategy of discrimination."
"Arab States attempted to impute racism to Israel, with the intention of making the Arab world out to be victims of Israeli racism, which was then to be condemned by the conference."
"This was a perfidious strategy."
"They attempted to make use of this important conference for their own purposes."
"Like the conference as a whole, any attempt to seriously get to grips with this strategy was sunk by the terrible events on 11 September."
"We now have a situation in which the entire Arab world is in danger of itself being pilloried in a racist way."
"All people of Arab origin or from an Islamic cultural background are in danger of having the deeds of a small terrorist group laid at their door."
"There are, unfortunately, already examples of how this can happen openly and violently."
"It can also, however, happen surreptitiously through concealed mistrust."
"Either way, it is a creeping venom seeping into our open society and becoming a burden on it."
"This would represent a victory for the terrorists."
"So let us not allow it to happen!"
"Let us not follow the bad example that cast a pall over the Durban Conference."
"We Members of Europe's Parliament, above all people, must be wary of rashly pigeonholing people by nationality and religion."
"Let us be an example."
"Let us continue to be open and tolerant."
"But the terrorists must be in no doubt: they will be pursued with rigour, with no regard to race and religion."
"We here can do something against racism."
"Let us act accordingly and give an example."
"That will be worth more than all the conferences in the world, something that will be demonstrated when we take this debate to its post-Durban conclusion."
"Mr President, the European Union bears a particular responsibility in the fight against racism and racial discrimination."
"The action plan adopted on 8 September in Durban is an important message and a contribution to creating awareness in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"The conference's eventual agreement on a joint declaration is to be welcomed."
"Although many, but not all, NGO's and also many States strenuously attempted to convert the Conference into a unilateral forum of condemnation of Israel and to make the issue of slavery and colonialism an opportunity for demanding compensation payments, it can be counted a success that the Final Document did not take up extreme positions of this sort and that it came into being at all."
"With hindsight, however, we must ask ourselves whether the European Union's generous support for the NGOs, which I consider justified in principle and which amounted to EUR 3.7 million, always found its way to the right destinations, all the more so as agitprop arguments to the effect that, for example, Zionism is equivalent to racism, are very much part of the political vocabulary of many States, Syria being one example."
"The biggest terrorist attack to date against the civilised world took place three days after the Durban Conference."
"None other than President Mubarak of Egypt has pointed out that human rights issues are often misused by terrorist organisations in order to build up their international networks."
"Mark well, though, that human rights and the fight against racial discrimination and xenophobia are indivisible and of global significance."
"Nobody is immune, as demonstrated by the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans and the most recent tragic events in Northern Ireland."
"The Durban Action Plan is an important document for every State, but also for the European Union as a whole, which bears great responsibility in this respect, above all in the framework of the United Nations."
"I wish the EU's role were more visible there as well."
"Mr President, the debate on the outcome of the UN Conference on Racism is particularly topical following the tragic events on 11 September."
"Unfortunately, the global coalition against terrorism appears to exist alongside a xenophobic revival, as Mrs Diamantopoulou said earlier, and a tendency to demonise whole groups of people, mainly Muslims and Arabs."
"According to the international press, the majority of the public in Holland, 62% to be precise, in a country with a long tradition of democracy, considers that the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington will seriously impede the social integration of Muslims in Holland."
"At the same time, there is support in Germany for reviewing the legislative framework governing religious organisations."
"A few days ago in Britain, a nineteen-year-old Muslim girl and a taxi driver were the victims of an unprovoked attack."
"During this morning' s debate on asylum and immigration, several members in the House expressed anti-Islamic views."
"These developments are most worrying."
"Europe' s experiences from the horrendous wars of the twentieth century highlight the danger to peace and democracy and to human dignity of racism, xenophobia and nationalism."
"In the light of recent events, the European Union and the Member States need to strengthen their legal mechanisms for fighting racism and to take initiatives at global level to reduce the gap between countries and to ostracise violence as a means of resolving differences."
"Fighting terrorism and dispensing justice should never call our democratic achievements and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights into question."
"Finally, I should like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Michel, and the European delegation as a whole for helping to make the UN Conference in Durban a success."
"Mr President, racism is one matter on which there exists a great cultural unanimity: that it is wrong."
"Nobody wants to be accused of racism; it is one of those strong and highly-charged words which can easily be used not only to struggle against injustice but also to attack and to brand people."
"The shadow declaration which preceded the NGO Conference on Racism, in which Israel was accused of racism - without any simultaneous condemnation of anti-semitism - created a distorted starting point for the UN conference."
"We Members of the European Parliament, too, have seen with our own eyes how anti-semitism appears in the form of naked racism in Palestinian textbooks."
"The tone of debate was unfair to Israel when account is taken of its past and the obvious desire of hostile States to deny Israel's very right to exist."
"I certainly do not deny the problems of the Palestinians; these need to be rectified. But no solution will be generated by obfuscating facts in one way or the other."
"It is tragicomic that, while condemning discrimination, one is guilty of that very thing oneself."
"This unfairness unfortunately harmed the credibility of the NGOs and damaged the prestige of the Conference on Racism."
"As a friend of the civic society and of NGOs I particularly regret this: by its lack of consideration, this body has weakened its own credibility and future operating prospects."
"I very much appreciate the way in which the most respected human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch immediately dissociated themselves from the text of the NGO conference."
"Similarly, I wish to thank the representative of the presiding State, Belgium, whose intervention on behalf of the EU justifiably stressed that the conflict in the Middle East is a political one and should not be treated in a conference on racism at all."
"What, then, should have been discussed?"
"What did all this political talk crowd out?"
"According to Amnesty International, many critical matters such as the treatment of refugees, human trafficking, persecution based on the caste system, and the rights of gypsies threatened to remain unnoticed."
"And, unfortunately, this is what happened."
"The Indian untouchables, for example, made strong efforts to bring up their own plight in the NGO forum on racism."
"Discrimination against untouchables is, according to them, a hidden form of apartheid."
"Mr President, the Durban Conference provided an important opportunity to condemn the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia, sending out a clear and powerful message, the need for and importance of which remain highly relevant today."
"The twentieth century bore witness to the most horrendous crimes committed in the name of racist doctrines which, we should bear in mind, took place in Europe, whose civilisation was the birthplace of the great declarations on rights."
"The Durban Conference, however, was much more than an exercise in the duty of remembrance."
"Durban reminded us that the modern world has proved itself incapable of eradicating racism and xenophobia from its societies and these, even in Europe, continue to create victims and underlie violent conflicts."
"Unfortunately, some people have succumbed to the Manichean philosophy, lacking in any historical rigour, that gives Europe a disproportionate and over-simplified responsibility for all the evils and oppression associated with racism, such as the use of slavery."
"Europe does not reject its history, neither the enlightened times nor its darker moments, but nor must it allow it to be crassly manipulated."
"Europe must not allow its history to become a mere settling of accounts, with the past being placed in the dock in order to exonerate the present time and conceal modern responsibilities for the persistence of the abject and anachronistic phenomenon of slavery and, more generally, of the systematic violation of fundamental rights."
"Judging history with the eyes of the present is a pernicious exercise in populism that simplifies the complex and, consequently, offends the truth."
"Manicheism seeks to segregate fanaticism and use the whole gamut of crusades that interpret history as an endless struggle between Good and Evil."
"A fanatic, by definition, has no interlocutors, only enemies."
"History is not merely the balancing of criminal offences and civil compensation laid down in current legislation."
"We reject this pointless exercise."
"The European Union' s political responsibility for affirming the universal values inherent to human dignity is both domestic and international because it is inherent to the most intimate raison d' être of our common project."
"Our collective European responsibility is expressed in the unreserved confirmation of our place in the front line of combat, by the universal affirmation of human rights and rights protecting against racism and xenophobia and in the determination to pursue and extend its constructive role on the international stage, by liberating humanity from all discrimination based on hatred, prejudice and ignorance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would nonetheless like to briefly respond to the speakers with some considerations, and perhaps with some more detailed information."
"First of all, I agree to an extent, as Mr Van Hecke said, I agree to an extent with him in believing we must ensure that we prepare very thoroughly for a conference of this kind."
"I think that, essentially, we have, to a certain degree, paid a heavy price for the fact that a number of shortfalls were perceived in the preparations for this conference."
"I believe, to use a term that you are familiar with, that there were still far too many 'leftovers' at Durban, which obviously made the task at hand much more complicated."
"I therefore think that this preparation is obviously extremely important."
"My second comment in relation to this type of conference: I am not sure whether to want to draw up a document that provides a comprehensive list of every situation would not be a mistake, and whether or not, at the end of the day, this would adversely affect the substance of the final document."
"By this I mean that, if we had a more concise text, with a specific number of principles that can be generally applied, I feel that we would probably be able to produce a stronger text."
"And we can even question whether or not the European Union could perhaps at some point contemplate doing this, in other words, glean from the Durban Conference a basic framework, which would facilitate the roll-out of the Durban achievements in each Member State."
"I have heard many people ask the question, 'So, that was Durban - what comes next?'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that what happens next depends in the main on the Member States."
"I believe that it was Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who said that if a State wants to apologise, present or express remorse or regret, at the end of the day, it is up to that State to know how far it can go."
"Secondly, I think that each State can very easily put the finishing touches to or devise its own specific action programme to combat racism, based on what was done at Durban, drawing its inspiration from these principles and from what was agreed at Durban."
"I also listened earlier to the Commissioner very clearly saying that the Commission was also planning to take some very specific measures."
"I think that the Commission has already been working on this matter for some time."
"I therefore feel that there will be a follow-up, that there will be another conference after Durban if that is what we want."
"In fact, this comes down to the usual question of political will."
"Naturally, I would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the speakers who have expressed their appreciation of my work, which is much too generous."
"I believe that I had the support of some extremely competent people from the Commission, Council, and of course from my own delegation."
"I was also able to count on all those representing the various European countries."
"I feel that it was logical to do the work that we did. I think that it was perfectly natural."
"I would like to perhaps respond to a number of comments about what is lacking in the documents."
"Yes, they naturally lack a number of points."
"For example, why is there no mention at all of the caste system in the documents adopted at Durban?"
"This is a particularly important subject for the European Union, I am aware of this, and what is more, I share this concern."
"As you know, the European Union is concerned about situations involving discrimination throughout the world; therefore it was natural that we also express this concern."
"We closely followed developments regarding this problem and we supported a paragraph put forward by Switzerland, discussing this problem. The text makes references to discrimination based on ancestry and occupation, which clearly describes types of discrimination, the helpless victims of which live in several countries around the world."
"Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the European Union and other countries, particularly South America, it was not possible to reach an agreement with India on this paragraph."
"Since this conference was based on consensus, as you know, the text was therefore withdrawn, and this is something I regret."
"However, we must also remain realistic and realise that we cannot achieve everything."
"One speaker quite rightly mentioned the problem of the death penalty. This is a subject that is of particular personal concern to me."
"As you know, the abolition of the death penalty is one of the European Union' s priorities."
"I believe that we are right to reiterate this, and we are endeavouring to use every possible opportunity we are given at international level to push forward the debate on this issue."
"This was the case at the Durban conference."
"The European Union supported a paragraph of the action programme referring to racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty."
"The United States strongly opposed this paragraph during the preparatory process, however, and several countries, particularly those in Asia, also rejected it and, without consensus, it was not possible to retain this text either."
"I am obviously giving these examples in order to convince you that your concerns were relayed and were expressed in Durban, but unfortunately we could not achieve everything."
"I would like to briefly mention the behaviour of the NGOs throughout the conference."
"As stressed in the documents adopted at Durban, civil society, and NGOs therefore, have an important role to play in the fight against racism."
"That is why the NGO forum organised prior to the Intergovernmental Conference was particularly important for the European Union."
"In my view, this is also the reason why the European Commission funded most of those taking part in the forum."
"Unfortunately, although the forum provoked some interesting debates, I, myself, took part in a debate that I found extremely interesting, the forum followed a process that was, at times, dubious and, at others, totally undemocratic."
"Extremist organisations seem to have monopolised the discussion, which forced Member States to disregard the conclusions of the forum."
"Some NGOs, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and FIDH, also disassociated themselves from the forum' s outcome."
"Moreover, we must admit that the aggressive approach and disgraceful verbal abuse from some NGOs raises the question as to why the European Union and its Member States as well - my own country included - give their unconditional support to these organisations."
"I think that we must also discuss with the NGOs such issues as their accountability, their representativeness and the confines of their responsibilities."
"As I have already said, I enjoyed a very good relationship with most of the NGOs, and I also acknowledge that they have a specific role to play."
"Earlier, I heard Mrs Boumediene-Thiery use a rather subversive term - which is a great credit to you, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery - but we could have a fundamental difference of opinions."
"Personally speaking, as a democratically elected politician, I am not willing to give up my prerogative to assume political responsibility on behalf of the people."
"I have been elected, the people can therefore reject me, which is what I call responsibility, and I must also be accountable to the people - these are, essentially, my two duties."
"I am not therefore willing to let this prerogative be taken away from me because, when this system of political responsibility ceases to exist, we would no longer have a democracy, in other words."
"And that is something that I cannot accept."
"I did want to bring up one particular subject - which Mr Sylla mentioned, I believe - that of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, which is one of many forms of discrimination."
"The European Union was in favour of highlighting the many forms of discrimination that affect some classes of people."
"This concept is certainly present in the texts."
"However, when it came to defining potential sources of these many forms of discrimination, it was not possible to include concepts that the European Union considers to be important, such as discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"This idea was firmly opposed by some countries, as you suspected."
"The only aspects that everyone found acceptable were the sources of discrimination listed in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, in other words, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political belief or any other belief, national or social origin, wealth, birth or any other situation."
"What are we doing in terms of following up this conference?"
"I shall conclude by reiterating my earlier point that it would be the task of each Member State to follow up the Durban Conference, but it has already been decided that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights will primarily be responsible for providing this follow-up."
"Several measures must be implemented, particularly the creation of an anti-discrimination unit within the Office of the High Commissioner and the appointment of five highly-regarded independent experts, who will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the provisions contained in the action programme and the political declaration."
"These experts will be appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General."
"Naturally, I wanted to provide you with this clarification, first of all because I was also keen to congratulate those speakers who made such relevant comments, and I wanted to tell them that their strong convictions have served as a significant driving force and support enabling us to defend the points of view that we expressed on your behalf in Durban."
"In accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions to end the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Vehicles designed to carry more than eight passengers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0312/2001) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver' s seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC (C5-0278/2001 - 1997/0176(COD))."
"Madam President, I welcome everybody here again tonight."
"I see a good number of familiar faces."
"I wish to pay tribute to my shadow rapporteur, Mr Harbour, who again is attending a late-night sitting with me."
"We probably spend more nights together than we do with our respective wives."
"I should also like to pay tribute to a number of people who have worked on this report, not just within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market but also within the Commission and the Council."
"It was not a difficult conciliation but it was successful and I was very pleased at the outcome."
"I should also like to give the thanks of probably about a third of the population of the European Union to Parliament, for I am anticipating that the vote tomorrow will go the right way."
"There are something like 35 million registered disabled people within the European Union; we have 120 million elderly people."
"The two groups are obviously not mutually exclusive, but they make up about a third of the population of the European Union."
"The outcome of tomorrow's vote will very largely decide what their quality of life in the future will be."
"For years now people with disabilities have not been able to get around the towns and cities of the European Union as they should; they have been trapped for too long in their own houses."
"If this directive is adopted tomorrow, it will open up that door."
"It will be one small step towards freeing a lot of people who, as I said earlier, have been trapped."
"I would like to convey their thanks to Parliament."
"I realise that some of my colleagues on the right of this House have had difficulties with this directive, mainly because of its technical nature."
"I fully understand and appreciate that."
"However, I would ask them at this late stage to consider what we are doing, because if this directive is adopted tomorrow, it is something that everybody in Parliament could be proud of, because we would be improving the lives of the citizens of the European Union."
"For once we would be making a difference."
"Too often we stand up in this Chamber and talk about various great plans, schemes and motions, etc. and they do not impact on people's lives."
"Here is a small thing that does impact on the lives of the European citizen and it is something we should all be proud of."
"I understand my colleagues on the right will be abstaining tomorrow."
"That is unfortunate but it is, at least, an improvement on voting against in the second reading."
"I would ask them, however, to look at this again and cast their votes in favour, because all along I have tried to leave out the technicalities and have concentrated purely on the policy and philosophy of getting people with disabilities mobile again."
"That is an aim and objective I think we would all agree with."
"In that respect, I have really not much more to say, because this has been discussed at length."
"The Commissioner is well aware of the contents of the report and probably could recite them as well as I could."
"Finally, I should like to thank very much all those who have helped draft this report and who tomorrow will help to adopt it."
"Madam President, once again it is a genuine pleasure to be working with my friend Mr Miller."
"I want to pay tribute to him for his persistence in working through this, and particularly for the masterly way in which he handled the conciliation process."
"This is the first time I have been involved in a trialogue, so I have been able to study the process at work."
"Indeed, as he says, we have reached a very satisfactory outcome."
"I fully supported the final compromise and, indeed, the benefits that it will deliver."
"It is important that we finally, after five long years, bring this to a close."
"In a moment I shall refer to some of the issues involved."
"However, it is important to add that, in delivering the sort of benefits that Mr Miller was talking about, we need to reflect the fact that a lot of other improvements to the infrastructure associated with public transport will also be needed."
"The buses are only part of it."
"That is something that we have not been able to tackle but that other committees will wish to look at."
"What about the principles?"
"He quite rightly said - I tipped him off beforehand - that we will be abstaining on this."
"It will go through tomorrow."
"We certainly do not wish to obstruct it or vote against the conciliation procedure, but we feel, on this side of the House, that the principles that led us to vote against this last time - and my colleague, Mr Rübig, who will speak later, is a veteran of the previous process - are entirely consistent."
"So we will not be obstructing it."
"It will go on its way with our qualified support."
"Mr Miller has played the role of the man riding the last dinosaur, if I may put it that way."
"Commissioner Liikanen told us at second reading in the debate that he does not envisage bringing a regulation of this complexity before Parliament again."
"That is absolutely the right approach."
"I want to take the opportunity to say to the House tonight that I, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, have made a proposal to other committees and to the Commission on ways in which Parliament can exercise its political role in scrutinising and putting forward ideas for motor vehicle regulation."
"We have suggested that the Commission should bring to us on an annual basis a comprehensive report on its plans for future motor vehicle regulation, specifying where it is going to use the Economic Commission for Europe proposals and, indeed, covering some of the voluntary regulation process that we have talked about."
"That will allow this Parliament, through all its various committees, to take a serious look at the political content of regulation and not ever again become immersed for five years in this sort of complex, technical regulation - a process that we finally sign off this evening."
"Mr President, one of the objectives of the directive is to improve access to public transport for persons of reduced mobility."
"The European Parliament and the Council seriously disagreed on this point."
"The European Parliament' s insistence on provisions to facilitate access for persons of reduced mobility, especially wheelchair users, was vindicated, as was the rapporteur, Mr Miller."
"The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with the position taken by the European Parliament, proves yet again how important issues such as the quality of life can only be promoted through courageous policies which are free from technocrats' reservations and financial considerations."
"The proposed directive introduces a broader definition of the term 'persons of reduced mobility' , stipulating that it includes all people who experience some difficulty when using public transport, especially the elderly and the disabled."
"Reduced mobility does not necessary depend on some form of medical complaint."
"This is an important innovation which could be used as the starting point for similar adjustments to give substance to policy on the quality of life."
"To be specific, disability may take different forms, including not just physical mobility but also intellectual and sensory impairment."
"Therefore, it also includes people who merely have limb impairments, are of small stature, pregnant women etc."
"It also states that all sloping areas in vehicles must have a non-slip surface."
"It is also worth pointing out that it does not limit itself to vehicle specifications; in order to ensure passengers can board safely, it also makes provision for easier access through local infrastructure planning."
"This should guarantee safe, pavement-level boarding by all persons of reduced mobility."
"I would like to believe that the spirit of agreement achieved here will prevail over other similar endeavours."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about this directive is above all a dispute about principles, about whether we, in the European Union of the future, want the principle of harmonisation, that of mutual recognition or the 'third version' - where do we need the one and where the other?"
"We have achieved only a small partial success with this directive on the EC procedure for approving vehicle types because, of course, national procedures for type approval still apply concurrently with, and in addition to, the directive which is now being laid down."
"What we want matters here, and I would like to express my thanks to Mr Miller for working so hard to ensure that what we want prevails."
"This is, of course, not true of national procedures for type approval, which prevail at present and will continue to prevail in future."
"The success is a very modest one, and we will therefore be abstaining tomorrow, because it does not go far enough for us, because we would actually have liked a general regulation for all buses."
"I must also say that the Commission's proposal was a very, very good one in terms of content and from the points of view of engineering and technology, but must be rejected absolutely on the grounds of logic."
"At first reading, we had 160 pages of detailed Commission proposals on the table, Members worked out another 110 amendments to them, and I think this House and, at the end of the day, Europe as a whole, is overburdened with this sort of detail."
"The state of affairs we will be deciding on tomorrow is such that we have now even fixed the curvature of the rear panel of a bus at a normative maximum of 150 mm."
"Even compared with the European standard cucumber, that is a sensational success!"
"Madam President, I wish to congratulate Parliament and, in particular, its Conciliation Committee and the rapporteur, Mr Miller, on their success in reaching an agreement with the Council on this very important directive."
"I should like to stress that, with this directive, the European Community will be setting the pace and enabling the industry to compete under common rules to produce safe and more accessible buses and coaches for the benefit of all European public transport users."
"This directive makes significant progress in three areas, namely the internal market, the transport policy and the social policy of the Community."
"The access provisions for buses and coaches as regards boarding by persons with reduced mobility will ensure that a larger proportion of our citizens use public transport."
"I should like to reply to the question by Mr Harbour."
"I received the letter based on his proposal from the chairman of the committee, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, and I have sent him a detailed reply, which supports this initiative."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday."
"GALILEO"
"The next item is the report (A5-0288/2001) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council on GALILEO (COM(2000) 750 - C5-0110/2001 - 2001/2059(COS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are latecomers; time is running away from us and, above all, from the GALILEO project."
"The longer the European Union hesitates in getting the European satellite navigation system underway, the more both industry and the people will react to it with apathy."
"The ultimate danger is that GALILEO will one day be buried."
"My anxieties increase when I recall some of the statements made to me over the years when I worked on the European satellite navigation project."
"The position Parliament has taken with regard to the Commission's communication does not, admittedly, possess any legislative character, but points in an important direction."
"I hope that it will be by a large majority that Parliament will adopt my report tomorrow and thus support the position that Europe urgently needs a satellite navigation system of its own, not least in view of the special situation in which Europe and the rest of the world find themselves since 11 September."
"The Council also holds this fundamental view, as again confirmed by the final conclusions from Stockholm."
"How, though, may we clear away the doubts that surface again and again, even in the amendments before us?"
"The fundamental issue is now as it was before: why do we need a European satellite navigation system of our own, when the Americans have already supplied a working model in the form of GPS?"
"Let me quote some of the main arguments."
"The first is that the American system is conceived on military lines, with resultant disadvantages as regards continuity of availability, precision, and also legal certainty."
"What concerns us here is reliability, which must be guaranteed even in a crisis."
"It must be clear to all of us that Europe's sovereignty and security would be gravely imperilled if the navigation systems were to be taken out of European control."
"We quite evidently need our own civilian system which, however, must be available to all - and I emphasise all - potential users."
"I regret therefore that I am unable to support the amendments newly reintroduced by the GUE/NGL Group, which demand a purely civilian use."
"Secondly: we are pressing for free competition not only within the EU, but also worldwide."
"It can, then, be only a cause for amazement if we readily accept a monopoly from a foreign State and expose our users to the risk of provision being less than optimal."
"We must commit ourselves to the best interests of our citizens and users."
"Thirdly: if the European Union were to do without its own system, it would fall back massively in the high technology sector."
"That can surely not be the intention."
"On the contrary, we want to see Europe at the top, and for that we need GALILEO."
"Fourthly: GALILEO creates employment in Europe."
"The jobs created are for the highly qualified and in a sector with a future, namely high technology."
"The building-up of the infrastructure and the many potential applications could create up to 100 000 jobs in the next few years and result in high earnings in the market."
"Why, then, is GALILEO vital for Europe?"
"In my report, I have described at length the advantages and positive aspects for the various fields of application."
"These advantages become all the more convincing if we succeed in involving other countries in the project."
"For example, China expressed interest only recently, at the Brussels Summit."
"Europe is capable of developing its own system."
"We are not going to keep GALILEO, like a confection, for our own enjoyment, but will offer it to those of our partners who are willing to have it, and we will let those partners share in the great benefits."
"As we want to offer the best service possible, we set great store on compatibility with other systems from the outset."
"Industry is showing an interest, as demonstrated by the EUR 200 million pledged to the Commission as a statement of intent, but we must not make excessive demands on Europe's industry."
"The wheels of industry will not start rolling without a clear and definite political signal, a green light given by us."
"The preparatory work done by the Commission and the European Space Agency deserves high praise."
"Now, though, I await expectantly the Commission's financial and administrative framework, as called for in the report."
"This framework will be a further building block and a weight-bearing pillar for developing our own satellite navigation system."
"GALILEO is a Community project - incidentally, the first in this field, which makes it a vision for the future!"
"Let us now, then, get to grips with it, instead of putting it off forever and a day, for GALILEO will revolutionise transport and mobility, just as the Internet has done."
"Success stories - of which we in Europe can already claim a few - require careful thought, courage and decisiveness."
"Let us make good use of this historic moment when we vote tomorrow!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the Commission communication on GALILEO, I will confine myself in this speech to the financial side of the project."
"At the current stage, GALILEO does not comply with the statement on financial programming, which was adopted by the three institutions on 20 July 2000."
"According to this statement, 'the budgetary authority must have accurate information about the financial consequences of each new proposal presented by the Commission, in order to be able to assess the impact of the proposal on the ceilings of the financial perspective (...)' ."
"Furthermore, at a meeting of EU transport ministers in April 2001, it became clear that the Union had major problems finding the extra EUR 1.5 billion required from private sources for the deployment phase (2006-2007) of GALILEO."
"On the other hand, the Commission states that when it issued a call for an expression of interest in order to establish the conditions needed in order to set up a public-private partnership, several European industrial consortia responded to this, without reference to any further problems."
"I would like to make it clear that I support the Commission' s approach in principle."
"Nevertheless, I would warn that GALILEO may have a much bigger impact on the general budget than initially expected."
"I consider that the budgetary authority should have a clear picture of GALILEO' s source of funding before it can commit appropriations to the project."
"The identification of the sources and amounts of private funding should be concurrent with the identification of public funding. Financing needs should be met by 2002."
"Then, Parliament should demand prior consultation of the budgetary authority in the event that the expenditure to be financed from the general budget is to be revised."
"This would ensure that no restrictions are placed on other activities financed under heading 3 if GALILEO does not attract the investments foreseen by the Commission."
"However, following my approach, in a situation of crisis, the European Union would have the possibility to use the satellite navigation services provided by GALILEO without having to rely on other (primarily military) satellite systems operated by the United States and Russia such as GPS and GLONASS, although it would still be compatible with them."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to give our opinion on the GALILEO programme, taking into account the decisions made, namely by the Stockholm European Council on 23 March 2001."
"At this Council meeting, great emphasis was placed on the need to launch this satellite navigation programme immediately."
"Our Committee acknowledges the benefits of such a programme, the main feature of which is that it is European as well as civilian in nature, and is therefore independent of systems developed by the military, such as the American GPS and Russian GLONASS systems, and that is reliable and has greater precision than these two existing systems."
"We are proposing, however, that the following points be implemented during the development and validation phase from 2001 to 2005, the deployment phase from 2006 to 2007, and the operation phase, which begins in 2008, essentially under the aegis of the European Space Agency and the Commission."
"First of all, we must accurately monitor the funding, initially estimated to be in the region of EUR three billion, as well as the partners chosen, particularly private industries, and their involvement. We must also carry out an in-depth analysis of the cost-effectiveness and the implications for the economy and employment."
"We are demanding the greatest level of transparency in this matter and to receive regular information from Parliament."
"Secondly, we stress the fact that the structures established during the development of the programme should be used solely for civilian purposes, and we point out that it is vital, in this case, to develop the use of space for purposes related to the general interest and public service."
"Thirdly, the GALILEO programme must not be applied in such a way that will jeopardise the right to or the protection of privacy and it must not under any circumstances be used for the surveillance of citizens."
"It must, in particular, be developed in order to protect and safeguard the environment, to protect the lives of citizens and natural resources, and ensure early detection and even prevention of natural or man-made disasters."
"It must also contribute to progress in European research, when drawing up the future Sixth Framework Programme."
"Lastly, we are proposing - and this is important - to set up an advisory ethics committee, whose task would be to ensure respect for the aforementioned requirements and which would assist the Commission and the European Space Agency in their decision-making duties."
"I want to emphasise - and I call on Mrs De Palacio to give us her point of view - the fact that it will be civilian organisations that set up the system."
"Of course, we cannot say that, 'we will not vote in favour of GALILEO if it is used by the military in the future' , because, when we set up transport and communication systems, for instance, anyone can use them."
"What matters is that Europe is independent and that it is not dependent on the USSR or the US."
"We believe that these various provisions are realistic conditions, which must accompany and justify GALILEO, and we would also hope to hear Mrs De Palacio' s point of view on setting up the ethics committee."
"Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, competition stimulates business, as the example of the motor industry over the last 100 years has shown."
"The fact that there were at least three major production centres, the USA, Europe and Asia, was extremely good for business all round."
"Airbus is another good example of what can be achieved by exposure to international competition, if we are not simply content for other people to make a good product that we can buy or even use free of charge like the GPS."
"It will be no different with what we are discussing today - the GALILEO satellite navigation system."
"Of course it is no bad thing that GPS exists."
"Of course it is no bad thing, it may even be a good thing, that in many cases it is available to users free of charge."
"But that there is, to all intents and purposes, only an American system is not good at all."
"The Russian GLONASS is probably not entirely in the same category."
"We Europeans have no real rights of access."
"The examples there have been in the past have shown that we are suddenly bereft of navigation in one case or another."
"Almost more important and quite central from my point of view as a university teacher is that we have no real involvement in technological innovation if we are not engaged in development ourselves, if we do not carry out research ourselves and if we do not ourselves take research to the applications stage so that it can also go into industrial production."
"We need both, we need access and we need technological development."
"We cannot talk about a society of knowledge and learning without taking the next logical step."
"Above all, too, we also need the many potential applications in transport."
"I believe that requires no further explanation."
"Admittedly there are also problems when it comes to GALILEO."
"The problems of finance have still not really been resolved."
"Industry is still biding its time, waiting for public funding, while the public authorities in turn plead Maastricht criteria, empty pockets and the like."
"Hopefully there will sooner or later be a genuine public and private partnership in this matter."
"A last word on the tricky subject of double use or only civilian use."
"I cannot understand the naivety of many of the tabled amendments."
"There is not only good in the world."
"The events of 11 September were a cruel demonstration of that."
"Finally a word of thanks and appreciation to the two ladies who have made such a big contribution to this evening' s report, the rapporteur Brigitte Langenhagen and the Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio."
"Neither of them lost their bearings in dealing with this topic."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen on her excellent work, which also received a notably favourable vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I hope that the same will happen tomorrow when the House votes on the report, since this is a particularly important, even historic text for the European Union."
"The European Union is a major power."
"Europe is a major player in the aviation and space industries, but the European Union does not have aviation and space power, since it has never had a policy in this area until now and, as Mrs Langenhagen said, GALILEO is a historic beginning for us, our first Community programme."
"The GALILEO programme is all the more important because it guarantees that the high technology and the activity of our industries will be maintained in the future, since 150 000 jobs will be created."
"GALILEO represents the political independence of the European Union, since, as you are aware, we had no frequency access during the Kosovo war due to the American GPS system, and as things stand at the moment, we cannot count on the American system being completely reliable in the coming years."
"I therefore believe that it is crucial that we consider the success of GALILEO as vital in ensuring the EU' s credibility over the next few years in an area where competition in the aviation and space industries is increasingly marked, particularly when faced with new competition, for instance from China or Japan."
"We are also concerned about how this operation is funded, about the delays in its implementation and that it has been postponed on numerous occasions."
"Let us be clear about one thing - in the space industry, as in all the other transport industries, nothing can be achieved without State funding and without a boost from the government, whether this is direct State funding or so-called co-funding, along the lines of the American model, where the military sector funds the civilian."
"We must be aware of this situation."
"With regard to infrastructure, it is very difficult to find private sector investment, therefore we must be prepared, the Commission is not only responsible for this, Member States are responsible as well."
"The Council must certainly be made aware of this."
"This is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not want to increase the number of obstacles."
"We shall not vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left or the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the funding method, whereby the GALILEO programme must be halted if private sector investment is not sufficient. This is because we believe GALILEO is a crucial programme for the future of the European Union and for the future of European space policy."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to say a word of thanks to Mrs Langenhagen for the huge amount of work she has carried out on this topic."
"It has been a long haul, with obstacles and unruliness along the way, and the end is certainly not yet in sight."
"However, we are taking an important decision tomorrow, which will bring us one step closer to our goal."
"International developments underline the importance of having a system of our own, but at the same time, of establishing sound international cooperation, so that interoperability of the system can be achieved."
"I should like to mention three other points which the ELDR Group considers important."
"First of all, the management structure."
"To the ELDR Group, it is important that the management is transparent, and we are already glad of a major step forward by the Council, namely the proposal to set up a single administrative structure in agreement with Article 171 of the Treaty."
"The second point I should like to raise is the financial concern."
"We are still not entirely convinced that that is going in the right direction."
"We accept that at the beginning, public money must be invested, but industry must contribute too."
"There must be a balance."
"There is still no binding agreement with the private sector and there is still uncertainty in that area."
"That is why we have tabled an amendment for which I should ask your support, so that the European Union does not become a safety net."
"And given the high cost, we expect a contribution towards the cost of the use."
"Improved geographical access and reliability must be factors in favour of which industry must choose and in which they must display willingness to invest."
"That is exactly what makes the system first-rate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, a great deal of work has been done."
"A report has been drawn up."
"That too took up a lot of time."
"However, a whole host of arguments are being put forward, with which - let there be no mistake - I entirely disagree."
"The wrong arguments are being used in order to sell a project."
"Let me start with the technology."
"Some people claim that superior technology is being used here."
"That is absolutely not the case."
"GPS is a similar system."
"Our system is slightly better because it uses ground stations."
"As a result, it is slightly more reliable and communication is possible."
"But the subsequent generations of GPS II - did you think the Americans were mad? - and GPS III are just as capable."
"No problem whatsoever."
"If we consider the levels concerned, the first level is an open access system, which is free."
"It is similar to GPS with matching criteria: same height, same accuracy in terms of horizontality, etc."
"The subsequent systems CAS I and CAS II are commercial and intended for the government, while the latter system is also used for military purposes."
"To quote another point on which people appear to be misinformed: it is also possible for CAS II to be switched off at regional level if it is used for military purposes."
"You may not have been aware of this, but that is the case."
"All in all: GALILEO is not more accurate, and it cannot be switched off."
"Where military use is concerned, we are agreed that we do not want this in any event."
"I will not enter into the detail of the arguments, but at this moment in time, in the light of 11 September, I do not find it necessary to highlight the need of such a system once again."
"It is somewhat inappropriate, in my opinion."
"It is clear that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has agreed to the wording for civil use, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has not."
"It will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings when the amendments are tabled."
"As for the funding, the Council has launched an enquiry."
"It appears that there are actually no business partners."
"One and a half billion must be coughed up."
"Two hundred million is being freed up indirectly and it is suggested that that funding is now available."
"The problem in this connection is that it is the same people who have freed up tens of billions for UMTS."
"When I listen to Mrs Langenhagen' s opening words, I have a feeling that GALILEO will be laid to rest in the not too distant future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Langenhagen, the GALILEO project is technologically interesting and already has a lot of potential applications."
"Up until now we have had the similar Russian and American systems, but these were designed and developed and are also operated from a military perspective."
"The American system does in fact hold the real danger that in times when the USA is using it for military purposes the Europeans and all civilian users will be switched off, as actually happened during the Gulf war!"
"The GALILEO project is now being presented as a civilian project that will make the European Union independent from the USA in an important field of technology."
"In my group, too, opinions on the GALILEO project differ widely."
"But we are united on one point: we want it to be used for purely civilian purposes."
"We have tabled amendments that are designed to ensure its exclusively civilian use."
"Mr Rack, I am neither naïve nor do I believe there are only good people in the world."
"But if we do not do this, we will have the same problem as with the American system, namely that when it is being used by the military it will be switched off for civilians."
"You are not solving the problem you are claiming to want to solve."
"Secondly, I also have concerns about finance."
"A total of EUR 1 730 000 000 of European taxpayers' money is to be spent on development, validation and construction."
"Industry wants to join in the construction phase, contributing EUR 1.5 billion, but so far only EUR 200 million have been committed."
"That is 13%."
"From a business point of view, no company could afford to develop something with such a poor equity position."
"I think it an impertinence that you want to pay for this out of public funds!"
"Thirdly, there is another aspect to this GALILEO project."
"The Americans allow the GPS to be used free of charge."
"You want future users to pay for the European system."
"Where do you think that will land you with your much-vaunted competition?"
"Competition works like this: if I am being asked to pay for something that I can get free somewhere else, I am not going to pay, and you won' t get any users."
"Then you will have thrown all that taxpayers' money away!"
"Mrs Langenhagen, you described this so beautifully as a confection, and Mr Savary used the word historic!"
"This historic confection will cost a total of EUR 3.2 billion."
"I think that is much too expensive for the present time and at this stage!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of a European satellite radio navigation programme raises various questions that warrant our consideration."
"This is a project of global scale, that uses cutting-edge technology and involves vast amounts of public and private financial resources."
"The strategic importance of political decisions which must be taken for the project to a large extent explain the hesitation that the Council has shown, despite the commitment and enthusiasm that both the Commission and the European Parliament have demonstrated in their statements and in the documents they have drafted."
"In fact, the problem is not insignificant."
"First of all, because a project of this scale requires close international cooperation."
"This cooperation is fundamental, not only because of the future installation in various parts of the world of control centres and communication equipment to support the around thirty satellites that will also have to be sent into space, but also because the success of a project of this nature clearly depends on its interoperability with other, existing systems: the North American GPS and, to a lesser extent, the Russian GLONASS."
"It therefore makes no sense to base the argument and the need for a system such as GALILEO on a vague feeling of suspicion in Europe and amongst Europeans towards the United States due to the situation of near total monopoly that that country currently enjoys. And which could cause it unilaterally and for no plausible reason, in other words irresponsibly, to stop data transmission via satellite, or to introduce unacceptable levels of signal degradation affecting the accuracy of this data for civilian users."
"The GPS system and the radio navigation by satellite that this allows have been used successfully by the whole world, particularly in Europe."
"It should be added that reception of GPS signals has been completely free to users and any member of the public can access the necessary sectors at an affordable price."
"The reasons that the European Union must use in its definition 'Development, installation and use' of a system of this type are, of course, quite different."
"They chiefly concern the boost that GALILEO would give to the European high-tech industry and providers of related services, thereby introducing an element of healthy economic competition in this sector of activity, which is crucial to its development."
"This system would also provide enormous assistance to the development of European technological potential and to improving the associated academic and applied research."
"We must also emphasise the invaluable contribution that a project of this scale would make to the creation of new jobs - more than one hundred thousand - and we are talking about highly qualified posts."
"And, lastly, the installation and use of the system would enable the development of a public or private partnership of enormous strategic value to support sectors as important as transport (maritime, air or terrestrial), air traffic management, search and rescue, meteorology, mobile telephony and so many others."
"It is for all of these reasons, which I have briefly summarised, that we give our support to the GALILEO project, in the hope of thereby contributing to the construction of a genuine Europe of the future."
"Madam President, Mrs Langenhagen predicts a rosy future for the GALILEO satellite system."
"This is understandable, based on her line of thinking."
"However, I, coming from a critical stance, can see major drawbacks to this project."
"The calculated costs of this project are more than considerable, especially now that the contribution of the private sector is not clearly marked and secured at all."
"Despite the fact that, according to the Commission, only 150 km of high-speed link can be built for the funding initially required, any amount is too high if it does not yield clear advantages."
"In this case, the advantages should mainly be in the field of reliability and price."
"As things stand at the moment, it is very likely that GALILEO will become a facsimile of the existing system, at least in terms of functionalities."
"Despite the civil line of approach, the system will also boast a military component in time."
"I have no doubts about that."
"This brings to an end the advantage which GALILEO would have compared to existing systems, namely to be independent from military use and more reliable as a result."
"What remains is a situation in which we obtain the same services at higher costs."
"However, the most important aspect to us is that the system could play an unwelcome role in the relations between the European Union and the United States of America."
"Especially in a military context, it has appeared more than once that the European Union produces little without the United States."
"Not only does stirring up trouble in the relationship with the United States not make any sense, it is also very dangerous."
"That is why I am in favour of accepting the existing offer and not deluding potential users with illusions."
"For it is very much the question whether the use of satellite signals will be better and more efficient than it is at present."
"Mr President, have you noticed that, not just the Commissioner, but the president and the rapporteur are also women, a coincidence which I think augurs well for the future of GALILEO, even if he was a man."
"So, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, I should like to make a point of repeating the view that, at every stage in the design, implementation or application of the system, the political decisions will need to be discussed and taken at European Union level and at that level only, although the role of the candidate countries will, of course, also need to be determined."
"It is equally obvious that international collaboration with the United States and Russia is essential, not just in order to reduce the huge costs but also because the question of frequencies can be regulated so as to guarantee reliability by ensuring that enough frequencies are available for GALILEO to provide a broad range of services."
"Of course, we need more information on the organisation, administration and funding of the implementing agency, with integrated, realistic proposals, mainly as regards private investment."
"At least, from the information available to date, there appears to be no particular drive to attract private investment, given that we have not yet clarified if the system will provide services in return for a fee, which it will need to do if there is to be private investment, or free of charge, so that it can compete with GPS, which provides its services free of charge."
"Finally, is there any chance of Member States being called upon to pay large sums of money from their national budgets so that the initial appropriations are not lost?"
"I think the Commission should give a prompt response here."
"Similarly, we must push ahead and resolve outstanding issues, by which I mean technical issues, such as incorporating EGNOS and the corresponding financial analysis and lawyers, both at Community and national level so that we can make any deliberate interference in or distortion of the system a crime and set up an authority to decide when to impose sanctions."
"We trust that, one way or the other, GALILEO will progress more quickly now."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, for her work on the report."
"I am taking the floor today because I feel we need technical systems that offer environmental benefits."
"Technical progress is ever more rapid."
"Personal computers and mobile telephones have drastically altered our working lives and our everyday life."
"We have also seen how technology is changing all the time and creating new aids and how companies are forever developing new products to be used within different areas of society."
"A European satellite navigation system can, in fact, mean major opportunities for developing the transport sector, especially when it comes to combined transport, dovetailing different types of transport."
"For aviation and shipping, too, as well as for transport by road and rail, the new technology can be used to make transport more efficient and environmentally friendly."
"I do agree with the rapporteur that GALILEO will enable Europe to be involved in developing a new technology-based industry and to be in the vanguard of this."
"There is a space industry in various parts of Europe today, for example in northernmost Sweden, and I think it important that we should use existing infrastructure to keep down the future costs of this project."
"Major technical breakthroughs have more often than not taken place following development using research supported by the public sector, often with a view to the research' s being used for military purposes."
"The money and resources needed for developing completely new technologies often do not exist in private companies."
"This particularly applies to the GALILEO project which is based upon joint financing by the EU countries but to which the private sector too has to contribute."
"What is unique about GALILEO, unlike the GPS system, is that it is being developed for civil rather than military purposes."
"I consider this to be an absolute prerequisite for the European Parliament' s supporting the project."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you once again for the European Parliament' s constant and determined majority support for the GALILEO satellite navigation programme."
"The resolution contained in Mrs Langenhagen' s excellent report is testimony to this and I thank her for her work."
"Please allow me to make some comments on the motion for a resolution based on the Commission' s communication of November 2000."
"At the end of June, the Commission sent to Parliament and the Council the proposed regulation on the statute of the GALILEO joint undertaking."
"I would like to insist on the importance of this proposal which is intended to establish a single management structure for the programme at the beginning of 2002."
"Given that the timetable is so tight, it is essential that Parliament can issue its opinion on this proposal before the end of the year."
"In accordance with the conclusions of the Transport Council of last April, we have implemented a study of the services which GALILEO may offer, the income it may generate and the methods for collecting it."
"This study must be finished in the coming weeks so that the Transport Council in December may take the decisions necessary for the programme to move ahead."
"Of course we will send the results of this study to this House and I hope that those of you who have expressed more reservations about the programme will find that it provides better explanation and greater confidence and that we will therefore have greater support - I know that it is supported by the majority of this House, but also that some of you have expressed significant reticence, if not opposition."
"As the motion for a resolution clearly states, international cooperation is essential to the GALILEO programme."
"Its objective is to guarantee the interoperability of GALILEO with the existing radio-navigation systems, such as the American GPS or those in preparation, such as the Russian GLONASS."
"In this respect - and some of you have wondered whether or not it is necessary - I would like to say that the idea is that they are compatible and that they benefit each other mutually."
"Ladies and gentlemen, after what happened last month, the need for a second system which reinforces the existing system and which provides greater security and is, when the time comes, not only a complement, but also an alternative in the event of possible unwanted situations - when we are seeing a huge increase in the applications which affect all the areas of our lives relating to GALILEO - is absolutely essential, not only for Europe, but for the whole world, including the users in the United States."
"It is also important that we have the support of third countries so that we might have the necessary frequencies, principally within the framework of world radio communications conferences - the next one being in 2003."
"As you know, the allocation of frequencies is due to be consolidated in 2003."
"When this happens, it should aid participation in the development of the GALILEO programme."
"With regard to the data issued by GALILEO, the international and Community instruments intended for its protection will clearly be applied."
"As Mrs Langenhagen' s report stresses, we believe - and this is one of its special features compared to the GPS system - that GALILEO must supply a public signal, that is, a robust and precise signal which cannot be interrupted as a result of military issues, as happens in the case of GPS, and sensitive applications, whether they be public - customs, judicial investigation and so on - or private - such as banking transmissions."
"Finally, allow me to sum up the next stages of the programme."
"At the end of the year, after receiving Parliament' s opinion, the Council must adopt the statutes of the GALILEO joint undertaking and decide how the programme must continue to be developed by the said joint undertaking in close cooperation with the European Space Agency."
"As some of you have said, the green light must be given to the GALILEO project once and for all."
"The development phase, which should last from 2002 until the end of 2005, should allow the launch of the first satellites with a view to testing the system in reality and allow the receivers sector to bring those receivers into line."
"As you can see, there is still much to do."
"Your support is absolutely essential and, in any event, we will keep this House fully informed of all the steps we take in relation to this project."
"Thank you, Mrs De Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday."
"Energy efficiency labelling for office equipment"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0298/2001), by Mrs McNally, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment (6760/1/2001 - C5-0246/2001 - 2000/0033(COD))."
"Madam President, I am very pleased to present my recommendation for second reading on the Energy Star agreement."
"As you will know, in a rather complex procedure, Parliament has already been consulted on the agreement itself."
"This is now the codecision procedure on the regulation which implements that agreement."
"I wish to thank the Commission, the Council and my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, for their help in steering through this rather complex procedure."
"I would like to thank in particular the Swedish Presidency, which went out of its way to be helpful."
"The Council common position takes on board most of the points made by Parliament at first reading."
"We shall have an earlier review than was expected; we shall have an update on new technological advances in this area of energy efficiency; we shall have a report to Parliament."
"Furthermore, the United States' authorities are absolutely clear that Parliament is involved in discussions on the Energy Star programme from the Commission's point of view."
"This has been done through a side letter added to the agreement, at Parliament's request, which meets our wishes for them to know how we operate in the European Union."
"This clearly is not the only measure which is to be taken in the area of energy efficiency."
"I understand there is an update to the common position because of the new Eco-Label award scheme."
"I am prepared, as rapporteur, to accept that slight modification which has been made necessary."
"Even though I am pleased that it looks as though this agreement is coming into force, I do not want to exaggerate its importance."
"It is a useful tool, but it is a relatively modest proposal; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model."
"I know many colleagues agree with me that in future we should work as a European Union and have European Community schemes rather than attempting to latch on to schemes developed elsewhere, in the United States for example."
"Nevertheless, although it is relatively modest, it is welcome."
"Computer equipment is sold worldwide and the educative, awareness-raising aspects of seeing the Energy Star logo on computers is worthwhile."
"We know that one of the tasks in increasing energy efficiency is to improve public awareness."
"It is a small part of what is needed."
"Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy."
"It is the fifth fuel - coal, gas, renewables, nuclear - the fifth fuel, with a 30% potential, is energy efficiency."
"If someone from another planet saw us acting as if we had known that, they would think we were stupid."
"We are not stupid, we are intelligent and that is why intelligent energy - a phrase with which I hope everyone is becoming familiar - and certainly Mr Wijkman, Mr Turmes, Mrs Van der Laan and I are doing our best to make it a very familiar phrase - and energy-intelligent Europe depends on energy efficiency."
"We look to the Commissioner to bring in a package of measures well beyond Energy Star."
"They are demand-side management and two important directives: one on household appliances and one on office equipment - not made in the USA."
"I hope that during this autumn, under the Belgian Presidency, we will see both of those draft directives adopted."
"We have been very cooperative on the Energy Star programme."
"There is only one amendment, which could be withdrawn."
"If the Commissioner is able to give us tonight an appropriate assurance and accept the spirit of that amendment, which asks her to take further action on the withdrawal of inefficient equipment, it is quite possible that we can approve the common position unamended."
"Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, on behalf of my group for undertaking this technically difficult task and for the tough way she negotiated with the Council, because Parliament' s rights were at stake."
"She was in a way having to negotiate a precedent and she showed great commitment and was very successful on Parliament' s behalf."
"I would also like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, who over all has worked very energetically for a European contribution to solving our energy problems."
"I think we are all agreed that the more efficient use of energy is a very important contribution to solving our energy problems."
"Modern technology offers us ways of saving energy and using it more efficiently."
"If we do that correctly, it is actually to everyone' s advantage."
"The costs of such technical innovations are small enough to be written off within months or a few years at the most, which means it is to the consumer' s overall advantage and it also gives industry an opportunity to bring its innovations on to the market."
"Here we are looking at one way, namely the Label."
"It is an important step because it gives us influence over world standards since the Energy Star is used not only in the USA and in Europe, but in other countries besides."
"When I took on the task of being my group's shadow rapporteur, I asked firms in my constituency that are concerned with the subject, those that sell or make computers, for example, what they thought about it."
"They said the Label alone would probably not achieve much because, when consumers buy computers and similar goods, unfortunately they do not pay attention to energy consumption so much as to various other criteria."
"So we should perhaps talk about finding other ways of promoting energy-efficient equipment and gradually removing the big energy wasters from the market."
"The amendment in front of us says, after all, that one such way forward might be a voluntary agreement with industry."
"We should only think about legislation if that fails to work."
"I believe that to be very, very important because, as the rapporteur has said, we are debating here about an agreement with the USA and about a Label, but the solution to the problem does not lie in this Label alone."
"I am therefore asking the Commissioner to make very clear in her speech that the Commission is thinking of going further and also to say when we can expect other proposals."
"I don' t believe any of us would gain from having to engage in a lengthy conciliation procedure because of an amendment being tabled."
"If we achieve a good outcome this evening, we can avoid the conciliation procedure."
"Otherwise conciliation would be necessary and I am sure we all want to avoid that."
"Madam President, on 11 September the world changed, at any rate the world as we knew it."
"Suddenly a regulation that has occupied us here in this House for quite some time has become a small pebble in the mosaic of this changed world."
"We know that 11% of electricity consumption - between 10 and 15% in other countries - in private households and public sectors - if we add those as well - contributes to power stations being operated completely unnecessarily because there would be other ways of doing it in standby mode."
"On a European scale that means between six and ten large power stations, and they could be nuclear power stations."
"When at this very moment the first bombers could already be flying towards Afghanistan and people are wondering what form a possible counterattack might take, we can see that such a mundane thing as this regulation could bring us greater security here in Europe, greater security, too - if we think of the consequences of 11 September - in relation to the probable rise in the price of oil."
"From this point of view I therefore very much welcome the work that Eryl McNally has done."
"The second aspect that should now again be given particular consideration is that we could provide a stimulus to the economy to which the Commission pays particular attention in the amendment to which the previous speaker has already referred - by finding a way not only to label good equipment but also to remove bad equipment from the market as quickly as possible."
"Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs McNally for her persistence in keeping this report on Parliament's agenda and bringing it to fruition."
"I welcome the approach adopted in this proposal for a voluntary code."
"That is a more pragmatic approach towards achieving improvements."
"Unlike Mrs McNally I see no harm in adopting measures that are in place in the United States."
"It is one of our aims in Europe to achieve common standards in the internal market."
"In that regard, why should we not seek to extend those common standards to our major trading partner across the Atlantic?"
"Just because it was invented in the United States does not mean it is all bad."
"It is very important that we should assist people making choices about purchasing equipment in knowing what the energy efficiency is."
"In my own experience, labelling materially affects one's decision."
"It certainly affected my decision this summer when I was buying a fridge and a freezer for my home."
"The old ones were getting very noisy and very expensive."
"It may be that my motive was also concern to stop using so much electricity supplied by a company owned by a French utility, but that is another issue."
"I should like to close by supporting the comments about the amendment, namely, that we all look to the Commission to give us an assurance on the issue of the further voluntary code."
"This is a healthy and sensible approach."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, for her work in relation to this Regulation."
"I am aware that she has worked intensively with Parliament and the Council in order to reach the position we are in today."
"I also hope that we manage to reach an agreement on the text which is acceptable to all of us."
"I am sure that none of us want to go to conciliation if we can solve the problem in a more appropriate way, given that our positions are very similar."
"This proposal is integrated into the Commission' s action plan to improve the energy efficiency of the European Union."
"Office communication equipment represents a high proportion of the electrical consumption of the tertiary sector and we all agree that the use of efficient and ecological office equipment can contribute to the sustainable development strategy decided at the European Council in Gothenburg."
"The proposed programme for coordination of labelling, the Energy Star programme, will lead to significant reductions in electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, and is therefore very viable."
"As Mrs McNally has very rightly said - and I would like to stress that I am in full agreement with her - energy efficiency is key."
"The key thing is to use energy well. That is where we have the greatest margins and we stated this in the Green Paper on the European Union' s energy supply."
"After a long period of negotiation, in December 2000 the agreement was finally signed with the United States on coordination of programmes for energy efficiency labelling on office equipment."
"Now we need this Regulation so that we can appropriately implement what was signed with the United States."
"This programme has already been a success in the United States and has led to considerable participation by manufacturers, the large majority of which have introduced energy-saving devices into their products. It has also increased consumer awareness of wastage resulting from office equipment in standby mode."
"On the basis of the positive experience on the other side of the Atlantic, the Commission is convinced that the Energy Star labelling programme will naturally lead to the gradual elimination of inefficient equipment on the Community market."
"We perfectly understand the European Parliament' s concerns in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed Regulation on this specific point."
"These concerns are reflected in the amendment which Mrs McNally is still maintaining."
"There is no doubt that in other circumstances I would say that I agree with her. However, on this occasion I would ask Parliament to reject it or, even better, that Mrs McNally withdraw it."
"Because, although I agree with its content, I do not believe that this is the right instrument in which to include this type of measure."
"The Energy Star programme is not exactly the right place to include this incitement to renovation, modernisation and withdrawal of least efficient equipment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell the House that we are preparing a framework directive on minimum efficiency requirements in the office communication equipment sector, amongst others, a directive which I hope will be presented to this House and the Council during next year."
"I have taken this opportunity to explain the Commission' s position and I hope that Mrs McNally can withdraw her amendment and that we can therefore approve this report on the Energy Star programme today without having to go to the conciliation procedure."
"Thank you, Mrs De Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday."
"Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy"
"The next item is the report (A5-0234/2001) by Mr Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy (COM(2000) 567 - C5-0740/2000 - 2000/2336(COS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why is innovation so important for the European Union?"
"We can all see that we are having slight problems with the economy at the moment."
"If we want the economic situation to improve again, we must take initiatives to get employment rising again, take initiatives to get unemployment to fall, and take initiatives to ensure our continuing prosperity in the future."
"I believe we also need to be able to assess that objectively."
"That is why we should use benchmarking."
"I am very grateful to the Commissioner for putting the innovation scoreboard very much to the fore here, too, because it enables us to see very clearly how the various countries are performing."
"And, of course, the method of best practice: to see where among our neighbours of the Fifteen in Europe they are working better than in our own countries."
"That is how it always was for me at school: you can learn from your better classmates."
"And we shouldn' t just stick to Europe, but we should also be looking in particular at the countries that aspire to join us, to see what they are already doing better than we do."
"There is an enormous amount of knowledge, a great deal of capacity for innovation, in the technical departments of our universities, as there is of course also in America, Japan, India and many other countries, from which we could benefit."
"Innovation must not take place only in the economy, but also in the social, cultural and above all the political fields."
"We would very much like to see publicly sponsored research corrected to make it in future even more geared to the market or, it would perhaps be better to say, to the citizen."
"Where in future will we find services or products that the citizen would like, that he needs?"
"Such market research will be very important for us in future if we are to see where our innovation policy needs to be focused."
"Innovation also means repeatedly taking risks, however."
"We therefore need to ensure that the necessary venture capital is available."
"It is especially when times are getting hard that funding runs short."
"We all know that Basle II will perhaps bring a further restriction here, too, especially for smaller firms."
"Nevertheless - and I would like to correct the text here - we have 18 million SMEs in Europe with fewer than 250 workers."
"We need to pay particular attention to them, since after all they generate 80% of the tax yield and employ two thirds of the workforce."
"Innovation must start in the small units."
"We need subjective innovation; that means combining familiar techniques and technologies, extending them, rethinking where they can be used and where they can be improved."
"One of the central points is of course life-long on-going and vocational training."
"Continuing training schemes are becoming increasingly important, and we should therefore also concentrate on the best ways of passing on knowledge."
"By e-learning - to use the general term - but much more, I believe, by e-entertainment."
"Learning should be fun, learning should be interesting, learning should make you curious, but learning should also be an adventure."
"We ought in future to provide an experience primarily with a European content, putting our European values, our European knowledge at centre stage on the Internet and in our education and learning programmes as well as being ready to engage in international competition."
"We also need new systems in schools, however."
"We need new methods of quality management for teachers and pupils."
"ISO 9000 is already taken for granted in firms."
"It seems to me that these new procedural techniques could also be used to make appreciable progress in schools."
"But enterprises also need easier access to funding."
"We need people to start new businesses and the mentality to start new businesses, and we need to make it easier for businesses to pass from one generation to the next."
"Tax concessions need to be offered and venture capital made available, because the life cycle of a business goes: founded, handed over and finally closed."
"We need to give thought to all three phases in future."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Rübig for approaching his report with such an open mind and, of course, to agree that innovation concerns entrepreneurship and employment."
"However, we need it not just to serve the economy, the knowledge-driven economy in today's society, we also need it to serve the knowledge-driven and cultural society."
"Because innovation is not just an economic and business factor, it is also an educational and cultural factor."
"More to the point, it is the result of mutual and complex actions and reactions between education, research, the administration and the public."
"Innovative procedures presuppose a dynamic social model which is receptive to change."
"In fact, innovation does not depend solely or exclusively on technological factors, it also depends on organisational factors."
"A propitious environment is the main requirement, so that new initiatives, new discoveries and scientific applications can be developed, which is why we need social components working together, we need close cooperation between businesses and scientific institutions, as well as schools and universities, and we also need the help of the media if an innovative culture is to mature in our society as a whole."
"Innovation must be the property of every member of society."
"That is how our society will work in new directions, opening up new paths."
"Europe needs an approach to innovation which will directly serve society as a whole."
"However, we know that there are quite a few negative structural factors which prevent us from progressing as far as we should."
"We are quite a way behind and I think that this is a bitter but honest admission, which is why we need the measures proposed in the report, together with suitable educational systems that nurture innovation."
"Innovation is a process of analysis and synthesis and young people - mainly students - need therefore to play a part."
"We must take care to ensure that we do not just inflict talk and chalk on young people and that they take an active part in the innovative process during their studies and both inside and outside school."
"We must cultivate this approach at all levels of education."
"It is important to have cross-disciplinary syllabuses in tertiary education."
"We must bring the exact and the theoretical sciences close together, however difficult that may seem."
"We must also understand that we need better penetration of university research institutes and of scientific libraries via the Internet."
"I should like to highlight this sector in particular, because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must."
"Finally, we should take steps to provide better protection for intellectual property because this is what can invigorate and foster the incentive for our scientists to innovate."
"That is why it is also extremely important for us to promote the application of European patent law."
"Madam President, at last spring' s Lisbon Summit the Heads of State and Government set themselves an ambitious target."
"The European Union was to become the most dynamic and the most competitive economic area in the world."
"Innovation is the key to this."
"It is the subject of an excellent report by Mr Rübig, whom I would expressly like to congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. His report is thorough and precise; it is creative and full of insights."
"Only an innovation offensive will create the necessary conditions for making up the ground we have lost to the USA and Japan, preventing a mass exodus of researchers and finally achieving international competitiveness."
"Specifically, it means changing our systems of education."
"Young people must be able to be involved at an early stage, by teaching them science in schools and specifically encouraging their talents."
"Curricula must include projects modelled on professional management, by forming junior enterprises, for example."
"We need new information systems and higher technological qualifications in the training and further training of workers and students."
"Mr Rübig has always been concerned with revitalising small and medium-sized enterprises."
"His particular concern is important given that we have 18 million SMEs."
"Workers are specifically asking for programmes to promote SMEs in the European Union because over 70 to 80 % work in that sector."
"SMEs need simpler tax procedures, a dismantling of bureaucratic hurdles, and active support for innovative products and methods of production."
"Research needs to be integrated into operating structures."
"Access to start-up capital is essential, because young people need to be able to start new businesses, to become entrepreneurs."
"They need to be able to take all the current problems of the new economy into account."
"I hope we have all learned something from that."
"On this basis, Madam President, the European Union will be able to make a sustained contribution to the high performance, knowledge-driven economy we are looking to achieve."
"In Lisbon and Stockholm, it was decided that Europe should become the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-driven economy."
"Of the seventeen million companies in Europe, no fewer than 99 percent form part of the medium-sized and small business sector."
"That accounts for more than 70 percent of employment, 50 percent of investment and 60 percent of the Union' s wealth."
"As such, the medium-sized and small businesses are the most important economic factor in the European economy."
"The competitiveness of these businesses very much relies on their innovative capacity."
"At the moment, Parliament is working hard on the Sixth Framework Programme, in which the participation of SMEs must be guaranteed at the same - or, ideally, a higher - level."
"I have therefore proposed to increase the budget available to SMEs to 15 percent from the current 10 percent."
"But that participation of SMEs must, in the view of the Liberal Group, take place within themed programmes."
"Indeed, in that way, it is guaranteed that large and small companies will join forces, for small companies do not have the expertise and manpower to go it alone."
"It is not acceptable for most of the limited research budget that is available to be spent on the flanking policy in the Member States, for that is not a European task."
"It is more important to simplify the participation of medium-sized and small businesses in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"That is why the 'rules of participation' must be simplified and standardised so that research applications submitted by all Directorates-General for the Sixth Framework Programme as a whole can be dealt with more efficiently and more quickly."
"I should like to conclude by giving you some food for thought: Europe is good at converting euros into research, but often fails in converting research into euros, and that must change in future."
"Madam President, the Commission and the rapporteur are preparing for a more innovative Europe."
"This report calls for the networks to be strengthened at European level."
"This dissemination of gathered knowledge should not lead to less competition, which is another aspect of innovation, for what are the areas in which cooperation actually reinforces the ability to innovate?"
"Tax benefits are in any case not a very good incentive."
"They fragment the market and can lead to a shift in activities to the cheapest region."
"Market-oriented attraction is preferable."
"The rapporteur also underlines the importance of education."
"This is an area in which only the Member States have authority."
"In this connection, it is not the international orientation or the mobility of education and research itself, but the results, that deserve recognition."
"National initiatives promoting the innovative environment and acknowledging achievements will have to increase competitiveness."
"The aspects that make European regions into an attractive environment in terms of innovation are the knowledge available, the labour market and other local factors."
"A government should therefore have a vision of regional profiles it would like in future."
"However, regional specialisms can be adversely affected either by tax measures or by uniform measures which are said to result in a loss of quality for Europe as a whole."
"The Commission proposal is typified - more so than the report - by a realistic approach from the bottom upwards."
"If necessary, a joint approach could play an additional role to promote networks."
"In that way, the Union can back the measures which increase the Member States' ability to innovate, both individually and jointly."
"Madam President, Commissioner, my colleagues, knowledge and know-how are the basis of economic competitiveness and of the well-being of society as a whole."
"The ambitious objectives of Lisbon also threaten to remain so much rhetoric, and will perish like worldly honour, if the success of the European Union in global competition is not based on a high level of education and research."
"There are several aspects relating to a comprehensive innovation policy, which many colleagues have already emphasised in their interventions."
"As European legislators, we should pay particular attention to simplifying legislation and administration."
"I subscribe to the view of Mr Rübig and of other colleagues, that simplification is a necessity."
"Enterprise and development activity is excessively restricted by bureaucratic impediments, and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular suffer from this."
"Besides some form of labour reform, we also need a complete administrative reform, which has already got off to a good start with the White Paper on administrative models."
"As you, yourself, said a couple of days ago, our esteemed competitors the United States and Japan are further along the road of promoting and developing innovations than the EU; one of the reasons for this is that in those countries enterprise and risk-taking are rewarded to a significantly greater degree than in Europe."
"We must create conditions which encourage self-starting and independent initiative."
"Enterprise can be promoted early among schoolchildren and students."
"All we need to do is to create the prerequisite conditions in our education systems, for example, in the form of a special business model which young businesses can then adopt."
"I also regard the development of human capital as important."
"It is a significant factor in innovation."
"A genuine information society must be within the reach of all citizens, and so raising the level of know-how of the entire population is important."
"The copyright of innovations must also be better protected; this has already been mentioned in other interventions."
"Even before this, in the course of my work I have stressed the importance of adopting a Community Patent which will cover the entire area of the European Union."
"The Community Patent would offer complete Union-wide protection for new patents, at the same time significantly reducing the administrative costs of firms."
"And last but not least: we need a revolution in thinking which would free us from orthodox thinking and modes of action."
"We must create conditions which make it possible to produce a whole raft of new ideas, out of which we may perhaps develop that one breakthrough innovation."
"New technology is not the key to a good future; we need non-conventional thinking in all fields, in firms as well as in public administration."
"Madam President, Commissioner, with outstanding diligence and sometimes frightening consistency of purpose my fellow countryman Paul Rübig has again produced a report containing almost everything that is good and right."
"For that very reason, I hope I may be allowed to question some of it."
"We have been discussing why innovation is so important for the European Union."
"The rapporteur has given a broad answer to that question."
"We could of course ask him what innovation?"
"What innovation is most in demand at the moment?"
"Perhaps military technology so we can find Osama bin Laden quickly."
"Is that the kind of innovation we mean?"
"Is it innovation in surveillance that will enable us to uncover sleepers in the future?"
"Or do we not need to define innovation?"
"With our European system of values, are we not concerned here with innovation in education, innovation in social learning?"
"And how will we get there?"
"Would it not be an innovation finally to know how much is spent on innovation?"
"Do you know, Commissioner?"
"I have tried to find out how much is invested in the future in a big country like the Federal Republic of Germany."
"We know what is spent on administration, we know what is invested in transfer payments, but when it comes to investing in the future, nobody knows."
"We all agree that there cannot be too much funding for investment, because that is really the only way to safeguard the future."
"But the question is, what kind of a future?"
"Where are we heading?"
"And is not the time after 11 September actually an ideal time to question much that was simply only a fixation with technology and instead to initiate research into social innovation?"
"Has the time not now also come to free ourselves from old instruments like gross national product and bring the innovative instrument of a well being factor more into the centre?"
"Questions on a good report."
"Nevertheless, once again congratulations, Paul!"
"Madam President, the role played by innovation in achieving the ambitious objectives set by the European Union in Lisbon has been mentioned by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on his detailed report, and by previous speakers."
"However, the importance of innovation to our economic and social development needs to be appreciated more both by the Member States and by the European Commission itself."
"Delays in implementing innovative measures under the Structural Funds and the cancellation of resources are sad proof of the fact that innovation often gets no further than the drawing board."
"So we need a decisive and coordinated policy which ensures that innovation penetrates our entire economic and social fabric and that our citizens' creative powers are give free rein."
"That is why I should like to highlight the fact that this policy needs to be driven by the principle of equal opportunities."
"For a start, I do not believe that innovation is the duty or preserve of the young, I believe it should affect all ages with lifelong learning and the other methods mentioned by previous speakers."
"I would like to point out that we need to encourage women in their individual and collective efforts, such as setting up companies, and we need to encourage women's non-governmental organisations to take an innovative approach to social activities which have a positive impact on social cohesion and job creation."
"Equal opportunities should also apply geographically, given the huge discrepancies between the regions of the European Union when it comes to innovation."
"Both the European Union and the Member States should pay special attention to disadvantaged regions, which are usually the mountain and island areas of the Union."
"With the lack of innovation in Europe compared with the United States and Japan, we need to get moving and mobilise our forces."
"This means that the spirit of innovation must also drive the European Union's innovation management policy."
"Special units, such as the unit set up to manage innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, are a step in the right direction, they just need to be adequately staffed to make them effective."
"The European Commission must also focus on disseminating the results of best practices, which is why pioneering methods need to be found, with much better penetration and efficiency than those available under past policies and both the Member States of the European Union and candidate countries must work with the European Union and take appropriate steps to disseminate best practices and adopt all the new models which account for the performance of the best countries."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, for an excellent report and the House for a debate displaying quality and commitment."
"It is widely recognised that policies that foster innovation are an underlying determinant of economic growth."
"I am particularly happy to present to you today the very latest findings of the EU' s innovation policy performance, namely the 2001 Innovation Scoreboard, which was compiled as a follow-up to the report last year."
"The 2001 European Innovation Scoreboard gives us a starting point for the Union' s strategy to enhance its overall competitiveness, by providing a common measure of a country's performance using 17 indicators."
"I would also like to say that I share the rapporteur' s opinion in underlining the importance of education and training, something that has been noted by other speakers."
"One indicator called for in the report was added to the scoreboard to cover lifelong learning."
"EU performance in terms of growth and the standard of living relative to the US and Japan highlights the key challenges that the EU faces in enhancing its competitiveness."
"In the past twenty-five years, and apart from temporary cyclical fluctuations, the EU has not kept pace with the US in improving its standard of living."
"The gap is now wider than it was a quarter of a century ago."
"At the aggregate level, the gap in living standards can be attributed to two factors: two-thirds to the employment rate, which is lower, and one-third to productivity."
"I will focus on the productivity gap."
"Until the mid-1990s, the productivity gap between the EU and the US narrowed steadily."
"In the second half of the 1990s, however, the rapid acceleration of productivity growth in the US again began to widen the gap."
"Until the early 1990s, capital-intensive industries spearheaded productivity growth."
"This changed in the mid-1990s, when research and innovation became the key determinants."
"The industries that achieved the greatest productivity gains during the late 1990s were predominantly research-intensive."
"The overall strategy for boosting competitiveness requires us to better combine Union and Member State efforts to develop more effective policies to foster and support innovation."
"National innovation policies should be reinforced, developed, and take a more consistent approach across the EU."
"This is why we need a regular benchmarking exercise to measure and compare the performance of EU countries, identify key areas of weakness and strength, and enable ourselves to design and fine-tune innovation policies accordingly."
"Taking the EU as a whole, we still lag behind the US and Japan on most indicators."
"We trail significantly in terms of private-sector investment in research and development."
"Rapid increases in business research and development in Japan and the US since 1994 have widened the gap with Europe alarmingly."
"US expenditure in this area is now 74% higher than in Europe."
"Europe' s high-tech patenting activity is also too weak: US businesses apply for more high-technology patents in Europe than do European businesses."
"Japanese patenting in Europe is almost as strong as US patenting."
"This patenting imbalance is an area that requires urgent attention."
"At individual Member State level, the picture is different."
"I must say that, as regards many indicators, the best-performing EU countries are also world leaders, sometimes doing substantially better than the US and Japan."
"I will give you some examples: the UK, Ireland and France, for example, are world-leading suppliers of science and engineering graduates; the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark are ahead in home Internet access;"
"Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden lead in public research and development; and Sweden is well ahead in business research and development expenditure."
"However, differences in innovation performance between Member States are still significant."
"Countries such as Denmark and Finland, whose performance was already strong, continue to lead the field when measured by the innovation index, that is to say in terms of trends, not scoreboards alone."
"Greece and Spain are rapidly catching up with the EU average, while starting from a relatively low base."
"But change is important and positive."
"The four largest EU economies (France, Germany, the UK and Italy) are improving, but at rates below the EU average."
"A number of lessons can be drawn from these results."
"The Union should: first, invest in education and training, as has been said here a few times; second, improve its performance in the high-tech sectors and promote entrepreneurship; third, help to step up business research and development by encouraging Member States to introduce or increase the necessary incentives; and finally, promote the use of technologies in all sectors of the economy, including public administrations."
"I am pleased to see that several of these aspects are well covered by Mr Rübig' s report."
"I believe this report will help to generate a consensus on the way forward."
"This is necessary, as shown by the findings of the Innovation Scoreboard."
"The report expresses Europe' s wish to reduce the Union' s innovation deficit and achieve the goal set at Lisbon and, hence, does a great deal to help improve the EU' s overall competitiveness."
"I hope that there will be an opportunity to come back to these issues in the Commission' s 2001 Competitiveness Report, which will be presented in a few weeks' time."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Exhaustion of trade mark rights"
"The next item is the report (A5-0311/2001) by Mr Mayer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the problem of the exhaustion of trade mark rights (SEC(1999)2033 - C5-0354/2000 - 2000/2187(COS))."
"Madam President, I would like briefly to outline the underlying issues and the main points of my report."
"The central statement is that the Commission is called upon to produce a detailed study of the possible implications of the transition to the principle of international exhaustion by 31 December 2002."
"The Nera study presented by the Commission in 1999 fails to deal with this matter adequately."
"A trade mark right has its effects only in the territory for which it was granted."
"Community exhaustion applies to the Community mark and national marks when the holder of the right has put his product into circulation in the Community for the first time."
"If the holder of the trade mark right puts his product into circulation outside the Community, the legal effects of the marks are not exhausted in the Community."
"He can therefore prevent parallel importers from importing the product into the Community."
"Because of the current Community-wide exhaustion regime he can therefore quote two different prices: a lower one for countries outside the Community and a higher one for the Community itself."
"This split pricing policy, however, is not what the trade mark right is about."
"The main purpose of the mark is to make the product distinguishable and familiar and to indicate a certain product quality."
"We could also speak about the advertising effect."
"The division of markets to the disadvantage of consumers in the Community cannot be the objective of granting a Community trade mark."
"Neither is there anything in competition law to argue against parallel imports."
"So why should it be possible to use trade mark rights to prevent them?"
"There is something wrong there."
"We must do something to get back to more competition and lower prices for branded goods."
"The same conclusion was reached in a study by the Swedish competition authority, as, too, did a discussion paper by the Irish competition authority."
"A hearing before a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was also presented predominantly with arguments in favour of international exhaustion."
"There is now an important new factor: the increasing amount of trade on the Internet."
"The present exhaustion regime could hamper the development of e-commerce."
"It is not in fact certain whether Internet sales with the subsequent dispatch of branded goods are permissible under trade mark law."
"But legal certainty and consumer protection are essential conditions for the development of trade over the Internet."
"Then there are the following points."
"There are a) trade marks that are not really matched to any particular product. For example, you order 'a Siemens' ."
"'A Siemens' can be a lamp, a washing machine or a nuclear power station."
"There are b) also trade marks that designate group products, for example Adidas shoes, whether they are sandals or high heels."
"There are c) trade marks that require absolute identity, in medicine for example."
"It cannot be even one milligram different from what the mark designates."
"All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study."
"Such a study must also draw comparisons with the world' s major trading nations and study and make a precise analysis of the implications for the EU labour market."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Mayer who, in spite of some extremely polarised positions, listened and put forward an alternative in the form of a proposal for further consideration, which met with everyone' s approval."
"This position is all the more important and necessary since the report refers to the crucial problems related to globalisation and European integration."
"In addition to the direct interests of consumers and manufacturers, the economic position of the European Union in world trade is at stake."
"Some may be in favour of a total liberalisation of trade, whereas others, myself included, believe that the system of Community exhaustion responds to the need to develop the integration of the single market, a favourable way of supporting Europe in the face of global competition."
"Apart from the concept of integration, the crux of this report is to support innovation, and God knows how much we have spoken about this in the previous report, to support innovation and creativity within the Community."
"Trade marks are the most important and most efficient way of protecting intellectual property."
"Trade marks provide the consumer with a guarantee of a product' s authenticity and quality, and they ensure pre-sales, shape investment and, consequently, creation."
"A change in the system could lead to a drop in investment in research and development of European products and the impact on jobs could be significant."
"The current system also provides the best means of protection against counterfeiting, as the channels used by parallel importers are often those used to transport pirate products."
"In the studies that are currently available, and I stress the 'currently' , we found no relevant information enabling us to justify a change to the system, which could be detrimental to innovation."
"I hope that the further consideration proposed by Mr Mayer will confirm this opinion."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Mayer on the report he is presenting today."
"I am perfectly aware that it is not the report he would have liked to approve and, although it is little consolation, I would like to say that I also would have preferred the report finally approved by Parliament to have been the one Mr Mayer initially drew up."
"Despite the powerful interests concerned with preventing the world trade in trade mark products, the unusual report by a consulting company which states that consumers would not benefit immediately from the acquisition of goods at lower prices and the lukewarm position of the Commission which does not seem interested in seeking a solution to a problem which has a very negative effect on European consumers, the rapporteur, Mr Mayer, has been able to produce a report urging persistence in the quest for formulae which prevent manufacturers of trade mark products from maintaining excessively high prices on European markets."
"When, in July 1998, the Court of Justice issued the Silhouette judgment, it caused great commotion in countries which recognised the principle of international exhaustion of the trade mark."
"Either by law, as in Sweden for example, or by jurisprudence, as in my country, Spain."
"Legally, the judgment is unassailable from the moment that it states that Article 7 of the Trade Mark Directive, by establishing the principle of Community exhaustion, indirectly establishes the prohibition of international exhaustion."
"But this is a legalistic interpretation which does not prevent the recognition, as the judgment does, of the harmful effects for consumers of the fact that owners of trade marks can prevent the import of their own products if they originate from third countries."
"The arguments used by those people who defend the prohibition of the international exhaustion of trade marks - combating counterfeiting, maintaining the prestigious image of goods, diversion of income from the manufacturer to the importer - are at odds with a reality which is demonstrated in the documents produced by the rapporteur."
"When parallel imports from third countries are allowed, the prices of trade mark products drop."
"The information provided on price increases in Germany, when the reform of German law prevented international exhaustion, is conclusive."
"And although my experience is of little scientific value, I must point out that I have been able to note how, in the United States, a product which in Spain costs me EUR 10, costs me just EUR 1.5."
"For all these reasons and despite the reservations involved in finding a consensus in favour of a more ambitious resolution, it is important that the Commission takes the initiative in favour of consumers and brings forward proposals to strengthen the world market, removing barriers to trade, which are not just customs barriers, but which often consist of anti-competitive practices by companies whose aim is to defend their own profits."
"Madam President, at this hour brevity is a duty and not a virtue."
"Although I was not a member of the committee which produced this report, I want to speak because my colleague, Mrs McCarthy, who was a member, is detained by the grave events now under discussion at our party conference in Brighton."
"I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs."
"Like Mrs Thors, I was for a time the Chair of the Consumer Protection Intergroup."
"Parliament's Rules do not allow us to express these opinions in the way we once did."
"The substantial majority which Mr Mayer rallied in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was, of course, for a response which, as my colleague has said, was less than he would have wished."
"It is also less than I would have wished and it should be less than this Parliament would have wished."
"The principal recommendation here is for a further study of the consequences of a transition to the use of the principle of international exhaustion."
"Fine, but how long is that going to take when a parallel importer can be prevented from giving the consumer a quality product at a price which benefits them both?"
"This is not like counterfeit products, as another speaker tried to suggest."
"It is not competitive selling at a loss to weaken rival products, nor is it driving down the quality of those products."
"It is a straightforward blockage of trade, which will not diminish the so-called grey markets but will make them more confused and complex."
"We need this to be a study which tells us of the shady side of what proclaims itself to be a respectable trade."
"I do not really expect more from the Commissioner tonight than I have heard from him privately."
"However, the matter cannot rest here."
"The Silhouette case was not the last word on all this and nor, as he would acknowledge, is Mr Mayer's report."
"Nevertheless I salute him."
"Madam President, this is an important subject and has been discussed at various places and at various times."
"It is important that the exhaustion regime for Trade marks which the Community applies provides for a proper balance between the interest of consumer prices and protection of Trade mark rights."
"It has been stated by those who advocate a change to the Community-wide exhaustion regime, that a unilateral change to international exhaustion of Trade mark rights would have a significant impact on consumer prices."
"The Commission is not convinced that this would be the case."
"According to the Nera study carried out by a consultancy firm based in London which was submitted to the Commission in February 1999, prices under international exhaustion would probably not be very different from those that are currently in force."
"Mr Berenguer Fuster and the rapporteur have referred to alleged price increases in Germany of films, perfume and cameras."
"As soon as this became known, the sectors concerned supplied statistics to the Commission to show that prices have not increased as was claimed, but have remained the same or in some cases even decreased."
"The purported evidence concerning Germany is not what it seems to be and, in fact, supports the case that the Commission has put forward and not the case in favour of international exhaustion."
"There has also been a price study carried out by the Swedish and the UK governments."
"It is very interesting to note, and significant for this debate, that of the items where comparisons between the European Union and the United States were possible, the cheapest market was often within the European Union."
"For some products, the United States was even the most expensive market."
"Moreover, there were considerable price differences between Member States."
"In general, prices in Germany and France were lower than in the UK and in Sweden."
"Those differences exist within the European Union where there is regional exhaustion for Trade mark rights and not international exhaustion."
"In other words, for all Member States of the European Union the same exhaustion regime applies yet there is a 40% price difference in electronic goods between Sweden and Germany."
"This certainly goes to show that the internal market is not performing as it should be, but it also shows that the differences in prices have nothing to do with whether the exhaustion regime is regional or international."
"The price differences within the European Union usually exceed the price differences between EU Member States and the United States."
"In other words, the arguments in favour of the thesis that international exhaustion would lead to a decrease in prices is very tenuous."
"In fact the Commission does not believe that evidence at all."
"Furthermore, I should like to add that the price element is only one aspect of the exhaustion issue."
"It is also very important to consider the legitimate interest of Trade mark holders in their home markets."
"For many companies the Trade mark is their most valuable asset and that is not something we should take lightly."
"Trade marks are also of value to consumers because they represent a sign of quality."
"The Commission decided in May 2000 that there is no reason, at least for the time being, to propose any change to the current regime."
"The Commission considers that there is now a proper balance between the interests at stake and that the current Community-wide exhaustion regime is an appropriate way to protect the legitimate rights of Trade mark holders."
"The Commission has taken due note, obviously, of Mr Mayer's report and of the long and difficult discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Many arguments have been put forward for and against a change of regime."
"The Commission recognised all those arguments from previous discussions in other fora."
"All the aspects mentioned have been thoroughly studied and analysed by the Commission services and in my view no new elements have been put forward which would require further examination or which would give the Commission reason to reconsider its decision."
"Having said this, the Commission intends to monitor the question of exhaustion closely and will certainly take any action necessary should new and important reasons emerge to consider abandoning the current exhaustion regime."
"In the meantime, the Commission is, of course, willing to share with Parliament our experiences concerning cases of possible abuse of Trade mark rights but in order to make the report more useful and balanced the Commission intends to take all relevant elements into consideration."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have here before me a newspaper interview, from which I should like to read you an extract."
"It reads 'I do not agree with the Anti-Slavery Conference in Durban."
"It promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already feel like victims.'"
"It goes on to say: 'I am not happy with the whole Conference in Durban, quite apart from the way in which the Middle East was discussed and the fact that someone like Castro was applauded."
"These are not my words, but those of a European Commissioner, namely Mr Bolkestein."
"Last night in my group, our group chairman told me that Mr Nielson, on account of unfortunate statements he made concerning anti-American imperialism, will have to justify himself before the Conference of Presidents."
"Would it not be fair, therefore, if you, in your capacity as President of the Conference of Presidents, were also to invite Mr Bolkestein, giving him the opportunity to explain before the Conference of Presidents these very unfortunate, extremely dangerous statements at a time when we, as the Western world, must join forces with the Islamic world to combat terrorism."
"Mr Staes, I can confirm that Mr Nielson will be attending the Conference of Presidents and we shall consider your suggestion."
"Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Finnish language programmes have been removed from Parliament' s television network."
"We wondered why that was, but got no explanation for it."
"There are therefore no programmes being broadcast from Finland, while some Member States can get three or even four channels."
"Could I request the President to ask those concerned to correct the situation, as it is odd, particularly during these times of crisis, that one Member State' s programme signal should have been removed from the television network without any explanation."
"Mr Paasilinna, due to absolutely exceptional circumstances, Mrs Banotti has unfortunately not yet arrived."
"We shall, of course, inform her of your dissatisfaction and she will immediately find out what can be done."
"Announcement by the President"
"The Court of First Instance has recently rejected the appeals lodged by Members of the European Parliament, the National Front and the Bonino List against Parliament' s decision of 14 September 1999 not to recognise the existence of the Technical Group of Independent Members."
"In accordance with the provision of the order, the cases concerned were joined for the purposes of judgment and the appeals were rejected."
"In each case, the applicants will bear their own costs and the costs of Parliament, including those incurred in the summary proceedings in case 222/99."
"The judgment was delivered in open session in Luxembourg on 2 October 2001."
"As a result, the suspensive order handed down by the President of the Court of First Instance on 25 November 1999 at the end of the summary proceedings lapsed when the judgment was delivered, in other words, on 2 October 2001, pursuant to Article 107(3) of the Court' s Rule of Procedure."
"Therefore, Parliament' s decision of 14 September 1999 not to recognise the existence of the Technical Group of Independent Members is once again fully effective."
"I shall of course give the floor to Mr Dell' Alba."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the eighteen MEPs belonging to the Technical Group of Independent Members have taken note of the judgment of the Court of First Instance on 2 October."
"They point out that this judgment is somehow the inverse image of the order handed down by the President of the same court, who, on 25 November 1999, ruled that Parliament was obliged to recognise the legitimate existence of our group."
"It stands to reason that we shall be appealing against yesterday' s decision and that, obviously, we ask for an interim order to suspend the effects of the judgment."
"In this respect, Madam President, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, I ask you, before making further provisions to consult the Legal Services as to the effects of the suspension, which is what we shall ask the Court to do, as is within our rights."
"Having said that, I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to two important aspects of yesterday' s judgment."
"The first aspect is that our appeal is fully admissible and, therefore, MEPs are fully entitled to question the justice of actions of the European Parliament, such as these."
"This was not what Parliament wished, as it had requested that the Court declare that this appeal should not be admitted."
"The second aspect is that, on several occasions, the Court recognises that disparities do exist in the treatment of the Members of the European Parliament."
"The Court mentions this in Paragraphs 201 and 57 of yesterday' s judgment."
"I am not going to quote these paragraphs and I will simply say that the Court declared that Parliament must remedy these disparities, as part of its duties to manage internal affairs."
"Mr Corbett, since your draft report on the reform of Articles 29 and 30, which aims to rectify these disparities has been held in abeyance for a year, we shall continue our fight, we shall be vigilant and we shall do everything within our power to ensure that we continue this fight to eliminate these disparities and that it does not cease as a result of yesterday' s judgment."
"Madam President, I am delighted at the victory of Parliament at the Court of First Instance."
"It confirms that we were right in the decision that we took."
"Mr Dell'Alba, though, is also right to draw attention to the fact that we must ensure that there are no disparities or discriminations in our Rules."
"That was the objective of the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which we held in abeyance pending the judgment of the Court."
"Perhaps now is the time for this report to come before the full House, but if there is to be an appeal and if - although I would personally doubt this - the full Court of Justice were to suspend the effects of the decision of the Court of First Instance until they themselves rule, that would put us in a difficult position with the report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Personally I doubt that the full Court of Justice would give such an ordinance giving a suspensive effect, in which case we can proceed immediately to look at the disparity that some people may feel exists in our Rules."
"My report would, I am sure, go some way to reassuring people."
"Mr Corbett, what I can say to you and Mr Dell' Alba is that, of course, if there is to be an appeal, I shall examine very closely, in conjunction with Parliament' s Legal Service, whether this appeal will have a suspensive effect."
"We shall look into this matter extremely carefully."
"Madam President, the judgment is very clear, but in a society governed by the rule of law there must, of course, be the right of appeal and the judgment must have no effects until such time as the highest court has reached its conclusion."
"The judgment is also very clear when it comes to the duties of Parliament."
"Among the grounds of the judgment, number 157 expressly states that it is Parliament' s duty, within the framework of its relevant internal procedures, to investigate whether the disparities in treatment of the two categories of Members arising from the aforesaid internal procedures are all necessary and, therefore, objectively justified."
"This is, to speak plainly, a broad hint to us to examine our Rules of Procedure to see whether they are discriminatory."
"I think that all MEPs and political units such as the Italian Radical Party must have completely equal opportunities. They must naturally have the same political rights as the political groups, apart from a number of rights quite specific to the latter."
"However, the rules need to be examined critically to ensure that political units have the same opportunities to work in Parliament. I would therefore call upon you to request the legal services to go through the judgment carefully and see how we are to improve the Rules of Procedure in order to ensure complete equality."
"I would also call for the judgment to be brought up at the first meeting of the Conference of Presidents to be held directly after such an investigation of the judgment has been carried out. In that context, we shall be able to debate a package of arrangements for independent MEPs and smaller political units which are not large enough to form a group and, in that way, be able to secure the fair treatment of MEPs."
"Madam President, I must take this opportunity to inform you that a party of schoolchildren invited by me for this week - tomorrow to be precise - has cancelled the visit."
"I also heard, however, that mine was not the only group affected, but that around half the invited groups had cancelled their visits this week."
"The children in question, or their parents, fear that security measures in this House are inadequate and that the children would be in danger if they visited Parliament."
"Let me request you, then, to supply the public with extensive information about the adequacy of the security arrangements."
"Should this not be possible, consideration should be given to a general suspension of visits."
"I myself have also another concern: I would welcome it if those visitors' quotas that cannot be made use of because visits have been cancelled, could be set aside for future dates rather than be lost, so that these groups that, for understandable reasons, are not visiting Parliament now, may make up for it at a later date."
"The Bureau members will be meeting this evening and I shall inform them of your proposal."
"Madam President, as regards the formation of Parliamentary Groups, our group expressed itself quite unambiguously at the time this Parliament was constituted."
"We are grateful for this confirmation of our understanding of the law."
"Further to certain remarks by Members, I would again like to make it clear that our Rules of Procedure, decided on by this Parliament, make a clear distinction between Members belonging to a group and pooling their rights in it, and those who do not belong to a group."
"Members without a group should quite clearly not be discriminated against, but that does not mean that they, as individual Members, enjoy complete equality of treatment with the groups."
"Rule 30 of our Rules of Procedure expressly states that Members not belonging to a group have the use of a Secretariat with all other details being decided on by the Presidents."
"That is now the legal position as handed down by the Court of First Instance, and we should proceed in accordance with it in the coming months."
"Extraordinary European Council of 21 September 2001 in Brussels - Preparatory work for the European Council in Ghent"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements, firstly, on the Extraordinary European Council held in Brussels on 21 September 2001, and secondly, on the preparatory work for the European Council in Ghent."
"I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, and I shall now give him the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was keen to inform you as quickly as possible about the progress of the work done at the extraordinary European Council held on 21 September involving the Heads of State and Government of the European Union."
"I felt that it was important to involve you, as MEPs, closely in the European Union' s talks and decisions, as we have done since the tragic events occurred."
"As you know, the European Council met to analyse the international situation following the terrorist attacks in the United States and to give the necessary impetus to the actions taken by the European Union."
"The talks rapidly led to unanimous conclusions, the text of which was made public on the evening of 21 September."
"I do not intend to read it out here in its entirety, but I would like to emphasise the salient points."
"I will first inform you that the presidency is most satisfied to see the European Union decide that the fight against terrorism is a priority, and to reaffirm its unyielding determination to take concerted action under any and all circumstances."
"The terrorist threat is a test for European integration."
"The unanimity displayed by the European Council, the quality of its debate, and the adoption of comprehensive and specific measures all show that the Union proved to be equal to the challenge."
"The extraordinary Council gave the Union an opportunity to get several important messages across."
"The first message is one of solidarity and cooperation with the United States."
"The European Union shares the same values as the United States: those of an open, democratic, multi-cultural society."
"The Union will stand alongside the United States to bring to justice the perpetrators of these barbarous acts, together with their sponsors and accomplices, and to ensure that they are punished."
"We are of the opinion that the targeted American reprisals are legitimate under Security Council Resolution 1368."
"We are prepared to commit ourselves to this line, each Member State according to its means."
"However, we must not underestimate the seriousness of this scourge."
"If we are to succeed, we must have the backing of a broad coalition, under the aegis of the United Nations."
"This coalition would include candidates for EU membership, the Russian Federation and our Arab partners."
"The second message that the European Union would like to get across following this Council is that it is fully committed to fighting terrorism, and to this end has adopted an action plan comprising five series of measures."
"The first series of measures consists of bolstering essential police and judicial cooperation."
"To this end, the European Council has set a number of objectives, including the creation of a European arrest warrant and the establishment of a common definition of terrorism."
"The same European Council has also taken a firm decision to adopt measures for identifying terrorists and the organisations that support them in order to draw up lists of terrorist organisations."
"In this connection, the role of Europol and its cooperation with the United States will be reinforced."
"The second series of measures in the action plan, which I consider to be very important, involves the development of international legal instruments."
"There are many such instruments that need to be implemented and it would no doubt be worthwhile examining, as India suggests, the idea of a general convention against international terrorism."
"The third series of measures on which the European Union would like to work involves the funding of terrorism."
"Here too, specific action will be taken at EU level, particularly with regard to money laundering and the freezing of assets."
"The fourth series of measures involves air safety."
"The European Union intends to swiftly devise a set of specific, technical measures for this purpose, such as baggage checks, technical training for crews and so on."
"Lastly, I wish to draw your attention to the fifth series of measures, which involves the common, foreign and security policy as a whole."
"The emphasis has been placed on the need to coordinate the Union' s overall action; the idea being to bolster the common, foreign and security policy, in order for there to be an integrated campaign against terrorism, including the systematic reassessment of relations between the European Union and third countries in the light of any support that these countries might give to terrorism."
"In the medium and long term, the fight against terrorism will also require the Union to strengthen its prevention policy and to become more involved in stabilising regional conflicts."
"As part of this, the European Union certainly intends to enhance its role, with the assistance of the United States, Russia and its partners in Arab countries, in order to work towards finding a long-term solution to the Middle East conflict."
"In addition, the development of the common, foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the European security and defence policy (ESDP) could have long-lasting effects."
"These EU policies must not be used as tools for reprisals, but as a means of prevention."
"Conflict prevention also implies an unstinting commitment on the part of the European Union to integrate all countries into a global system of security and sustainable prosperity."
"Finally, we must pay special attention to the problem of refugees."
"On this issue, the Commission will devise projects to assist Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries."
"The last message sent by the European Council was to reassure the European countries and the markets about the economy, and it will be helped in this endeavour by the conclusions of the informal ECOFIN Council held at the same time in Liège, and to stress the positive role the euro will play in this economic context that we are experiencing."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is the content of the message of the European Council held on 21 September."
"To sum up, I would like to add two comments."
"First of all, as is so often the case, the crisis situation created by the attacks in New York and Washington has given impetus to European unification."
"The Extraordinary European Council on 21 September provided an opportunity to take practical decisions and to display genuine European leadership."
"The Belgian Presidency will endeavour to follow up its commitments, particularly at the forthcoming General Affairs Council in October and the Ghent European Council."
"Secondly, while making the fight against terrorism a priority, we must not be diverted from other projects that are fundamental to European integration."
"I would like to confirm here and now that the Belgian Presidency will make every effort to comply with its programme on preparing for the introduction of the euro, enlargement negotiations and the implementation of the European security and defence policy."
"I would now like to turn to the preparation of the Ghent European Council."
"(NL) The informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Ghent on 19 October will consider the three subjects already identified by the Belgian Presidency, namely the euro, the enlargement of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration on the future of Europe."
"In the wake of recent international developments, a fourth issue will probably be added to the agenda, namely the fight against terrorism."
"With regard to the introduction of the euro coins and notes in 12 Member States on 1 January 2002, the President of the ECOFIN Council, Minister Reynders, the relevant European Commissioner, Mr Solbes, and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Wim Duisenberg, will present a detailed report on the level of preparedness of the Member States."
"The Heads of State and Government will thus have an opportunity to influence preparations, where necessary."
"They will also have the opportunity to discuss some of the more political aspects of the euro, such as the use of the euro in the candidate countries."
"With regard to the preparations for the Laeken Declaration, the President of the General Affairs Council will report on the talks held to date by the foreign affairs ministers on this subject."
"In particular, the focus will be on the work done in this connection by the Belgian Presidency."
"The progress made to date mostly concerns the organisation of the Convention as an innovative instrument paving the way for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004."
"The Belgian Presidency hopes to be able to consolidate this progress at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 and 9 October and then build on it with regard to two additional aspects: the status of the candidate countries at the Convention and the organisation of a Civil Forum."
"What is more, the presidency would like to see a consensus reached on the best way of defining the Convention' s mandate."
"The presidency would prefer to develop further or to reformulate the four themes of the Nice Declaration, with, of course, the objective of arriving at a broader agenda."
"At the General Affairs Council of 8 October, the presidency will also give the Member States an initial indication of the possible structure of the Laeken Declaration."
"The preparatory work done in the General Affairs Council should make it possible for the Heads of State and Government meeting in Ghent to push ahead gradually with the plans for the Laeken Declaration and, if possible, to make further progress in this domain."
"Consequently, over the coming weeks, the presidency will strive, firstly, to convince the other Member States that the Laeken Declaration should not be limited simply to procedural matters; secondly, to explain the nature of the new elements affecting the Declaration' s content and, thirdly, to persuade the other Member States that this approach, in substance, should not pose any specific problems."
"(FR) I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to reassure all those who have expressed reservations regarding the approach being recommended by the presidency."
"The type of undertaking that we envisage does not give rise to insurmountable obstacles."
"On the contrary, it offers up a number of advantages."
"In my view, the question of knowing whether or not it is advisable to stick to the four topics of the Nice Declaration is not a genuine problem."
"This declaration was worded in such a way so that it is possible to widen the debate, using the four topics listed as a basis."
"Moreover, it is difficult to see what could prevent the Convention from taking the initiative on whatever subject it feels it would be useful to discuss."
"It has been clear since our meeting in Genval that the Laeken Declaration will simply ask the questions and will not necessarily seek to give any pre-prepared answers."
"The outcome of the Convention will be presented in the form of options, which should reassure all those who felt that their hand was being forced."
"Lastly, while the aim of the exercise - which was acknowledged by all - is to ask the right questions, it is quite legitimate to seek to formulate them in the most complete, clear and pertinent manner in order to optimise the future work of the Convention."
"Where the enlargement of the European Union is concerned, the European Council will be asked by the presidency to consider a report drafted by the European Commission on the implementation of a specific enlargement strategy."
"This report will be available as soon as it is adopted by the college."
"The aim in this respect is to check that the road map adopted by the Nice European Council and confirmed by the Göteborg European Council as a general framework for negotiation is being respected."
"Lastly, I would like to stress that the presidency has no intention of drafting any written conclusions for the meeting of the Heads of State and Government."
"I would like to thank Mr Michel."
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Michel Barnier, who is speaking on behalf of the Commission."
"Madam President, Minister Michel, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and its President, Roman Prodi, who is currently in Brussels attending the European Union meeting with Russia, I would like to make a statement on the recent Extraordinary European Council held in Brussels and the opportunities arising from the preparatory work of the Ghent European Council."
"Before I speak about the three subjects that Minister Michel also mentioned, which will be on the agenda of the Ghent Council, I would like to briefly talk about the Extraordinary European Council held on 24 September, in the wake of the tragic attacks on New York City and Washington."
"As you know, this Council was, first of all, an opportunity to unanimously express our shared sadness and solidarity with the American people."
"However, looking beyond these events, whilst we too experience this sadness and solidarity, I want to reassert our belief, and that of the Commission as a whole, that the fight against terrorism is not and cannot be a clash of civilisations."
"On the contrary, it is this fight that brings together all the nations of the world, as equal partners, against the forces that set out to destroy them, without regard for human life, without any respect for the values that people share and that transcend borders and cultures."
"And it is the concept of humanity on which the European Union bases its action."
"This is how our collective, global fight will achieve its goal."
"At the Extraordinary Council, the European Union outlined the main points of a common response to the threat of terrorism, a threat that is unfortunately not unfamiliar to some of our Member States and which the Heads of State and Government now wish to combat together, using every possible means."
"At the informal meeting at Ghent, the Commission will report back on developments in the economic situation, and more generally, on the various measures that were put forward on 21 September by the European Council."
"The Laeken European Council will provide an opportunity to give a more detailed operational report."
"In the coming months, the European Union must demonstrate that it is able to organise, take action, react swiftly and, of course, respect the fundamental freedoms, because this situation forces us, once again, to reconcile freedom and security."
"The most urgent measures, on which my colleague Mr Vitorino is working, include the introduction of a European arrest warrant to replace current extradition procedures and the adoption of a common definition of terrorism."
"I would point out that the Extraordinary European Council hoped to implement all the measures decided by the European Council at its meeting in Tampere in October 1999."
"With the same determination, the Commission yesterday referred to you, Madam President, a draft Community regulation enabling us to freeze the assets of individuals or bodies that may have links with terrorism."
"The Laeken European Council will therefore be a good opportunity to assess very carefully the progress made on creating the area of freedom, security and justice laid down at Tampere."
"In the meantime, the European Parliament and the Council will be able to make initial progress due to several measures."
"In October, the Commission will present the biannual performance indicators, which enable us to monitor the follow-up of the Tampere Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let there be no mistake: whether it be regarding these matters and the other measures announced in Brussels on 21 September, the funding of terrorism, which I have just mentioned, the situation of air transport or the aid that we must give to the Afghan refugees, the European Union has a duty to achieve results, first and foremost to the Afghan refugees, who are expecting some progress to be made."
"I would like to reaffirm my belief that the most effective means of bridging what we call the democratic deficit is most certainly to respond to citizens' expectations and to follow up our words with actions."
"I shall now move on, if I may, to discuss the forthcoming informal Ghent Council and to the first of the subjects on the agenda, which relates to the major challenge of the euro and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins."
"In less than three months, the euro will be here."
"It is crucial to constantly reiterate, to everyone we speak to, the reasons why the majority of Member States of the European Union took the decision to share the same currency."
"The euro is a political and economic undertaking; for almost three years, we have kept inflation under control and have had sustained growth because of economic and monetary union."
"The euro will provide the European Union with better protection against external economic forces and against international financial crises."
"Now is also the time to reiterate this."
"This is an achievement, and we can all weigh up the extent of our achievement."
"By using the euro on a daily basis, people, private individuals and businesses will benefit from the greatest transparency in prices, easier transactions and better investment opportunities."
"They will gain a better understanding of what an internal market can offer, one that is made up of almost 400 million citizens and consumers, 300 million of which will use the single currency."
"From 1 January 2002, the euro will, undoubtedly, make Europe more tangible, more visible than ever, and I believe that the circulation of the euro notes and coins will show in a very specific manner that the people of Europe are managing to achieve their common goals."
"The euro will therefore become a symbol of stability, peace and shared identity."
"Yet, when faced with such challenges, we must also hope and ensure that the changeover to the euro notes and coins is as straightforward as possible for 300 million people in 12 countries, when so many new methods of payments are introduced, along with 15 billion notes and 50 billion coins."
"In other words, we must ensure that we meet this unprecedented logistical and strategic challenge."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has shown that it is playing an active and willing role to prepare for the introduction of the euro, and that it is concerned that consumers and businesses, from the largest to the smallest, receive the information they need."
"With the support of the European Union, Member States have put in place national plans for the changeover to the euro."
"Next week, my colleague, Pedro Solbes, will present a communication on the introduction of notes and coins, so that, in Ghent, the Heads of State and Government can put the finishing touches to the preparatory work that is underway."
"The European Union, working together, must ensure that this information is circulated as far and wide as possible in order to respond to the concerns that exist, and which are having a noticeable effect on price stability, and to force us to collectively resolve any technical issues in an accurate and practical manner."
"The second subject which Mr Michel raised, and which the Heads of State and Government will bring up in Ghent, is preparations for enlargement."
"The Heads of State and Government will discuss enlargement because it is important to keep up the strongest possible political momentum for this project, whatever technical difficulties we encounter in relation to any particular aspect."
"In any case, politically we are already living in an enlarged Union."
"This has been made even clearer from our intensive contacts with the candidate countries since 11 September."
"In Nice, last December, the Intergovernmental Conference defined the minimum parameters that will enable the Union institutions and bodies to take in new Member States."
"Moreover, the European Council approved the strategy we had proposed for bringing the accession negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"These decisions unequivocally confirmed that enlargement is an irreversible process."
"We now have to implement, on a day-to-day basis, the road map the European Council adopted at Nice, based on the principle of differentiating between candidate states."
"We have to evaluate the progress made at each accession conference separately, which will in fact also enable those candidate states that are currently less advanced to catch up."
"In Ghent, the Commission will report on the progress made with the road map, presenting a kind of mid-term review of enlargement strategy, that will allow the Heads of State and Government to determine what kind of approach or impetus is needed for the further negotiations."
"In mid-November, the Commission will publish the regular reports in which it evaluates the progress of the candidate states towards accession."
"Let me say a last word on this subject."
"We know that enlargement is a difficult project, but we also want it to be a very ambitious one."
"It will succeed only if it enjoys the support of the people of all the countries concerned, by which of course I mean the candidate countries and their citizens, but also the citizens of the present EU Member States."
"At the instigation of Mr Günther Verheugen, and in liaison with the European Parliament, the Commission has proposed measures for informing the citizens of the present and future Member States and explaining the issues involved, the chances and the opportunities, without, however, concealing the problems or risks of enlargement."
"To that end we want to mobilise the Commission delegations in the candidate countries and our representatives in the Member States."
"But everyone must play their part, the institutions and the European elected representatives, as also the national authorities and, more broadly, all the opinion-formers in Europe."
"Madam President, let me raise a last point, which will be debated in Ghent, prior to Laeken, and concerns the future of the Union."
"The Heads of State and Government will have to extend and confirm the positions defined at the recent foreign ministers' meeting in Genval."
"Obviously this is the same subject the foreign ministers will or may debate in Luxembourg on 8 October."
"In Genval, the Commission reported on the situation and called for a new approach in the preparations for the future institutional reforms, taking account of the limitations of the methods applied in the past, for Amsterdam and Nice."
"For a long time, in fact, the European Parliament and the Commission had shared the interest shown by several Member States in a method inspired by the convention that prepared for the Charter of Fundamental Rights and brought it to a successful conclusion."
"The Commission obviously hopes the next General Affairs Council will formally mark the support of all the Member States for this formula."
"Let me just point out here that at a very early stage the Commission highlighted the importance, in view of preparing the future institutional reforms, of involving the various sources of democratic legitimacy that coexist in Europe and of preparing for these reforms as openly and transparently as possible."
"That is why we would also like to see special attention devoted to establishing a structural link between the activities of the convention and the future Intergovernmental Conference."
"Another link we would like to see is between the activities of the convention and the more general debate that will continue to be held and in which a growing number of associations, interest groups and citizens is already taking part."
"This forum on the future of the Union, for which more and more people are perceiving the need, should encourage an exchange of views that very closely reflects the concerns of civil society."
"I believe the convention must listen carefully to these discussions."
"As to the procedures for organising this future convention, several questions still need to be resolved before the Laeken European Council."
"Let me note here the very thorough work done by your Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, especially in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"This report very carefully and skilfully analyses all the questions at issue."
"It also discusses something I consider most important, namely how to consolidate and deepen the Union's policies."
"Like the rapporteurs, I too would conclude by emphasising the need to maintain the link between the institutional architecture and the European projects."
"It would be rather paradoxical to try to strengthen Europe's institutional structure, to strengthen the Community model, while at the same time weakening the major, or some of the major Community policies or allowing them to 'unravel' ."
"The four main themes identified in Nice must be tackled."
"I listened very carefully to Mr Michel's very coherent and, I think, ambitious words on how to consolidate the achievements of 50 years of European integration."
"That could mean that when the environment itself changes we have to make changes to the course of European integration, although without losing sight of its points of reference or its raison d'être."
"We will have to keep to a simple and effective decision-making system, but also strong common policies."
"For the European Union cannot confine itself to producing legislative rules."
"Through political union, through economic and monetary union, and also through certain major common policies such as the one for which I am responsible, cohesion, European integration must lead towards solidarity between peoples and nations, the stability of the continent, the balanced development of its entire territory and its regions."
"It is these principles and these common objectives that we must reaffirm at this moment in time when it appears so necessary for Europe to stand united beside our closest allies."
"When the Heads of State and Government meet in Ghent, they will certainly discuss the future Laeken declaration."
"So I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission attaches great importance to this Laeken declaration, which should in a sense set the tone and determine the spirit in which, as Mr Michel just said, we need to approach all the institutional questions, so as to ensure that our institutions are in a position to achieve our common goals."
"Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, since we have some time at our disposal before the year 2004, rather more than usual for a change, which is rare, no doubt we can and, I believe, we must spend some of that time reflecting together on what we want to do together, checking that we really do agree among ourselves on what we must and can do together and, of course, integrating this fundamental political reflection process into today's new and grave international context, which emphasises and underpins the necessity, the value and the relevance of the European project."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September have changed the world, the drama of which event is shown by the way yesterday Article 5 (the assistance clause) of the North Atlantic Treaty was invoked for the first time in the history of the North Atlantic Alliance, thereby declaring that all NATO countries were required to engage in defence."
"It is important, though, to point out that this challenge has been thrown down not only to the United States and the West but also to the community of nations as a whole."
"I was told yesterday by someone from China - the People's Republic, not Taiwan - that fifty Chinese people were killed in New York."
"That means to say that these terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center were an attack on nearly all the nations of the world."
"It is therefore necessary that we act in solidarity with each other."
"Getting to grips with terrorism is an intellectual, political, economic and military task, and it can only be done in the long term."
"We say again that terrorism, in so far as its causes lie in Islamic lands - for that is where the terrorists are - is not to be confused with the peaceful Arab and Muslim world."
"This must be repeated again and again!"
"I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for travelling to many countries in the company of Mr Solana and Mr Patten."
"We will now also - Madam President, I thank you for your initiatives - be calling a meeting of the Mediterranean Forum, in order to consult with our parliamentary friends from the Mediterranean region."
"I would counsel strongly against any inappropriate rhetoric!"
"I am not satisfied with what was said by Mr Nielson or by Mr Bolkestein."
"We must be able to rely on a Commissioner' s speaking appropriately and in cautious terms."
"We will discuss this on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents and, subject to the way these discussions go, our group reserves the right to call upon the President of the Commission and, if need be, the two Commissioners to elaborate here in the European Parliament on what they have said."
"We now need more of Europe."
"We will be no more than a partner of the USA even if we are capable of dealing not only with foreign, security, and defence policy, but also with internal security issues."
"We need to cooperate with Russia."
"We welcome the fact that President Putin is having talks today with Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council and with Mr Prodi as President of the Commission."
"We want partnership with Russia, but the events of 11 September must not mean that we close our eyes to the human rights violations that are still going on in Chechnya."
"On the contrary, we must say 'Yes' to combating violence and terrorism if it originates in Chechnya, but 'No' to war on the Chechen people."
"We must also be an advocate for the rights of the Chechen people, within the Russian Federation of course."
"For this reason, there must be recognition for the identity of peoples, which is one of the core values of the European Union."
"It goes without saying that we must proceed with the World Trade Agreements as planned, for nothing could be worse than for us not to transact our normal day-to-day business."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned Ghent."
"We support what you have said."
"We ask you to send out a signal for renewed close cooperation in combating terrorism."
"Not only should Europol and Eurojust, too, closely cooperate, but - in my personal judgment - this close cooperation is best guaranteed by their being based at one location."
"We ask you to send a signal to the acceding countries, that they are welcome in the European Union if they comply with the conditions."
"I am saying this as a German, for eleven years ago, on 3 October 1990, we were celebrating the unity of Germany, which was only possible because the road towards it was prepared by those Europeans who now wish to join the European Union."
"What you have said about the preparation for the Laeken Convention meets with our approval."
"Let me express my gratitude for the way your conception of it coheres with our own."
"My final remark will be a personal challenge to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as much as to anyone else. We are all facing a challenge as regards the security of our institutions."
"I must tell you that I feel safer here in Strasbourg - which has nothing to do with the place itself - but because we know that, here, the police are French."
"When the President of the European Parliament gets a response from the Belgian authorities to the effect that greater protection for Parliament in Brussels is not necessary because there are no indications of attacks or such like, I find that justification far from adequate..."
"(Applause)"
"... but I call upon you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to have the European Parliament in Brussels more securely guarded by the security forces of the Kingdom of Belgium."
"I am given to over-reaction even less than I am to panic, but we need protection and security wherever possible."
"I ask you, in your capacity as the currently responsible President-in-Office of the Council to use your influence with the Belgian government so that the security of the European Parliament in Brussels may, so far as possible, be assured by Belgium."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group endorses the conclusions reached at the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels. The Council came at just the right time politically, and resulted in a sea change in the Union' s collective conscience."
"I should like to recall that this change was initiated by the Watson Report in early September."
"Unfortunately, it was not until after the attacks on Washington and New York that the Council woke up to the situation and began to press ahead, and we do welcome the change in approach."
"I should like to emphasise that in our view it is very important for this action to be included in the framework of United Nations' Resolution 1368 (2001), as stated in the Council' s conclusions."
"Kofi Annan' s proposal to establish a global convention against terrorism is also important. It is already under discussion in the United States and will receive the European Union' s full support."
"A clear definition at all levels of the nature of the fight against terrorism is also needed. This fight will not curtail freedoms, it is a fight to defend the intrinsic freedom of every individual, namely the right to life and the right not to be subjected to indiscriminate violence."
"In this connection, Madam President, I believe the activities of the Justice and Home Affairs Council must be supported, as it works to consolidate both Europol and Eurojust. Common instruments must be developed, not only at European level but also within our respective countries."
"The lobbying groups are very adept at exerting pressure or influence on the Commission and the Council. Please take note of this, Mr President, and pass it on to Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council."
"I believe we should respect the activities of others. I have in mind, in particular, the criticism of our activities in connection with the directive on money laundering."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should also like to express my group' s disquiet concerning the legislation passed by the Italian Senate yesterday. It is entirely contradictory to your aims, and will hinder judicial cooperation and the fight against terrorism because its provisions make cooperation at judicial level quite impossible."
"(Applause from the left and protests from the right) Madam President, I must appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering ..."
"Surely, Madam President, this is a civilised House and those who resort to barracking have no place in it."
"I am addressing my colleague Mr Poettering too. He is very concerned about the statements made by certain Commissioners."
"My group would like all Commissioners to explain themselves before this House."
"Mr Poettering ought to confer with his political friends, especially with the Prime Minister of Italy, to ensure that no statements are made to undermine the European Union's action here and in the wider world."
"In addition, Madam President, I should like to comment on the Ghent Council. The measures taken so far concerning the euro are good, and it is an important issue."
"However, we need to strengthen our economic capacity so we can respond to the world crisis. It is for the Council to do so, because it is essential for us to define an anticyclical policy and put it in place."
"Further, with regard to enlargement, and here I am addressing all the political groups in this House, we must make a commitment on the basis of what you achieve at Ghent, and of the Commission' s progress report. This has to come back to Parliament."
"There is a lot of talk of progress along the road, and about the road map. However, we need to check whether the road and the road map will eventually lead to the same destination and whether it will be possible to comply with Parliament' s request that the countries involved should participate in the 2004 elections."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the Convention. Firstly, I understand that the Convention has already been adopted."
"Secondly, the Convention is to be established on the basis of its composition when preparing the Charter."
"Thirdly, when you refer to options, are you not speaking of coherent proposals by the Convention?"
"The Convention is not a research body, nor is it a seminar."
"The Convention is required to present proposals. The latter sometimes involve two options, but they are never options to be accepted or rejected."
"We do not wish to be involved in that kind of game."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Madam President, the Liberal Democrats in this House welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council."
"We are pleased that it took on board proposals from this House in the field of justice and home affairs on combating terrorism and indeed that it reviewed the Union's policies in other areas to ensure that we have joined-up thinking in our approach to this very serious problem."
"We regret, however, that it took a shock like the bombing of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon to push the Union into using the legal powers that it has under the Treaty of Amsterdam to act in fighting terrorism."
"Liberal Democrats welcome particularly the Commission's proposals of yesterday for a Council Regulation to freeze the assets of terrorist groups."
"We note its request for urgency and will be pushing this morning within the committee I have the honour to chair to make a recommendation to Parliament this afternoon to adopt those proposals."
"I hope that the Committee of Permanent Representatives meeting this morning will add its request for urgency to that of the Commission."
"The need for action in this area throws into sharp relief the weaknesses and the contradictions of the European Union post-Amsterdam."
"These were not dealt with properly at Nice."
"I hope they will be dealt with at Laeken and through the convention which will be established."
"Commissioner Patten yesterday rightly lamented the inability of the European Union to act fast in situations like this and thus to enjoy the confidence of its Member States and to coordinate the policies of its Member States in an area where a supranational threat requires a supranational response."
"At times like this the Union must act fast, but finds it cannot act fast."
"The mechanisms of the third pillar leave Mr bin Laden laughing all the way to the cash machine."
"I challenge the national governments to explain to our citizens why Europe has been incapable of acting fast because of the curious and complicated mechanisms of the third pillar."
"When we act fast we find that we need urgency and urgency frequently leads to bad law."
"We cannot continue to adopt the necessary security measures for our citizens in a way which is infelicitous for the Union's institutions, incomprehensible to our citizens and ineffective because it allows for no proper legal, democratic or administrative control of decisions."
"I hope that the convention set up by Laeken will look at invoking Article 42 of the TEU to bring these policy areas fully within the core competences of the Union."
"Many measures will be needed in the coming months."
"Commissioner Vitorino has provided us with an anti-terrorism road map outlining such measures."
"Clearly, in our consideration of these, a delicate balance will need to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the civil liberties which make our democracy what it is."
"The President-in-Office said this morning that we should not be blown off course on our other agendas."
"I agree with him."
"Those agendas include our agenda to consolidate citizens' rights within the Union and our agenda of anti-discrimination."
"Liberals in this House will defend, with the President-in-Office, the rights of EU citizens."
"The House has received a proposed regulation on the freezing of assets."
"That regulation could potentially, depending on its implementation, have a disastrous effect on many legitimate Muslim-owned businesses."
"Therefore Liberals will be calling for a sunset clause in that regulation giving it a limited life to make sure that it is not being abused in its implementation."
"We look forward to proposals from the Council for the involvement of the European Parliament in determining the names that will be put on the list in the annex to that regulation."
"In conclusion, Article 6 says that the Union is founded on rights."
"The Charter defines those rights and we hope that the convention will agree to insert the Charter fully into the Treaties."
"Commissioner, the European Union is facing several major challenges, which it will have to meet as quickly as possible if it wants to mount an effective, coherent and long-term campaign against terrorism, with particular reference to breaking up the terrorist networks."
"Several colleagues have already discussed the first challenge, namely to avoid a clash of civilisations with the Islamic world."
"In that context, let me take advantage of Mr Michel's presence and congratulate him on his diplomatic activity over the past weeks, which, I believe, is bound to produce positive results in terms of establishing a very broad coalition against terrorism and its supporters."
"Creating a very broad coalition means, of course, securing the participation of as many countries as possible, but without losing sight of the fact that our enemies' enemies are not always our friends and realising that no state that forms part of this coalition is exempt from its duties in regard to democracy, the protection of human rights and respect for minorities."
"I am thinking in particular of Russia and China, which are of course important players but also cause us serious concern in this respect."
"The second challenge, and it is certainly not insignificant, is to strengthen police and judicial cooperation without compromising individual rights and freedoms."
"In fact here, in the European Union, the parliamentary control is totally inadequate."
"I therefore think, and I believe we agree fairly unanimously, that it is important to include judicial and police cooperation in the first pillar."
"That would certainly be one answer."
"Furthermore, at international level, we urgently need to set up the International Criminal Court, a process that has been underway for several years but is now marking time."
"Let me point out that we vitally need this kind of court to try crimes against humanity, such as those committed in New York and Washington."
"We will have to mount a large-scale diplomatic action to persuade as many states as possible to support this project, in particular the United States, which is after all a vital player."
"The third challenge is the problem of depriving the terrorist networks of their means of action, both financial and technical."
"We have already raised the subject of financing; we have a draft directive on money laundering that is currently making little progress and I think an effort needs to be made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament to ensure that this directive is adopted quickly."
"Moreover, we must realise that this is a first step; it does not go far enough but it is a determining step."
"In the long term, I am convinced we will be forced to take large-scale action to outlaw and abolish offshore banking and tax havens."
"Money laundering is obviously an important weapon in the hands of international terrorist groups and international terrorist networks."
"I was struck by some information, which has not been denied, to the effect that even before the New York and Washington attacks it appears that shares in some companies - and I am thinking in particular of the two American airline companies and several insurance companies that were affected by the attack - were jettisoned just before the attacks."
"This could be regarded as insider dealing and I think that at the very least we need an international inquiry to check this information."
"Finally, let me turn to the technical level, technical being, of course, a euphemism for arms."
"Clearly the European Union will have to intensify its fight against illegal and uncontrolled exports of light arms and keep a close eye on the fundamental problem of the proliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons."
"I believe that we cannot avoid the need to take a longer-term look at the vulnerability of some of our technological tools to acts of terrorism."
"I am thinking, for example, of energy, of the risks posed by nuclear power stations, the majority of which are highly vulnerable to the types of action committed in the United States."
"Madam President, once again, we declare our condemnation of any form of terrorism, whatever its source."
"As well as destroying human life, terrorism takes any possibility or capacity for democratic initiative away from the huge numbers of men and women who are fighting to change the unjust social and economic system of this world."
"Moreover, we condemn any attempt to assert the non-existent superiority of the moral, cultural or political systems of the communities of the European Union over other communities."
"We believe that, at this moment in history, one of the ways in which the European Union can combat and isolate any form of violence is to make a concerted effort to achieve the objective of giving the peoples of Israel and Palestine two autonomous, sovereign States, as stipulated in all those UN resolutions which Israel has been violating for years."
"The internal security of the Union must be reinforced - and I agree with much of what Mr Watson said - but always and only in respect for fundamental rights and the constraints of the rule of law."
"Therefore, any extension of the competences or spheres of operation of bodies such as Europol or Eurojust must go hand in hand with the creation of a system of judicial and, most importantly, democratic controls, with Parliament playing an active role."
"Any attempt to use the danger represented by terrorism to restrict or eliminate, by any means including Union or national legislative instruments, the huge democratic waves of dissent and opposition to the dominant social and economic system which are now sweeping through Europe and the world, must therefore be rejected, just as those legislative practices also referred to by Mr Barón Crespo such as the Italian laws on international letters rogatory, which are of practical assistance to terrorist and organised crime groups, must be condemned."
"We hope that the fight against terrorism, which is a crime against humanity, will increasingly be seen as the responsibility of the entire international community, that is of the UN, rather than the responsibility of a small number of wealthy, powerful nations who often use their wealth and power not to combat terrorism and its causes but to consolidate their economic and political power."
"The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair, poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism - never. This situation must be fought and eradicated by action, not just formal declarations, if we want our world to be at peace."
"This is another area in which we must take action if we genuinely want to eliminate terrorism."
"Mr President, EU leaders met in Ghent on 21 September to evaluate how the Union should react to the horrific terrorist attacks in America."
"I welcome the solidarity which all EU leaders showed with the American government and the American people in their time of mourning and grief."
"I also very much welcome the concrete plan of action that EU leaders are now going to implement in an effort to tackle international terrorism head-on."
"But let me be clear about one point."
"As a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September it is now clear to us all that people are willing to engage in well-organised suicide missions to further their own political goals."
"That means, in the simplest terms, that we are going to have to implement wide-ranging measures if we are going to be in a position to defeat the scourge of international terrorism."
"In line with the conclusions of the Tampere Summit, EU leaders are committed to introducing a European arrest warrant, designed to supplant the current system of extradition in Europe."
"Easing extradition, while protecting civil rights, is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, and in particular within the Union, where free movement of persons exists."
"The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is also going to be ratified in all Member States of the European Union."
"Our finance ministers are going to bring forward proposals outlining a timetable for the implementation of the draft directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering."
"The financial task force run by the OECD will be broadened to cover the issue of combating money laundering."
"There is agreement to implement the framework directive permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the Union."
"There has also been agreement on paying closer attention to the draft directive on insider dealing so as to guarantee that all activities linked to terrorism come under the auspices of the directive."
"Intelligence agencies within the Member States of the Union, together with Europol, must work together more closely in terms of exchanging intelligence information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken."
"Finally, fanatical terrorism is difficult to defeat, but we must be prepared to be determined and vigorous in the counter-terrorism measures that we introduce."
"We must all work together."
"A united front, spearheaded by the Union and the United States, will be the only means of enabling us to defeat these cold-blooded and ruthless murderers."
"Mr President, the summit is now to discuss the composition of the Convention that is to draft the EU' s constitution."
"A majority of MEPs want to see the European Parliament' s representation doubled from 16 to 30."
"The argument is made in terms of equality with the national parliaments which each had two Members in the Charter Convention, making a total of 30."
"The name of my political group refers to a 'Europe of Democracies' in order to emphasise that we want democracy in the individual countries and democratic control of the EU."
"Democracies can govern the EU jointly, but there is no European people, as such, to have given the European Parliament a mandate to negotiate a new constitution for the EU."
"My group and the intergroup SOS Democracy instead proposes that we let each individual national parliament present proposals for the next treaty and then let representatives of the national parliaments prepare the draft treaty that is to replace the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The Commission, Parliament and the governments could be observers in such an assembly."
"We would, at the same time, call upon the prime ministers to pledge that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the Member States."
"A treaty adopted in a referendum could bear the insignia 'more democracy' rather than 'more Union' ."
"We should like to create a slimmer EU with greater freedom for the Member States: an open and democratic EU that is close to the people and is governed by electorates and elected representatives in the Member States; a more flexible Europe, open to the candidate countries and to all other European nations."
"'A democratic EU' sounds all well and good, but it can only come about when there is a European public."
"A living democracy requires a common language, culture, media, treasury of songs and sense of internal interdependence: in short, a European people."
"A 'Europe of democracies' is the art of the possible."
"The EU should be put on a slimming course and the focus shifted to cross-border matters which we cannot control as individual nations."
"In that way, there would be no loss of democracy but a benefit in terms of shared influence, and the people of Europe would vote in favour of the next treaty."
"Would they do so today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council?"
"Dare you allow the Belgians to vote on the Treaty of Nice?"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, first a word on the defence aspect."
"Much has been said about air safety and security, many measures have been taken at European level."
"Curiously, though, there is not a word about our secret services; in fact, if there are a number of organisations that did not work, at any rate in the 15 Member States, they certainly include our secret services."
"Today we see them digging away and finding out all sorts of things."
"Perhaps it would have been better if they had discovered some of them beforehand."
"They cost us dear."
"Nobody is quite sure what they do; sometimes we wonder whether they do anything."
"No doubt that too could be a subject worth considering at European level and subjecting to parliamentary control, for they can present a risk: so long as we leave them total freedom of action, they will sometimes take inappropriate action."
"Turning to the offensive aspect, yesterday the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, provided the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a great deal of information."
"He strongly emphasised the value of dialogue."
"However, I think that unless this dialogue is accompanied by a political project, it may risk merely reinforcing certain positions."
"We are currently endeavouring to forge an anti-terrorist coalition."
"There are, in my view, two main risks."
"Mr Poettering highlighted one of them: the measures to combat terrorism risk - and it is more than a risk, since they have already produced some very adverse results - provoking and encouraging state terrorism."
"Mr Poettering specifically stated - and I thank him because authorised voices in his country, like that of Mr Schröder, seemed to agree with Mr Putin, who has still not provided us with a shred of evidence that the Chechens were responsible for the Moscow attacks, a point Mr Lannoye also emphasised - that it can be tempting to use this great anti-terrorist battle to settle a few scores at home, in Tibet for the Chinese, in Chechnya for the Russians, etc."
"That is an aspect we must bear in mind."
"The other issue is the Arab world."
"There has been much criticism of certain statements that were made."
"I believe we all agree that this is not a clash of civilisation between Islam and Christianity but, obviously, a clash of civilisation between democracy and non-democracy and that we have to take the offensive in that conflict."
"We must help all those people in the Arab countries, in the Muslim countries, who are fighting, often at the price of their freedom, at the price of torture, and often at the price of death; and this Parliament, our European Union, is certainly not doing enough in that respect."
"Examples such as Morocco and Jordan show that the Arab countries can move towards democracy."
"Other countries that might have gone the same way have in fact done the opposite, such as Tunisia: in fact, it would not take much to change the course in that country, which has a ruling class, a cultured class, an education system, and which recognises the rights of women, the equal rights of men and women."
"In that respect our policy is aiding and abetting Mr Ben Ali in consolidating a regime that is moving further away from the rule of law every day and is becoming enclosed in a vicious circle of state gangsterism."
"An offensive policy means supporting the people of Tunisia who are working for the rule of law, for freedom."
"Mr President, the MPF delegation members approve both the 'solidarity and cooperation with the United States' and the 'European policy' headings of the action plan against terrorism adopted by the extraordinary European Council of 21 September."
"However, we feel the practical value of introducing a European arrest warrant and a common definition of terrorism have been rather overestimated."
"Similarly, it may seem a good idea in theory to give Europol new powers, but this organisation is not doing very well as it is and first we would have to call for an independent and objective audit of the way it operates."
"But these are all secondary issues."
"Overall, we approve the Council's conclusions."
"In particular, we welcome the establishment of Eurojust, which is to develop forms of judicial and police cooperation and create synergy between the existing systems instead of trying to demolish them."
"Like the Council, we also call for the speedy ratification of all existing international conventions, like the convention on the financing of terrorism, whose implementation has been seriously delayed."
"However, in spite of all that, Mr President, we are still not happy."
"That brings me to my main point."
"Although the Council adopted long lists of actions to be undertaken, they remain one-off measures and the European Union is still not really prepared to examine its own conscience."
"It would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the 11 September attacks is currently concentrating on Europe and that it shows that, for years now, the terrorists have been centring their preparations in Europe, which they have used as their base."
"All this is not pure chance."
"The day after the attacks, a French newspaper interviewed the current president of Eurojust, Mrs Coninsx, asking her the following question, and I quote from the article: 'is the loose Islamist conglomeration strongly established in Europe?'"
"Mrs Coninsx, head of Eurojust, replied: 'Europe may act as a logistical fallback for these terrorists."
"It is, indeed, fairly easy to cross frontiers because of the Schengen area' ."
"Everyone knows that."
"It is true for the terrorists, but it is also true for fissile materials, it is true for stolen works of art, it is true for illegal immigrants, etc. In fact it was only yesterday and in this very place that I accused the Commission of all too often concealing the problems of illegal immigration."
"Europol informs us that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter EU territory every year, a figure that I actually think is an underestimate."
"At any rate, it means that millions of foreigners live on our soil permanently and illegally."
"So let me ask you: if countries let in millions of foreigners without discovering them and allow them to live there illegally, can they be regarded as in control of their territory?"
"Obviously you will all say 'no' ."
"It is now up to the Council, and the Council alone, to issue strong instructions in order to restore some balance."
"The President of the Council has rightly said that the fight against terrorism will be global and sustained."
"We have to draw all the necessary conclusions from that, discard outdated points of view, give priority to security, review all the old strategies that are no longer appropriate and begin by admitting that controls do not prejudice freedom of movement; while they harm criminals they protect citizens' freedoms."
"The Council must, therefore, call immediately for a list of all the documents that need reviewing from a security point of view and, in particular, that disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which promises a total absence of any kind of control of individuals at the internal frontiers five years after its entry into force."
"We need a general review plan, of which the Council must be directly in charge."
"That means we need to review Article 67 of the Treaty of Amsterdam..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Since the attacks of 11 September, the world has been on tenterhooks."
"People are shocked."
"They feel for the victims and those left behind, and their own sense of security has reached an all-time low."
"People expect their governments to guarantee their safety."
"They realise that this is not wholly possible but they are asking for efficient and conclusive action, and rightly so."
"Anyone who is responsible for security these days has a complex task to fulfil."
"The need for true, European integration and international coordination has been brought into focus more than ever, both in words and deeds."
"Mr President, I very much hope that you will be able to carry out your action plan of 21 September effectively, and that the Belgian Presidency will be able to take specific decisions in this connection."
"We have all asserted that the attacks were not so much directed at innocent victims as at the symbols of freedom, democracy and human rights, including the right to life."
"Nobody will deny that the European Parliament too is a symbol of these values."
"Of course, we do not want to proclaim ourselves as targets, nor do we want to spread panic, but many MEPs are worried, as already stated by group chairman, Mr Poettering."
"In Strasbourg, the entrances and the immediate surroundings of this building are under police surveillance."
"In Brussels, however, we are even denied the illusion of security."
"If, moreover, we infer from the words of the Belgian Minister for the Interior here that he sees no indication of a need for tighter security, then we have a real reason to worry."
"For terrorists do not give warnings, something which a Minister for the Interior should realise."
"That is why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to ask you to persuade your Minister for the Interior and the police in Belgium to think again."
"Not only in the interests of the safety of the MEPs of the 15 Member States, but also in the interests of their colleagues, their visitors, the safety of the city, which is the capital of Europe, and in the interest of the values for which we all stand."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are Europe's tasks in these times?"
"First, Europe must support the victim against the aggressor."
"We hold to our treaty commitments."
"We salute the firm and considered attitude of the United States government."
"We also welcome the European Council's expression of solidarity with the USA."
"All of you must make it your concern that Europe is not divided into doves and hawks!"
"Secondly, the European Union must play its part in forging a worldwide political alliance against terrorism."
"We appreciate what you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, have undertaken not only in the Arab countries but also in Russia."
"We ask that you continue your efforts as intermediaries in the Middle East, above all between Israel and the Palestinians."
"They are in the best interests of us all."
"Thirdly, we must, join together in reinforcing our internal security."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is regrettable that the European Council, and the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers as well, have only now got around to partially implementing plans that already existed and had been thoroughly worked out."
"We expect action against terrorism, not reactions to terrorist attacks."
"In doing this, Europe must continue to be an example of how to maintain the balance between the right to individual liberty and the security of all."
"Fourthly, we want Europeans not to be distracted from their common commitment to a more just world order, in which law for all replaces force exerted by the few."
"We are not making this effort for a more just world order solely out of a belief that we will thereby be depriving terrorism of its breeding ground."
"On the contrary, we seek a more just world order because that reflects our values and our dignity as Europeans - a dignity we share with all the peoples of the earth!"
"Fifthly, if it is true to say that the world is no longer what it was before 11 September, then the European Union cannot stay as it is."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome your intentions for Ghent and Laeken."
"We hope they do not remain only as intentions but that what you have put before us will indeed become the opinion of the Fifteen and a basis for our further work."
"Europe could be broken by the crisis now facing the world."
"It could, though, equally, emerge stronger from it."
"It is at this crossroads that you and all of us will be standing in Ghent and Laeken."
"In this crisis, Europe can - and I would add - must show its citizens what the European Union is really worth."
"By this yardstick you and all of us will be judged."
"Mr President, 11 September will go down in history."
"It will create a new framework for our daily lives and our political work."
"The subtitles on CNN have read 'America at war' for a long time now."
"Europe has been there."
"Europe has been at war."
"Europe has experience of being a theatre of war."
"The United States has helped us in the past, and we in turn must therefore, of course, help the United States now."
"However, Europe also knows that wars are not won with weapons alone."
"Conflicts cannot be prevented with weapons."
"Wars cannot be won with weapons alone and, above all, peace cannot be built with the aid of weapons alone."
"It may be the case that weapons are necessary, but we must be clear that other things are also required."
"I should like to highlight two things that are necessary to the European agenda."
"The first is the urgent proposal we are debating at present."
"It is regrettable that it is only now that we are debating such a proposal."
"I wish to endorse what other speakers have said."
"I should like to emphasise that there is, of course, a reason why we are only discussing the proposal now."
"Far too many people have too many financial interests in this matter."
"There are too many people who do not wish to reveal what is in their hidden accounts. That is why it has been impossible for Europe to do anything before now, and it may well also prove quite difficult now."
"The second thing I want to say is that, if we do not gather grassroots support for further European cooperation, we shall lack the communal spirit needed to stand firm against terrorists."
"Mr President, yesterday, Mr Nielson stood here and reported on the situation in Afghanistan."
"Afghanistan was on the list of forgotten countries before 11 September."
"Now, however, the situation has become all but catastrophic."
"The World Bank has produced a report showing that between 20000 and 40 000 children per day will die of hunger because of the economic recession caused by the events of 11 September."
"In the EU' s Member States, we have received a report to the effect that foreigners and refugees are being persecuted."
"This is shown by the Monitoring Centre on Racism in its report."
"We are, of course, all appalled at what happened on 11 September, but what these events showed us first and foremost was, of course, that the world has shrunk and that no one is safe."
"The American missile shield would not have helped in this situation."
"Nor did all the American military hardware help, either."
"Now, we are moving on to talk about the need to strengthen democracy and dialogue."
"However, the anti-terrorism package we have debated - not the one concerning the economy, but the other - reeks of distrust."
"The ambition to strengthen the police and intelligence services completely overshadows the fight to strengthen human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"We will not accept increased powers, either for Europol or the intelligence services, until we have got them under democratic control."
"Combating terrorism must not overshadow freedoms of expression and assembly."
"I should like to ask whether there is anyone who believes that our world will become safer when we prohibit certain organisations."
"Terrorism, killing, robbery and the destruction of property are to be forbidden, Well, they are already forbidden."
"Those responsible must be caught, and they must be punished."
"I do not wish to defend anti-democratic organisations, but the question is whether our world will become safer if these organisations go underground and are made illegal."
"There are limits to the number of problems that can be solved by legislation alone, and I think that the first package is evidence of more haste, less speed."
"Our task must be to remove the basis for terrorism."
"I therefore think that the Troika initiative was a step in the right direction and one that favoured dialogue and the creation of a broad alliance to combat terrorism."
"However, there are problems in the alliance."
"When China demands, as a condition of its being a part of the alliance, that we close our eyes to what is happening in Tibet; when Russia demands that we close our eyes to events in Chechnya; when Turkey demands that we close our eyes to the fate of the Kurds; and when Israel demands that we close our eyes to the situation of the Palestinians, then we do not have a safe world."
"There must be security for all, including oppressed people and also the 20 000 to 40 000 children who will die of hunger next year."
"Mr President, the writing on Commander Massoud' s tombstone reads: ""Here lies a man who was like an angel: let him guide you."
"His name is Massoud"" ."
"We must follow him and defend those who are fighting terrorism, trying to restore their people' s freedom, democracy and human rights."
"Yet we did not help Commander Massoud when he came to Strasbourg in April to condemn the crimes of the Taliban."
"Let us at least help the Afghan people and the civilised world to overcome terrorists and fundamentalists."
"However, our statements of condemnation must be followed by practical action: words alone are not enough."
"Therefore, we wonder why it is that the terrorists' bank accounts are only being frozen now, if the governments and intelligence were already aware of these accounts before."
"Why have the Internet sites which continue to promote terrorist initiatives and maintain links with subversive cells throughout the world, recruiting new terrorists all the while, not yet been condemned and closed?"
"We call for the Community funding and financing programmes aiding those governments which are not joining the alliance to combat terrorism and, in any case, continue to harbour terrorists on their territory, to be frozen immediately."
"Mr President, the possible establishment of a Convention is taking up most of the attention in the debate on the future of the European Union."
"This morning, I would like to draw your attention to another point, namely the timeframe for the preparation of the next IGC."
"It is understandable that this Parliament does not want an IGC in 2004, for that is the year when elections will be held and the Commission steps down."
"However, would 2003, as Parliament suggested, be a good alternative?"
"In the Netherlands, we have a saying 'haastige spoed is zelden goed' (more haste, less speed)."
"When one considers the weighty subjects on the agenda, it very much confirms that more time should be taken to reflect."
"Moreover, the topics of the IGC are sufficiently interesting to be the subject of the election battle."
"In addition, it is also necessary to give the applicant states a vote in this important debate."
"In short, 2003 is far too early and 2004 is far too hectic."
"Could the Council not decide to hold the IGC in 2005?"
"Mr President, the attacks in New York and in Washington also claimed many of our own citizens."
"That means, therefore, that there is more than simply a display of solidarity on our part."
"We are united in our fate."
"It is therefore logical that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked, which means that we are involved in NATO responses every step of the way."
"We carry full responsibility, and we must therefore be aware of the reactions that are heading our way."
"All the terrorists wanted to attain was chaos and unreasoning revenge."
"The response to that must be measured and specifically targeted at the people and organisations responsible."
"The security instruments must be comprehensively reinforced."
"That is why I agree that Europol and Eurojust should clearly be given more scope and be integrated into a constitutional state structure."
"The European arrest warrant, the common definition of terrorism and organised crime, more flexible extradition: these are all vital instruments."
"Member State Ministers who tire themselves out producing objections will undoubtedly be considered 'useful idiots' - to use a term from the cold war era."
"What more is needed to enable us to safeguard our common internal security, whereby the sovereignty of Member States is used to benefit the citizens in a way that does not conflict with their interests?"
"Every Member State should realise that if they offer sanctuary to criminals who seek the necessary peace and quiet to plan their crimes, they themselves can become targets."
"The improvement of international relations also strengthens international security."
"That is why we need to make good use of the structures in place, such as the Mediterranean dialogue and the United Nations."
"Contact with certain sections of the Afghan population is necessary, particularly in the interests of providing relief to those in need."
"The resolution which came about under the competent guidance of Mr Collins receives our full support."
"We would only like to adopt one single amendment from the old, socialist resolution, and replace Article 26 on Gibraltar with our own wording."
"Apart from that, we give our wholehearted approval to the joint outcome."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will reply quickly to some of the questions; unfortunately I have to be fairly brief because I cannot stay till the end of the sitting."
"Let me begin with some further information about the convention."
"Several Members raised this matter."
"I think it is important to say, since the question was asked, that the principle of holding a convention to prepare for the IGC has, I believe, been accepted."
"It has also, of course, been agreed that representatives of the governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament, that is, a quadripartite group, will take part."
"This participation could take the following form: government representatives - possibly numbering 15 - 16 MEPs, 30 members of national parliaments and one Commission representative."
"However, I am not going to start a debate about numbers at this point."
"What is important to remember is that the number of participants in this convention must be reduced somewhat."
"It must not be exponential."
"Of course, we could try to please everyone, but then we would end up with a convention that was not viable."
"I believe we have to remember that."
"The Laeken European Council will, no doubt, or, at least, that seems the most likely road, appoint a president, assisted by a bureau made up of at least one member of each component of the convention and assisted by a secretariat."
"The convention's brief would not be to adopt a final text but, at this stage - I think that answers Mr Barón Crespo's question as to whether these are proposals or whether these are options - simply to decide whether we are in favour of options rather than proposals, leaving it, of course, to the bodies concerned to choose from among these options, since options are never more than variations on proposals."
"I am not embracing any one point of view: I am simply describing things as they are."
"If it was just up to me, believe me we would go much further than proposals."
"We would be more radical."
"However, I simply have to adjust to toeing the presidency's line..."
"So I am telling you what I believe I have to tell you for the sake of transparency."
"I can do no more."
"The convention should become operational as soon as possible, during the Spanish Presidency, that is, during the first half of 2002."
"Let me also touch on two questions relating to this convention: it is important that you remember them but also that you can discuss them and make your views on the subject known."
"First of all, it is important to gain the support of the candidate countries."
"We saw a fairly strong convergence of views in Genval on the need to involve the candidate countries in the convention."
"Although, in effect, we are moving towards giving them a status and right of say there, obviously we still have to define the precise procedures for their representation."
"Here, the presidency is putting forward three possible formulas: representation modelled from the outset on that of the Member States, namely one representative of each government and two members of each national parliament - that is conceivable; or one representative per country for the duration of the convention's activities; or, the third formula, progressive representation, consisting of a single representative until the accession treaty has been signed, then representation in line with that of the Member States after the signature."
"Representatives of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions could also be invited as observers."
"Those are the ideas now on the table."
"The next question is how to involve civil society."
"On the whole, the idea of a civil forum was well received by the delegations."
"Nevertheless, some questions came up about the composition of this forum, that is, the selection of representatives of civil society - its organisational procedures and the nature of its links with the convention, which could, for example, take the form of hearings or a variety of other formulas."
"In the presidency's view, this forum could take either of two forms."
"Either it could be like an enlarged assembly, in which case one would need to define its exact composition, role and modus operandi; or it could be a structured network, made up of organisations representing civil society, established at European level."
"The organisations making up that network would be kept officially informed of the activities of the convention and their written contributions would form part of the official documentation forwarded to members of the convention."
"They would be heard by the convention, in accordance with procedures to be defined, and, where appropriate, they could also be consulted by the convention on specific issues."
"If that option were adopted, it would probably be advisable to appoint a coordinator at political level, who could be chosen either by the Laeken European Council or by the convention itself."
"That is the additional information I wanted to give you on the convention and you are, of course, welcome to come back to us with any ideas this might suggest to you or inspire in you, since that is the purpose of this kind of exchange of views."
"I am entirely open to any comments, ideas or suggestions on the subject."
"Several Members raised the issue of security in Brussels, so I will address their concern."
"I do not think there are any difficulties in principle, except for one aspect where we do come up against certain problems - I will endeavour to analyse this matter and take a closer look - namely the question of unconditional access to Belgian territory."
"I do believe this could pose a number of problems."
"That aside, it looks as though we can certainly reach an agreement fairly soon."
"I promise I will discuss it with the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers immediately after my return so that I can give you practical answers to your questions as quickly as possible."
"Let me highlight something that has emerged from our debates and to which I too am paying close attention."
"If we take a whole range of measures to combat terrorism effectively, they will necessarily - and we must not pretend otherwise - involve the risk of taking measures that curtail freedoms."
"Mr Barón Crespo said so and Mr Lannoye also drew our attention to it."
"I have heard statements in this Chamber that show that some people have not entirely understood this: for instance, if I had to translate Mr Berthu's programme into action, it is clear that this would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms, which would have nothing to do, let me say, with the quality of life, with the democratic quality of our societies."
"That is the way it is, that is my opinion and I am sharing it with you."
"I think we must be very watchful here, for this really is an important issue."
"We cannot bring back the olden days on the pretext of fighting terrorism."
"I think that would be very dangerous, so I am not in favour of it."
"I believe the difficulty we will keep encountering will be, precisely, how to evaluate our margin for manoeuvre constantly."
"But let us please not give in to a security phobia, because sooner or later we would all end up as victims and that would be democracy's loss."
"Mr Lannoye and several others made a most important point in relation to our foreign policy and I entirely agree with him here: the enemies of our enemies are not necessarily our friends."
"Of course, I agree with him."
"It is true that, under cover of this kind of consensual coalition, necessarily based on immediate needs and, admittedly, to some extent also on feelings that are justified, it might well be tempting to overlook, to look away from or to forget certain aspects."
"I think it was yesterday, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that I was asked whether I had put any questions to my interlocutors about State terrorism."
"I think we must not, indeed, lose sight of that aspect in considering our approach, our European commitment and our values."
"It is true that we will have to be very vigilant here too; in other words, sometimes we must not forget that countries, organisations and bodies that form part of the coalition should also, to some extent, render account for some of their own practices, forms of behaviour and policies."
"I therefore agree that we must avoid any kind of naive optimism in this respect and not forget to continue to fight for and campaign for a democratic society wherever possible in the world."
"I therefore agree that we must strengthen the role of the International Criminal Court."
"As time goes by, we come to realise that it is absolutely crucial to have that vital tool at our disposal."
"I was asked whether I am in favour of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into a constitution."
"You all know my views on this."
"Unfortunately, I do not think everybody is quite ready for it yet."
"Nevertheless, I believe that there are all sorts of arguments that can be put forward and that we must, therefore, pursue this debate."
"We will get there in the end."
"Another important aspect on which I was questioned was the danger of curtailing freedoms."
"It is true that if we take a range of measures - Members have referred to the freezing of assets and various other measures - we must ensure that, however urgent, they are accompanied by a systematic evaluation process, preferably conducted soon after their adoption, whatever their nature. I think that it will, of course, be necessary for urgent measures to be re-evaluated fairly early on and fairly regularly."
"We must avoid a practice often seen in some countries - and I know this happens in Belgium - where temporary measures are still being applied 50 years later."
"So I support those who call for guarantees."
"In the event of urgent measures, we must indeed lay down a procedure of regular re-evaluation of those measures."
"Apart from that, I basically agree with the ideas and concerns that have been expressed."
"Mr Dupuis spoke of the effectiveness of the secret services."
"I must admit that I know little about the secret services, since they are secret."
"I suppose that, from that point of view, they certainly are effective."
"I would simply appeal for more regular exchanges of information, deeper integration and closer coordination."
"I think others will agree with me on this point."
"I also replied to Mr Dupuis on the question of the risk of encouraging State terrorism or, at any rate, concealing certain facts about certain countries."
"I also agree that we must not abandon our action; we must persevere and continue trying to persuade certain countries to move towards democracy."
"We must not conceal that aspect or pretend the problem no longer exists in certain Arab countries."
"We must nevertheless continue to bring it up."
"I, personally, am convinced that we must strengthen political dialogue wherever we can, a political dialogue without taboos."
"I think it is quite possible to impose that dialogue in our relations."
"It is a minimum condition and, during my visit to Iran, for example, we agreed to set up a European Union-Iran group, which would have human rights questions as the only item on its agenda. This was accepted."
"We definitely need to take more initiatives of this kind."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I believe I have answered as fully as possible although I may well have omitted some aspects."
"Let me say, however, that, in general, I broadly share the concerns you expressed."
"I heard them clearly. In any case, I undertake to pass them on to the quarters concerned."
"I will do my utmost to transmit faithfully the information, ideas, criticisms and suggestions Parliament has offered me today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 21 September initiated the forthcoming review of our fundamental concepts."
"Since 9 November 1989 Europe has known that the cold war is over; but since 11 September 2001 the world has known that this cold war is over and it is now time to form global alliances against terrorism."
"Today the right to speak will go to those who can demonstrate their full solidarity with the United States and commit themselves unreservedly to this fight against terrorism."
"But that also means forbidding any sideslipping within our own ranks, for neither obscurantism nor fanaticism are permissible weapons in the fight against terrorism."
"We will also have to inquire into the root causes."
"The European Union knows that not all acts of terrorism are the consequence of poverty, but frustration and humiliation do feed terrorism."
"We must, therefore, review our development policy again."
"We must cancel the developing countries' debt."
"We must resume our work on light arms trafficking."
"We must urge everybody to play their part in the multilateral structures."
"Within our institutions, we must give ourselves the means to prevent all forms of conflict, for they are also a source of tension."
"I do not believe this is the moment to drop one of Parliament's initiatives, namely the prevention centre, which we are now told may be under threat."
"The European Council showed that it was able to draw the consequences of the fight that lies ahead."
"To mention only a few issues, let us turn first to the question of the financing of terrorism."
"Yes, the Union put itself in a position where it could fight the Talibans' money and freeze their assets, thanks to the regulation of 4 July 2001."
"Some European countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, have already frozen these assets."
"Yesterday the Commission proposed a new initiative."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us on what basis the Commission envisages the revision of that annex."
"It is an important question because this is the first time Parliament has been consulted on measures of this kind."
"Then there is the fight against money laundering, the fight against tax havens; we will have to give new impetus to all these tasks on which the European Union has embarked."
"These upheavals have come at a moment when the European Union is entering the final stage of its transition to the euro, when it is engaged in vital projects: enlargement, but also the definition of a genuine common foreign and security policy, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"These projects will be given a strong boost, circumstances will sweep away any hesitation, force us to be resolute."
"But if we are to be able to seize this opportunity for Europe, Ghent will have to live up to our high expectations."
"I can tell the Council representative that while we welcome the adoption of a convention, Parliament will not support a system of options."
"On the other hand, Parliament will certainly support the Council when it comes to broadening the agenda of that convention, to asking useful questions, for instance whether we need to maintain the pillar structure."
"What kind of presidency will the Union have?"
"Mr President, it is only natural that the issue of the fight against terrorism should be given a certain amount of attention in Ghent."
"The European Union has acted with impressive unity and decisiveness."
"We can look forward to a long-term battle on several fronts, including the political and the legal fronts, with a sensitive balance regarding respect for legal rights."
"In terms of the long view politically and economically, we may also be able to establish a better legal system with a stronger UN."
"It is gratifying that the US has realised the importance of the UN and is paying its debts to that organisation."
"Perhaps the EU can also get the US to ratify the protocol on the International Criminal Court."
"Of course, we must also work in the long term to achieve peace and democracy throughout the Middle East."
"In Ghent, enlargement will also be discussed."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes it is vital that each country be assessed on its own merits and that the principle of differentiation be genuinely upheld."
"That is a message I should like to send to the presidency."
"Finally, when it comes to the Convention, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the concrete explanations."
"However, there is still a certain amount of concern in this area."
"The Convention is not a debating club for talking in rather general terms about various alternatives regarding the future of Europe."
"The Convention is not an alibi for the Council, but a serious and democratic partner in this discussion."
"Regardless of its composition - I hope that the candidate countries will be given a strong role to play in this context - the Convention will contain a large number of hard-working parliamentarians who need to know that the work that is put in is taken very seriously."
"Mr President, war is not the answer."
"Our message of suffering for the victims should not turn into a war cry."
"These were the main signals sent out by the thousands of American demonstrators who took to the streets of Washington last Saturday."
"On our side of the Atlantic, tens of thousands of demonstrators in Athens, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Barcelona, Stockholm, Istanbul and elsewhere raised their voices in protest against the warmongering plans of the American and European imperialists."
"What has happened is that those who systematically engage in state terrorism, those who made the Bin Ladens and the KLA what they are, those who turned whole nations into terrorists have found a golden opportunity, following the hideous terrorist attack in the USA, to settle their accounts with anyone and everyone who opposes their world dominion."
"At the same time, in the countries of the European Union and the United States, suppressive policing measures have been stepped up in order to gag anyone who stands up against or questions their anti-grass roots policy."
"The President of the United States said that the war against 'terrorism' will last a long time. The resistance of peace-loving grass-roots forces will be equally long-lasting."
"We are certain that the justice of peace will prevail against the barbarism of imperialist war."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I fully support the conclusions of the extraordinary European Summit in Brussels, I can only condemn the amount of time it is taking Europe to make a practical response to terrorism top priority."
"It took thousands of deaths for us to be able to come to an agreement on establishing the European search and arrest warrant; it took thousands of innocent victims for us to be able to agree on defining a common strategy to combat terrorism."
"Only now is the Union being called upon to participate more actively in the prevention and stabilisation of regional conflicts."
"Where was Europe - we wonder - when the Mediterranean sea was seen as the border between two opposing worlds, between Islamic fundamentalism and religious tolerance?"
"Will the Union please realise, at last, that we can only define a European security and defence policy if we take the Mediterranean as our starting point."
"I live on the farthest edge of European territory in the Mediterranean, just a few metres away from the most advanced NATO base - the Sigonella base - and a few minutes away from the Middle East by 'plane."
"I know how willing the moderate Arab and Muslim world is to cooperate;"
"I met the mayor of Jerusalem and the mayor of Gaza last year."
"Well then, I am convinced that it is now up to Europe genuinely to start to turn what have hitherto just been good intentions into practical action."
"There are quite a few worrying messages from the Brussels Summit."
"First of all, it is glaringly obvious that the summit reflects a shockingly small degree of self-knowledge, which also characterises the United States' s government."
"There is no understanding of the fact that there is a political background to the horrific massacres on 11 September."
"In keeping with this small degree of self-knowledge, at odds with the insights of international conflict researchers, alliances for combating terrorism are being entered into with the world' s most effective State-authorised terrorists."
"Russian genocide in Chechnya is being legitimised, and alliances entered into with oligarchies in Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, not to mention Saudi Arabia."
"Any intervention is legitimised in this way and, at the same time, attempts at international conflict resolution under the UN system, including the international administration of justice, are being set aside."
"Moreover, the adoption of new police measures is tailored to the same pattern and based on the same low level of self-knowledge."
"It is the end that justifies the means."
"In this case, the means will deprive us of the very democracies we are supposed to be defending."
"I believe it will subsequently be possible to say, 'The operation was a success, but the patient died.'"
"Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, I hope that the terrorist atrocity on 11 September had the same effect on the Council, that is to say the Interior and Justice Ministers, as it did on the Heads of State and Government, namely that of shaking them awake and bringing it home to them that national resentments and animosities have no place in the fight against terrorism."
"I see these resolutions overall in a positive light."
"We must, though, be able to expect a rapid start to be made on putting them into effect."
"I also expect the Union at last to embrace the possibilities already open to it; that the Member States will at last comply with their obligations and supply the necessary information to Europol in The Hague; and that the counter-terrorist Conventions will at last be brought into force."
"I also look forward to Europol being supplied with the personnel and technology it needs to its at last being put in a position to carry out an investigation into the state of terrorist networks in Europe and to a joint investigation team soon being set up."
"What I look for from the Summit is that new projects will be called into being, such as intensive cooperation between Europol and the United States security services and the networking of police databases, ranging from Europol to Schengen via Olaf, so that these might be used against terrorism; that Eurojust should become the reality to which Mr Poettering has just referred, working closely with Europol; and that Europol should be developed in the direction of the first pillar, with authority to conduct investigations; and that the intergovernmental level should be abandoned in favour of the European in closely circumscribed areas of organised crime."
"In other words, to take this cooperation in security policy as an example, Europe has a great opportunity to bring the added value of the European Union home to its citizens."
"Let us make use of this opportunity without delay!"
"Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September have shown, once again, how wide the gap is between the Europe that is and the Europe that ought to be."
"The shock we felt at the inconceivable level of violence reached by terrorism must now give way to a practical endeavour to provide Europe with the political and institutional tools it needs to play a role combating terrorism and working towards peace and justice in the world."
"We therefore welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council of 21 September in the field of judicial cooperation and home affairs and on combating money laundering."
"Against this tragic backdrop, the decision of the Italian government and the majority supporting it to make changes to the judicial cooperation treaty with Switzerland appears even more serious and irresponsible, changes to its own code of criminal procedure which are in direct conflict with the commitments made at the extraordinary Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"This law would mean that evidence gathered abroad could not be used in court proceedings and that, since this measure applies retrospectively, it would jeopardise hundreds of trials which are currently in progress, nullifying evidence already established."
"It is this kind of decision which made the Public Prosecutor of Geneva say that this law is a disaster for international justice and that, in twelve years of judicial cooperation with countries throughout the world, he has never, ever seen rules like this adopted."
"Since I feel that this is not the right place to express an opinion, I call upon the Commission, the Council and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to ascertain whether this measure is in line with the decisions of the extraordinary Summit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, stated before the United Nations General Assembly, the terrorist attack of 11 September was an attack on the very ideal of free, inclusive, civilised society and on its practice of openness and tolerance."
"The attack will be unsuccessful only if we are able to enhance these characteristics rather than weaken them."
"Our initial response, our initial reaction must be to switch off the psychological 'emergency' mode and get a grip on our agenda."
"Therefore, I welcome the commitment to be made at Ghent to proceed with the debates on the euro, enlargement and the political integration of Europe at Laeken and through the Convention."
"It is in this sense that the fight against terrorism must be seen as part of a series of structural operations."
"In the area of air safety, for example, we must proceed on two levels: on the one hand, there is an urgent need for a revision of the Regulation establishing the European Air Safety Authority, extending its responsibilities to include accident prevention and - if we can call it that - terrorism prevention; on the other, we need incisive action from the International Civil Aviation Organisation to ensure that the rules we are seeking to adopt for Europe become rules which are binding upon the whole world."
"Europe must be capable of taking the initiative in this and many other minor areas to express all that potential for peace and democracy which is its strength and must become the strength of the whole world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we Europeans should be clear in our own minds that we are going to be weighed in the balance in the times that lie ahead."
"The United States of America and world public opinion will be looking to see whether we demonstrate our solidarity and our capacity to act in the face of the new challenges of international terrorism which have just become visible."
"European effectiveness has hitherto often fallen at the hurdle of national sovereignty."
"Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty."
"Now, national sovereignty is not an objective in itself, and certainly not if it tends to hinder rather than promote the defence of national independence against terrorists and the effective protection of citizens against terrorist attacks."
"It is for that reason that the future will see us having to develop effective Community instruments and examining whether national sovereignty helps or hinders us in doing so."
"Solidarity with the United States is a principle invoked on every side, and this is right and proper, as this attack has been not only on the United States but also on our fundamental values, as was intended."
"That is why it is so perilous for a member of the Commission, namely Mr Nielson, to abandon Europeans' solidarity as a community."
"His remarks are dangerous because they blur responsibility for the terrorist action, transfer the guilt for it onto the victims, and pour scorn on the solidarity we affirm in the resolution on which we are voting."
"These remarks, then, must be withdrawn."
"We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them."
"Mr President, it was as if Europe was drowsing."
"Its one dream seemed to be comfort and peace."
"Suddenly the shock of the brutal terrorist attacks in New York profoundly shook its confidence and its hedonism."
"Europe suddenly felt vulnerable and unprepared."
"After all, its hard-won fundamental freedoms were being threatened by mysterious terrorist networks, which nonetheless appeared to be dominated by Islamist religious proselytism."
"This violent and anti-modernist proselytism is anti-Western by definition."
"However, this does not authorise cultural cretinism and historic ignorance leading to an abusive fusion between Islam and the aberrant, irrational and sectarian assertions of the perpetrators of the attacks."
"It was not only the United States, the target of these sinister attacks, which was put to the test."
"Europe was also put to the test and the European Union has to do some deep soul-searching."
"In the immediate aftermath, still in shock, the European Union proved equal to the occasion at the Brussels Summit."
"It was fast, clear and precise in its emergency responses."
"But, now what?"
"Europe cannot in future act in such a spontaneous, opportunistic and superficial way."
"Europe cannot be a plaything of destiny, a destiny plotted by others."
"What has been established in Ghent and Laeken is that Europe should completely rethink its project and its role in light of the new world order and adopt a clear guideline for the troubled times ahead."
"Without becoming unduly pessimistic about the human condition, Europe must be less ingenuous in the face of the dangers that will arise in the future."
"Europe must unite more strongly on the economic level, the political level, the military level and in its internal security."
"That is obvious."
"But how is it to do so?"
"What are its priorities beyond fighting relentlessly against terrorism?"
"What are the new aims of the European project?"
"Will enlargement continue to take place on the same terms?"
"Will it not be necessary, from now on, to speed up the accession of, for example, Turkey to the European Union?"
"Will it not be the most elementary common sense to give absolute priority to the strategy for the Mediterranean and provide new impetus to partnerships with the Muslim countries?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that we support the anti-terrorist measures announced by the presidency, both these measures and any others needed, goes without saying."
"We stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the global coalition against terrorism, although we have little advice to offer about the technical, policing or military measures which will need to be applied."
"What we can do, however, is to speak with perhaps greater authority about the political preconditions to success."
"No campaign of this sort and no war, at least no war in which democracies have taken part, has ever been able to create the necessary alliance of nations - because that is the alliance which counts, not the alliance of governments - without offering a vision of a better world at the end of the campaign."
"Politically, we need to point out yet again that we support all the democratic regimes and, more to the point, that we reject any tyrannical regimes which may promise to help fight specific terrorist organisations but which, in the long term, work with secret services which collaborate with them like terrorist recruiting offices."
"Socially, we need to recognise that environmental catastrophes, epidemics, poverty and misery threaten the security of the world and need to be dealt with as threats which are every bit as serious as terrorism."
"We need to state that, in a globalised society, our wealth and our military power do not offer the man in the street any security."
"The only realistic solution is to find ways of taking the tension out of social and ethnic fights, of reconciling all men of good faith, irrespective of nationality, religion, social position or ideology, in fact everyone who is determined to put an end to the scourges which inflict mankind and which, even if they do not result in terrorism, prepare the ground for terrorism and we need to remove this ground if we are to guarantee the security of our citizens."
"Mr President, a great Italian writer, Oriana Fallaci, breaking years of voluntary silence, has written a major article seeking to stir the consciences of many Europeans involved in the fight against terrorism and to promote the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance throughout the world."
"At a time when fresh threats are being made to American targets in Italy, it is the European Union' s duty to take the lead in defending these values, which apply to all citizens."
"That is why, while I support the decisions taken by the Council at Brussels, I feel that it is vital that, as we implement the inevitable specific military initiatives, we must step up political and economic initiatives as well."
"In any case, I cannot remain silent regarding a controversial point raised in this Chamber: Mrs Napoletano' s call for the Italian Parliament to be monitored by the Council is irrelevant and devoid of any legal basis."
"I would remind Mrs Napoletano and Mr Barón Crespo that the Italian Parliament is sovereign, like all the parliaments in consolidated democracies."
"The statements of the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are, as far as we are concerned, extremely serious and unacceptable, for they amount to interference in the internal affairs of a Member State of the European Union."
"And before making pronouncements on legislative affairs such as international letters rogatory, with which he is clearly unfamiliar, I would suggest that he read Article 3 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed right here in Strasbourg, where he will find answers to his unfounded concerns: I would advise Mrs Napoletano, who also is clearly unfamiliar with this provision, to read it as well."
"It would, in any case, be appropriate for the Chairman of a Parliamentary Group, and also for those holding positions of responsibility in the European institutions - I refer to the absent Mr Michel - not to make statements either of approval or condemnation in this Chamber on the internal affairs of a Member State."
"Rather, we would like to hear what action the Belgian government intends to adopt, at last, to ensure the safety of the thousands of people who work within the European Parliament in Brussels, especially the staff based permanently on that site."
"Declarations of intent must be followed by practical action."
"Mr President, the conclusion and the action plan of the extraordinary Council offer a solid basis for a focused, measured, coordinated response to the attacks of 11 September."
"The following are examples of the proposals which receive my full support: developing international judicial instruments, freezing the funding of terrorist networks and exchanging intelligence in conjunction with the US by setting up an anti-terrorist unit within Europol."
"We are also pleased that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have spoken with one voice over the past three weeks, embarrassing slips by Commissioner Bolkestein and Prime Minister Berlusconi apart."
"This suggests that European cooperation, both internally and externally, is growing up fast."
"The weapon of new terrorism is fear and disruption, and hunger for power."
"An effective line of attack protecting the international rule of law must spring from a worldwide coalition against terrorism under the aegis of the UN and on the basis of UN resolutions."
"Provided that that coalition is based on international rule of law principles and not, as was the case in the past with the Taliban, by financing future enemies, for that is misguided Realpolitik."
"I support a worldwide dignified response, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, proportional across the legal, political, diplomatic, financial, military and economic fields, whereby an appeal is made for extreme caution with regard to innocent lives."
"Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the long-term perspective, particularly now."
"Let there be no doubt about this: the direct causes of terrorism do not lie in creed or poverty."
"For example, the World Bank expects that, as a result of the terrorist attacks, economic growth in the developing countries will drop from 5% to 2%."
"The expected effects are enormous, with ten million additional people under the poverty line and between twenty to forty thousand more children under the age of five who will die."
"If we fail to formulate adequate responses in the face of this harsh reality, we in Europe will be applying double standards."
"Investing in worldwide security means taking safety measures, but it also calls for international solidarity, which is a basis for international cooperation and, along with this, a basis for the worldwide coalition against terrorism."
"Mr President, terrorism is a scourge attacking and afflicting our societies."
"It resorts to violence and terror in an effort to impose its views by force. At the same time it attacks the very core of democratic systems, namely our system of individual and collective freedoms."
"Terrorists are aware that our democratic societies are more open and consequently more vulnerable. They therefore resort to the advantages offered by globalisation."
"It follows that the response to the terrorist phenomenon must likewise be a response at global level."
"In this connection, I should like to congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on convening the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels and on placing terrorism on the agenda for the next Council."
"I think congratulations are also due to the European Commission on the initiatives it has proposed."
"On the basis that there is no good terrorism as against bad terrorism, I believe that terrorists the world over need to be aware that there will be international resistance to put an end to this scourge."
"I also feel that it is important for us all to appreciate that the existing balance between an individual' s right to safety and the principles of legality and individual freedom which underpin our system of values cannot be altered. It is very important for us to understand that the horrendous attacks perpetrated on 11 September must not result in the eventual dilution of the culture of freedom in democratic countries."
"Mr President, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of terrorism."
"I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism, but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty, exploitation and oppression."
"The battle against terrorism is above all a battle of values and a battle of ideas."
"We will not defeat terrorism, whether it be national terrorism, whether it be driven by fundamentalism of any kind, unless we do battle with the ideas that underpin that terror."
"We have to recall again that no country has ever been defeated by terrorism and I am certainly confident that the terrorism which we now face on an international scale does not have that capacity unless we allow it by failing to grapple with the ideas underlying it."
"This is not an argument for business as usual."
"It is an argument for avoiding the trap set for us by terrorism."
"We have to be careful also not to fall into the trap of seeing Muslims as an enemy."
"The statements by our European leaders and President Prodi are very much welcome in this regard."
"I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi."
"It is a disgrace that a country of the European Union is led by a man who can present these ideas in this day and age, particularly when the country is Italy, which in my view has always led in terms of modern ideas."
"I would add my voice to others' condemnations."
"The question is how do we respond?"
"The very best response, apart from the obvious security measures that we have to take, is to defend our ideas of freedom, of democracy, of justice and of ending exploitation."
"This European Union has a key role to play on the European stage in leading that battle and not falling into line behind those who only see security as an answer to this appalling problem."
"Mr President, so much has now been said and written about the tragedy, the crime of 11 September."
"I will, therefore, confine myself to three issues: terrorism, Europe and the world."
"Yes, we must resolutely declare war on all forms of terrorism, from wherever it comes, the IRA, ETA, the assassins of Claude Erignac, Prefect of Corsica, Osama Bin Laden and his clique and all the others, but without making the stupid and suicidal mistake of lumping them all together."
"Our capacity to take in terrorists is now beyond the limit; it is probable that the insane attacks of 11 September were prepared in Europe."
"So, let us spring to action and pool our resources, our activities, our objectives in the field of intelligence, justice, security and defence and let us be implacable towards the terrorists, their networks, their support structures, their dirty money."
"Yes, the Commissioner was quite right to refer to the obligation to get results!"
"Solidarity with our friends, our American allies, does not imply mindless alignment."
"With its tried and tested experience of the world, Europe can and must play a specific role here."
"Others place hope in us, await us, call on us, alas, too often without response."
"Let us not disappoint them any longer."
"In the Middle East, a constant source of tension, the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states - Israel and Palestine - with absolute security guarantees for both."
"Even the Americans are, for the first time, considering this obvious arrangement."
"It is up to us to initiate the process of opening the doors."
"Let us finally realise that the post-Yalta organisation of the world needs to be rethought to take account of the incredible developments since the last war: the emergence of nuclear powers, whether official or not, the fall of the Berlin wall, more than a billion Muslims around the world desperately seeking recognition and respect, new giants like India, limitless technological developments in every field, developments that are accessible only to the few, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor."
"Let us finally take account of these positive or disturbing trends and organise a world in which each individual is recognised, respected rather than despised, involved rather than ignored."
"There is a burning need to fulfil that obligation."
"Mr President, following the attacks on 11 September, it is incumbent upon us to come up with a response appropriate to this tremendous challenge, to ensure justice is done and to prevent further attacks."
"Europe' s response must amount to more than the solidarity called for earlier in the House. It must be an active response, defending specific values."
"I am not referring, as Mr Berlusconi might, to Western values or to Christian civilisation. I have in mind genuine democratic values."
"Where it does not, they must be established and nurtured. Success can only be guaranteed through long-term support by the governments committed to this fight."
"In the face of the serious threat to humanity terrorism represents, we are called upon to take action and to get it right."
"We must abide by the rules when taking action against those who have no rules. We have to get it right, but getting it right cannot in this context mean taking spectacular action."
"Getting it right has to mean identifying those responsible and dealing with the key figures."
"It involves destroying their networks and preventing them from organising new ones. All this takes time, and calls for cooperation between judges and police at international level, together with mutual political trust between governments."
"It will be a long and difficult process but believe me, it is the only way to defend democracy from fanaticism and barbarism."
"A genuine common foreign security and defence policy for the European Union is called for."
"The Union also needs a common approach to legal and home affairs. The European search and arrest warrant will be an essential element of this but by no means the only one."
"No European leader should jeopardise the joint response, as Mr Berlusconi' s government has just done. The legislation it has recently endorsed is diametrically opposed to the approach adopted by this House."
"What action will the Council take to ensure that it speaks with one voice, as Mr Michel was saying this morning? Also, how does it intend to deal with that thorn in its flesh, namely the Berlusconi doctrine?"
"Mr President, in light of the seriousness of the terrorist attack of 11 September, there are several important questions to be discussed and clarified, relating to our intention to resolutely fight terrorism."
"The first question is the need to find effective means to combat terrorism, which do not necessarily entail legislative reform on matters of security."
"It is worth recalling clearly that it is not effective, and never has been in democracy, to curtail freedoms in order to fight the enemies of democracy itself."
"Indeed, we think the problem lies elsewhere."
"It is not only the lack of legislation at national or European level, or the lack of coordinated policing at international level."
"The problem has much to do both with hesitancy and weakness in the fight against terrorism, which manifest themselves in laxity towards activities of a terrorist nature, in the hope that terrorist acts would always be carried out in the country next door, or in the slow deterioration of methods of defence and security, police forces, information services and armed forces."
"European governments which thought that wars had ended once and for all and which often cut the financial resources available for defence and safety cannot, of course, talk loudly about terrorism."
"The second question concerns political awareness of the times in which we live."
"If we denounce what happened in New York and Washington merely as a criminal act, we will from the start be limiting the scope, the meaning and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism."
"What happened is in reality an act of war, no doubt of a war different to previous wars but, unfortunately, all wars are different to previous wars."
"They are usually more deadly, affecting more civilians and not hesitating to use any means to massacre. They are increasingly total wars."
"To classify what happened as an act of war is not a mere question of semantics."
"It has had major implications, starting with the right of the nation or nations affected to respond with military actions, if necessary, in relation to the country or countries shown to be responsible for supporting or carrying out terrorist acts."
"At present this is a basic condition for effectively fighting terrorism, which cannot attain the magnitude of the attack of 11 September without the support of one or more States."
"Unfortunately, there has been little discussion on this subject, but it is necessary to know the position of the Council, Parliament and the Commission concerning the need for military intervention against States which perpetrate or support terrorist acts."
"Mr President, we all understand how fragile our society is when civil aircraft with people on their way to meet others are turned into bombs targeting citizens of the world in the metropolis of New York, a city in which people, at the start of their working day in the service industry or finance, become innocent victims of fanaticism and fiendishly well-organised terrorism which will stop at nothing to vent its hatred of the open, civilised and diverse society in which we live."
"At the same time, however, all democrats throughout the world have realised that this open society is worth defending and that we have to work together to combat terrorism and lack of freedom."
"US President George W. Bush has therefore, to his credit, been successful in creating global coalitions for freedom."
"The UN, NATO and the EU have acted vigorously in this common struggle."
"The common will in the European Union must manifest the ideals of the open society."
"Let us not panic and introduce legislation which eliminates the principles of a state governed by law."
"Do not let the protection of human rights be seen as incompatible with the fight against terrorism."
"Do not let the prevailing mood be exploited for the purpose of closing borders or increasing prejudices between people."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, make sure that Ghent is used to strengthen the EU' s ability to promote the open society."
"Trade is increasing links and understanding between the people of Europe and the rest of the world."
"It is therefore disgraceful that certain countries in the EU are at present outside the common currency, which is one of our best tools for increasing partnership."
"It is therefore also foolhardy of the Belgian Presidency to play the anti-globalisation game by bringing up the Tobin Tax, which would directly counteract economic recovery and increased trade."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe' s best long-term contribution to a more open, freer and safer world will be in terms of obtaining concrete results now on the reuniting of Western and Eastern Europe through enlargement."
"You must not only handle an emergency and increasingly clear threats, but you must also fulfil the EU' s most important and historic task."
"I wish you the best of luck in Ghent."
"Mr President, I believe it to be clear in the aftermath of this terrorist attack that we need a far more integrated policy, not only as regards its European scope but also in respect of its content."
"We must combine foreign and home affairs policy so as to take into account the worldwide nature of the enemy and their presence in our towns and cities."
"Mrs Carlsson is quite right; we must not do it at the expense of abandoning the liberal state under the rule of law."
"Another issue is that of how the causes of terrorism around the world are to be fought."
"We know very well that none of these three aspects can any longer be coped with by the Nation State. Rather, it is only as a European community that we can get to grips with them and, to some extent, only together with the Atlantic Alliance and with our friends in North America."
"I believe that we cannot be content with mere slogans, but, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that we must, through the post-Nice process and by pressing on, in Ghent and Laeken, with enlargement and so extending the zone of stability, create the practicalities, instruments and preconditions for, in time, casting what would have been mere slogans into durable forms enabling us to comply with these requirements."
"It is for this reason that the preparation for Laeken, with a rationally conceived Convention, is of such decisive significance."
"We must see clearly that in these fields too, technology is extraordinarily important."
"We must ensure - and I am sure that you will take the right direction in your role as Belgian Presidency - a Convention that is workable and represents the necessary legitimisation, on the basis of which to present to the Heads of State and Government a document that will facilitate the really great reform of the European Union over and above the agenda laid down in Nice."
"Please permit me a final word to the chairman of the PSE Group."
"There is a difference between a person who is a Prime Minister and one who, like Mr Nielson, is a Commissioner and thereby subject to the European Parliament's immediate right of control."
"If someone is directly subject to the European Parliament, it must be possible to express clear criticism of him here in this House and to call him to account if he talks nonsense, as he has done."
"I have to tell you that the situation in Afghanistan, especially for the Afghan refugees, is tragic."
"If we close our eyes and think of the impact this situation will have on millions of people, we, as the European Union, should really take action."
"I believe it is of the utmost importance for the Council too - and I am addressing Mrs Neyts at this point - together with Parliament, to consider the question as to what we can do to make more resources available."
"Mr President, if our humanitarian aid efforts do not run smoothly, we will create a new breeding ground for the Bin Ladens of this world. It is therefore crucial to get it right."
"I would like to denounce the statements made by Commissioner Bolkestein."
"It is now the umpteenth time that he has acted beyond his remit."
"He makes statements and gives an analysis in the Volkskrant of 29 September in which he says that the Arab world is indignant and feels weak vis-à-vis the West, partly as a result of the Gulf War. But they are quite welcome to supply oil, he says."
"Mr President, this analysis is not shared by Mr Patten."
"Mr Bolkestein goes on to say that the EU' s asylum policy is not coming off the ground."
"In my opinion, that is a direct attack on Mr Vitorino' s policy."
"I would like to ask Mr Barnier to consult the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, on the matter of Mr Bolkestein adhering to his remit, being the internal market."
"We cannot end up in a situation where the Commission as a whole would ultimately be harmed because it is judged on statements by Mr Bolkestein."
"That is inopportune under these circumstances."
"I think it is useful and necessary for the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Mr Bolkestein to hold a discussion, with a view to the latter concentrating on his own task."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I fully share the sentiments of Mr Van Velzen concerning Mr Bolkestein."
"As far as the debate on terrorism is concerned, I share the views of Messrs Van den Berg, De Rossa and others who have recommended a broader approach."
"But since I was absent during the last debate, I would like to come back to it."
"Following on from the debate on terrorism, I would like to add that we in Europe too must prevent grounds for frustration from developing or continuing to exist."
"This is also relevant to enlargement."
"Commissioner, it is vital for the political criteria of democracy, human rights and rights of minorities to be just as much respected as the quantitative aspects of enlargement."
"With enlargement will come a number of small countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States."
"We therefore wonder what, in future, the place and rights of the constitutional regions will be, some of which see themselves as nations equivalent to others that have their own state."
"They must be given their place."
"Not only Flanders, but also Scotland, Wales, the Basque Country, Galicia and others spring to mind."
"I am thinking of all those constitutional regions which might feel obliged to apply for Member State status, simply because Member States are the only States acknowledged within Europe."
"In other words, if we fail in a future debate to give regions and nations a place in Europe, we in fact further separatism. That is not what I want."
"I would like regions to be able to help build a federal Europe, a federal Europe that is often curbed by the Member States themselves."
"I would therefore urge you to include a paragraph on regions."
"Mr President, at the close of this debate let me thank all the speakers, although I will not be able to reply to each one individually in the few minutes that remain."
"Let me say, on behalf of the Commission, that I was touched by the support several of you gave to the work we are doing during these difficult and serious times, side by side with the Council and the European Parliament."
"Turning to the most important issue, which almost all speakers addressed, the fight against terrorism, let me remind you of the spirit in which we are undertaking it."
"We, and in particular my colleague and friend Mr Vitorino, take account in our activities of the important work done by Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs under its chairman Mr Watson."
"In fact we were working with that committee this morning on the final text submitted to you on freezing the assets of organisations linked to terrorism."
"At this point, I can confirm that the Commission, like the Council, is prepared to take on board any suggestions or proposals from Parliament where at all possible."
"To echo Mr Poettering's concern, let me repeat what I said in my statement this morning about the fight against terrorism."
"That fight certainly involves all the states; in no case can it be reduced to some kind of conflict between the different civilisations of the world."
"As Mrs Béres and Mr Salafranca said, we must build a global alliance and wage a global fight against terrorism."
"Let me also point out - in response to a number of speakers, Mr Lannoye, Mr Michel and Mr Di Lello - that we are most concerned during our activities with steering the best possible course between the need for freedom and the need for security."
"Perhaps, as Mr Michel advised, it would be a good idea to carry out regular, careful evaluations to ensure that we remain on course."
"I listened carefully to the recommendations of several Members, in particular Mr Collins, who called for determined and vigorous measures;"
"I also noted the encouragement offered by Mr Berthu, calling on us to continue to work towards an objective that has clearly emerged since Amsterdam and since Tampere: a common judicial area, with the necessary cooperation between Member States and between all the services - and let me say to Mr Dupuis that I certainly mean all the services - and the necessary harmonisation or communitarisation in some areas."
"Nor am I forgetting, just as you must not forget, that in Amsterdam and Tampere we also looked at ways of tackling illegal immigration."
"Finally, on terrorism, as part of our collective action, we, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must implement our common foreign policy by establishing a political dialogue, by preventing and stabilising all the regional conflicts, by giving marked support to development."
"A number of you discussed this in relation to long-term action."
"I am thinking here of Mr McMillan-Scott and Mr van Velzen."
"And then, of course, in the shorter term, there are the support and cooperation measures to help the refugees."
"Overall, looking at this serious challenge of fighting terrorism, let me emphasise what Mr Klaus Hänsch and, in a sense, Mr Nassauer said a moment ago."
"We are facing a moment of truth and it is likely that the European Union will emerge stronger from this crisis in terms of the values and rationale of the European project."
"As I said myself, it is also likely that we will have to step up the pace and find additional reasons for taking this European project further."
"Ladies and gentlemen, even if it is difficult to explain this to you at this time of the day and with all this hubbub, I believe there is a link between, on the one hand, the political lessons we have to learn from this crisis and from the tragedy of New York and Washington, which tell us to speed up, to intensify, to prove once again the value of European integration and, on the other hand, that broad debate that began after Nice and is due to conclude in 2002."
"There is a link with the activities the convention will have to undertake. Speaking of that convention..."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is appalling that Commissioner Barnier should be forced to end the debate on terrorism under these conditions."
"It is a matter of responsible behaviour and manners. I therefore invite you all to take your seats and listen quietly."
"I am sorry to be so harsh but this behaviour is truly unacceptable."
"Mr President, unfortunately it was not I who chose the moment for my replies."
"I have tried to be as precise as possible and to keep to the speaking time."
"I will come to a close soon."
"Nonetheless, turning to that convention, may I, following on from Mr Michel, establish that there is a link between the political debate that is beginning and the new dimension, the new gravity it has acquired as a result of the lessons we have learned from these tragic attacks."
"I believe that the candidate countries must be given a place, the best possible place in this convention."
"I believe the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions must be given a place as active observers."
"I believe, as Mr Belder also suggested, that we must work as quickly as possible to bring this convention and the IGC that will conclude it to a close no later than the beginning of the year 2004."
"I believe we will have to find a structured link between the citizens' forum with civil society and the activities of the convention."
"Lastly, I believe that this convention must not confine itself to setting out the options but must be authorised or take it upon itself to make proposals."
"Finally, addressing Mr Bonde, I do not share his fear about the convention."
"I do not see why he should have any fears about its activities."
"We have to learn from earlier weaknesses or failures."
"I am speaking of the weaknesses of the intergovernmental method; indeed we saw its limitations before Amsterdam and before Nice."
"We are fortunate to have time between now and 2004."
"We are also fortunate to be able to work more openly with the four institutions, the four sources of legitimacy, in order to make the future Intergovernmental Conference a success."
"So I believe that through that convention, the Ghent Summit, followed by the Laeken Summit, will confirm both our political ambition and our use of more transparent methods."
"I apologise once again, Commissioner, for the conditions under which you were forced to speak."
"Mr President, I think we should apologise to Commissioner Barnier, because it is intolerable, when we are discussing such grave matters, to see our Parliament not conducting itself in a courteous manner or listening to a particularly important statement."
"I profoundly regret this and I would appeal to my colleagues' sense of responsibility."
"The same has happened under other circumstances."
"When we are holding such a weighty, such a serious debate, I think at the very least Members could keep quiet and show respect for the Commissioner by listening to him."
"I believe we have a real problem of dysfunctional behaviour within this Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"It is a question of irresponsible behaviour as well as poor administration."
"Mr President, my card has disappeared."
"I put it here on my seat and when I came back it was gone."
"Someone has taken my card, meaning that I cannot vote."
"Mr Patakis, you will have to go and get another voting card."
"Mr President, the accusations made in this Chamber against the Italian Parliament by certain Members of this House represent an extremely dangerous precedent, in terms of both the democratic nature of this Parliament and the credibility of its decision-making process before the European public."
"A Parliament which becomes a vehicle for accusations and a political campaign against another democratically elected parliament is nothing more than a forum for subversion, political racism and the intentional dissemination of inaccurate information."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, for the whole week we have been unable to hear the original sound out of this system."
"The acoustics in this Chamber are very, very poor."
"This is not a new thing, though."
"To add to that, we have been getting a terrible noise out of the loudspeaker today, which interferes with everything."
"Because of the noise from the loudspeaker, we cannot hear anything."
"Somebody must do something about this sound system."
"I am sure your comment has been heard by all those who need to take action to resolve the issue as well as me."
"I hope that they will do so without delay so that there will be no need for further speeches on the matter tomorrow."
"Announcement by the President"
"The House has been requested to approve an extension of the deadline for the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors."
"The Council submitted the names of the candidates it has proposed for appointment as members of the Court of Auditors in two letters dated 22 and 28 June 2001 respectively. These letters were received on the 27 and 28 June 2001 respectively, that is, just before the summer recess."
"For practical reasons, and to enable both the candidates and the members of the committee responsible to prepare the necessary hearings, the hearings were planned for 11 September and 8/10 October 2001."
"Rule 35(3) provides that the vote in plenary is held within two months of receipt of the nomination, unless Parliament, at the request of the committee responsible, a political group or at least 32 Members, decides otherwise."
"In view of the fact that the debate and vote in plenary are planned for the October II part-session, that is, after the two-month deadline laid down in Rule 35, the committee responsible has submitted a request that the House be asked to approve an extension of this deadline."
"Are there any objections?"
"Then it is decided to postpone the deadline."
"We shall now proceed to the votes."
"VOTE"
"Mr President, this first vote on our order paper today relates to the request from the Commission for urgent procedure on the measure you have outlined."
"In exceptional circumstances, following the attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs met this morning and approved, without report, the proposal submitted to us."
"I understand that we will also receive, following this morning's Coreper meeting, a request from the Council for urgency, to add to that from the Commission."
"It is the recommendation of the committee, which I have the honour to chair, that we accept that amendment."
"If that is approved by the House, I hope you will confirm that would give the political groups until 6 p.m. this evening to submit amendments to this proposed measure."
"Are there any objections?"
"Mr President, I was present at the committee' s meeting this morning, and I would therefore like to add to what the Chairman, Mr Watson, has said."
"There was substantial concern regarding precisely the request for urgency - there were even three votes cast against the motion and three abstentions - because we are being asked to approve an urgent procedure not on the mechanism for identifying money launderers but on a list."
"It is with regard to this fact that we expressed our opposition."
"(Parliament adopted the request for urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, I too should like to protest in the strongest terms against the uproar during Commissioner Barnier's speech and to say that I share Mrs Grossetête's indignation."
"However, this is not the first time this has happened and I should like to propose a practical solution to the problem, because otherwise there is nothing left for us to do but apologise to the Commissioners."
"I think there should be quarter of an hour's break between the end of the debate and the vote."
"Mr Marinos, what you are saying has already been said by Mrs Grossetête."
"There is no need to repeat it."
"If you have a precise, practical suggestion, you should write a letter to the President and it will be considered by the President and the Bureau."
"You cannot bring the matter before the House for we are currently here to vote, not to open a debate on the way the plenary is organised."
"Thank you for your contribution, however. Please would you send your proposal to the President."

"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0298/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment [6760/1/2001 - C5-0246/2001 - 2000/0033(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs McNally)"
"Mr President, I had expected to recommend the House to adopt this draft regulation unamended at second reading."
"That depended, however, on a statement from the Commissioner last night."
"Unfortunately, the statement by Mrs de Palacio was insufficient."
"However, I would now like to ask the Commission again whether it will undertake to bring in measures complementary to this agreement in the first three months of next year."
"This is the only commitment which we will accept as reasonable, otherwise I will ask the House to vote for the amendment and to invoke the conciliation procedure."
"I therefore ask the Commission to clarify its position on supplementary measures."
"In any case, Mrs McNally, I should have asked for the Commission' s opinion on the amendments tabled."
"I therefore now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier."
"Mr President, last night at the close of the debate and on the basis of the supporting studies, Commissioner Bolkestein clearly contradicted those who say that prices rose after the introduction of the Community exhaustion system."
"On the contrary, in some cases they fell."
"Those who pretend they are defending the consumer are in fact protecting the parallel import circuits that pose a threat to quality, innovation and jobs by promoting counterfeits."
"Hence the three amendments I tabled."
"They seem to worry the rapporteur."
"In fact the PPE-DE Group has called for a roll-call vote on all our amendments to check how its members are voting and the undertakings given by certain coordinators."
"I fear that once again pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken."
"Mr Bernié, you requested the floor to tell me whether you are withdrawing the amendments."
"This is not the place for political reasoning or an explanation of vote. Please would you tell me whether you withdraw the amendments or not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drafting European law should concentrate on fundamental issues rather than pointlessly wasting time and energy on details."
"This was written by Mr Prodi in a guest column in the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' on 27 July this year."
"I indeed hear this gospel, but I have no faith!"
"The Miller report is evidence to the contrary, defining things that are self-explanatory."
"It tells us, for example, what a floor is, what is meant by 'behind' and 'in front' and informs us that provision must be made for passages through which two coaxial cylinders must be able to pass."
"The whole thing is actually absurd, but - and here I refer back to the quotation from Romano Prodi - Europe's citizens will rightly ask themselves whether we have nothing more important to occupy us. It was therefore with extreme annoyance that I took part in this brief vote on the Miller report."
"In many spheres, the imagination of regulators is positively inexhaustible."
"Yet there is a lack of real political will where really explosive legal issues are concerned."
"It will not be in that way that we will bring Europe and its citizens closer together."
"The freedom of movement on which this European Union is founded is daily denied to our continent's 37 million disabled citizens."
"There is no more important question in the campaign for comprehensive human rights for disabled people than the pursuit of accessible public transport."
"The directive finally agreed today, is a historic step forward in that campaign."
"It shows that the cost of access for industry is affordable, if only designed-for-all principles are included at the beginning."
"It shows that European regulation really can make a difference in enforcing rights for disabled people."
"Above all, it shows that eleven years of tireless campaigning by the disability movement, by Buses for All in my own country the UK, was absolutely worthwhile, necessary and ultimately victorious."
"Congratulations to all of you."
"I am proud that the European Parliament has helped deliver your demands."
"de Roo report (A5-0296/2001)"
"Mr President, the report by our Green colleague, Alex de Roo, will no doubt mark a milestone in the European Union's environmental legislation."
"Until now, we had an almost total legislative silence about the environmental damage caused by noise."
"Our parliaments lent a deaf ear, although this in no way reflected the real-life experience of the citizens of the Union."
"More than a quarter of them, one hundred million, believe they are the victims of noise and the economic repercussions of this noise in the environment oscillates at between EUR 10 and 40 billion."
"So we can only welcome the pioneering measures set out in this report."
"We do indeed need to introduce noise mapping."
"It is as necessary and salutary as the mapping of dangerous sites, which we now realise, all too late, is a vital measure."
"This information is useful only if it is given to the public quite transparently."
"It is meaningful only if it is constantly updated in terms of geography and choice of indicators."
"Lastly, identifying these noise nuisances will only be useful and effective if it is accompanied by penal and coercive measures against the noise-makers, be they civil, public or military."
"Over and above these practical imperatives, we can really only combat euro-noise today if we do so at European Community level."
"We therefore continue to call for common European standards."
"Noise respects no frontiers; noise penetrates every wall, resounds through every space."
"We therefore urged all our parliamentary colleagues to support this report and we welcome the outcome."
"Noise pollution reaches us in diffuse, sporadic and intangible ways; often it even forms part of our daily environment."
"Noise is not as black as oil, or as acrid as chemical waste; yet it is just as harmful, in condensed form."
"I hope therefore that the demands set out in this report will not be regarded simply as sound and fury but that the European Union will manage to make them resound for a long time."
"- (FR) We voted for all the amendments calling for limits to noise pollution caused by road, rail or air transport or for imposing binding and uniform noise ceilings throughout the European Union."
"At the same time, we reject the arguments about competitiveness put forward by transport firms."
"The crucial factors must be safety and limiting noise levels, not competitiveness."
"We also voted for the amendments fixing shorter deadlines for implementing these measures."
"What is the point of deciding to take measures in the interest of society if the implementing date is put off to a more or less indeterminate future time, to enable special interests to find a way round them?"
"- (FR) We know what an impact noise emissions can have on the daily life and the health of our fellow-citizens."
"But Europe must not come along and act as a kind of noise extinguisher to make up for mistakes in land use planning."
"I am not calling the general objective into question; but if our action is to be effective, it must be pragmatic, like the action we took on air quality."
"It is not up to Europe to introduce unilateral standards and impose them on everybody throughout its territory with no regard for specific local conditions."
"Europe is already intervening in relation to tyres, aircraft engines, road surfaces..."
"It is important for the measures to take account of these territorial disparities."
"Europe must do more to make the Member States aware of their responsibilities here, it must urge the local authorities to take the necessary measures on the basis of the local situation, rather than deciding on their behalf."
"In this case I subscribe to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Let us take airports as an example: it would be ineffective to set uniform noise limits for all airports."
"Conditions vary widely from one airport to another."
"Each airport is unique (runway configuration, distribution of traffic and so forth)."
"The impact of aircraft noise differs from one airport to another and it would make more sense to take measures to reduce noise emissions at national, regional and local levels."
"Moreover, it seems quite incredible to find no distinction drawn between international and regional airports!"
"Nor should we forget that airports are important to the area concerned."
"Air transport infrastructure is a vital factor in industries' choice of where to locate their plant, and therefore vital in terms of jobs too."
"Let me also remind you that the title of the directive is 'Noise evaluation and management'."
"So evaluation comes before management."
"How can one think of fixing limit values without first carrying out a precise, horizontal study, based on agreed, common evaluation criteria?"
"Furthermore, the first stage would be to set up a system for evaluating noise levels in the different Member States and to draw exact noise maps region by region."
"Only when this information is available should Member States be encouraged to formulate an effective action plan, working together with all the local authorities and elected representatives."
". (NL) In densely populated urban areas, the traffic noise and the noise around airports, in particular, is a disaster."
"People' s night rest is increasingly being threatened by continuous noise."
"Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission' s standpoint still harks back to the first half of the twentieth century, a time when cities, traffic and the economy were on a much smaller scale and growth was still welcome."
"That is apparent from, among other things, the fresh attempts to protect the position of airline companies."
"Instead of tackling overcapacity by imposing a tax on fuel, thus removing the competitive edge compared with more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, there is now a renewed attempt to reduce the tax burden for the sake of continued growth in air traffic and airports."
"Mr De Roo is right - also at second reading - to adhere to previous choices made by Parliament with regard to the restriction of night-time pollution, short terms, clear definitions of noise pollution, and daughter directives on noise emissions of lorries, buses, motorcycles, trains and aircraft."
"It is now only the need for a majority of 314 votes to break the opposition that threatens to lead to a long-term stalemate."
"- (FR) I wanted to explain just why I voted for this report as amended."
"Firstly, I believe it adopts a balanced position and takes account of the well-being and health of the citizens who are, indeed, being more and more exposed to noise pollution."
"With regard to the substance, I agree with the Commission's idea of harmonising the noise indicators and the methods of evaluating ambient noise."
"Next, thanks to these common indicators and evaluation methods, it will indeed be possible to compile information on noise exposure, in the form of 'noise maps' without, at least for the moment, fixing noise limit values for the entire European Union."
"Moreover, I wanted to continue excluding military airports from the scope of the framework directive."
"I am glad no amendment calling for their inclusion was tabled at second reading."
"I am also satisfied with the deadline for incorporating the directive into national law (30 June 2003) and for proposing the daughter directives that will ensue (namely three years after the entry into force of the framework directive)."
"However, let me emphasise that the subsidiarity principle must be respected fully and that Member States must have some margin for manoeuvre, based on common indicators and methods, so that they can take account of special factors (different geographical situations, for example) especially in relation to airports."
"Joint resolution on the accident in Toulouse"
"- (FR) While expressing our indignation at the accident at the AZF factory in Toulouse and its terrible consequences, as also our solidarity with the victims and their families, we have not associated ourselves with the joint resolution, to show that we do not condone the hypocrisy of discussing this disaster without implicating the TotalFinaElf trust, the owner of that plant."
"This trust puts profit first, that is, the profits of its shareholders, to the detriment of safety."
"It did not take all the necessary measures to avoid an accident happening or, at any rate, to prevent it having such tragic consequences for the factory workers and the local population."
"Furthermore, we refuse to join in the congratulations addressed to the French authorities."
"These authorities, from the town council to the government, were not able or not willing to take steps to check the AZF factory in Toulouse properly, as is also true of the many other high-risk sites, and to force the TotalFinaElf trust and its ilk to take the essential precautions."
"As for providing 'appropriate aid...to the populations affected', even after the accident, that assistance did not match the scale of the damage."
"The sum of one and a half billion released by the government will cover only a quarter of the damage caused."
"How long will those who have lost their homes and are living in precarious conditions have to wait to be housed?"
"However, quite apart from the fact that this aid is inadequate, the taxpayer was supposed to pay it."
"Why should the taxpayers have to use their money to pay for the damage for which TotalFinaElf is to blame?"
"That company should pay for this in full, including of course the total wages of the workers forced out of work, both at AZF and its subcontractors and in all the local firms that had to shut down."
". (EL) The catastrophe in Toulouse, a tragic accident indeed, should give us an incentive to overhaul the Community directive on highly dangerous installations and ensure that it is applied more strictly."
"We all know that numerous Member States of the EU have not applied the revised 'Seveso' directive, even though they should have been doing so since 1999."
"Even worse, a number of countries are clearly not even applying the original 'Seveso' directive properly."
"I am delighted that our joint resolution calls on the Commission to publish a table, within the next three months, of all the industrial plants in the EU which are highly dangerous and are located in residential areas and which, were an accident to happen, could cause damage on a scale similar to that caused by the accident in Toulouse."
"One such plant, Petrola Hellas plc, is located a stone's throw from the densely populated areas of Elefsina, Aspropyrgo and Mandra and has already applied for planning permission to extend over a 130 hectare plot of land located in the buffer zone between the current Petrola plant and the Pyrkal munitions factory."
"I should also like to point out that, according to witnesses working in the factory in question, the factory operator has not provided the public with the safety report or the emergency plans setting out action to be taken in the event of an accident, as required under the Seveso directive."
"Other factories in the area are guilty of similar practices (no plans, failure to inform local authorities and the public)."
"The usual procedure is to send a very basic file to the ministry and ignore the rest of the provisions of the Seveso directive."
"Just how interested and concerned the Greek authorities are in preventing major disasters and limiting their impact is obvious from the environment Commissioner's reply to my question on the matter."
"The Commissioner replied that he had written to the Greek authorities on 7 June 2000 asking for information on the extension to the Petrola plant but that the Greek authorities had not yet replied to the letter in question."
"- (FR) Following Monday's statement by Mrs Christine de Veyrac, Deputy Mayor of Toulouse, I want to express the sympathy and solidarity of the entire French delegation of the PPE-DE Group towards our compatriots struck by disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse, and, in particular, towards the victims and their families."
"Let me also pay tribute to all those who responded with such extraordinary courage and provided help, medical care and assistance to all the many victims."
"Information to date suggests that this was an accident, although it is too early to be entirely sure."
"If that is indeed the case, we will have to check whether all the necessary safety measures and precautions were taken, given that this factory was classified as presenting a major industrial risk."
"The real question is to find out whether the provisions of the 1982 and 1986 Seveso directives, which provide for all the necessary procedures and all the danger scenarios, are being observed on such sites in the European Union and to check whether the risk reports are updated on a regular basis."
"We also need to check whether the plans are operational and tested, whether the national administrations have the means of inspecting all these installations and whether the no-construction zones are being respected."
"Above all, we must learn from this tragedy that has struck the inhabitants of Toulouse, to ensure that in future the people of the European Union are protected once and for all from such terrible explosions."
"Evans Robert J.E. report (A5-0304/2001)"
"I voted in favour of this report, but I am disappointed that some of the most important aspects were rejected."
"It seems that Parliament does not accept the common definition of a refugee, based on the full inclusive definition, which would cover gender-related persecution, include both state and non-state persecution and take account of the applicant's fear of further persecution."
"I cannot see how people can justify voting against such principles."
"In relation to the issue of a safe country of origin I do not think there is such a thing as a safe country anywhere."
"For certain people in certain sections of society, there is a danger in any country."
"In Ireland we have signed a bilateral agreement with Romania and Nigeria and we are planning to sign more such agreements in the future so that we can speed up the procedure of deportation."
"This really falls short of what we are required to do under international law."
"Individuals are not being treated as individuals, they are being treated as groups coming from the country concerned."
"The idea of a safe country, the idea that governments can actually claim that certain countries are safe, is quite incredible."
"We have to remember that there is no such thing as a safe country for certain people."
"- (FR) We voted against the Evans report, which echoes the main Commission position on the common asylum procedure."
"Like the Commission, the rapporteur believes this procedure should be refocused towards giving greater right of asylum to applicants who want 'to find safety'."
"We already established, at the last part-session, what practical consequences this policy would have, when we considered the Commission's proposal on minimum standards for the procedure for granting refugee status."
"It quite simply overlooks the fact that today the right of asylum is being distorted and manipulated to such an extent that it has become a if not the prime source of illegal immigration."
"How many applications are unfounded?"
"Probably nine out of ten."
"The Commission forgets these figures, just as it minimises the total number of applications, which it puts at 200 000 for the entire EU in 2000, while according to the figures we have it was as much as 375 000, counting only 10 out of the 15 EU countries!"
"This underestimate is made deliberately."
"It allows the problem to be minimised."
"In fact it is immense."
"The member countries must not accept the Commission's proposals, for they would constrain them to observe a common procedure that would start out flexible, only to become increasingly rigid, as is clearly stated on page 8 of the communication."
"That procedure would end up by granting unlimited rights of asylum and, in addition, broaden the concept of 'refugee' set out in the 1951 convention by extending it to other forms of temporary protection."
"All this is totally ill-timed."
"The Commission would do better to present us with proposals for establishing a policy on the return of applicants whose claim has been rejected."
"It would also do better to present us with proposals aimed at giving priority to assisting refugees in their region of origin."
"- (DA) The report' s detailed requests to the Commission and the Council are based upon an appealing ambition to improve legal protection for asylum seekers in relation to the rights applicable under the Convention and particularly with regard to the procedure for dealing with asylum seekers. The proposals could therefore mean a long overdue strengthening of legal protection in our own countries."
"We also find it encouraging that the proposal seeks the reasons why refugees are persecuted."
"Even though we are able to endorse by far the majority of the report' s recommendations, we have not been able to vote in favour of the report, partly because quite a few of the proposals are too vague and partly - and especially - because the proposals are based upon asylum and immigration policy' s being defined supranationally by the EU."
"These policy areas are a part of the Member States' own area of responsibility and ought not to be (mis)used to construct a supranational policing and legal system."
"- (FR) First of all I want to thank both Mr Robert Evans, our rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the committee as a whole for the quality of the work they have done and for the courageous social choices they have asked us to make today."
"In my view, voting for this report means, above all, endorsing the ambitious approach set out by the Tampere European Council, namely not just the statement that 'in the longer term, Community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union', but also the commitment of that same Tampere European Council to the 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention."
"In other words, to vote for this report means to support the idea that a common asylum policy must adhere to high standards for the protection of the refugees, include a common definition of the concept of 'refugee' and give a full and inclusive interpretation of the Geneva Convention, taking account of persecution both by state and by non-state agents, as well as the asylum seekers' fear of future persecution."
"I therefore believe it is important to draw your attention to the fact that the common, 'full and inclusive' interpretation of the Geneva Convention must include the possibility of granting asylum in cases where the persecution is not carried out by the state."
"The Member States take many different views on this particular point."
"In other words, the further development of the common policy calls for further harmonisation of procedures throughout the Union."
"We must, however, note that while it is important to encourage this kind of single procedure, this must not restrict the possibilities for the individual to obtain refugee status under the terms of the Geneva Convention."
"In my view, voting for this report also means emphasising the fact that the use of concepts such as 'safe third countries', 'safe country of origin', 'accelerated procedures' and 'procedures for manifestly unfounded applications' must only be used where justified and include legally binding guarantees."
"(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (EL) The two reports, one on the procedure for granting asylum to refugees and the other on ÅU immigration policy are in fact both an attempt to deal with the same problem."
"The problem of the influx into the Member States of the ÅU of people who have lost everything, of people who are in danger in their own country, either because they are being politically persecuted or for reasons of economic survival."
"Reports and other EU documents on the matter always contain a paragraph referring to the need to combat the causes of asylum-seeking and immigration."
"Of course, what they fail to mention is the criminal responsibility of imperialism, which has exploited the natural and human resources of third world countries for centuries and which has no hesitation in setting up and bringing down what are usually authoritarian governments in order to serve its economic interests."
"The furious struggle of the imperialist forces to overturn Socialism, the war which they ignited in the Balkans and the recent tragic example of the war planned against their own Taliban and Bin Laden resulted and will continue to result in millions of unfortunate people hanging about in the countries of the ÅU and elsewhere, looking for a place in the sun."
"Consequently, we should have no delusions about the fact that, as long as imperialism prevails, asylum-seeking and immigration will live and rule."
"So the question is, how can we manage the problem better?"
"In this respect, the Evans report on granting asylum contains a number of positive points and proposals."
"However, it is still a wish list."
"For example, it quite rightly points out that the concept of 'safe' countries of origin or 'safe' third countries is very fluid and the danger here is that people will be deported to countries in which they are at risk, that is, they will literally be sent into the lion's den."
"A typical example is Turkey, a candidate country, which the ÅU considers has made steady progress in the field of human rights."
"In reality, as we all know, people are imprisoned in Turkey for their ideas, hunger strikers and other people fighting for democracy are murdered, parties which represent millions of Kurds or opponents of the regime (such as the Communist party) are banned, trade unionists are arrested and so on."
"And yet there are countries in the ÅU, including Greece, which deport opponents of the regime to this 'safe' country."
"As far as the conditions of survival of refugees are concerned, a typical example is Greece, where thousands of Kurds live in shanty towns in Lavrio and Afghans and other refugees sleep in cardboard boxes on the beaches in Athens, deprived of even the basic necessities."
"Likewise, the report quite rightly highlights the huge delay in processing asylum applications and the fact that the Member States are unwilling to grant asylum."
"In Greece, for example, an average of 5% a year are approved and only this year did this rise to 7%."
"We shall vote in favour of the Evans report because it proposes improvements to the current system of protection for refugees."
"However, we feel that only solidarity and a united fight by both refugees and workers in the Member States of the ÅU in a bid to claim dignified living conditions for everyone and, more to the point, wipe out the reasons for refugees and poverty will provide a definitive solution to the problem."
". (NL) Huge discrepancies between the rich and poor in the world encourage migration, which only solves the problem for a small number of people and not for humanity as a whole."
"It is often the best educated and the most privileged who manage to enter Europe, often at the expense of useful roles they could be playing in their countries of origin."
"Such individual solutions, however, are necessary to those whose only chance of survival is to flee from war and suppression."
"It is not acceptable to send people to their deaths by establishing quota and to refuse access to others."
"Neither is it justifiable to send people back before the problem in their country of origin has been solved."
"Moreover, some refugees will want to stay on because their children and grandchildren have meanwhile been raised in the new country of residence."
"Some EU Member States admit many more refugees than others."
"It is remarkable that both those in favour of restricting and those in favour of extending the permits have for years been calling for a more centralised and standardised European policy."
"I can only agree with this if it means that the EU Member States will be more generous in applying minimum standards than those agreed in the Geneva Convention."
"It is easier to organise and supervise the protection of refugees on a small scale than by a remote bureaucracy."
"- (FR) According to Article 1 of the Geneva Convention, refugee status applies to anyone who rightly fears being persecuted on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a certain social group or political opinions, is outside the country of his or her nationality and cannot, or because of that fear will not, seek the protection of that country."
"It is time that the Member States of the European Union applied that Convention in full."
"Yet France, in its hypocrisy, refuses to grant that status to Algerian refugees."
"In the same way Europe refused, at the height of the war in Kosovo, to give refugee status to Serbian deserters or to the Kosovars who were being persecuted."
"How many Bosnians are still mouldering in refugee camps in Turkey because the Union has refused to take them in?"
"How many Afghan refugees are flocking to Sangatte in the hope of getting to England because they know they have no chance in the Schengen area?"
"However, despite these reservations, because the text proposes minimum standards for receiving asylum seekers (a minimum level of assistance, such as the provision of full legal aid, at public expense, to each applicant, or justification, by the authority or by the court, of any rejection of a refugee' s application, as well as specific aid for vulnerable persons), we shall be voting in favour."
"Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)"
"I voted against this report."
"It sends out the wrong signals."
"It suggests that Europe will take in the people it wants, the people it needs; in other words, human beings are being classified as commodities that certain Member States will want."
"This goes against all the international principles of basic human rights."
"It suggests that people who have a certain trade or a certain profession can come in, but other people who may desperately need to get in are not allowed in."
"This whole policy is completely restrictive."
"In relation to the idea that we all have to share the burden of quotas, that immigrants are a burden, that we must all spread this burden, that immigrants are not people at all, that they are basically problems, this report sends out completely the wrong signals."
"It establishes the concept of a fortress Europe whose door will be open to a privileged few."
"Mr President, I share some, if not all, of Mrs McKenna's reservations on the Pirker report."
"However, I voted in favour of this report on a common immigration policy, but with an extremely heavy heart."
"I did so because although the report as amended is, as we would say in English, all over the place - some points do not correspond with others and there are contradictions left, right and centre - there are a few (and I am sure Mrs McKenna will look at them) but significant positive aspects to the report."
"For example, it recognises the right of third-country nationals legally resident in the European Union to free movement in Europe."
"Equally, it gives the right to vote in local elections."
"However, there are negative aspects."
"I doubt whether all the people who voted for paragraph 35 could have read it, because it restricts the right of residence, accommodation and education."
"That is inherently racist and we should oppose it."
"However, to have rejected the report would have placed in jeopardy the positive points; hence my support, although with the reservations I have expressed clearly here."
"Mr President, the Pirker report is extremely important because it includes certain declarations of principle which we consider to be fundamental and to clarify the issue: firstly, the principle that immigrants are expected to respect the Community of values, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and to have a genuine desire to be integrated into the society of the Member States."
"Today, let us grasp the full extent of the now tragic dimensions of the danger represented by different 'values' which are opposed to the values common to our societies and to our traditions, which have been introduced and disseminated, so to speak, by illegal immigration linked to Islamic fundamentalism within our societies."
"Among these values, I would like to focus on those relating to family relationships, family rights, and I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the tragedy of two Italians - mother and daughter - who were forced to take refuge at the Italian embassy in Algiers and approached Parliament, asking us to protect their fundamental rights, violated precisely by those people who adhere to the opposing principles of Islamic law."
"Furthermore, another principle: the recognition that every State has the right ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
". (EL) New rules for the waves of immigrants heading for the European Union, calculating the needs of the countries of entry and procedures for integrating third country nationals into society in the European Union are, without doubt, moves in the right direction."
"However, the Commission communication on an 'immigration policy' contains omissions and additional objectives need to be promoted."
"To be specific, we need:"
"to clarify the difference between the terms 'working immigrant' and 'economic immigrant' and avoid the risk of creating new forms of discrimination based on the narrow interests of the job market in Europe;"
"to accept family reunification in general and not as a special characteristic of certain categories of immigrants;"
"to extend mobility within the ÅU for immigrants with a legal resident's permit;"
"to combat human trafficking gangs;"
"a strategy to facilitate the return of specialised immigrants in order to strengthen productive capacity in their country of origin;"
"to abolish discrimination between immigrants on the basis of sex, age, sexual orientation or disability;"
"to create a European network for immigration as an observatory and census mechanism."
"This being the case, I voted against the report."
"The Pirker report on Community immigration policy has just been made worse by the adoption of Amendment No 17 which claims voting rights for foreign nationals in local elections."
"In any case, despite Mr Pirker' s laudable efforts, this report is ambiguous in the way it is worded in general, because it does not dare to say clearly that the Commission' s approach, in its communication on immigration, is wrong."
"First of all, to a large extent it hides the phenomenon of illegal immigration, and it proposes only partial or distant solutions."
"In particular, the approach involving co-development with the countries of origin will no doubt be of value in the long term, but it does not mean that we do not need to strengthen our border controls now."
"Moreover, the Commission is more or less opening the floodgates to legal immigration. It says that European policy should be based on the fact that migratory pressure will continue (page 14), and from this it draws the conclusion that legislation should be designed so as to facilitate, rather than hinder, the admission of economic migrants (page 19)."
"We, however, do not draw that conclusion at all."
"On the contrary, we believe that a quota policy should be adopted, with quota levels determined by each Member State on its own behalf, and in our opinion those quotas should be filled, as a matter of priority, by nationals of countries in Eastern Europe, who will soon be members of the Union."
"On the subject of the integration of immigrants, the Commission invites us to recognise that integration is a two-way process requiring adaptation by both the immigrants and the society that receives them (page 21)."
"This is not our opinion either."
"The strangers who come knocking at our door more often than not come from countries which have completely failed to let their population live decently, or even to feed it."
"It is obviously in the immigrants' interest to adjust to our way of life and our values."
"To take the opposite view would be to do them a great disservice, and it would also, in return, do a great disservice to the countries of Europe."
". (PT) The report comments on a Commission communication on immigration, adopted in November 2000, which considers the issue from a mainly economic perspective, linked to job prospects, which may create the conditions for establishing immigration quotas in the European Union."
"It appears that the European Union is only interested in using labour from third countries to meet the needs and shortages of European capitalism, indifferent to the obstacles this may create to those countries' own development by depriving them of vital human resources."
"It is, therefore, crucial that we find a new perspective on cooperation and development policy, particularly with third countries, in order to contribute towards greater support for their development and provide their populations with decent standards of living, something which the report, unfortunately, does not touch upon."
"With regard to immigrants, it is important to guarantee and respect all their rights."
"Hence the proposals we submitted on upholding the legalisation of all immigrants, our insistence on the need for recognition of civil and political rights, namely the right to vote in local and European elections and the guarantee of equal treatment in terms of economic, cultural and social rights."
"- (FR) I voted in favour of Mr Pirker' s report and I would like to draw attention to the quality of the work carried out by our rapporteur."
"I am glad that Parliament is finally taking a decision on such an important subject."
"For almost twenty years, immigration as a subject of public debate has been treated only emotionally or unrealistically."
"How could it have been otherwise, when the subject has virtually become a major stake in the internal policy of every Member State of the European Community?"
"It also has to be admitted that, in the eyes of the public, the policies being followed are, on the one hand, inefficient when it comes to combating illegal immigration and, on the other, unjust in the case of proper immigration which is legal and useful to the development of our society."
"It has now become vital to make a clear distinction, both in law and in practice, between proper immigration and improper immigration, and finally to define criteria and then stick to them."
"While several international and European organisations all emphasise the risk of shortages of qualified workers in Europe, we must learn to adapt, like certain Anglo-Saxon countries, and open up European society to the immigrants that it so badly needs in several sectors, including informatics and new technologies."
"To conclude, real courage consists in campaigning for deep-seated change in the world economic order."
"Justice and ethics would then count for much more than they do in the moralising extremism of those who would like to demand total freedom to live and work in Europe, like those who would like to turn our European Community into a mere sanctuary."
"- (FR) In the light of the recent dramatic events of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, the fight against illegal immigration into Europe should, more than ever, be our chief concern."
"It is time to stop letting all these illegal immigrants in and put an end to the free movement of traffickers and terrorists within the Union."
"We must show some instinct for survival."
"Terrorist cells have recently been identified in various Member States of the Union, in particular in France and Belgium, among illegal immigrants."
"Since the opening up of borders and the Schengen Agreements, some immigrant communities have systematically organised themselves into networks of religious and ethnic infiltration, and as a result they are a fertile breeding ground for terrorism, and also for delinquency, trafficking and violent crimes of all kinds."
"Yet what, in the face of all this, is Brussels' policy?"
"It closes its eyes and ignores the evil."
"At the very best it feebly condemns the constant increase in international crime."
"So what are its solutions?"
"Encourage immigration, legalise illegal immigrants, give identity papers to all those who have entered our territory illegally, create and allow the creation of no-go areas where the law does not apply, such as the Sangatte Centre in France."
"Broadly speaking, that is what is being preached by the report that we are voting on."
"It tells us that we must populate Europe because Europe has a population deficit."
"Europe needs manpower, so in order to meet that need we must have a global and voluntary immigration policy."
"The National Front Députés have for years been constantly denouncing this irresponsible and suicidal policy coming from Brussels."
"The fight against illegal immigration must clearly be based on the principle of zero tolerance."
"Illegal immigrants must be sent back to their country of origin."
"Our borders must be re-established, because proof has finally been given to all signatory parties to the Schengen Agreements that those borders are an essential element in the security of our countries."
"Therefore, before committing ourselves to a Community immigration policy, let us start by establishing a Community security policy."
"We are critical of parts of the report."
"In our opinion, there is too great an emphasis placed on what should be done to limit immigration, instead of highlighting the positive and necessary aspects of increased immigration, including the immigration of labour."
"In several cases, we should like to go further with regard to becoming more receptive to increased labour migration."
"We are particularly critical of Paragraph 15, which states that 'immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate into society in the Member States' ."
"We do not currently require the citizens of Europe to respect the community of values referred to in the report."
"The question is how this paragraph will actually be interpreted."
"A wave of anti-Muslim sentiment is currently sweeping across Europe."
"In Sweden and in several other Member States, Muslims have been harassed."
"Politicians in individual Member States have, in our opinion, made some astonishing statements."
"Our concern is that the wording of Paragraph 15 is in danger of providing further scope for intolerance and xenophobia."
"There is a risk that the diversity of Europe could be lost."
"- (FR) The debates that have just taken place in the present session on the Pirker report, and indeed on the Evans report, represent a double departure from the debates previously held within the European Parliament on the same subjects."
"The first of these departures is the new tone of firmness and rigour demonstrated both by the presidency and even by the Commission."
"The events of 11 September have something to do with that."
"The ideology of 'fewer and fewer controls' has given way to the realisation that terrorism feeds on our laxity."
"It is not by chance that the Europe of the Fifteen, the European Union, has emerged from the inquiry into the killings of 11 September as being the privileged location for the organisation, preparation and mounting of the terrorist attacks in the United States."
"It is necessary now for the good intentions just expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission to be translated into action and sustained in the long term."
"It is, in fact, high time that the fight against illegal immigration and the fight against the abuse of the asylum procedure should no longer be mere formulae to be bandied about, but should become policies to be implemented with determination."
"The second departure is more distressing."
"This is the obvious discrepancy that has appeared between the new tone of the Council and the Commission, which is a positive signal of awareness, and the persistence of an ideological attitude among most of the Members who have spoken, which continues to confuse control with violation of freedoms, and which wants to increase the number of guarantees to the benefit of those who are abusing our reception and asylum procedures, to the detriment of the security and protection of our citizens and the interests of those who, because they really are being persecuted, ought to find asylum here."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to clarify the reasons why my group voted in favour of the Pirker report."
"In our view it is of the utmost importance that the Commission' s communication be favourably received."
"The Laeken Council has the political duty of revitalising the process launched by the Tampere European Council."
"As evidenced by the data supplied by EUROSTAT, the citizens believe that the European Union must adopt a common immigration policy."
"Amongst other provisions, our group has included the right of long-term residents to vote in local elections. We have also contrived to build in clearly defined responsibilities for the European Union."
"For all these reasons, and also to express our strong support for the Commission, we have voted in favour, even though our views differ markedly from some of those expressed by the rapporteur."
"We trust the communication will be favourably received at the Laeken Council."
"We regret that some right-wing Members have referred to terrorism and immigration in the same breath during the debate. This gives rise to mistrust of immigrants and Muslim refugees."
"Evans report (A5-0304/2001) and Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)"
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Evans' s and Mr Pirker' s reports."
"We agree that, in the longer term, the EU should develop a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for persons granted asylum."
"Moreover, the EU' s immigration policy should be adapted to developments in the world."
"We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the communications relate to an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and do not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position."
"- (FR) We voted in favour of the Evans report because it contains a certain amount of progress as regards the position of refugees and because it ought to go without saying that on this subject all the countries of the Union should apply the same procedure."
"However, this joint situation should be in line with the country that is most favourable to refugees, which is far from being the case."
"Moreover, the wording leaves several loopholes for those Member States who like the rules to be applied more restrictively, which limits the actual scope of measures which are a step in the right direction."
"On the other hand, we voted against the Pirker report on immigration, which justifies a policy of immigration quotas based solely on the interests of the bosses in the countries concerned."
"This report tries to provide a legal basis for the activities of traffickers in modern slaves, allowing them to seek the workers that they need in poor countries, and giving them the right to turn people away as soon as there is no longer a demand for them."
"Titley report (A5-0309/2001)"
". (EL) The terrorist attack on the USA gives us an incentive to look at the problem of arms exports in a new light."
"Having said which, the Titley report, despite containing a number of positive, albeit general, pointers, does not I think, come anywhere near to responding to the demands of the times."
"It is unacceptable for the European Union to base its code of conduct in arms exports on the criterion of the 'needs of the European defence industry' , because this negates any substantive measures which might be mentioned."
"The European Union should move to get the USA, Russia, China and all the other major arms exporters to adopt binding rules of conduct and their unwillingness should not be a reason for the European Union to relax or otherwise fail to act properly."
"At the same time, we need an observatory at European level, we need records and transparency on arms exports so that we can put an immediate end to the scandalous practice of selling arms to forces of crime and destabilisation which have no hesitation in using terrorism to turn their arms against the European Union and its citizens."
"This is why I feel that the motion falls short and I did not vote for it."
"- (DA) The idea of regulating politically the production and export of arms has our complete backing, but we reject Mr Titley' s report with the following justification."
"The report does not reflect the fundamental conflict between the interests of the arms industry and an ideal and peaceful world order."
"To introduce a report on codes of conduct on arms exports by, in paragraph 1 d), proclaiming that the EU' s policy on arms exports should 'meet the needs and challenges of the European defence industry' is self-contradictory."
"In the same way, we are opposed to the goal of making arms exports policy into a tool for developing a common defence policy, as intimated in paragraph 1 e)."
"We acknowledge that positive changes have been made and also support a number of the individual wordings."
". The Verts/ALE Group welcomes the fact that the report by Mr Titley on an EU code of conduct on arms exports is a major improvement on his previous reports on this issue."
"We can fully support the vast majority of this report and we welcome many of its recommendations."
"However we regret that many of our members felt they had to abstain from the final vote because the amendment to delete section 1 (d) ""... Reiterates its belief that European policy in arms export must: (d) meet the needs and challenges of the European defence industry"" was not adopted."
"Had this section been removed we could have supported the final report."
