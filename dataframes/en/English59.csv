"I wish to point out the high skill level of many Indian workers and therefore feel that we should promote exchanges and the sharing of experiences at technical, academic and professional levels."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a recommendation before us, although I wish to make it clear that upgraded EU-India relations must neither replace nor dilute existing bilateral relations with the Member States; rather, they should complement them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate and one that is not only about the irrefutable fact that Iran is a fundamentalist state where human rights are frequently violated."
"This is also a debate in which it must be stated quite clearly that two things must never be forgotten if we are to bring progress to other countries outside the EU."
"Firstly, equal opportunities and equality before the law must be implemented in the EU itself, where much remains to be done, to put it mildly. Only then will we have the moral right to reprimand others."
"Secondly, as the doctor’s creed says, ‘first do no harm’."
"It is not difficult to adopt a resolution, but it is difficult to dispute facts that are unacceptable in terms of the European system of values we claim as our own."
"It should not be forgotten that the European system of values and the system of values that exists in Iran – a system of values bound up with the country’s religion – are two quite disparate worlds."
"Any attempt at taking short cuts in rebuilding this system may lead to unrest, with a legitimate goal proving to be the cause of even greater tragedies for the Iranian people."
"I am sure the House is full of good intentions, but we will not be able to make genuine improvements to the lives of the Iranian people by issuing condemnations or imposing isolation of any kind."
"The only way to achieve progress is through gradual development, and any attempts to cut short this process cannot fail to result in tension and a further closing off of the country’s system and regime. Any real influence we have on events inside Iran is extremely limited."
"Whilst on the subject of human rights, it is worth taking this opportunity to present the other side of the story, which has had an impact right here at the heart of Europe. The system of values upon which European civilisation was built, and upon which European and Latin cultures were built, is now being rejected by this very House."
"It means all the nations and all the Member States of the European Union are still being forced to accept models imposed by a minority as the only politically correct ones. This is another approach that cannot fail to result in tension if unnecessary short cuts are taken, and this tension may be one of the key reasons why the European Union is unable to create a genuinely firm foundation for the edifice you wish to construct."
"Mr President, it is not only Iran’s domestic affairs we are talking about today."
"We are discussing a country that is finishing work on an atomic bomb and on devices able to launch such bombs at Israel and at American bases."
"This poses the threat of supraregional conflict."
"What image do we have of Iran today? One made up of a whole variety of aspects, such as the sentencing to death of teenagers, as referred to by previous speakers, public executions and stonings."
"This is not a matter of a European system of values, Mr Pęk, it is a matter of indisputable human values."
"We hear of executions on a daily basis, as if we were reading reports of road accidents in Europe."
"The figures are as follows: 22 executions were carried out in October, and 120 over the course of six months."
"These figures hide human tragedies that statistics may not fully reveal, and the situation is deteriorating, as those who favour a tough line increasingly have the say in Iran."
"We should not allow a debate on persecution to pass without reference to an issue which has not yet been raised before this House."
"To my great surprise, Mr Pęk did not mention it either. I have in mind the persecution of religious minorities and of Christians."
"For example, 80 Christians were arrested in Teheran on 11 September."
"It is a shame that this escaped Mr Pęk’s attention. The situation we are discussing is a kind of never-ending story that just goes on and on."
"This being the case, Mr Meijer is entirely right to say that the inclusion of certain bodies, for example the People’s Mujahideen, in the list of terrorist organisations would be a mistake, as these are the very people who are fighting against the regime."
"The European Parliament must bring pressure to bear on Iran, and I should like to praise those Members of this House who lead the way on this issue and monitor developments in the field."
"Mr President, let me make things clear. I had the opportunity of an audience with the Council on the subject of relations between the EU and Iran."
"I had the opportunity to hear with my own ears that the Council deemed this dialogue dead in the water. I am therefore extremely surprised to see the Commission, against all logic, wishing to revive something that is no more than a completely failed project and criticising those Members of this House who spoke very well on the subject."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I passionately hope that next Tuesday the American people will defeat Mr Bush’s extreme right government."
"That would be the quickest way to put an end to the medieval treatment being suffered by the prisoners of war in Guantánamo."
"That government has taken a step backwards from civilisation in favour of barbarism, through pre-emptive war."
"We are talking about the collateral damage resulting from pre-emptive war, such as the humiliation of prisoners of war in Guantánamo, where the Geneva Convention is not respected, where people are denied the right to a public and fair trial, to legal representation, and people are tortured."
"We already have the testimonies of people who have been tortured."
"What are we Europeans waiting for? Yesterday this Parliament gave a lesson in the sensitivity of managing the protection of freedoms."
"So the old Europe cannot remain silent in the face of an administration responsible for the ignominy of having prisoners of war bound and gagged in truly medieval dungeons. The old Europe cannot tolerate that."
"We must therefore speak out clearly, and I agree with my fellow Spaniard, who has said that this resolution is important, but that it is very mild. We must speak out more loudly against the ignominy of Guantánamo."
"Mr President, nearly 200 people, including five British nationals, have been released since the prison was created."
"This means that all these people were held against their will for up to two years, without being told why."
"They were tortured, denied access to family, friends or legal representation, and in the end they were not charged with any crime."
"How can any civilised democratic society not only justify but also condone this? If a country like Iran, for instance, did this to an American citizen, I am sure George Bush would be the first to condemn it."
"One of my constituents, Moazzam Begg, who is detained in Guantanamo Bay, wrote a letter to his family which got through uncensored."
"It details a string of abuses."
"This, along with other evidence from former prisoners and people who have worked there, paints a disturbing picture of what is going on."
"There must be an immediate independent investigation into the allegations."
"All the detainees at Guantanamo Bay have been held in unacceptable legal limbo for far too long."
"... 'welcomes clarification from the Iranian authorities concerning the case of the 13-year-old Zhila Izadi, allegedly sentenced to death by stoning, and the sentencing of her 15-year-old brother, Bakhtiar, to 250 lashes, that both have been unconditionally released without further pursuit of their case'."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 28 October 2004."
"I would like to inform you that, in accordance with the second paragraph of Rule 127(4) of the Rules of Procedure, a plenary sitting will be held on Tuesday 21 December in Brussels in order to examine the report by the President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr Balkenende."
"– Mr President, with the special sitting on 21 December, you have given us something of an early Christmas present."
"Do you think that the expenditure on this sitting will be justified in terms of what comes out of it?"
"Will we get more information from this sitting than we will be able to get from the media?"
"That is a good question to put to Mr Balkenende; it would be appropriate to put that question to the President-in-Office of the Council, since it is for him that we will be meeting."
"I believe it is proper at the end of each Presidency for the President-in-Office of the Council to come to Parliament to give us a final assessment of that Presidency."
"If we do not do so now, we will have to do it late in January, and that would interfere with the dynamic of the next Presidency."
"Mr Balkenende is prepared to come on the 21 December, during the Christmas period, and I do not think it would be polite of us to tell him that we have better ideas and we do not want him to come."
"I hope that the meeting on the 21 December will be of sufficient interest to merit the work and the cost of arranging it."
"The beginning of November brings memories of events in our history that we Europeans should never forget because, to a certain extent, they tie in with some of the events we are experiencing at the moment."
"A week ago, on 9 November, we celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and with it the Soviet empire, which has led to the unification of the continent within the European Union."
"So today we are here together for the first time to celebrate this anniversary in this Parliament for all Europeans."
"The fall of the Berlin Wall was the last geo-political event stemming from the First World War."
"On 11 November we also celebrated the armistice that marked the end of that drama, of that great civil war amongst Europeans."
"On 9 November we also celebrated the international day against fascism and anti-Semitism in memory of that night which marked the beginning of the institutionalised persecution of a people on the grounds of race."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can never let up in our defence of the human rights which the European Union has fought so hard for."
"Although it may not always be apparent, they are always under threat."
"Our peace, the peace amongst Europeans which we are so proud of, has been threatened over recent days by new dangers which threaten our values and our co-existence."
"I believe I can say on behalf of everybody that we are following the events in the Netherlands the escalation of ethnic and religious tension and confrontation with sadness and concern."
"I believe this is a good opportunity to send a message of solidarity to the Dutch Government and the whole of Dutch society, regardless of its origins or beliefs."
"We stand wholeheartedly behind all those who, through their own sense of personal responsibility, are committed to preventing the pointless spiral of violence."
"The European Parliament is aware that, at the end of the day, extremism and xenophobia, from whatever quarter, comes from a very small section of the population of that country and under no circumstances must it cast a shadow over the whole of Dutch society, which is one of the most tolerant and inclusive societies in Europe."
"Furthermore, during this month of November, Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, has died, and I have sent a letter of condolence to that Council."
"Our Vice-President, Mr McMillan-Scott, represented us at the funeral in Cairo last Friday."
"For 40 years, Mr Arafat was the symbol of his people’s struggle for self-determination."
"Today, his departure offers a new opportunity for hopes of peace between the people of Israel and of Palestine."
"I would like to express my agreement with the words of Mr Solana who, talking on behalf of the Council, has said that the Union must be prepared to participate in a new phase of peace negotiations if they are relaunched."
"I am sure that all Europeans wish to take this opportunity to promote the effective application of the Roadmap."
"The next item is speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, on 28 October three United Nations aid workers were kidnapped in Afghanistan."
"One of the captives is from the Philippines, one is from Kosovo, and one, Annetta Flanigan, is from my constituency in Northern Ireland."
"They have been held captive ever since."
"One can only imagine the trauma that these captives and their families have gone through and are still experiencing."
"I would ask that you, Mr President, and this House give full support for the release of the three captives and that you raise this immediately with the Council and the Commission to gain their support."
"I heard this afternoon that the captors have said that they will make no further effort to make contact after 7.30 p.m. our time."
"Mr President, I ask you to give this your utmost priority, because, as Annetta Flanigan said, they only went there to help the people of Afghanistan."
"Mr President, as you said, we must not drop our guard when it comes to the issue of human rights."
"During the last sitting, we adopted a resolution on the problem of human rights in Iran."
"Since then, the situation has continued to deteriorate."
"I wish to draw your attention to the fact that people are still being arrested, including human rights activists Doctor Mabobeh Abbasgholizadeh and Mrs Fereshteh Qâzi."
"This is an unacceptable situation and I feel that you must ask the President-in-Office of the Council to enlist the support of our Ambassadors in Tehran to help ensure that human rights are respected."
"We may have concluded an agreement on nuclear energy, but we must not turn a blind eye to what is happening in Iran on a daily basis."
"– Mr President, European citizens face two new food scandals: on the one hand, Dutch dioxins and, most probably, on the other, as the diagnostic test to date has shown, the first signs of mad cow disease in sheep and goats."
"As a result of this dioxin food scandal, over 200 livestock holdings have already closed in Holland, as have numerous holdings in Belgium and Germany."
"I am protesting, because no information is forthcoming from the authorities in the Netherlands, which are also the presiding country, or from the European Commission, about what products have been sent to the other Member States, so that consumers can be protected."
"I call for greater transparency, immediate information and full publication of the analyses relating to both cases."
"The European Union needs to take care of public health, as well as the market, in order to prevent the introduction of suspect products into the food chains."
"Mr President, I wish to raise an issue of serious concern to everyone who believes in democracy."
"The Belgian Supreme Court has upheld a previous ruling that declares the Vlaams Blok a criminal organisation and effectively bans it."
"Nobody in my Group supports the ideology or the practice of the Vlaams Blok, but in a democracy that is not the point."
"It is for the electorate and not the courts to make political decisions, and actions such as this can only increase political extremism and perhaps the use of violence."
"Today these events have taken place in Belgium, but tomorrow it could be the European Union."
"We already have a European arrest warrant."
"We have EU funding of political groups, and I believe that criticism of the EU itself will very soon be deemed xenophobic, and that action might be taken against parties such as mine."
"Every democrat among us should therefore condemn these moves."
"– Mr President, for a week now, the American occupying forces have been committing an abominable crime in the city of Falluja in Iraq."
"They have been indiscriminately bombing homes, killing civilians and destroying the entire city."
"The tens of thousands of inhabitants of the city are in danger, not only from the bombings, but also from power cuts and water shortages."
"The occupying forces and their collaborators are preventing the inhabitants from leaving and are giving out hardly any information about civilians, and even less about the dead."
"Your counterpart, Mr Alawi, is prohibiting the names of the dead from being announced in the city of Falluja."
"The Red Crescent and the Red Cross are being prohibited from providing any assistance whatsoever."
"This is brutality for which there is huge political responsibility both on the part of the European Union, which legalised the war, and the occupying forces, and the political groups, which approved the recent resolution on Iraq, thereby encouraging the American intervention."
"The crime against the people of Iraq must stop and that will only happen if the occupying forces leave."
"Why do you people who talk about human rights now have nothing to say in the face of this crime?"
"Mr President, two weeks ago I visited Israel and the West Bank."
"Almost exactly two weeks ago today I was standing in a place in Tel Aviv called Carmel Market, looking at the tragic aftermath of a suicide bomb."
"To witness for myself the horror that Israeli citizens have to live with every day was profoundly moving and deeply upsetting."
"The prosaic and everyday nature of the scene of bustling shoppers and market stalls contrasted brutally with the clear-up operation that was taking place, with human remains being scraped off the canopies of the market stalls."
"I hope that all MEPs will join me in condemning those who send 16-year old children, strapped with explosives, to blow themselves up together with innocent shoppers who have just popped out to buy something from the local cheese shop."
"I also hope that everyone in this House will join me in expressing our profound hope that we have reached a turning point in the Middle East, and that we have reached a point where the path of peace and dialogue will start to displace that of the bomb and the bullet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw Parliament’s attention to a shortcoming, a problem."
"On 16 September, we adopted a resolution on the harassment of national minorities in Vojvodina."
"Parliament decided that the delegation for relations with Serbia and Montenegro would send a fact-finding mission to Vojvodina, in Serbia."
"Two months have already passed since then."
"I do not understand."
"There is a danger – as mentioned in our resolution – that incidents will multiply and that the harassment of national minorities will spiral out of control."
"The delegation for relations with Serbia has not found five Members to send on the fact-finding mission."
"This beggars belief."
"Parliament’s good name is at stake; this is a case of non-compliance with a European Parliament resolution."
"I ask you, Mr President, to look into why the delegation for relations with Serbia has sabotaged Parliament’s resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to a matter I believe to be of great significance."
"As we see it, and further to the legal opinions we have in our possession, the European Parliament has allowed a situation to arise whereby the European Commission has acted without legal authority since 1 November."
"In other words, it has been acting illegally."
"This means that all legal, formal and other administrative decisions taken by the European Commission may be appealed against and overturned."
"Such a state of affairs must not be allowed to continue."
"Mr President, I believe it is necessary to establish interim legislative measures, which would serve to provide a legal definition of the measures to be taken by Parliament when it is unable to appoint a Commission."
"Mr President, I want to speak on two matters."
"Firstly I would like to associate myself entirely with the remarks of my colleague from Northern Ireland, Mr Nicholson, with regard to the atrocious situation that has befallen Annetta Flanigan, a lady who has given selfless service to Afghanistan."
"Doubtless all our thoughts are with her family at this very difficult time."
"Secondly, I want to dissociate myself from any eulogy to so-called President Arafat."
"He was an unrepentant terrorist who introduced to the world the horror of the human suicide bomber."
"He found common cause with other terrorist organisations throughout the world, including, in my country, the Provisional IRA, which has for years maintained fraternal relationships with its fellow murderers in the PLO."
"I therefore dissociate myself, on behalf of the victims in my country, from the eulogy to a confederate of world terrorism."
"– Mr President, as you know, the European Commission has proposed the adoption of a regulation to establish a pre-accession assistance mechanism (ΙΡΑ)."
"This proposal is positive, insofar as it groups and simplifies the management of existing programmes for accession countries and potential candidate countries in south-eastern Europe."
"Given that the ΙΡΑ will cover sectors such as the strengthening of institutions and regional and cross-border cooperation, among others, payment of the planned assistance needs to be linked to strict terms of political conditionality, terms which make up the political ."
"Our message must be clear."
"The challenge of the European orientation presupposes the overcoming of differences via dialogue, mutual understanding and agreement."
"Mr President, 14 November is World Diabetes Day."
"To mark this, I would ask MEP colleagues to follow up in their own countries the question of job discrimination against diabetics."
"All EU countries operate blanket exclusions against people with diabetes in certain posts, but the range of excluded occupations varies widely."
"For instance, Belgium and the UK bar diabetics from being police officers, but Hungary and Portugal do not."
"Italy bars them from being ambulance drivers, but the UK, Portugal and Greece do not."
"In the UK they cannot be air traffic controllers, whereas in Greece and Portugal they can."
"In a European Union with a common market and the freedom of movement of workers, this makes absolutely no sense."
"I will be putting questions to the Commission on this, but I must point out to my colleagues how illogical the situation is."
"Some of these bans date back 40 years or so and they do not take account of modern treatments."
"This kind of blanket discrimination must be abolished."
"Mr President, I should like again to warmly thank you for accepting the flower box, which symbolises European nature and biodiversity."
"The flower box is a gift from the European habitat forum, which represents millions of Europeans."
"Through you, we would also like to make Members aware that we now have an attractive green patch in Brussels, namely at ground-floor level very near the post office."
"It is the intention that we look after it together, but also to ensure that the Natura 2000 network receives sufficient financial resources to protect European biodiversity, because that is desperately needed."
"I would invite all Members of this House to walk past the flower box and contemplate the importance of nature and Natura 2000."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the worsening situation in Darfur."
"According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, up to 450 people are dying there each day."
"Rebel groups are attacking relief agencies more frequently, forcing them to leave the area."
"The numbers of displaced people are increasing, with the UN reporting an additional 150 000 left homeless last month alone."
"The response to such a dire situation should be prompt and effective."
"Firstly, the European Council should make the issue a top priority at its summit meeting later this month."
"Secondly, the European Union should use all its weight in highlighting this crisis at the meeting of the UN Security Council in Nairobi."
"The Sudan situation will be debated and a draft resolution considered."
"The Security Council must send a clear message to all parties involved to ensure that they adhere to agreements already entered into and that they end the violence now."
"Thirdly, the government of Sudan must be specifically singled out to take responsibility for the protection of its citizens and the disarmament of the Janjaweed militia."
"Lastly, the African Union force must be strengthened and its mandate expanded to deal more effectively with the security situation."
"It is time the European Union insisted that this resolution bring about real and sustained results."
"Mr President, on 8 October the Territorial Association of East Prussia (held its annual meeting."
"Twenty-one territorial associations are active in Germany, and they are openly anti-Polish and anti-Czech."
"Under an act passed in Germany in 1953, every German evicted from territories that belonged to the Reich or the Habsburg Monarchy before 1914 is to be considered a displaced person, with the status of displaced person being hereditary."
"The territorial associations call for the annulment of the legislative acts signed to end World War II."
"This is exactly what the Nazis did when they on the Treaty of Versailles."
"The charter of the Territorial Association of East Prussia demands that part of Poland’s territory be seized, and the Polish Government is regarded as an interim government."
"Yet the German Government grants subsidies to these associations, and their meetings, at which recordings of Waffen SS marches are sold, have been attended by Chancellor Schröder and Mr Stoiber, the President of Bavaria."
"How can Germany, an EU Member State, support revisionist organisations and allow them to operate legally, whilst these organisations call to war?"
"The German beast is stirring again, and the spectre of Hitler is hanging over Europe."
"I appeal to the European Parliament to look into this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Sunday 7 November, Sébastien Briard died when he was run over by a train carrying highly radioactive nuclear waste."
"This tragedy has left all ecologists and anti-nuclear protesters grief-stricken."
"My thoughts today are with his family and his loved ones, with his friends and with those committed to protecting our planet."
"He believed in a better world."
"This terrible accident did not happen by chance."
"It is the direct consequence of the stifling of democratic debate and of the power of the pro-nuclear lobby, particularly in my country."
"It also demonstrates that transporting radioactive materials, by rail or by road, is certainly not exempt from accidents, which may lead to major disasters."
"It was while highlighting this danger that Sébastien died on a Lorraine railway line, on which hundreds of carriages of this kind are transported."
"Let us honour his memory and his non-violent protest in this House."
"Let us spare a thought for him."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring of the British and Spanish Governments, who are providing Fidel Castro’s bloodthirsty Communist regime in Cuba with oxygen."
"As you reminded us, the Berlin Wall has fallen, but, unfortunately, murderous dinosaurs continue to threaten our ideals of democracy and freedom."
"I am talking about the Castro regime."
"I will follow your advice, Mr President, and not let up in my defence of human rights, and I appeal to you not to allow Members of this Parliament to travel again with a view to providing the regime with publicity at the expense of our budget, but rather to support future visits by Members aimed at highlighting and providing us with information on the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba."
"The European Union’s policy on Cuba must not change."
"We must defend it in memory of the thousands of people tortured and murdered, remembering in particular what happened last year with the summary execution of several innocent people."
"There must be no more political prisoners in Cuba."
"We are calling for freedom for the Cuban people so that they can achieve a peaceful political transition and demonstrate their potential for greatness."
"The Cuban people do not need outmoded clowns or accomplices who laugh along with them."
"Mr President, in your opening remarks you mentioned anniversaries."
"Before we gather again in Strasbourg there will be another anniversary."
"On 3 December, it will be 20 years since the Bhopal disaster in India."
"The death toll from that tragedy – more than 20 000 – is still rising at the rate of one every day."
"Over 120 000 people were injured, and the survivors and the children born since then are still suffering appalling injuries, symptoms and disabilities."
"However, for the last 13 years, Dow Chemicals – the American owners of the Union Carbide factory – have ignored a summons to face charges of culpable homicide in the Indian courts."
"Compensation has been pitiful, responsibility accepted negligible."
"I hope you, Mr President, and colleagues here in this Parliament will support all measures to get justice and real help for the victims."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our warnings concerning the dangerous road the EU is going down are being borne out."
"We are witnessing the formation of a new totalitarian system, which holds in contempt natural rights, the rights of nations, the rights of families and every individual’s right to life."
"Dreams of a Europe of solidarity, democracy, freedom, and assistance for the less able are fading."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your EU has not been a success."
"The reality is one of chaos and moral relativism, economic crisis, unemployment, growing social discontent, the law of the jungle behind a democratic front and a division into superior and inferior states."
"A new super-state is being founded on falsehood and fantastic ideology, the origins of which can be traced back to previous totalitarian systems."
"This was bound to happen, once God was rejected and His place usurped."
"We Poles have no desire for such a Europe, and we hereby appeal to all other nations: wake up, all you people of good faith, especially those of you who declare your Christianity!"
"They are spitting in your face, and you are silently submitting to corrupt compromises."
"You sacrificed Professor Buttiglione, and you agreed to a dictatorial Constitution."
"We do not agree to such a diktat and such barbarism."
"We wish to help minorities that are lost and have been hurt, but we will not submit to their pernicious domination."
"The nations of Europe have a right to freedom, to truth, to God and to the Cross."
"That is our Europe!"
"Mr President, the recent record rise in the euro/dollar exchange rate has caused concern in the minority of EU Member States that belong to Euroland, or in other words in the 12 of the 25 Member States which are in the euro zone."
"To a certain extent, the situation is of course beneficial to exporters in some of the countries of the ‘new’ EU."
"It is less beneficial, however, to the countries of the ‘old’ EU, and it demonstrates the European Central Bank’s helplessness and failure to take action."
"The reaction of the Frankfurt-based ECB to what is happening with the euro has in principle always been the same, namely a complete lack of reaction."
"I therefore propose that this House hold a debate on the role of the Central Bank."
"Mr Trichet, the ECB President, recently appeared before one of Parliament’s committees, and I hope a debate on the practical role of the Bank will also take place in this House."
"As a lawyer of minority rights who is committed to Romania’s accession, I would like to draw your attention to an increasing democratic deficit."
"General elections will be held in Romania on 28 November."
"On 25 October, one of the Hungarian minority organisations was deprived of its right to run in the elections based on a discriminatory Election Act, the involvement of the police, and the intimidation of certain people."
"All of the methods that were employed are incongruous with the concept of European pluralism and democracy."
"The same organisation, the Hungarian Civic Union, was discriminatively excluded even from local authority elections in July."
"The European Commission’s Annual Report disapproved of this, and at that time the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats set up a committee to investigate the case."
"The discriminatory regulations of the Election Act, the discriminatory action on part of the authorities and the exclusion from elections harshly violates the European standard of democracy and pluralism as well as the Copenhagen Criteria, which provide the basis for a stable constitutional state and a working democracy."
"A working democracy is indeed a condition for membership within the Union."
"Mr President, I would thank you particularly for the words of support and solidarity that you addressed to the Netherlands a moment ago on behalf of the European Parliament."
"As you know, on 2 November, the Dutch filmmaker and critical columnist, Theo Van Gogh, was brutally murdered by an Islamic extremist."
"In reaction to this, various attacks have ensued on mosques and Islamic schools in the Netherlands."
"So far, the European Union has failed to condemn these acts of terrorism emphatically as something that affects the whole of Europe."
"There is much speculation as to what the reasons could be."
"Apparently, the Council does not have the courage to hold a debate about Islamic extremism at this moment in time, or the events are being regarded as an exclusively Dutch matter."
"I do not know whether those speculations are true, but a condemnation from the whole of the EU would be very welcome indeed."
"We should not avoid a debate about Islam in Europe, even if it were to unite all moderate forces, religious or otherwise, in order to isolate and fight extremism and racism."
"After all, the events in the Netherlands could occur anywhere in Europe, and the Netherlands and its citizens could really do with the EU’s solidarity and support."
"Mr President, I would like to condemn the fact that yesterday, within European Union territory, specifically in the Spanish city of San Sebastián, Batasuna, a political group which is banned for being part of ETA’s network, held an event which amounted to a celebration of, and an apology for, terrorism, and I wish to express my regret at the fact that neither the Basque autonomous government nor the central government took any measures to prevent that illegal act from taking place."
"Today, the Basque citizens and the citizens of the rest of Spain continue to be amazed, perplexed and, above all, indignant to see no action being taken against this banned group with all the democratic force of the rule of law."
"I would, therefore, urge this Parliament and the European institutions not to let up either in the fight against terrorism nor in the fight against the accomplices of terrorists and I would urge them to condemn them and pursue them in every corner of the European Union."
"Mr President, I want briefly to raise two issues regarding freedom of expression."
"The first is the re-arrest of Mordechai Vanunu in Israel."
"He completed an 18-year sentence – much of which was in solitary confinement – was released and has now been re-arrested on the grounds that he associates with foreigners."
"As he is seeking sanctuary in the cathedral in Jerusalem it is hard for him to do otherwise."
"The second issue I should like to raise concerns the series of raids that have been carried out by FBI agents against 21 independent media outlets, most of them in the European Union."
"Most have been closed down."
"No clear explanation has been given for either of these actions."
"I would remind the House to consider that in troubled times we should be more and not less concerned with liberty and issues of freedom of expression."
"I hope that the authorities here can seek some explanation for these actions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks the Government of the People’s Republic of China has invited the groups in the European Parliament to send delegations for talks."
"I should like to remind you that the previous Parliament, in a formal sitting, heard an address from the Dalai Lama, to which we listened with attention and deep emotion. He spoke to us of the tragedy and the cultural genocide of his people."
"I call on the representatives of all the groups to make it a condition of sending a delegation from their own group to the People’s Republic of China that each delegation should be able to satisfy itself as to the state of the cultural, political and religious freedom of the Tibetan people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about Oswaldo Paya."
"As you know, he was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2002 and, as recently as last year, was prevented four times by Fidel Castro’s regime from coming here to take part in a debate with us on the terrible human rights situation in his country, Cuba."
"I have heard that last Friday, Oswaldo Paya wrote to you, Mr President, and also sent a copy of that letter to President Prodi, to Commissioners Nielson and Patten and to President-designate Barroso."
"The intention, as far as I understand it, is to have this letter distributed to all of the Members of this House, which would be extremely useful, because we are going to debate the Cuba situation tomorrow."
"I have also heard that the Council is set to hold a debate on the Cuba situation in the coming days."
"There is a conspiracy among certain governments against human rights in Cuba and against hopes for democracy in that friendliest of countries."
"It is appalling that this conspiracy continues, even though we have not heard the perspective of Cuban democrats."
"I therefore wish to know if you have received the letter, Mr President, and if you are going to distribute it. I should also like to ask you to pass it on to the Dutch Presidency and to the Council."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the violation of EU citizens’ consumer rights in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and to ask for action to be taken on this matter."
"The fact is that Slovak and Czech establishments and businesses apply a dual-pricing system for tourists who visit their countries."
"Both Polish citizens and citizens of other EU Member States are discriminated against in restaurants, hotels and museums."
"The very same services used by local citizens are offered to foreigners at two or three times the price."
"In practice, this is done by showing a higher price for entry to a museum in the English language price list than in the price list written in the local language."
"The use of different price lists for citizens and foreigners is a violation of the basic consumer rights guaranteed within the EU, as all citizens of the 25 EU Member States are EU citizens, along with Czechs and Slovaks, and they are entitled to the same rights and responsibilities within the EU."
"I therefore call on you, Mr President, as well as on the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and on the Slovak and Czech Governments, to take action on this matter."
"There is no time to lose."
"The winter tourist season is fast approaching, when tens of thousands of tourists will visit Slovakia and the Czech Republic."
"– Mr President, the detection of dioxins, carcinogenic substances, in dairy and animal products produced in Member States of the European Union is a threat to consumers."
"The new food scandal demonstrates that the problem is political and that, before any legislative intervention, we need to get to the root of the matter."
"The laws of mega-profit and speculation which are applied to the management of the food chain are primarily responsible for the deterioration in the quality of food."
"As long as production is intensified, as long as the food chain comes under the guidance and control of the large multinationals in the sector, which determine the method of production and the quality of food on the basis of the cost/benefit ratio, there will never be effective guarantees for consumer health."
"Adopting regulations does not change the nature of production."
"Unless the production process is changed to exclude the use of illegal and dangerous methods of producing, processing and moving food, criminal activities will continue to the detriment of public health."
"The food risks which have come to light recently ..."
"Mr President, I should like to protest at insults suffered by the governments of the Member States at the hands of the European Parliament."
"The Polish nation has had first-hand experience of the two most recent totalitarian regimes, namely Nazi fascism and Communism."
"My nation and my homeland had no time at all to recover."
"It was destroyed not only materially, but also intellectually and spiritually."
"In view of the threat that such totalitarianism could return, I should like to protest against certain comments by Members of this House, especially those by Mr Schulz concerning the Member States’ governments, which he called servants."
"Our nation and homeland are what is most sacred to us, after God and the family."
"That is where our most important values are enshrined."
"Current trends in the European Union promote a world in which people live without homelands and without religion, and where patriotism, culture and language have become almost completely devalued."
"All this being promoted in the name of some sort of soulless common state with a single government. Europe will only be able to develop if it is a Europe of homelands."
"Consequently, the democratically elected governments of the Member States should be respected, by this House in particular."
"A Europe without Christian roots, without religion and without homelands, based merely on Mammon, is not a place where human beings can thrive."
"It is simply heading towards destructive totalitarianism."
"Mr President, I will be a member of this Parliament's delegation to observe next Sunday's run-off presidential election in Ukraine."
"But unless the EU agrees to the long-term possibility of eventual EU membership for that delightful country, it is inevitable that whoever wins has only one economic option: to look east to Moscow."
"Ukraine will then be obliged to implement fully the single economic space with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and possibly even Uzbekistan."
"Once it enters into close free-trade agreements with countries – such as Belarus and Uzbekistan – that have lamentable human rights records and, in particular, if these evolve into a customs union, then its door to EU integration will be irreversibly shut."
"With the possible exception of Mr Berlusconi, no other EU leader is bold enough to make encouraging Euro-Atlantic integration noises to Ukraine."
"It cannot be morally sustainable to open negotiations with Turkey and with western Balkan countries and deny such a right to Ukraine."
"This election, as well as being free, fair and transparent, must also allow the option of long-term EU accession to be part of the Ukrainian people's choice."
"Mr President, during our last session, and after depositing documents with the Serious Fraud Office in London, I advised this House that I had called on the British Government to withhold all future funding of the European Union on the grounds that the British Parliament has never voted to pass public money to third parties who cannot be trusted to account for it properly."
"You later said that such action would be contrary to European Union law."
"A number of questions arise from your claim."
"Are you saying that Member States must pay their dues to the European Union however inadequate the financial controls are?"
"Are you saying that the European Union cannot be forced to account properly to its paymasters?"
"Under the Treaties, Member States shall ‘take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community as they take to counter fraud affecting their own financial interests’."
"Are you saying that those words are in fact meaningless and cannot be enforced?"
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the issue of the additional funds required pursuant to the EU’s current enlargement."
"The political decision to enlarge has obvious financial implications, as there must be a guarantee of additional funding to integrate the new Member States effectively."
"We cannot agree to the proposal to limit the EU budget at a time when it has only just undergone enlargement to include ten new and mainly poor countries."
"Our priority should be to ensure that an appropriate budget is available to strengthen the cohesion of the EU as it currently exists."
"Only then should we make plans for the funding of further enlargements, given that this will require additional resources."
"The next item is the joint debate on the Council statement on the lifting of the embargo on the sale of arms to China and Mr Romeva i Rueda’s report on the Council’s Fifth Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"I now give the floor to Mr Nicolaï, on behalf of the Council."
". Mr President, it is a privilege to be here today to discuss with you an issue to which this Parliament and the Dutch presidency attach great importance: arms export policy and the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"I shall begin with some comments on the report on the Council's Fifth Annual Report and on the motion for a resolution."
"Please allow me to start with some general remarks about the Code of Conduct."
"The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was adopted in 1998, and it is no exaggeration to state that it has become one of the more successful instruments of our common foreign and security policy."
"Arms export policy has traditionally been veiled in secrecy."
"It was considered to be an essential element of undiminished national sovereignty in which interference by others was, to put it mildly, not welcome."
"However, since 1998 we have witnessed increasing transparency, increasing inter-state consultation and increasing harmonisation in the European Union."
"That is impressive progress, and the success of the Code of Conduct is also illustrated by the interest taken in it by third countries."
"I am not only talking about countries aspiring to become Member States of the European Union, but others too."
"The Code of Conduct is a useful tool that can help them establish an efficient and responsible export control policy."
"The Dutch presidency attaches great importance to further harmonisation of the European arms export policy and to making that policy even more transparent."
"One of the priorities of our presidency is the conclusion of the first review of the EU Code of Conduct."
"We hope to be able to finalise this review before the end of the year."
"I stress that I use the words 'first review' on purpose."
"It is important that we see the Code as a living document which should regularly be held up to the light, and take into consideration internal and external developments and views."
"Hence I am sure that this will not be the last review of the Code."
"In its endeavours to enhance transparency, the Dutch presidency has also stressed the importance of increased dialogue with the European Parliament."
"On 1 September the Committee on Foreign Affairs held a debate with the Dutch chairman of the COARM working group on the EU Code of Conduct and the current review."
"The committee's rapporteur, Mr Romeva i Rueda, participated in a conference on the review of the Code on 30 September in The Hague."
"We have also invited Mr Romeva i Rueda to an informal meeting with the COARM working group on 3 December to discuss Parliament's report."
"Furthermore, we have invited Mr Romeva i Rueda to participate in a meeting which the presidency is organising, together with the Czech Government, in Prague, to inform the candidate countries and Norway on the implementation of the Code."
"We think it is important that the parliamentary role in European arms export policy is highlighted in that regard."
"At this point I would like to make some more specific remarks on the draft report and on the motion for a resolution."
"The European Parliament report refers to the Council's 2003 report."
"Since then a lot has happened, most importantly the review of the Code of Conduct."
"Some of the points addressed in the report are being discussed in the framework of this review."
"In this respect I should mention the following points."
"The European Parliament report welcomes the common position on arms brokering."
"In the present review there is already consensus to extend the application of the Code to brokering activities."
"The same is true for licensed production overseas, and transport and trans-shipment."
"Licence applications for these activities will become subject to the criteria and practices set out in the Code of Conduct."
"Furthermore, the Code should also be applicable in cases of so-called intangible transfers of technology."
"Outside the context of the review of the Code of Conduct, we have made progress in areas such as outreach."
"I have already mentioned the seminar in Prague in December."
"In September, Member States agreed on a more coherent approach concerning outreach."
"The Council Secretariat will keep a database on the outreach activities of the individual Member States so as to achieve better coordination."
"Progress has also been made in the further development of the denial notification and consultation system – one of the core elements of the Code."
"Consultations on denials are now taking place in such a way that all Member States are informed about the consultation."
"Only the final decision of a Member State as to whether or not it will undercut the denial is not automatically shared with all the partners."
"Furthermore, an electronic database is being developed by the Council Secretariat, which will contain the denials notified by Member States, as well as information on the consultations they have undertaken."
"This database will contribute greatly to the efficiency of bilateral consultations and the transparency of their outcomes."
"Much time has been devoted to the status of the Code."
"Parliament expresses a clear preference in its report for making the Code legally binding."
"You may be aware that there is no consensus on this issue in the Council: about half of the Member States are in favour of making the Code legally binding, but the other half opposes it."
"However, there is something more important than the question of whether the Code is politically or legally binding. That is the actual content of the Code and the way it is implemented, because changing the status in itself would probably have little or no effect on the arms export policy of individual Member States."
"The Romeva i Rueda report stresses the importance of increased transparency."
"I agree and am therefore pleased that the Council's 2004 Annual Report will be more transparent than previous ones."
"We hope that further steps can be taken, probably as soon as next year."
"The transparency of the national reports is also of importance."
"The Dutch presidency, together with SIPRI, recently organised a meeting with Member States on how to improve national reporting."
"I am sure that subsequent presidencies will follow-up this initiative."
"The resolution also advocates a monitoring system to control end-use."
"This is an area where more work could be done."
"A recent US Government study shows that, in the case of the US, between 15 and 20% of authorised exports to so-called 'vulnerable' destinations do not end in the hands of the indicated end-user."
"We have no figures for the EU, but there is no reason to think they would be dramatically different."
"We will therefore, as a first step, organise a meeting on post-shipment controls where we will be briefed by the US authorities on their experiences with post-shipment control programmes."
"This brings me to probably the most politically sensitive issue."
"I know that the EU arms embargo vis-à-vis China attracts the special attention of this Parliament and of many national parliaments."
"I take note of the appeal in the resolution not to lift the arms embargo."
"The issue of the future of the arms embargo is still under discussion in the Council."
"It is therefore not possible to discuss this issue in detail."
"However, let me say that the Dutch presidency is well aware of the various concerns expressed by parliaments, the public, NGOs and also by important partners like the US and Japan."
"One such concern is the human rights situation in China."
"The EU takes every opportunity to discuss human rights issues with China, and monitors carefully the developments on the ground."
"All these concerns are taken into account in the discussion."
"We are also discussing measures supplementary to the Code of Conduct that should prevent an increase in the flow of arms and military technology from Europe to China should the embargo be lifted."
"The aim of these measures is to increase transparency and intensify consultation among Member States."
"It is not yet clear when this discussion will be concluded."
"In conclusion, the Dutch presidency is pleased to see that the European Parliament pays so much attention to the important issue of arms export policy."
"As I said earlier, increased dialogue on this issue between the Council and Parliament is one of the objectives of our presidency."
"Progress has been made or is under way on many of the points mentioned in the report and the resolution."
"There are areas where further progress is possible."
"The transparency of the national reports is one; harmonisation of the interpretation of the criteria is another."
"However, we can say that the glass is already more than half full."
"Please be assured that the Netherlands will do its utmost in the remaining six weeks of its presidency to fill the glass even fuller."
". First of all, I apologise for appearing in front of the House for yet another farewell appearance."
"I am starting to know what Frank Sinatra must have felt like, as he staggered on making farewell appearances until he was into his seventies."
"I hope this really is the last afternoon that the House will have to endure me, but that is in Parliament's hands."
"As Members know, given the way in which the common foreign and security policy operates, this is not an issue on which the Commission takes a lead."
"Nevertheless, we have an obvious interest in the overall development of our relations with China, which by and large are excellent, and the arms embargo naturally operates in that context."
"As Parliament knows, the embargo was imposed by the European Council in 1989, following the events in Tiananmen Square, the early stages of which I was able to witness at first hand as the then vice-chairman of the Asia Development Bank."
"This year, China has intensified its campaign to have the ban lifted."
"That campaign continues in the run-up to the summit between the European Union and China next month."
"The Chinese authorities consider the embargo to be evidence of discrimination against them; they argue that the ban is obsolete."
"They claim that it severely hinders the further development of bilateral relations."
"Whilst we have acknowledged that positive change has occurred and that the political situation in China has moved on since Tiananmen, China's observance of some basic human rights, notably in the area of political and civil rights, continues to fall well short of international norms."
"Without making any direct link we have, therefore, consistently told the Chinese authorities at the highest level that the lifting of the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take the sort of concrete steps in the field of human rights that would convince the European public that that was an appropriate course of action."
"I know that a number of Member States are favourably disposed towards lifting the embargo and have made that view public."
"Others believe that it is premature, citing concerns about human rights."
"Human rights were an issue that figured prominently in the resolution passed by this House last year against lifting the ban."
"Those Member States arguing for lifting the ban use the rationale that the controls introduced in the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on arms sales render it nugatory."
"I acknowledge that this argument is not without substance."
"I am very keen to move forward with our important strategic partnership with China, a country that is rapidly emerging as a global player across the board, and is now, amongst other things, our second largest trading partner."
"That is one of our top foreign policy goals in the years to come."
"That said, given the underlying logic of the embargo and the significant political and symbolic issues involved for both sides, it is understandable that some Member States argue that the lifting of the ban should take place against a background of positive and tangible steps by China to improve its human rights situation."
"I should also like to say a few words on the European Parliament’s report on the operation of the EU’s Code of Conduct on arms exports."
"The strength of the Code of Conduct is closely related to the China embargo debate, since it will guide Member States' export practice if the ban is lifted."
"Responsibility for the arms trade currently rests with Member States, but the Commission is fully associated with its consideration under the common foreign and security policy."
"I commend the rapporteur for putting together a substantial document which merits very careful attention."
"It challenges Member States to attain more stringent standards on the control of arms exports."
"Amongst other things, it asks for more transparency, not something that is normally immediately associated with the arms trade."
"It also seeks further controls and limitations on such trade, inherently difficult areas for those Member States with significant arms industries."
"Whilst the report focuses primarily on improvement in European practice, its scope is global."
"Recognising the European Union’s potential to promote best practice around the world, it advocates, among other things, an international arms trade treaty."
"We should not forget – and I am sure Parliament has not – the sobering fact that around half a million people die each year as a result of violence linked to small arms and light weapons."
"As you are well aware, the Commission is regularly involved, with other international organisations and NGOs, in dealing with the consequences of inappropriate or illegal arms sales."
"We are also implementing some specific projects to reduce destabilising accumulations of weapons around the world."
"A pilot project initiated by the European Parliament is under way to see what else can be done. More certainly needs to be done."
"I particularly support the idea of an international agreement to strengthen the control of conventional arms sales."
"That is why the Commission has, as part of wider EU efforts, strongly supported the adoption of an international Code of Conduct on arms exports based on the European Union’s initiative."
"Member States are currently considering how to improve the Code of Conduct and we are encouraging these efforts to strengthen EU controls on conventional arms sales."
"The success of this endeavour will be a factor in the ongoing China arms embargo debate."
"We all know the importance of China as an economic partner and a political player in the world in the coming decades."
"China is, to a considerable extent, regaining the position that it had in the world until the middle of the 19th century, when it was still responsible for probably 30% of global GDP."
"The historic recovery we are witnessing is, on the whole, extraordinarily beneficial to the rest of the world."
"China's integration as an open economy into the world economy is good for all of us."
"It is not in any way demeaning to us or the Chinese if we regularly make it clear that there are other issues that concern us, such as issues of human rights."
"I am sure we shall in due course see an improvement as the political situation in China matches the economic one."
"It is impossible these days for any country to remain completely self-contained."
"It is impossible for a country to open up its economy whilst keeping politics under absolutely rigid control."
"I look forward to a more intimate relationship with China in the years ahead. I hope China will continue to play a positive role in the international community."
"I look forward to a serious dialogue with China about human rights, leading to improvements of which I am sure Mr Sun Yat-Sen would have approved."
"Thank you Mr Patten, this is an important issue and we must move on to the debate. Nevertheless, I cannot resist saying that you are somewhat like Frank Sinatra: we never grow tired of your goodbyes."
". Mr President, I would like once again to thank both Mr Nicolaï and Mr Patten, not only for being here today, but also for having spoken so clearly and frankly, and I hope that will set the tone for our subsequent dialogue."
"We in this Parliament frequently condemn violations of human rights in different parts of the world and we frequently adopt resolutions to that effect."
"We have condemned murders, torture, abuse and wars, and we constantly condemn the extreme poverty in the world suffered by thousands of peoples and millions of people."
"Meanwhile, our governments are still authorising arms exports, which not only makes these people’s situation even worse, but also leads the buyers to spend huge sums of money for military purposes, when the social and development priorities of their countries require that it be spent elsewhere."
"In 2000 in New York, 189 countries signed the Millennium Declaration committing themselves, between 2015 and 2050, to putting an end to poverty, guaranteeing universal access to essential medicines and equal opportunities for men and women, as well as ensuring universal literacy and primary schooling, amongst many other things."
"In order to achieve these objectives, the governments must dedicate at least USD 60 000 million per year to the application of that Millennium Agenda."
"Nevertheless, despite the fact that it is extremely difficult to find money for these purposes, world military spending between 2002 and 2003 increased by USD 64 000 million, and between 2003 and 2004 a further USD 50 000 million had to be added."
"The countries of the European Union, which export a third of the world’s conventional arms, have a considerable responsibility here."
"In 2002, which the report we are discussing refers to, the European Union sold arms and military equipment worth EUR 21 000 million to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Morocco, India, Pakistan, Angola, Turkey, Iran, Algeria, Colombia, Israel and also Iraq, as well as many other countries, which, according to a strict interpretation of the European Union’s Code of Conduct, should not be buying European arms."
"Where is the problem?"
"It has already been mentioned; the problem lies in the fact that, on the one hand, that code is still too vague and, on the other, that it is not yet a legally-binding instrument and criminal penalties cannot, therefore, be applied in the event of its violation."
"The European Parliament has always been the most pioneering of the European institutions in terms of demanding that European arms exports be governed by a strict code of conduct and at the same time that these exports be consistent with the European Union’s constant messages in favour of preventing armed conflict and promoting peace and development."
"So, after ten years of working professionally on this issue, I must congratulate the Dutch Presidency in particular on the efforts it is making, not only on the review of the code of conduct, but also in terms of making this text much braver, more consistent and, ultimately, more effective."
"But it is not yet sufficient and we must therefore remember – as the report points out – that we must insist on the need to revise the text of the code, to make it stricter, to demand that it become a legally-binding instrument – although we do not yet have consensus, we must work to achieve it – to demand that governments increase transparency and improve the information they provide on authorisations and refusals of licences, to call for the code also to be applied to the export of material which can be used for torture or executions, to demand that the European Union create instruments to improve the registers of arms intermediaries, whether they operate from the European Union or whether they are registered strictly within it, and that the legislation controlling exports be harmonised upwards."
"Finally, amongst many other things, the report calls for the European Union to co-lead at international level the adoption of an international arms treaty."
"Finally, since this debate is taking place at a time when certain European governments are suggesting that we need to lift the arms embargo on China, we should take this opportunity to once again reiterate that it would be a mistake to do this."
"There are at least three reasons for this: the clearly unsatisfactory human rights situation in that country, which has been condemned many times by several NGOs; the fact that, since China is the world’s top importer of conventional arms, broadening the military market even further would undoubtedly speed up the arms race in the region and, finally, the numerous risks of aggravating certain unresolved conflicts such as that between China and Taiwan or the pressure being put on Tibet – which has yet to be clarified."
"For all these reasons, I would appeal to the Council not just to listen, but to take into account and respect this Parliament’s proposals and recommendations, with a view to eliminating once and for all the blatant contradiction of, on the one hand, complaining about poverty, wars and violations of human rights, while on the other, fanning the flames of violence in many places through our arms and our silence, something which is incomprehensible to millions of victims."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to arm or to develop, that is the question."
"We estimate that arms imports in fact account for over 20% of the developing countries’ debt."
"In those countries, military spending often far exceeds the health budget or the education budget, and sometimes it even exceeds both put together."
"It is therefore crucial to these countries’ sustainable development that they significantly stem the flow of arms imports."
"It is not possible to live for very long in a world in which USD 900 billion goes on military spending, whereas only USD 325 billion is spent on agricultural subsidies and only USD 60 billion is set aside for development aid."
"Against this backdrop, to take just one example, between 1995 and 2001 in Sub-Saharan Africa, military spending rose by 47% and life expectancy fell by four years."
"Yes, the European Union’s Code of Conduct on arms exports has existed since 1998."
"Yes, EU countries have made progress."
"As a matter of urgency, however, we must go further, especially given that other powers, such as the United States, Russia and China, do not practise such self-restraint."
"I feel that the measures laid down by Parliament’s Committee on International Trade will indeed make it possible for us to go further, even if they fall short of what some of us had hoped for."
"It is essential that these measures be adopted because they will help us to establish a different mindset."
"I should like to give particular mention to the complete harmonisation of the policy on Member States’ arms exports in the medium term, helping arms manufacturers to change direction and diversify into other products in order to prevent social crises and the loss of skills, the creation of a European agency for the control of arms exports and, most importantly, the creation of a tax on arms exports that will benefit the victims of conflict and the fight against poverty."
"Consequently, if the EU adopted those proposals and turned them into practical legal measures, that would represent considerable progress and would provide the impetus for putting pressure on countries such as the United States, China, Ukraine, Russia and Israel."
"What would be even more effective would be if all of this could lead to measures aimed at controlling the origin of capital in tax havens set up in EU territory. By doing that, we would be taking a step towards saving the human race."
"I should like to conclude, if I may, by quoting Albert Einstein: ‘Either the human race will destroy arms, or arms will destroy the human race’."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to say how happy I am that we still have the chance to see Commissioner Patten in the plenary."
"I feel the same way as he does about Frank Sinatra: I keep on hearing his voice, and Commissioner Patten’s as well."
"Passing on to arms exports, while I think we really can be justified in saying that the Code of Conduct has resulted in progress where arms exports are concerned, I must also say that this progress has not been enough."
"We are very pleased to learn that the Presidency of the Council is conducting negotiations with a view to clarifying a number of points in the Code, and I hope that these negotiations will have a successful outcome."
"I also see it as very important that these rules should cover not only sales, but also their mediation and brokerage."
"It is not, however, the legal basis that is the actual problem where arms exports are concerned; the real problem lies in the different ways in which these legal bases are applied in the various countries within the European Union."
"It is on this problem that we must focus our efforts — for a start, by declaring the Code to be legally binding."
"If this cannot be done at Community level, there is nothing to prevent the Member States from doing it, and, indeed, a number of them already have done so."
"This is the road down which we must go; whilst, on the one hand, we must aim to eventually stop treating intra-Community transfers of defence equipment as exports, this can be done only when every country in the European Community applies the rules relating to this uniformly and with rigour."
"Let me now turn to the question of the embargo on China."
"My group takes the view that this strategic partnership with China is what will take us into the future, and that we must seek to bring it about."
"We are aware, though, that there are a few problems left outstanding, such as China’s approach to human rights, problems that have to do with Taiwan and Tibet, and so my group’s position is that the conditions are not yet in place that would allow us to lift this embargo on China."
", Mr President, I should like to join in thanking the Presidency and, in particular, Mr Patten."
"We are very sorry because the EU could still benefit from ‘his way’."
"Whilst the proliferation of nuclear arms calls to mind apocalyptic scenarios, the fanning of the flames of conflict by the trade in conventional arms does incalculable harm to the development of many communities, and leads to death and to the violation of the human rights of millions of civilians throughout the world."
"According to the strategic safety approach adopted by the EU, the main threats that we must address are regional instability, failing states, organised crime and international terrorism, all of which are threats that might be exacerbated by unchecked arms exports to buyers outside the EU."
"In recent years, we have seen efforts by EU Member States to improve controls on exports of conventional arms originating in, or passing through, Europe."
"There remains much to do, however."
"As Socialists, we argue that the Code of Conduct on arms exports must become binding, and that national and European legislation must be adopted with a view to increasing transparency in the activity of arms brokering."
"The scope of the prohibition of exports of certain instruments, such as those used in torture, or anti-personnel mines, must be widened."
"The sale of arms to governments or groups in conflict zones must be subject to tighter control, in light of information obtained by the control mechanisms set up by the United Nations Security Council to enforce arms embargos."
"EU governments have a responsibility – one that they must not shirk – to press ahead with internal laws aimed at ensuring that companies and individuals breaking arms embargos declared by the EU or by the UN Security Council are seen to be punished."
"As Socialists, we support measures to mitigate the effects of the arms trade, such as the creation of a tax to assist victims of armed conflict and to combat poverty, as recently proposed in the current UN General Assembly."
"The EU can and must go further. With measures such as those identified in this Resolution – of which we voted in favour – and extending the binding enforcement of the Code of Conduct, not only to our partners in the enlarged Europe, but also to our new neighbours, so that there can be a common European arms market, in which the recently set up European Arms Agency plays a control and regulation role."
"As Socialists, we have tabled practical amendments on this Motion for a Resolution calling on the Council and Member States to maintain the arms embargo on the People’s Republic of China and to ensure a coherent approach as regards arms embargos in general."
"The embargo was imposed following the Tiananmen Square massacre and has been maintained ever since, due to the serious human rights problems that persist in China. This is despite the fact that China has opened up to the outside world and has recorded extraordinary economic growth."
"In 2003, Parliament delivered an opinion through a specific resolution on this issue and recommended maintaining the embargo."
"Parliament’s reports, along with those of various human rights non-governmental organisations, have, year after year, highlighted grave concern over human rights violations in China and Tibet."
"One resolution on the suitability of the arms embargo as a means of bringing about significant change cannot lead to a lifting of the arms embargo, at least for as long as there is no binding Code of Conduct on the export of arms and instruments that may be used for internal repression and torture."
"The entire scheme must be consistent in this area, yet the recent decision to lift the arms embargo on Libya is inconsistent and leaves the EU open to accusations of double standards."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Romeva Rueda’s report is an especially balanced one, containing plenty of interesting recommendations on how to improve the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, and it is to be hoped that the Council will take them on board this time."
"Only then can the Code become an efficient and effective instrument of control, legally binding, and with sanctions for non-compliance."
"Let me make specific reference to paragraph 20 of the report, which calls for the EU to maintain its embargo on China."
"Lifting the embargo now would be an especially poor message; it would, I think, be a classic example of hypocrisy and of a selective approach to the defence and protection of human rights around the world."
"The values and standards by which the EU sets such store would then once again be taking second place to crude mercantilism."
"The prospect of fat juicy orders for German submarines and French aircraft appears to be reason enough for some to thwart the arms embargo on China."
"To do so would make the EU look like a horse-trader selling his principles for a handful of pieces of silver, and that, Mr Nicolaï, is just not on under a Dutch presidency."
"Europe cannot, indeed, supply weapons to a country seeking to use military force to secure the unity of its territory and now making continual threats of military action in the Straits of Taiwan, where over five hundred rockets have been set up."
"The idea that the Code of Conduct could impose tight restrictions on arms exports is thus a false excuse."
"The risk of China passing on weaponry to developing countries has not gone away."
"No matter what, the lifting of the arms embargo cannot be an option for our group."
". Personally, I am delighted with the words I have heard from Members of this House and I note that Parliament has certainly adopted a wise attitude."
"I should like to say to Mr von Wogau – whom I congratulate on his position on the lifting of the embargo, in other words, his desire not to lift it – that at the same time the restrictive nature of the Code cannot be left in the hands of the Member States."
"It is clear that certain Heads of Government have few scruples when it comes to China."
"Have we not heard Mr Chirac say that the embargo belonged to a different era?"
"In this context, I should call on these Heads of State, whose eyes have clearly been opened wide by the enormous market that China represents, to go and take a closer look at what is happening in stadiums, at what is happening in Iveco trucks and at what is happening in a number of places where summary executions are carried out."
"I feel that China is the current world champion of human rights violations and, failing that, the world champion of capital punishment, which goes on unchecked and in entirely unacceptable extrajudicial conditions. I should like to ask if violating the Code, which, as everyone has said, the lifting of the arms embargo on China would represent, should not also be condemned if expressed verbally, as some Heads of State have done."
"I welcome the fact that the Council is seeking to reform the Code and urge strenuous efforts to prevent such statements, which clearly harm the credibility of many policies pursued by the EU in the field of respect for human rights."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a great risk that this debate will become an annual ritual, in which we declare ourselves more or less of one mind, but all that remains afterwards is a list of good intentions and recommendations to the Commission and the Council."
"In order to avoid this it is absolutely necessary that the Code of Conduct should become legally binding and that we set out strict sanctions against businesses registered in the European Union which do not respect it."
"It is also essential for the Union to commit itself to demanding that other countries, such as the United States, Russia and China, adhere to the Code of Conduct, in view of the fact, as well, that over 50% of world arms manufacturing takes place in countries that are members of the UN Security Council."
"As we speak, my country, Italy, has increased its arms exports by 25% in one year and is forecasting a 40% increase in future."
"Among the greatest beneficiaries of the Italian arms trade is Saudi Arabia, which is certainly not an example of a country that is respectful of rights."
"I believe that we certainly must maintain the embargo on arms sales to China, and, moreover, that the protection of human rights must take absolute priority over the economic interests of profit."
"One final observation: last year, world military spending equalled 900 billion dollars, 700 billion dollars of which was spent in the civilised countries of the first world alone."
"That is not the kind of civilisation that we want!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate, and indeed debates on values are particularly important in the European Union."
"As we are talking of values with regard to this particular case, however, I should like to draw your attention to a number of other cases."
"Poland, which at the time was experiencing difficulties, was once persuaded by one of the most important countries in the world to stop sending arms to a South-East Asian country."
"In agreeing to this, Poland did significant damage to its economic potential."
"The country in question promptly took advantage of the opening left by Poland, and made a clear profit in doing so."
"The Code of Conduct is a necessary and rational solution, but I should like to emphasise at this point that if it is to serve any useful purpose, it must be formally binding throughout the European Union."
"An international agreement must also be signed, and the latter should at least be approved by the United States and Russia."
"If it turns out that by taking the lead we will impoverish our societies and economies in the name of the so-called values at which we excel, and that others will take our place, increasing their advantage over our economies and the opportunities we have to influence the global situation, we will actually reduce our chances of improving the enforcement of human rights throughout the world."
"I am in favour of lifting sanctions against China, as they are ineffective and reduce the EU’s opportunities for economic development."
"Mr President – I was about to say Minister – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has to react to a situation where half a million people die each year from violence related to light weapons, both in armed conflicts and in connection with criminal activity."
"This debate is part of our reaction."
"The European Union exports death, although it must be said that it exports it mainly out of Europe, as during the past five years as much as 80% of EU arms exports went to countries outside Europe."
"We should not let ourselves be carried away by the wishful thinking of pacifists who would like to rid the world of wars and arms, as such fancies lack any basis in reality."
"We can and must control the production and sale of arms in the EU, however."
"We must also be firm in demanding this of the future EU Member States."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs has adopted amendments I tabled to this effect."
"The countries involved are of course Romania and Bulgaria, and also Croatia and Turkey."
"As a Polish citizen, I should like to draw your attention to an initiative taken by the Polish Government."
"Together with the Swedish Government, it has already organised five informal meetings of COARM, the Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports, with the participation of both old and new Member States."
"I should also like to lend my wholehearted support to item 28 of the motion for a resolution, concerning an export ban on all equipment used for the death penalty and torture."
"At the same time, however, I have my doubts as to whether the proposal in item 40, concerning a special tax on the arms trade, is realistic."
"I do not believe that a further tax would help bring about peace in Europe and the world, although it might appease the consciences of bureaucrats."
"Mr President, it may even be true that the embargo against China seems anachronistic, especially after the lifting of the embargo against Libya, which is certainly not a model of respect for human rights."
"It is also understandable that China, a sovereign state, should seek to reinforce its defences to protect its security and territorial integrity."
"It is also true that a little progress has been made in improving respect for human rights, and that China remains a protagonist in the fight against terrorism and is exerting useful pressure on North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons."
"However, it is also true that Beijing is trying to exploit the differences between ourselves and the United States on the subject."
"I am astonished that no one in this House has drawn attention to this dimension: our transatlantic relationship, which for us must remain of primary importance, will be affected by the more or less unified approach that we adopt towards the growing power of China."
"We also need to take account of the strategic, albeit precarious balance that currently exists in the Taiwan Strait."
"Taiwan is a model of democracy from which China is still very far removed."
"If, therefore, we intend to lift the embargo for reasons of , for economic and political reasons, rather than out of respect for democracy, we should be able to do so only by binding the Chinese People’s Republic to clear and continuous progress on human rights, as the Commission’s representative has moreover said today."
"We must try at least to discuss – I do not mean harmonise – our position with that of the United States and those European countries that are currently opposed to removing the embargo."
"I consider it essential that our approach to this issue should be as unified and as concerted as possible."
"Mr President, the supply of weapons from EU Member States to third countries needs to comply with a common, clear, and binding framework that must be capable of being tested."
"That is of course a requirement if we want to bring about a truly responsible European policy."
"It is quite simply a pity, as Mr Nicolaï said, that a number of countries are still resolutely standing in the way of a binding framework of this kind."
"Three important test criteria are a conventional human rights policy and of course the resultant practice in a given country, regional tensions in a specific field and also the ratio between what a country spends, on the one hand, on combating poverty, and, on the other, on its defence budget."
"It is against these yardsticks that the attempt by China – and now also by a number of countries within Europe – to have the arms embargo lifted must be measured."
"The human rights situation is still a matter of concern to the EU, and rightly so."
"China may well have signed up to essential treaties, but what it does in practice is another matter."
"The treatment of dissidents, of ethnic and religious minorities, and the large-scale imposition of the death penalty are, to put it simply, very worrying."
"Tight restrictions on freedom of expression and on workers’ rights, as well as on the right to form trade unions and to go on strike are also still giving cause for serious concern."
"The second point about regional development is also self-evident."
"Tensions are apparent at the level of global politics."
"Let me conclude with the economic aspect."
"China is of course undergoing enormous social changes and is, in economic terms, extremely dynamic; it is also characterised by hardworking capitalism on a vast scale, and by massive economic growth."
"In this, a lot of people have lost out, though; there is inequality in the shape of some 200 million people in search of work, living below the poverty level, accompanied by all the social unrest that results from that."
"In such a situation, economic change needs to go hand in hand with fundamental political reforms and social democracy, so I wholeheartedly endorse the position my group has taken in this House, that being that the arms embargo must not be lifted now, while also stressing the need for dialogue with China, which is a towering actor in both economic and political terms."
"We in Europe must try to foster the process of democratisation and offer to help resolve social problems."
"We must help China to play its part as a global actor effectively and fairly, for that is in the interests of the international legal system."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, it is always good to see you again."
"The arms embargo against China was the EU’s response to the events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989."
"It was our way of showing our abhorrence of what happened to thousands of peaceful demonstrating students."
"Since then, the world has changed."
"China has changed, but not the regime."
"China is the world’s largest dictatorship."
"Hundreds of thousands of dissidents are oppressed or imprisoned in labour camps."
"The country leads the world in terms of executions; human rights are infringed every day; freedom of expression is severely restricted, and all opposition is in principle banned."
"The regime would thus seem not to be changing, and now we are discussing whether we should lift the embargo, in spite of the fact that no changes have occurred."
"What kind of signals does this send to the surrounding world and to China?"
"China presents good trade opportunities, and we must trade with China; but we must not forget with whom we are dealing."
"We cannot betray all the thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of democracy activists, political prisoners and young people who secretly surf the Net to find out what is really happening."
"All these people have their hopes pinned on Europe."
"Are we to betray them by selling weapons to the regime that oppresses them?"
"Are we to have European missiles and submarines directed against the Democratic Republic of Taiwan?"
"No, we must be consistent."
"It is our credibility that is at stake, and that is more important than the French mirage aircraft, the Swedish JAS Gripen or German submarines."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is counting upon you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to stand up for human rights and retain the embargo and to send that message to the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to emphasise to this House today that the Code of Conduct is, as Mr Nicolaï rightly said, a very important instrument, but let us be realistic."
"Day-to-day practice – and I include my own country in this – indicates that there are still plenty of loopholes, that definitions are unclear, that prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and that commercial considerations all too often take precedence over respect for human rights."
"The result of that is suffering to an unacceptable degree, an unacceptable number of people suffering oppression, and an unacceptable number of people killed."
"Hence, therefore, our House’s justifiable demand for a stricter formulation; hence also the justifiable demand for this Code to be made binding in law; hence also the need for more monitoring, including of end-users."
"That is why it is right that the embargo on China should remain in place, and so countries such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Scandinavian countries, Poland and the Czech Republic, which, in the Council, are still saying that they want the embargo to stay, have my full support."
"Stand firm, Mr Nicolaï, and do not lift the embargo, neither at the EU-China summit on 8 December nor at the European Council on 17 December."
"We are all right behind you."
"Mr President, even to consider lifting the arms embargo on China is in fact an outrage that cries out to Heaven."
"Contrary to what one speaker has just argued, the arms embargo is no anachronism."
"Maintaining the embargo is, first and foremost, about human rights."
"It is not about China’s immense population, and the extraordinarily interesting economic potential it offers, inducing us to suddenly throw our principles in human rights matters overboard."
"If France – to name but one country – gets what it wants and the embargo on China is lifted, the European Union will lose all the credibility it has."
"This is not just a human rights issue; it is also about the fact that China constitutes a positive threat to Taiwan, which is a democratic country."
"Over 600 rockets are trained on Taiwan, and it is disgraceful that we are even contemplating supplying new weaponry to a country that is threatening a democracy in such a fashion."
"Mr President, Mr Nicolaï, Commissioner Patten, while the Council’s representative has been very frank in laying bare the ongoing disputes between two groups within it, I think the important thing for us has to be proper consideration, at the Summit, of the fundamentals of our relationship with China."
"It is on this that the Presidency should try to agree, while acknowledging that, although there have indeed been improvements over recent years in the way in which human rights are handled in the People’s Republic of China, they have not gone anything like far enough."
"It is evident from the way in which religious freedom, freedom of assembly and association and the freedom of the press continue to be brutally repressed in the People’s Republic of China that it simply is not enough to cast a veil of economic interest over it."
"I therefore call on the Council to draw a clear line here and to say that we acknowledge the improvements, but that they are utterly inadequate."
"China, under its new leadership, must make the first move."
"I agree with the previous speakers that we cannot lift the arms embargo while prominent representatives of the government in Beijing are threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, as they did yesterday."
"It is not acceptable that armed force across the Taiwan Strait should be a means of making policy."
"Commissioner Patten has always shown us the right way to go."
"We have always called for political dialogue between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan – a political dialogue on which both states must embark."
"I hope that the Chinese political leadership will indeed take the first approach, that of resuming dialogue through association."
"At a time when the People’s Republic of China is threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message."
"I think we are all agreed on that, and, at the Summit, the Council should do some straight talking to that effect."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to welcome the progress made with regard to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, but it is still a sad fact that 500 000 people die each year as a result of the use of small arms and light weapons."
"These are, in my view, the real weapons of mass destruction in the world today."
"It is extraordinary that while we know that 20% of the weapons that the United States sells fall into the wrong hands, we have no statistics whatsoever on the quantity of arms exports from the European Union that fall into the wrong hands."
"We have no idea of the extent to which we are responsible for the 500 000 deaths resulting from the use, and indeed misuse, of small arms exports."
"On the question of China, it is neither wise nor indeed feasible to believe that we can ignore or isolate China."
"Nevertheless, it is important that we maintain pressure on the Chinese Government to improve the political and human rights situation in China."
"It is therefore necessary to maintain the embargo and indeed to tie it in with making our own Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally binding."
"Mr President, I am anxious to contribute to this debate to emphasise two main points."
"First of all, there is nothing wrong with legitimate arms trade and legitimate EU arms exports consistent with a working code of conduct."
"Secondly and more importantly, effective control of arms exports is an essential part of a coherent policy that meets EU objectives on peace, respect for human rights and democracy."
"As many speakers have said, conventional arms kill more that half a million people a year, that is one person every minute."
"There are 639 million small arms in circulation in the world produced by over one thousand companies in a least 98 countries."
"It is essential therefore that the EU have a strict arms code policy that equates with EU values if we are to offer global leadership on this issue."
"The EU must also continue to promote an international code of conduct."
"The export of small arms in particular to third countries which do not uphold values of democracy and human rights creates greater instability, not just in the regions to which the arms are exported, but for the world as a whole."
"It is a fact that uncontrolled arms exports undermine global security."
"The voluntary code of conduct in the European Union has had some success; we need to build on that success."
"Continuing the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on a voluntary basis in the future does not go far enough."
"I support the recommendation that the voluntary code becomes a legally binding one."
"This would be a bold step but one that can allow the European Union to increase its control, in a more realistic way, over the export of arms from European Union countries."
"I would like to comment on the recommendations in the report that a tax be imposed on arms exports."
"It is my view that if the industry in Europe abides by a binding code of conduct and the only arms being traded are legitimate and consistent with that code, it is then inappropriate to burden the industry with an extra tax."
"With regard to the lifting of the embargo on arms in China, I support the rapporteur's view that the ban should remain in place."
"While I welcome and support the dialogue and the development of a positive relationship between the European Union and China, removal of the arms embargo in the immediate term is still premature."
". – Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the Council's proposal to lift the arms embargo on China."
"I want to ask everyone, has any foreign state threatened China?"
"If yes, then which one?"
"If no, then why are modern arms needed by a state which is known for its neglect of human rights, its one party dictatorship and the absence of the rule of law."
"Since when did the European Union decide to arm communist dictatorships?"
"We have seen how the People's Republic of China threatened and continues to threaten a democratic state like Taiwan with military invasion."
"If we wish to avoid fanning additional flames of tension in that region, then we must approve the document prepared by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which recommends that the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China is not lifted."
"Otherwise we can expect one more conflict, to which, no doubt, we would react with some sort of new resolution."
"But that would have no effect."
"When talking about a code, it must be said that it ought to be legally binding."
"Otherwise it will only be an empty collection of papers."
"Mr President, British Conservatives believe that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports has worked well as a politically binding instrument since it came into being in 1998, but there is scope for some improvement and refinement."
"However, we are opposed to the Code becoming legally binding."
"We sense that there are often fine political decisions to be made and that these are best taken by politically accountable ministers rather than by judges."
"Some of the information on which decisions are based is highly sensitive and confidential and should remain within the domain of government."
"We certainly would not wish to see the European Court of Justice involved in this area."
"In any case, a legally binding ban would merely present another opportunity for certain states to exercise their hypocrisy, as we have seen, for example, with the efforts by some to evade the European Union's targeted sanctions against regimes in Zimbabwe and Burma or, indeed, the efforts by certain states to circumvent UN sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq."
"If we look at the Romeva i Rueda report, some of its provisions would simply be counterproductive if adopted."
"For example, it calls for the publication of information on the number of licences refused, stating the reasons for refusal."
"The published details on licence applications that have been denied would give unscrupulous arms manufacturers and dealers knowledge about which goods are wanted by whom – effectively a rogue traders' customer list."
"We already have adequate laws in the United Kingdom, but want to encourage other states to meet our own high standards."
"You can be sure that any new EU law would be gold-plated and rigorously enforced in Britain but ignored in other countries."
"We spend a lot of time policing ourselves in Europe, but the main problems are countries which are not bound by any scruples or international rules."
"Mr President, every year arms kill hundreds of thousands of people and cause immeasurable human suffering."
"Not only are unlawful killings in wartime on the increase, but equipment is being misused by soldiers, paramilitaries and police to kill, wound and commit terrible atrocities against civilians in peacetime as well."
"On current trends, by 2020 the number of deaths and injuries from war and violence will overtake the number of deaths caused by diseases such as malaria and measles."
"Although the EU Code of Conduct was welcome as a first step, export controls across the EU still have many weaknesses and loopholes and we need the political will to implement the changes required to add to and tighten up the Code criteria, to regulate licensed production overseas, to apply the Code to weapons components, to strengthen arms embargoes and to ensure that all EU Member States publish annual reports on arms exports, which Austria, Greece and Luxembourg have failed to do."
"Otherwise the rules will continue to be bypassed."
"For example, the helicopters used against civilians and insurgents by the security forces in Nepal contain EU components."
"German Deutsche AG diesel engines bypass EU embargoes by going to China and to Burma and the production of military small arms has been shifted to Malaysia, a country that has aggressive export plans for these arms and would not be subject to the EU Code."
"As already indicated in operative provision 11, this should not stop at Europe."
"The British Conservatives hypocritically preach that others should do what they claim is done in Britain."
"I am proud of what Britain has done, but I want to see an international arms trade treaty."
"They will not support that in this resolution."
"Finally, I should like to endorse the view expressed in this debate that there are many hurdles to be overcome before the embargo against China can be lifted."
"First, it is crucial that any decision to lift the embargo should not adversely affect stability across the Taiwan Straits."
"Second, we need to understand fully the impact on the flow of arms if the embargo is lifted."
"Third, we should express our continuing concerns about China's human rights record and any decision must be subject to its progress in meeting human rights standards."
". I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament for their remarks on this very important matter."
"Let me start with the sensitive issue of China."
"Strong opinions have been expressed about human rights and other concerns, such as regional conflicts."
"It was stressed that the Council should not lift the arms embargo on China, with almost all the Members of Parliament present expressing the same sentiments."
"Mr Van Hecke mentioned the Dutch position."
"However, everyone knows that I am here not as a representative of the Dutch Government, but of the Council presidency."
"Nevertheless, the Dutch Government is facing a very critical Dutch Parliament, which is almost unanimously of the same opinion as this Parliament."
"That is also the case in other countries."
"I listened very closely to your remarks and share many of your concerns on this matter."
"These are currently also being voiced in the Council, and I must make it clear that even if this embargo is lifted, a restrictive EU export policy will be applied."
"It is important to be aware of that."
"With regard to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, many Members of Parliament mentioned the issue of the Code's status and stressed the importance of it being legally binding."
"Mr Van Orden, on the other hand, mentioned the issue of judicial consequences and the possible increase of the role of judges, which is also under discussion in the Council."
"I understand the arguments but you must be aware that positions are divided in the Council."
"The content of the Code and how we implement it is of greater importance than its status, which would probably have no effect on the arms export policy of the individual Member States."
"I agree with Mr Czarnecki, who stressed the importance of aspiring Member States applying the Code of Conduct."
"That is one of the reasons that the presidency organised a seminar to help these countries in that respect."
"Mr Agnoletto stressed the importance of urging other countries – the Russian Federation and the US – to apply this Code."
"We are in regular contact with these countries, aiming to maximise cooperation in this field, thus making export policy more efficient."
"Mr von Wogau raised the issue of differences in the interpretation of the criteria, which is indeed an important point."
"I agree and have already told Parliament that harmonisation of the application of the criteria is an important objective."
"In another question, Mr Henin asked about post-shipment controls."
"As I stated in my initial remarks, post-shipment controls are essential to ensuring that arms go where they are meant to go and do not fall into the wrong hands."
"Unlike the US, the EU Member States do not apply such controls, at least not on a regular and systematic basis."
"This issue has been identified as a priority in the Sixth EU Arms Export report."
"As a first step Member States will in the near future organise a meeting with US experts in order to be briefed on the US programme."
"On the basis of this briefing, Member States will have to decide how best to move forward this important issue both nationally and jointly."
"There were also questions from Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Gomes about the trade regulation on torture equipment."
"This draft regulation is at present being discussed in Council."
"Mrs Gomes also asked about taxation of the arms trade."
"We are aware of the various suggestions made in that regard, including those by Member States of the European Union."
"However no concrete detailed proposals are currently being discussed within the European Union."
"I would like to conclude by commenting on what Mr Romeva i Rueda said in his introduction."
"On the one hand he paid compliments to the presidency for the review of the Code of Conduct, but on the other hand he said it was not enough."
"In a way I agree that we should go further, and that this should not be the final step."
"It is indeed a first review and we should continue our efforts."
"I very much appreciate Parliament's strong commitment to this issue and the active role that Parliament has played."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
". We must defend the values of freedom and democracy through the legitimate use of words and the responsible adoption of legislation."
"The fact that the People’s Republic of China is a big market should not lead us to forget that its political regime has inherited what remains a distinctly Communist system of values, which is a very long way from meeting acceptable standards."
"The people of Taiwan are still suffering the political oppression and economic isolation imposed on them by the People’s Republic of China, which has recently threatened Taiwan once again with military action."
"The conditions are not in place for lifting the embargo on the trade in arms."
"If under current circumstances it is hardly possible to restrict the arms race of the People’s Republic of China, then what will happen if the embargo is lifted?"
"Furthermore, it would be seen as an approval of the current status of confrontation, rather than an insistence on the necessary political dialogue between the People’s Republic and Taiwan."
"Let us promote political action rather than military action."
"The next item is Council and Commission statements on the ALTHEA mission in Bosnia Herzegovina."
"I give the floor again to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Nicolaï."
"Mr President, the European Security and Defence Policy is on the brink of a historic step. The EU's first military crisis management operation, Operation ALTHEA, will start on 2 December."
"In the development of the ESDP, we have made great progress from concepts and capabilities to concrete actions."
"Like the first EU police mission, the first military operation will take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The preparations for the deployment of Operation ALTHEA after SFOR leaves Bosnia and Herzegovina are well advanced."
"An operational concept has been approved, force generation has taken place, and 11 third countries have been invited to contribute to the operation."
"A committee of contributors has had its first meeting and the operations plan has been approved by the Council."
"Operation ALTHEA will be an EU-led operation, with the use of NATO assets and capabilities."
"Therefore, the Deputy SACEUR was appointed operation commander in early July."
"The operation's HQ has been established in Mons."
"In early October the force headquarters in Sarajevo reached initial operational capability with a view to reaching full operational capability by early December, when authority is transferred from SFOR."
"People might consider the transfer of the operation from SFOR to the EU a big and risky step."
"They might have doubts about the capabilities of the EU mission."
"However they are wrong, if only because 80% of the SFOR forces have transferred to ALTHEA, while the departing 20%, which are US forces, will be replaced by additional European forces."
"All the EU Member States currently contributing to SFOR will continue their contributions in ALTHEA."
"However, ALTHEA is not just an EU operation."
"Third countries like Morocco, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway and Turkey will participate as well."
"I am very pleased about their participation, because it shows that it is not just the EU that cares about Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"As members of the committee of contributors, these countries will have the same rights and obligations as the EU Member States taking part in the operation in terms of its day-to-day management."
"No effort has been spared in ensuring a smooth transition from NATO to the EU and that includes the delineation of tasks between ALTHEA and the remaining NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, arrangements on the availability and use of reserve forces and on the sharing of intelligence."
"The EURFOR commanding officer and the commander of the remaining NATO headquarters will be based at the same camp, ensuring operational coordination."
"NATO itself also remains present in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"We therefore have a NATO strategic reserve for support in emergencies."
"This can be used for both NATO and Operation ALTHEA."
"This is a good example of the pragmatic and efficient use of limited resources."
"It also emphasises the good cooperation between the EU and NATO."
"With the transition from NATO to the EU, the last phase of military presence will start."
"The accent will no longer be on the prevention of inter-ethnic fighting but on assisting civil and military reforms."
"After that, a military presence can be withdrawn."
"With ALTHEA, we are contributing to the security and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is important to the reforms in that country."
"At the same time, operation ALTHEA is – dare I say – the final element in a comprehensive European Union policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"It is also part of our broader strategy for the Balkans."
"The combined activities in the political, economic development and security fields mutually reinforce each other."
"The situation in the country has a direct impact on the region and on the EU."
"We therefore have a clear interest in its stability and prosperous development."
"EU involvement is not only in its interests but also in our own and, given our comprehensive and coherent approach, it is only logical that the EU has taken over the NATO operation."
"The ultimate objective is to put Bosnia on track towards the EU and this will be achieved through the strengthened stabilisation and association process."
"The EU military mission, together with other EU activities such as the EU police mission, the EU monitoring mission and the CARDS development programme, will complement that process"
"A comprehensive approach reflects our belief that the future of Bosnia lies firmly in Europe."
"It exemplifies our long-term commitment."
"It is now up to the Bosnian people to make the vision come true."
"They will eventually have to decide whether to join the European political and economic union."
"Such a choice requires fundamental reforms of state, economic and judicial structures."
"Equally, they will have to confirm the decision to join the European community of values."
"Such a decision requires an environment of tolerance, dialogue, respect for religious freedoms and a tough stance in words and deeds against the impunity of war criminals."
"The right political will and popular support by the Bosnians, combined with our comprehensive role, could and should lead Bosnia away from conflict into a stable and peaceful future, a future in which our special representative Lord Ashdown will play an ever more important role."
"Let me conclude by saying that Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the right track."
"Stability and security are increasing and, with its integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, the country is moving more and more from the area of Dayton to the area of Brussels."
"However, much remains to be done, because we are still concerned about the lack of cooperation with ICTY, particularly in the case of the Republika Srpska."
"ICTY cooperation is an important criterion for closer relations with the EU and NATO."
"Here Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to deliver."
"I hope the reforms of the defence and police apparatus, one of the key tasks of ALTHEA, will also bear fruit in that field."
"In that way operation ALTHEA will bring even more benefit to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their quest for a durable and just peace."
". I am extremely glad to have this opportunity to say a few words about Bosnia and Herzegovina, just two weeks before the handover to EUFOR on 2 December."
"The launching of the ALTHEA mission is an important event: important because it will be the first significant military operation undertaken under the European Security and Defence Policy."
"The transfer from NATO has required long and detailed discussions because it was crucial to get things right from the very start."
"My colleagues Mr Solana and Mr de Hoop Scheffer deserve a great deal of credit for securing a successful outcome."
"I know some will be concerned that a brand new military mission in Bosnia sends a signal that the country continues to suffer from significant instability."
"That would, in my judgement, be an entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
"Last Spring the North Atlantic Council Ministerial Meeting noted an 'improved security environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina'."
"As a result they decided to reduce the number of troops committed to SFOR from 12 000 to 7 000."
"I have been visiting Bosnia for several years and I can personally attest to the transformation which has come over the country during that period."
"It would be the height of folly to take for granted the undoubted improvements which have occurred."
"All that is happening is that Europe is taking on more direct responsibility for its own continent – not before time, some might say."
"However, there will be a review of the operation every six months."
"This will take account of its duration, as well as its size and configuration."
"There is no question of keeping troops in Bosnia unnecessarily; as soon as conditions permit, the number of troops can be reduced and eventually the mission will come to an end."
"It is important at this time to recognise that Bosnia’s European future will assume growing importance as the military presence continues to reduce in size."
"Bosnia, like all the countries of the Western Balkans, has a clear European perspective as a potential candidate country."
"Last November the Commission published a feasibility study setting out 16 points on which the country needed to make significant progress before a recommendation could be made to the European Council to start negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement."
"Although there has been progress since then, I am disappointed to end my mandate as Commissioner without being able to give Bosnia the green light."
"I very much hope that my successor, Commissioner Rehn, will be able to do so early in his new mandate."
"Once he did so, the Council would have to accept his assessment and a negotiating mandate would then have to be agreed."
"Only then could negotiations start."
"There is no reason why they could not do so some time during 2005."
"If Bosnia is to make progress on this timescale, a number of things are required."
"First, the authorities have to make further progress on the legislation associated with the 16 points."
"Much has been done here, but there are continuing blockages in areas like VAT and public broadcasting."
"Second, Bosnia has to recognise that passing laws has little utility if they are not implemented properly."
"There is still a great deal of work to be done here."
"Third, the Commission indicated in the feasibility study that it would expect proper cooperation with the High Representative in his reform agenda, as provided for in the Dayton Paris Peace Accords."
"One crucial area here is the question of police reform."
"I very much hope that, by the end of the year, Mr Wilfried Martens will be able to report agreement on the way forward."
"Finally, there is the question of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"Bosnia Herzegovina is a member of the United Nations and a signatory to Dayton."
"As I have made clear on a number of occasions, there can be no dilution of the absolute requirement for full cooperation with the Tribunal."
"This is fundamental to Bosnia’s prospects for further movement through the stabilisation and association process."
"It is a crucial test of Bosnia’s commitment to its international obligations and to the rule of law."
"It is also a fundamental part of the process of allowing the victims of the atrocities to let go of the past."
"Allowing those accused of terrible human rights abuses to remain free makes it impossible for the communities to be properly reconciled."
"Next week the Chief Prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, will be reporting to the United Nations Security Council on the cooperation of the countries of the Western Balkans with the Tribunal."
"Up until now, she has been quite clear that Republika Srpska has not been cooperating at all."
"It is indeed a disgraceful matter that not one indictee has been transferred by the Republika Srpska to The Hague, although there are reports today that some war crime suspects have been arrested by Republika Srpska for trial locally."
"This is welcome news, but Republika Srpska will be judged by the international community on its cooperation with the Tribunal on cases which fall under its jurisdiction."
"It is on that issue that Mrs del Ponte will be reporting to the Security Council."
"I have no reason to expect that her report will be positive on Republika Srpska."
"If that is indeed the case, Lord Ashdown will have to consider his response. Certainly, it is intolerable that the prospects for the whole country to make progress towards joining the European Union and NATO are being compromised in this way."
"I urge the political leadership of Republika Srpska to take action now to fulfil their obligations."
"If they do not, they will be responsible for any consequences which flow from their failure."
"Honourable Members, the people of Bosnia Herzegovina suffered the most from the Balkan wars in the 1990s."
"Now they have emerged from that terrible period and have a clear chance of creating a real country with a genuine prospect of joining our European family."
"As I leave the Commission, I wish them every success and I look forward to hearing of their progress in the months to come."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transfer of responsibility for the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina from NATO to the European Union is a very important step on the road towards a European defence identity."
"This operation follows on from those in Macedonia and in the Congo; it is the third of its kind and also the biggest, involving 7 000 men and women, so it is much bigger than anything of which we have prior experience."
"What are we in this House now to do?"
"Our task is to exercise democratic control, although, at this stage, I would prefer to speak of parliamentary guidance."
"There are, however, certain questions we must ask. Is the leadership structure the right one, and is it capable of doing the job?"
"Will it stand the strain even in times of crisis?"
"What about the equipment and weapons of the soldiers who are being sent there – are they mutually compatible?"
"Do they meet the requirements?"
"It will also be very important to see how cooperation with NATO works in the aftermath of the ‘Berlin Plus’ negotiations, and particularly – in what is a speciality of the European Union and its security strategy – how well the civilian and military sides of this crisis management operation work together."
"We also regard the issue of how this operation is funded as most especially important."
"Time and again, we have cause for concern about the emergence of shadow budgets capable of being monitored neither by the 25 national parliaments nor by the European Parliament."
"It is for that reason that the resolution we will be adopting includes the demand that the expenses incurred in this operation should – insofar as this is possible at this stage in the Constitution’s development – be borne by the European Budget."
". Mr President, I would like to make use of this opportunity to compliment Commissioner Patten, who is still with us in what is actually extra time, on the part he has played over the past years in the Balkans and particularly in the former Yugoslavia."
"Despite his sombre view of the stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, I do think that it is essentially a good thing that the European Union, after all these years, has achieved its ambition of mounting a major operation, and, remarkably enough, doing so in the former Yugoslavia."
"Following the Dayton accords in 1995, it was NATO that assumed responsibility as the stabilising power in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Now that the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy is taking shape, it is a logical progression that the European Union should take upon itself responsibility for stability in the heart of its own continent."
"So it augurs well that the European Union should, at the end of this year, be replacing NATO as the stabilising power in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"ALTHEA is an important test of the European Union’s ambitions in the defence field."
"With an initial 7 000 troops, the operation is manifestly bigger than the European Union’s previous operations, such as Concordia in Macedonia and Artemis in the Congo."
"In operational terms, the mission is a continuation of SFOR."
"ALTHEA has the same solid mandate, which, as we see it, is the best possible guarantee of our soldiers’ safety."
"NATO’s experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be drawn on, but political responsibility lies with the European Union, so that it can demonstrate its ability to play a generally external role on a larger scale than before."
"In my experience, people in Bosnia take a generally favourable view of this mission."
"Everyone I spoke to on my recent visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed greater involvement by the European Union."
"At the same time, there are still tensions between the country’s various constituent parts, to which reference has just been made."
"While the Bosnian Croat federation is clearly drawing closer to Europe on its way to EU membership, Republika Srpska is still unwilling to cooperate with the tribunal in The Hague."
"The operation must help to further stabilise the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"ALTHEA must, as best it can, help to build up the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the rule of law, police and the army and stable democratic structures, enabling the country to be integrated into European structures."
"The ultimate objective must be that Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes capable of standing on its own feet as a complete and integral state – and that, I believe, must be the European Union’s ambition."
"No date has as yet been given for the EU’s mission to end, but it cannot be the intention that a military force should simply remain in place until such time as Bosnia is ready to join the European Union."
"For the time being, there is no realistic timeframe for this, but accession to the EU is, so to speak, a civil rather than a military operation."
"Only a functioning state, capable of guaranteeing its own security, can credibly apply for membership of the European Union."
"So it is that normalisation is the objective, and hence it is also necessary that the European Council, having resolved upon this mission, should also, and as soon as possible, devise some kind of exit strategy which might well be connected with the stabilisation and association process."
"Such an exit strategy will also require the EU to step up its involvement in developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Only if we are working towards withdrawal can ALTHEA make any substantial contributions towards achieving the ultimate objective, that being to prepare Bosnia and Herzegovina for stability as part of the European structure."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation regarding security in Bosnia and Herzegovina has improved, but the country is nevertheless unstable, and an international presence is needed."
"The forthcoming operation will do much to bring Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to the European Union and will strengthen the Union’s role in the Western Balkans."
"The proposal before us is an excellent one, and Mr Wiersma has done a magnificent job."
"As shadow rapporteur on ALTHEA, I made some observations with regard to the basic proposal, and I am pleased that they were taken into consideration when the proposal was being drawn up."
"It is important that action is taken in Bosnia and Herzegovina to combat organised crime and trafficking in women."
"I wish to emphasise how important it is to ensure that there is a more balanced representation of ethnic groups when police forces are being assembled."
"This will increase confidence of all groups in the region and their commitment to maintaining order."
"War criminals at liberty must be caught."
"The Dayton Agreement must be implemented."
"This is a matter of credibility, and is a task for NATO staff."
"This will be the first major EU-led military operation and we need to monitor its progress very closely."
"It will be important to attend to its operational aspects and consider clearly how responsibilities are to be divided."
"The EU must ensure that ALTHEA troops respect human rights in all their aspects."
"The EU is committed to respecting human rights, and that must be conspicuous in all action associated with the ALTHEA mission, whether it concerns the treatment of prisoners or those being detained, or any action."
"A parliamentary delegation will inspect the work of the ALTHEA mission next year, and, in addition to all its other responsibilities, it should also be given the opportunity to make an evaluation of respect for human rights."
". Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group, I would like to highlight the very fortunate fact that we all agree on how important it is, not only for the European Union, but also for Bosnia, that we have taken over this mandate."
"If it should turn out to be the case that this is the keystone to which you, Mr Nicolaï, referred, I would like us to take another step forward, politically speaking, by expressly calling on the Bosnian Government to invite us to undertake this mission."
"We have every basis in law for doing this, provided by SFOR, that is, by the military intervention that made this advance, this stabilisation, possible after ten years."
"As we talk about how we see Bosnia’s future prospects in Europe, should we not strive to achieve what we achieved in Macedonia, with the Government asking us to be present in this window of transition?"
"I believe that would be a triumph."
"Having concluded what is known as a SOFA – a status of forces agreement – with other states that have asked us for help, why should we not conclude one with Bosnia and Herzegovina too?"
"Secondly, we need these regular reports, and I hope that we will, tomorrow, make that a binding requirement."
"This House is committed, for we have all been committed for years."
"We are talking not only in terms of military intervention."
"Next year will see the tenth anniversary of the attack on Srebrenica, and the anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, and I believe we are obliged to make this clear."
"I hope that we will do as Commissioner Patten wishes and give close attention to Bosnia’s future."
". Mr President, in the light of what is happening today, it is difficult to assert that European intervention in the Western Balkans was a resounding success."
"In order to bring stability to what a German publication eloquently called the ‘restless Balkans’, help was needed from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean."
"The bottom line is that NATO is not there for nothing."
"I am still to some degree reassured by the fact that NATO is still there, and still, too, involved in the European ALTHEA mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The fact is that this whole operation, which we call ‘European’, is founded upon trans-Atlantic cooperation on the basis of the ‘Berlin Plus’ accord between the European Union and NATO."
"What brings me to this conclusion is the letter of 9 November from the Dutch Presidency to the parliament of the Netherlands."
"If anything, the ALTHEA mission is something for Europe to be modest about."
"Moreover, I am convinced that it also puts another big question mark against the idea that a European security and defence policy is useful and necessary."
"Such an ambition for power can only eventually weaken or undermine NATO, and then, Mr Nicolaï, to use a Dutch expression, all of us in Europe are far from home."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in congratulating Mr Wiersma on the quality and comprehensive nature of his report, I wish to emphasise on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group the importance that this European Union military peacekeeping mission assumes in the extremely sensitive area of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"This is a first for the Union; apart from the symbolic fact that it will allow the 7 000 soldiers already serving under the aegis of NATO now to wear the 12-star symbol on the sleeves of their uniforms, the mission does, in any event, mean a greater European presence and hence greater visibility for the Union in the Balkans."
"In the nineties, when bloody ethnic conflicts broke out one after the other in the region, people used to wonder where Europe was, and it was distressing that we were so absent."
"Today, however, we are witnessing a presence and attention on the part of our institutions that befits the circumstances."
"The 7 000 soldiers will arrive in Bosnia in a strong position, and their strength derives not so much from their weapons as from their expertise, their humanity, and their willingness towards the local population."
"The people are mindful of the need for a military presence on their territory in this delicate phase of stabilising their country, and are therefore ready to welcome them warmly."
"These soldiers are not arriving alone in unknown territory."
"With them in Bosnia there are the institutions, the Commission, the High Representative of the Union, who for two and a half years has been working as a truly enlightened governor in Bosnia, in a far-from-easy attempt to ensure the establishment of the rule of law within a renewed framework of peaceful co-existence between the three major ethnic groups in the country."
"Parliament, through its delegation led by its indefatigable chairman, Mrs Pack, closely follows events in Bosnia, as shown, among other things, by the recent visit to that country."
"This visit brought home to members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament the principles and routes through which they could have a closer relationship with the European Union."
"Today the perspective is that of a stabilisation and association agreement and tomorrow, at a time we cannot yet foresee, the prospect of future accession."
"We should not allow ourselves to be deceived by all this, however."
"Important steps have been taken in Bosnia on the path to stabilisation."
"The desire for normalisation is palpable in many areas of the country and the wish to forget the past and to think of the future is shared by all its inhabitants."
"Of the sixteen points set out in the feasibility study, many have already been translated into law."
"It is fitting and heartening to note this, but there is still much to do."
"The military peacekeeping mission under the aegis of the Union from 2 December is there for this purpose."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too would like to take this opportunity to bid you farewell and thank you most warmly for your cooperation over all these years."
"You have dedicated yourself in particular to the Western Balkans, where I would have preferred there to have been no need, ten years on from the wars in the Balkans, for the EU to mount further military backup operations."
"As Mr Solana once said, though many years ago, this is a front with which we will have to deal for some time to come, and it is in Europe, on our own doorstep."
"It is closer to us than other crisis regions, whether Sudan or the Côte d’Ivoire, regrettable though all of them are, and notwithstanding our responsibilities for all of them."
"ALTHEA, though, is more than these; it is a test case for the EU’s visible role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, now that it is, for the first time, taking over duties from NATO."
"The mission is part of a coordinated and coherent approach including also the Stabilisation and Association Process, which will, I hope, make further progress in view of the disconcerting fact that 16 points are still outstanding."
"Although Bosnia and Herzegovina needs the European perspective, which ALTHEA is meant to help secure for them, what is essential is that there should be a clear line of command avoiding needless duplication between NATO and ALTHEA and making it as clear as possible who is giving orders to whom."
"Cooperation between ALTHEA and NATO is therefore also being put to the test."
"It is regrettable that financial provision is being made outside the normal EU Budget, and so the European Parliament is not as involved as it should be."
"All these things considered, I welcome the report and assure you that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, I welcome the switch to an EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I also applaud the fact that Lord Ashdown will promote overall EU political coordination there and, specifically, will give the EU force political advice."
"NATO's SFOR was criticised by Amnesty International for human rights violations."
"Lord Ashdown will have an important role in ensuring that the ALTHEA EUFOR mission does not practice arbitrary arrests or ill-treatment of detainees."
"I would urge that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights Ombudsman be given jurisdiction over their activities."
"I also hope that the EU takeover of military responsibility will lead to an energetic effort to find war criminals and deliver them to The Hague."
"Finally, I want an assurance of zero tolerance towards sexual abuse, exploitation and use of prostitutes who are victims of trafficking."
"It is at last time to say goodbye to Commissioner Patten, but I look forward to working with him in the quest for a 'yes' vote on the Constitution in Britain."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we want a better future, we do well constantly to recall the past."
"Not that long ago, the headlines were full of expulsions, murder and ethnic cleansing in the Western Balkans, in the heart of Europe, while the EU, as if paralysed, was incapable of taking any effective action to prevent these things."
"Painful the memory of Srebrenica, Mostar or of Banja Luka may be, but it is right to remember them; the former military presence under NATO command may have brought Bosnia and Herzegovina a certain stability, but we need to be aware of how fragile that stability is."
"It is a good thing that with this, its first major joint military mission with an extended mandate, the EU is taking on far greater responsibility in this part of Europe, and aiming in the long term to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina can be stable, at peace, multi-ethnic, and capable of cooperating at regional and international level."
"It will be a further touchstone for Europe, and also for the decisions in this area that will very probably have to be taken next year and will also affect Kosovo."
"I would also, however, urge this House to include support of this kind in the Financial Perspective, as well as making provision for economic development and expenses."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just a few comments to make on the central issue."
"The first is that, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), I am delighted that the military mission – which is still necessary – is now in European hands and backing up the EU’s great financial and civilian commitment under the leadership of Commissioner Patten."
"The second is that this changeover from SFOR to EUFOR is being welcomed in Bosnia and Herzegovina too."
"It does indeed highlight how closely intertwined are Bosnia and Herzegovina’s destiny and our own."
"The success of our mission – political, economic and military – is the litmus test for our foreign and security policy."
"Thirdly, EUFOR’s tasks should be clearly set out."
"It should not involve itself unnecessarily in states’ prosecution of their own criminals."
"In these countries, the police and the justice systems have now become capable of pursuing ordinary criminals and imprisoning them."
"Apprehending war criminals such as Mladic and Karadzic should also still be a matter for the remaining NATO contingent, and, in particular, for the Serbs of Republika Srpska."
"Even though neither has so far demonstrated any enthusiasm for doing this, and Republika Srpska has even obstructed it, EUFOR should have other tasks to perform."
"Fourthly, how will cooperation between the police mission and EUFOR be organised?"
"My fifth point has to do with an issue that has started to worry me in recent years, and that is whether the EUFOR troops have been advised about the problems with trafficking in women and forced prostitution."
"Is there an ethical context, and where, when and by whom are offences to be punished?"
"Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a transit country, but also – not least because of the international presence – a destination."
"The sixth thing I want to say is that EUFOR is the right name."
"Why, then, call it ALTHEA, after a mythological woman associated with blood, retaliation and vengeance, and who ends up taking her own life?"
"What did the person who thought up this name have in mind?"
"They could have done with a bit of sensitivity."
"One might have expected something else in an area where we are working to counteract revenge and the settling of scores."
"Moreover, EUFOR is the name by which the mission is already being welcomed on great big posters in Sarajevo, so let us leave it at that and chuck ALTHEA out with the junk where it belongs!"
". Mr President, I thank Members for their remarks."
"As they were remarks rather than questions, I think I can be brief."
"Most of the Members who spoke agreed on the fact that the step we want to take in Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important step for the security and defence policy of the European Union."
"We also agree on the fact that it is important for them and also for the European Union because of the European perspective on Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Mr von Wogau, Mr Wiersma and others were very clear on that."
"There were questions, especially from Mr von Wogau, about the command structure."
"I shall explain."
"We have the Deputy SACEUR as commander of operations."
"He is supported by an EU operation which has its headquarters located within those of NATO in Mons, as I mentioned before."
"Under the Deputy SACEUR we have an EU command element in Naples where the regional NATO headquarters is located."
"This is in charge of the regional Balkans operation."
"The field commander falls directly under this command element and hence there is a very thorough military structure."
"As with all European Union operations, the Political and Security Committee has political control and provides strategic direction."
"As regards armaments, as I said before it is the same people with the same equipment."
"I agree with Mrs Poli Bortone and others that progress has been made but a lot remains to be done."
"In addition to the ICTY cooperation I have already mentioned and the internal reforms, I hope indeed Bosnia and Herzegovina will also become more active in regional cooperation."
"Croatia has made considerable progress and could be an example in a number of fields – except perhaps with regard to ICTY, as we will hear from the Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, on 23 November."
"I end with a short but important remark."
"On behalf of the presidency I would very much like to thank Commissioner Patten for the important role he played in the Balkans."
"As he said, we are all looking forward to the new Commission and the new Commissioner, on which this Parliament will decide on Thursday."
"Nevertheless we will miss Commissioner Patten."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, not only did I make a speech, I also asked two questions."
"I asked you in what way soldiers have been prepared for this difficult task, particularly with regard to trafficking in women and forced prostitution, and I asked you how and where soldiers are sentenced or called to account, should the need arise."
"Secondly, I asked you whether you are considering phasing out the name ALTHEA, which is a terrible word and has caused problems in the region."
"These were two important questions, and I should like to receive an answer."
". I cannot add very much."
"I tried to explain in relation to the first question and also to Mr von Wogau's question."
"With regard to the second question, it is a tradition that we choose Greek, Roman or Latin figures as names for operations and activities."
"I suppose that it was chosen for this reason."
"Mr President, like Mrs Pack I asked some specific questions."
"One of these was similar to hers and concerned assurances as to the non-use of prostitutes who are the victims of trafficking."
"This is not a trivial point, it is really important."
"Secondly, I asked whether the Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights Ombudsman would have jurisdiction over EUFOR activities with a view to avoiding the kind of criticisms levelled at SFOR regarding arbitrary arrests and the ill treatment of detainees."
"These were very specific questions and I would be very grateful for an answer from the presidency."
". Mr President, unfortunately I cannot be precise enough to answer the second question."
"As to the first question, I fully agree with the importance of the remark and the issue itself."
"The debate is closed after the tabling of a motion for a resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- the report (A6-0031/2004) by Anders Samuelsen on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction,"
"and"
"- the report (A6-0032/2004) by Mechtild Rothe on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community."
"– Mr President, I apologise for interrupting before we start the debate on Mrs Rothe's important report, but as my motion is pertinent, I am asking for the floor now."
"I have certain information, which I would be most grateful if you could check, that the plenary service known as the Tabling Office has tabled or intends to table an arbitrary amendments provision to Mrs Rothe's report."
"When I found out, I shrieked and, as the walls have ears here, the service may already know and may already have made the necessary change."
"If it has not, I repeat, if it has not made the change, please inform the Deputy Secretary General, Mr Rømer, that he must make the change and remind him that, when we voted for the creation of the Tabling Office under the previous presidency, we made it clear that the Tabling Office has no political jurisdiction whatsoever."
"If you saw the amendments provision which I have here, I am certain that its tabling on the part of the Tabling Office conceals a political expediency which I also denounce."
"To close, I repeat that, if it has not already made the change and does not intend to do so, the matter of the Tabling Office will be raised by me at the Conference of Presidents of the political groups."
"Thank you for your motion."
"I promise you we will check it."
"– Mr President, on the subject of support for the Turkish Cypriot community, which has been struggling for some time, we want this matter to end smoothly without further problems."
"My comment is that Parliament's Committee on Budgets decided, quite rightly, that financial support would be given to the Turkish Cypriot community under heading 3, in other words under the heading for assistance for Member States of the European Union."
"Now I understand that the European Commission has recommended that this support be given under heading 7, in other words under the heading for pre-accession assistance ..."
"I am sorry, but that is not a point of order."
". Mr President, I will seek in the course of my remarks to answer very robustly on the Commission's behalf the point made by the honourable Member, and to make it clear why it views heading 7 as the correct one for this assistance."
"If the honourable Member can wait for a moment and listen to what I have to say, it may help inform him on any subsequent points of order he wishes to raise."
"I would like to cover both the question of the extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate until the end of 2006 and the question of the Commission's proposals for helping Northern Cyprus."
"There is a connection between the two and I will make that clear in my remarks."
"I wish to start by paying tribute to the Agency and to Richard Zink for the splendid work done since 2000 to help Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The Agency was set up to deliver aid fast and effectively to communities which were in urgent need of it."
"That is exactly what it has done."
"The independent external evaluation of the Reconstruction Agency has concluded that the Agency has done an excellent job in fulfilling its original mandate."
"If the House remembers, it was a Commission Task Force for Kosovo, established just after the end of the conflict in July 1999, that laid the basis for the establishment of the Agency in February 2000."
"Since then its key positions have been held by detached Commission officials with long experience in managing our assistance."
"The Agency's record of success is the basis for the Commission's proposal to maintain it in its present format until the end of 2006, when the current assistance programme for the Western Balkans – the CARDS programme – also expires."
"On the strength of this positive evaluation, the Commission has not proposed any other substantive change to the Agency regulation as it stands."
"We have, however, given a great deal of attention to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in particular to the suggestion to submit a Commission report on the future of the Agency by June 2005."
"I am sure the House will appreciate that the important debate on the new Community financial perspective for 2007-2013 will have an impact on how to deliver assistance to the Western Balkans."
"We therefore feel it realistic to set the end of 2005 rather than the middle of 2005 as a deadline."
"Also, as the committee has requested, and in order not to leave any doubt about the future of the Agency, we will ensure that any proposal to extend the Agency beyond 2006 should be made by the Commission by 31 March 2006 at the latest."
"For formal reasons, we have not deemed it appropriate to accept as a legal requirement an obligation to report on the division of tasks between our delegations and the operational centres of the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"The existence in the same country of both the Agency and the delegations calls for close cooperation on the ground to ensure that our assistance effort is not dissipated in any way."
"We have made great efforts to ensure that any difficulties are addressed by making the necessary changes to administrative procedures."
"However, we will continue to be available to discuss with the Committee on Foreign Affairs any concrete issues that it thinks could hamper the Agency's work."
"I would like to underline once again the very important job which the Agency has done."
"When I became a Commissioner in the autumn of 1999, there was considerable concern as to whether we would be able to deliver assistance sufficiently rapidly in the Western Balkans."
"The Agency did the job extremely well and I want to pay tribute again to all those who have been responsible for that."
"In order not to jeopardise the effective performance and operations of the Agency in the Western Balkans, we have also found it sensible to go ahead with the original proposal to extend the time limit of the Agency's mandate and not to await the final outcome of the Council's discussions on the assistance package for the Northern Cyprus community and the extension of the geographical scope of the Agency."
"Since the current mandate of the Agency expires at the end of next month, the positive opinion of Parliament today is essential so as not to interrupt our assistance to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo."
"Let me now turn to the Commission's proposals for assisting Northern Cyprus, in the course of which I shall try to answer the point of order the honourable Member raised earlier."
"As the House is aware, the Council invited the Commission, after the failure of the referendum on the reunification of Cyprus in April 2004 – and I would like to wholly associate myself with everything that my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, said about that – to bring forward comprehensive proposals to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community."
"On 7 July, the Commission duly adopted a comprehensive package of trade and aid measures, as requested by the Council."
"Although today we are only discussing the Rothe report on the financial instrument, I would like to stress again the political importance of the package, which aims at facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by means of financial assistance and trade under preferential conditions."
"The proposal for a Council regulation establishing a legal instrument for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community creates a specific financial instrument for an amount of EUR 259 million, to be implemented from 2004 to 2009."
"At this point I will explain to the honourable Member why it is we have argued that heading 7 is the correct heading for this assistance."
"The financial instrument aims to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging economic development, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island through approximation and alignment with the acquis, mainly through TAIEX, and by improving contacts between the two communities and with the European Union."
"Most of the activities will therefore be similar to the pre-accession activities financed under heading 7, which appears to us to be the most suitable financial perspective heading for this particular assistance."
"Priority will be given to investments in the field of infrastructure, transport – including links between the two communities – and environment projects such as waste disposal, sewerage and improvement of the water supply, water quality and the distribution system."
"Rural development, as well as measures concerning small and medium enterprises, will be another priority."
"Other objectives are social policy, labour market policies, vocational training and treatment of illegal immigrant workers, as well as reconciliation, confidence-building measures and bicommunal projects."
"As regards implementation of the funds, different options have been carefully examined by the Commission."
"We finally propose that the Commission be enabled to entrust the European Agency for Reconstruction with the implementation of large infrastructure projects under this regulation, and amendment of the Agency Statute to this effect is considered in the Samuelsen report which we are also discussing here."
"The Agency option is clearly the most suitable as regards economy, efficiency and effectiveness."
"It would allow the Commission to rapidly deliver assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community after the regulation is adopted."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the financial instrument as expressed in the Rothe report on the proposal."
"Concerning the proposed amendments, I think the House is aware that these have already been discussed in depth in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets."
"The Commission is grateful for the proposals made by those committees and we can support the substance of the majority of them."
"I would, however, also like to take this opportunity to underline that in our judgement it is regrettable that the Council has not yet been able to agree, after nearly four months of discussion, on the text of the financial instrument."
"Implementation of the assistance could start immediately after the adoption of the regulation and the Commission has already taken the necessary preparatory steps."
"As for the solution to the Cyprus problem, the conditions still do not exist for a new international initiative."
"In my view the Annan Plan remains the only realistic basis for a comprehensive settlement."
"Concerning its possible role in any new process aimed at a settlement, the Commission remains ready to support efforts towards a settlement that would permit a reunified Cyprus to be fully integrated into the European Union."
". Mr President, at its meeting in Luxembourg on 26 April 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council underlined its determination to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community."
"To that end, the Council invited the Commission to bring forward comprehensive proposals, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the islands and to improve the contact between the two communities and the European Union."
"The Council also recommended releasing the EUR 259 million already earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement."
"In that light, as the Commissioner has just said, with a view to the economic integration of the island and improved contact between the communities, in July 2004 the Commission submitted a draft regulation establishing a financial instrument in which the opinion of the European Parliament is requested."
"It also submitted a draft regulation on direct trade between the northern part of Cyprus and the rest of the EU."
"In line with the mandate given by the Council on 26 April, the Dutch presidency committed itself to putting the proposals forward and made considerable efforts to that end."
"Both proposals were carefully considered in the Permanent Representatives Committee."
"Difficulties were encountered and concerns were expressed during that discussion on certain issues such as property and sovereign rights."
"Progress was made after intense discussion, especially on the draft regulation establishing a financial instrument."
"The remaining point is the definition of the role of the European Agency for Reconstruction, and discussions are also continuing on the direct trade regulation."
"There are still substantial problems with this draft regulation and the Council and the Commission are working very hard to resolve the issue."
"The Dutch presidency is considering discussing this at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"I would like to say that we are grateful for the constructive work undertaken by the parliamentary committees involved."
"The aim of the Dutch presidency is to provide real and effective economic opportunities for the Turkish Cypriot community, by promoting trade with the EU whilst respecting fully the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus."
"We trust that this will ultimately benefit the people of Cyprus throughout the island."
". Mr President, the process by which we have come to the point of prolonging the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate does not merit high marks for artistic performance."
"The Commission's request for a prolongation itself came at a very late stage."
"Members will recall that Parliament in its previous resolution on the European Agency for Reconstruction had asked the Commission to present its evaluation report on the status of the Agency by June 2003 at the latest, in order to allow the EP to hold a debate on the future of the Agency and its adequacy in managing EU external assistance in some Stability Pact and stabilisation and association countries."
"The Commission did not follow Parliament's recommendation and only presented its report during this year's electoral period."
"Further delays arose as a result of the change in the regulation with regard to the Agency's geographical area of responsibility, the intention of which was to bring assistance for the promotion of the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community within the remit of the Agency."
"My committee rightly took the decision to postpone adoption of this report and the one regarding assistance to the northern part of Cyprus until it received the relevant documentation."
"However, these shortcomings should not cloud the fact that an impressive job has been done on the ground by the Agency's staff."
"I have always been in favour of extending their mandate."
"They are doing a good job and need to know that they can sign contracts for buildings and pay salaries for next year."
"My concerns were directed at the lack of clarity and coordination in the division of tasks between the European Agency for Reconstruction's offices and the Commission's deconcentrated delegations, a matter which I have addressed in my report."
"The progress made in developing an effective decentralised system for contracts and financial management systems for EU assistance as foreseen in the CARDS multiannual programme for 2005-06 for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia needs to be examined further."
"I would be happy to incorporate a proposal fusing the ideas of two fellow Members by asking the Commission to submit by June 2005 a report on the future of the Agency after 31 December 2006."
"This should ensure that a prospective extension is not addressed with the same haste as in the past."
"I agree that the remit of the European Agency for Reconstruction should be extended to cover the implementation of financial assistance for the northern part of Cyprus."
"I would propose that we adopt the relevant part of the Commission's text, in agreement with the rapporteur on the proposed instruments, to ensure consistency between the two reports."
"I hope that all Members will join me in supporting the extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate for the term proposed."
"I should like to inform Parliament that I have asked for the oral question and debates on the future of the Western Balkans, originally planned to coincide with the vote on the European Agency for Reconstruction's report, to be postponed until the December part-session."
"It would be more useful to debate the future of the region when the new Commission is in place, as we had originally envisaged would be the case at this juncture."
"A debate in December would also save this important debate from drowning under speculation over the new team of Commissioners."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will focus on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a financial support instrument to support the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, a proposal which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I greatly welcome."
"EUR 259 million have been earmarked to support the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community until the end of 2006."
"These funds were originally to have been released only after Kofi Annan’s plan had been adopted, with the aim of reducing the significant economic disadvantage suffered by the Turkish Cypriot community."
"After the vast majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the plan in February, but the Greek Cypriots against it, so that the plan could not be adopted, the Council recommended that the financial support instrument be implemented even without an agreement having been reached in Cyprus."
"In my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I can say, on its behalf, that our support for this plan is unanimous."
"At this point I should also like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent cooperation within the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The Community aid provided for in this regulation can and should help to achieve greater compliance with the , in order to prepare for the takeover which will be necessary after a solution to the Cyprus issue has been found, and indeed one of the primary aims of this financial support instrument is to promote such a solution."
"We greatly welcome the fact that around EUR 260 million has been allocated for projects relating to the environment, transport, telecommunications, water and/or energy, for restructuring measures, for example in rural areas, for measures which are of particular benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises, and for bicommunal projects which facilitate trust-building between ethnic groups."
"Measures can and should of course be planned for Famagusta, in order to make it suitable for habitation again, and you will be aware that relevant initiatives are underway in the town."
"My report notes that the planned measures must not infringe the property rights of EU citizens."
"We have reiterated this point, even though we know that it has always been self-evident that this principle must be observed when implementing European projects."
"All the members of the committee were unanimous in their support for the Commission’s additional proposal that the measure as a whole be managed by the Agency for Reconstruction."
"The point I should like to make to Mr Samuelsen is that there is broad support for this proposal, and this is something upon which we all agree."
"As has already been noted by Mr Patten and the Council, financial support is part of the package proposed by the Commission in July."
"Although Parliament has no official right of consultation with regard to the direct trade which has also been proposed, I believe that this House will make it clearly known to the Council tomorrow that a prompt decision is expected on the trade proposal, just as we expect a prompt decision on the financial support element."
"In my opinion, it is crucial that the EU should send out a clear signal to the Turkish Cypriot community by implementing this proposal for a regulation and the proposed direct trade. This signal would be directed in particular at the large majority which voted for the Annan plan and for a ‘yes’ to the European Union, and it would make it clear that, although we want a swift solution to the Cyprus issue, we are also, even today, taking the concerns of Turkish Cypriot civil society very seriously."
"It is in the interests of all Cypriots and in the interests of positive developments in Cyprus that the democratic, pro-European forces in the Turkish Cypriot community receive backing and do not under any circumstances abandon their fight."
"I hope that Parliament will, by means of this report, help to achieve this, and I expect and hope that the Council will follow suit very shortly."
". Mr President, the EU has always shown itself to be in favour of the accession of a reunified Cyprus."
"In spite of diplomatic efforts, however, this has not been possible, given the unfavourable result of the referendum held in April 2004."
"In order to avoid further isolation of Turkish Cypriot territory and to strengthen contacts between the two communities, the European Commission has tabled a proposal intended to establish an instrument for economic development for this community totalling EUR 259 million for the period 2004-2006."
"In view of the fact that no political agreement on unified Cyprus’s accession to the EU has been reached, such funding has raised a number of issues of a legal and budgetary nature."
"There is, indeed, no heading allowing the direct award of Community funding to a Member State whose government does not have absolute authority over part of its territory."
"I should like to point out that the Republic of North Cyprus has not been recognised internationally and cannot therefore be deemed a state."
"This lack of budgetary basis implies that such funding can only be seen in parallel with draft amending budget No 10/2004."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I have analysed the Commission proposal before us. The Commission argues here that funding is intended to finance activities similar to those of pre-accession, which falls within the scope of category 7 of the budget."
"Without entering into the political aspects of the debate, I did agree, however, with the financial implications of this proposal on the Financial Perspectives, despite it not being entirely clear under which category this financial support would fall."
"I therefore deliberately left open the choice of the most suitable budgetary basis, a task that the Budgetary Authority must undertake once the Council has tabled its proposed text."
"I could not finish this speech, Mr President, without drawing the attention of this House to the difficulties of having to express a financial opinion on a text of which the most important part has not in any way been the subject of a Council agreement."
"Thank you very much."
". Mr President, the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction – which was meant to be called the European Agency for Reconstruction and Development, but which is still called the European Agency for Reconstruction – has to date been mainly focused on Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro."
"It has now been assigned an important new task, namely that of managing the financial instrument for north Cyprus. There can be no question that the Agency has efficiently performed the tasks involved in its former mandates, and I am sure that the same will be true of its activities in north Cyprus."
"As in the previous cases, however, it is also important with regard to Northern Cyprus that the Commission present a report on the future of the Agency after 31 December 2006 to the European Parliament and the Council by June 2005."
"South-Eastern Europe and the Agency’s future tasks are of too great an importance for the EU to allow the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction to remain unclear."
"The relationship between the Agency and what are termed the ‘deconcentrated’ Commission delegations must also be clarified in order to prevent a lack of activity or the duplication of work."
"The report should of course also cover the implementation of the 2005-2006 multi-annual CARDS programme for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, something which is not yet the case."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore endorses the proposal to extend the Council Regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction."
". – Mr President, first I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Samuelsen and Mrs Rothe, for the very responsible job which they have done in their reports."
"First, as regards the European Agency for Reconstruction, we should point out that, based as it is in Thessaloniki, it has played a decisive role in the reconstruction of the Balkans as a whole, in configuring the necessary infrastructures, in building democratic institutions, in promoting the rule of law and in defending human rights in the Balkan countries."
"This strategy is the only reliable proposal for the peaceful reconstruction of the Balkans and the strengthening of their European prospects."
"That is why it is absolutely necessary to extend the operation of the agency until the end of December 2006 and to make provision for examining the possibility of even extending its operation beyond that date, given that there will be important developments in the Balkans both in 2005 and in the next period and policies are needed to consolidate stability and security in the Balkans."
"For this reason, my request to Mr Patten is that the Commission submit a report on the matter to the Council and the European Parliament."
"The agency's efficient operation, transparency and in-depth knowledge of the procedure of reconstruction of the area as a whole are a guarantee for extending its jurisdiction to the implementation of financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community."
"Now to the question of the report on financial support for the Turkish Cypriot community."
"This money needs to be given to the Turkish Cypriot community, because it will help Turkish Cypriot citizens and the Turkish Cypriot community, it will contribute to economic development, to the incorporation of the , to the configuration of the necessary infrastructures and to the creation of jobs."
"In other words, it will help to create conditions which will allow the reunification of Cyprus through the development of contacts, dialogue and exchanges between the two communities."
"We need to use financial support to strengthen the prospects of resolving rather than consolidating partition."
"That is why the messages which we send the Turkish Cypriot community must be clear and unequivocal."
"We are not financing intransigence."
"We are financing dialogue and this is where the European Commission and the Agency for Reconstruction need to be particularly careful and act in cooperation with the Republic of Cyprus and with respect for the principles of European law."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Presidency to take a stand on the question of the heading for financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community."
"Mr Nicolaï needs to take a clear stand on behalf of the Dutch presidency on whether financial support will come under heading 7 or heading 3."
". Mr President, this is the first concrete expression of the European Union's appreciation that the Turkish North Cypriots voted strongly for the Annan plan."
"It is the first, but it is behind schedule and it is a small sum of money: far too small for the Commission's list of glamorous priority projects that Commissioner Patten, whom it is very nice to see still here, read out earlier."
"As a result of a lack of generosity, the money will be spent in such a circumscribed fashion that it will only apply to 15% of the territory of North Cyprus, excluding many villages that voted en bloc for the Annan plan."
"I would like to say that I deplore the sluggish progress on this question in the Council."
"Worst of all, the financial regulation has been split from the trade regulation, which is by far the most important part of the package."
"Will the Minister commit the presidency to produce a result on the trade question within three months?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be said often enough that the European Agency for Reconstruction has made a considerable contribution to the EU’s positive image in the Balkans."
"Indeed, before 2000, the European Union was, above all, a bureaucratic monster that delivered on all kinds of promises either far too late or not at all."
"After 2000, the European Union, via the agency, was very much capable of providing prompt and efficient aid, often under difficult circumstances."
"It has never happened before that such a large proportion of funding that was budgeted for granting aid was actually spent."
"Once again, all credit for this."
"Having said that, the question remains, which we in this House have discussed with the Commissioner on different occasions, as to what exactly the Commission’s thought process was when allocating a certain task to the Bureau, the various offices of the Bureau or to the decentralised delegations, the embassies of the European Union."
"Although the Commission may not admit to this out loud, it does suggest now and again that Parliament is going on about this while insisting on an answer."
"The reason is that we want to avoid further ambiguity."
"Allow me to give you an example."
"There is every chance that the European Union will be allocated more tasks in Kosovo in the course of 2005 and 2006: in other words less UN, less UNMIC and more European Union."
"Does this now entail a greater role for the Bureau or does it mean that we can expect a larger, all-singing, all-dancing delegation and a larger embassy?"
"It is important for Parliament to know, because it is we who must take difficult and awkward, political and financial decisions."
"I will not conceal the fact that I am also overcome by a certain wistfulness."
"This debate is the last of the many debates we have had with the Commissioner."
"I think that one of the reasons for the Commissioner’s popularity in this House is that he has given the EU’s Balkans policy a face and a voice, and has done a sterling job of it."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for this."
"I wish the Balkans a sound successor and, above all, wish the Commissioner much enjoyment in governing Oxford University and in penning fine books."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial segregation and distress of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots was never the objective of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"The underlying reason for this segregation is not the so-called embargo on the Greek Cypriot side, it is the Turkish occupation, the breakaway action of the occupying regime and the fact that the economy of the occupied areas is inextricably bound up with the Turkish economy, to the point even that the Turkish pound has been introduced as the currency of the occupied areas."
"Following the Turkish invasion and occupation in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus announced that its occupied ports and airports were closed, because it could not exert any form of control over them."
"This was also an act of self-defence, so that we would not be led into recognising the pseudo-state."
"Security Council resolutions 541 and 550, together with a series of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights upheld the above decision in full."
"The same happened in the recent opinion of the Council's legal department, which expressly recognises the right of the Republic of Cyprus to keep the said ports and airports closed."
"Our group supports the financial regulation for Turkish Cypriots, provided of course that the Republic of Cyprus is respected and no benefit or political advantage is reaped by the occupying regime."
"We hope that understanding and broad agreement have been reached on these matters."
"As regards the report on the European Agency for Reconstruction being debated, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus wonders why it has been tabled for voting before us today, at a time when there is no agreement at COREPER level, by the Commission or the Council."
"I would remind the House of the view of COREPER, that the matter would be debated under the next Presidency, under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"It is precisely because the Republic of Cyprus is not a third country and the occupied areas are not independent territory, they are, as the Accession Treaty expressly states, territory of the European Union to which application of the has been stayed, that the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus cannot vote in favour of the regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"It goes without saying that our vote against the regulation does not mean that we reject assistance to the Balkan countries."
"Finally, what we want is to vote on the protocol without clarifying the heading from which this money will be taken."
"It has been said that the matter will be resolved depending on where there are appropriations."
"However, no appropriations are available under the internal assistance heading."
". – Mr President, I have listened to Mr Patten and his views very closely."
"First, on a point of order, I am not sure if Mr Patten is entitled to even be in the House, given that Commissioner Prodi's brief expired on 31 October."
"Apart from which, all Commissioner Prodi's acts are being audited to see if they are legal."
"I believe that this matter will be resolved before the Court in Luxembourg."
"Who is to blame for the fact that northern Cyprus and southern Cyprus have not developed equally, when the northern part is more fertile and more suited to tourism?"
"The occupying army is to blame."
"However much money Europe gives, it will be wasted, because the occupying army has created a constricting framework which prevents any development."
"We therefore need to see what can be done, as the Commissioner says."
"The occupying army needs to leave and Cyprus needs to return to its following the Zurich and London Treaties, which were also signed by England, of which the Commissioner is, of course, the eminent offspring."
"The occupying army needs to leave, calm needs to be restored to the island, the 1960 Constitution needs to be applied and economic prosperity will follow in northern Cyprus automatically."
"As long as there is an occupying army, there will be no prosperity."
"The money will be wasted."
"We therefore need to have the courage to find a realistic solution."
"If we had not kicked Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, would we today be providing financial support to occupied Kuwait?"
"If we had not kicked Milosevic out of Bosnia, would we be funding Milosevic today?"
"So why do we not do the same with Turkey?"
"Tell Turkey to get off the island so that northern Cyprus can develop."
"No one wants poor neighbours. Most of all, the Greek Cypriots do not want poor neighbours."
"If you have the courage to kick out the occupying army – which is the only occupying army in a European country – development will automatically follow."
"Mr President, we also wish to express confidence in the Reconstruction Agency’s being able to help improve the economic and social situation in the Turkish-occupied zone in northern Cyprus."
"It is important to remember the background to the current situation in the northern part of Cyprus."
"The background is the Turkish invasion that took place in 1974 and that meant that the population in the northern part of Cyprus now finds itself in an economic and social situation clearly worse than that which existed before July 1974."
"In that connection, I have to emphasise that, as others have already pointed out, the efforts at development are to take place in cooperation with the government of the Republic of Cyprus."
"What must not happen is for the EU now to go in and provide aid as a thank you to those who voted in favour of the Koffi Annan plan and to forget those who voted against the plan."
"There are motives that, in my opinion, have not been properly examined in this Parliament, and I remember the discussion with Mr Verheugen, during the last sitting, of the whole issue of the Koffi Annan plan. This was clearly unjust and clearly unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot population, and it was consequently rejected by a huge majority."
"No doubt all of us want to see the situation improve, and an essential prerequisite for this is, of course, an end to the military occupation of northern Cyprus."
"As long as Turkey has occupied part of another European country’s territory, we cannot conduct negotiations, such as may be decided upon in this House in December, with the Turkish Government about Turkish accession to the EU."
"Any negotiation must always be conducted with the involvement of the Greek Cypriot population and with an appreciation of their interests."
"It is the Greek Cypriot population that have been the losers since 1974."
"It is they who have been victims and they must not be punished through the efforts that we in the EU now put in to normalising the situation."
"Mr President, I was somewhat surprised to hear Commissioner Patten say that the Annan plan remains a sound basis for a possible reunification of Cyprus."
"We should not overlook the fact that in April of this year, a referendum was held about this plan, and that a large majority of the Greek Cypriots voted it out."
"When a referendum is held, the outcome should be respected."
"The financial support to that part of the island that is occupied by the Turks was intended to be conditional on the Annan plan being rubber-stamped by referendum, which did not happen."
"Pledging EUR 259 million to the northern part of Cyprus is tantamount to recognition of the military occupation of that area by more than 35 000 Turkish soldiers."
"It appears that the European Union has no problems with the fact that a candidate country is occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State."
"Not only are we about to start accession negotiations with Turkey, but the occupation of Northern Cyprus is now also being rewarded financially, and this is absurd."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe and, of course, Mr Samuelsen on their reports."
"I, of course, shall focus more on Mrs Rothe's report."
"It is a fact that the report, as formulated following the discussions and vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, is a very good report and, as such, the decision which derives from the report on financial support for the development of the Turkish Cypriot community is also a very good decision, a decision which we all support."
"In other words, we consider that this support will contribute towards the general development of the Turkish Cypriot community, so that when, God willing – and this is something we hope will happen soon – the Cyprus problem is resolved with the reunification of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriot community will be at the same high standard as the Greek."
"I wish to say, however, as the Council has also taken a stand, that the regulation on financial support is one matter, while the regulation on trade relations is another."
"Although it may be logical for us to link the two, I would advise great caution as regards the matter of the regulation on direct trade relations."
"I am certain that the Council will exercise this caution in its work and that the solution found – when it is found – will be fair and will be the right solution."
"Finally, a couple of words on the positive role of the European Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki, in my country;"
"I would like here to express the hope and my agreement to its managing financial support to the Turkish Cypriots and I naturally hope that this management will be based on the regulations of the European Union."
"Mr President, we are to vote on the report of my colleague Mrs Rothe regarding the financial support of Northern Cyprus."
"This is good news: Northern Cyprus needs this aid."
"Over the last few decades events have separated the island politically and economically."
"The people of Cyprus suffered immensely from the partition of the island."
"All those involved must do their best to overcome the separation."
"It was the explicit aim of the United Nations and the EU that a united Cyprus would join the European Union on 1 May 2004."
"The governments of Northern Cyprus and Turkey have followed the steps laid out by the United Nations and the EU."
"The population of Northern Cyprus has overwhelmingly supported the unification of the island as well as EU accession."
"A united Cyprus could already be a member of the EU today."
"Unfortunately, that has not yet happened."
"It is our responsibility to encourage the two parts of the island to cooperate."
"The regulation on financial support that we are discussing today is the first step."
"The second step will be the regulation on special conditions for trade."
"The Council should finalise that regulation without delay, firstly, to allow for an improvement in economic conditions of Northern Cyprus; and secondly, to facilitate the rapprochement of the two sides through trade."
"This rapprochement can also support change in both parts of the island."
"During the times of the German Ostpolitik, we called this concept ."
"More steps must follow soon."
"The ultimate aim must be the reunification of Cyprus."
"Mr President, until 1974 the city of Famagusta was the centre of economic, social and cultural prosperity for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots."
"Since the Turkish invasion 30 years ago, the city has remained sealed off by Turkish troops and inaccessible to its local inhabitants."
"It has gradually become a ghost city, with empty streets and derelict buildings."
"Amendment 11 aims to help bring this dead city back to life for the benefit of the many thousands of local inhabitants."
"The resurrection of the city of Famagusta will also act as a catalyst for the establishment of better and closer relations between the two communities in Cyprus, thus greatly increasing the chances of a speedy, peaceful reunification settlement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start by echoing previous speakers in extending particular thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Rothe and Mr Samuelsen, as well as to Mr Patten and Mr Nicolaï, for their speeches today."
"I believe that it is crucial to convince the government of Southern Cyprus that the European Union must deliver on the promises it has made to the north of the island."
"Our goal must therefore be to authorise both trade and aid together; if necessary, however, and if there is no alternative, the two aspects should be dealt with separately, so that an end is put to the isolation suffered by the north of the island."
"I would also like to take this occasion to call on the government of Southern Cyprus and the Cypriot Members of this House to state clearly, once and for all, whether they genuinely wish to help the north of the island, or whether they will keep seizing every opportunity to throw a spanner in the works."
"I am delighted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, has recently expressed his firm support for Kofi Annan’s Cyprus plan."
"The end of this debate has made one thing clear to me. It is my belief that the people in the south of the island who were in favour of Kofi Annan’s plan have no representative in this House."
"I have therefore decided that the role I will play in this debate will be that of a representative of the people in the Greek part of Cyprus who voted for Kofi Annan’s plan."
"It is particularly in view of my Turkish origin that I should like to act as a voice for these people."
"I hope that we will take this opportunity to do everything in our power to bring about reunification."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may just be acceptable to regard financial aid to northern Cyprus as a charitable donation."
"However, if we regard it as an investment to encourage development, then we are throwing money out of the window."
"It is money wasted, because as long as the Turkish occupation of one part of the island, which is now part of the European Union, endures, for just as long as there are Turkish troops in northern Cyprus, there will be no development."
"The facts show it to be so and history shows it to be so: there will be no improvement in the economic situation."
"Therefore I believe that it would be better to make the Turkish troops withdraw first, and then intervene with financial aid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the frustration about the Greek Cypriot rejection of the Annan plan is ongoing."
"After all, today, every European can see for himself how the Union denies its own principles by giving a non-European country, in this case Turkey, a prospect of joining the EU, while that state’s armed forces are occupying part of the territory of a current Member State, Cyprus."
"That is why it was crucial for the Annan plan to be approved, by hook or by crook, and the Greek Cypriots were intimidated from all quarters in order to accept this half-hearted proposal."
"That is also why the Turkish Cypriots are being indulged so much by the European policy makers today."
"However, this turns the world on its head."
"Without going into exhaustive detail, I should like to remind you briefly of the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan."
"Indeed, the Annan plan authorised the Turkish invasion of 1974, as well as the attendant war crimes."
"According to that plan, the Turkish occupying forces would be allowed to stay on Cyprus and retain the right to carry out military exercises on Cypriot soil."
"The military border would be perpetuated and armed border crossing points would continue to carry out passport control."
"The Turkish Cypriots would continue to live under Turkish occupation."
"Their poor economic situation is attributable less to an embargo by the Greek population than to the corrupt Turkish economic system ."
"If the Annan plan had been ratified, the more than one hundred thousand Turkish colonists who, in the wake of the ‘Attila’ operation, were forced by their government in Ankara to move to Cyprus in order to continue the ethnic cleansing, would remain on the island."
"Financial support to the Turkish Cypriots – who, I sincerely hope, will, before too long, be reunited with the Greek Cypriots in an independent Cyprus without foreign occupation – must therefore go hand in hand with a number of strict conditions, first among them being the removal of Turkish military occupation."
"This support should under no circumstances be seen as a reward for a politically correct vote in a referendum."
"Mr President, the message that should go out from this debate is that not only Parliament but also the Greek Cypriot Members wish for the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community through economic assistance and unhindered trade around the world."
"We are satisfied that the rapporteur has introduced a vital amendment, making sure that EU money will not be used in a way that impinges upon individual property rights according to the relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights."
"I also welcome the fact that the Council appears ready to reach a consensus on the regulation."
"I stress the importance of consensus on the issue of trade, without time constraints and on a correct legal basis, as advised by the legal department of the Council."
"What is needed is creativity and adherence to the international legal status of the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the Union."
"I have perceived during this debate that certain colleagues, in their efforts to help the Turkish Cypriot community, underestimate the importance of the message that the Greek Cypriots are also in favour of economic development for Turkish Cypriots."
"This is not a 'zero-sum' game."
"Following the last referendum, and with all due respect to the decision of the sovereign people, neither Turkey nor Cyprus is discharged from its responsibilities to continue searching constructively for a mutually agreed solution."
"The messages coming from this debate build bridges between the two communities and do not create unnecessary disputes and confrontation between them, and due attention should be paid to them."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we Greek Cypriots are in favour of financial support and assistance for Turkish Cypriots."
"They are our compatriots."
"The government of the Republic of Cyprus has supported the decision on financial support for Turkish Cypriots from the outset."
"However, I should point out that the economic destitution of our compatriots is not due to isolation on our part; it is due to the isolation imposed by 30 years of Turkish military occupation in Cyprus."
"I must say that this action is an incidental action and the basic objective of the European Union must be to resolve the Cyprus problem, to bring about full equality, political and other forms of equality, between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in all sectors."
"That is our objective."
"Now to the Annan plan, which many people have glorified."
"It was rejected in the Greek Cypriot referendum because, first, it perpetuated the Turkish occupation, the Turkish military presence in Cyprus."
"Secondly, we are creating a climate of uncertainty about the future and, thirdly, it had shortcomings in the area of human rights and on the practical side."
"We must not forget this."
"There are those who are critical of the Greek Cypriot side for its stand; why were they not critical for 30 years and why are they not critical now of what Turkey is doing in Cyprus?"
"The Turkish occupation, the eviction of Greek Cypriots from their homes and this ongoing situation."
"They should demonstrate the same consideration."
"In closing, I should like to point out that the reunification of Cyprus must be the objective of all of us."
"We have no dispute with the Turkish Cypriots, we have a dispute with Turkey, which is occupying part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, part of European territory, because the Republic of Cyprus is a full member of the European Union."
"– Mr President, I wish to emphasise that Greek Cypriots are in favour of financial support for Turkish Cypriots and that we hope to see the standard of living of Turkish Cypriots raised to our standard of living as soon as possible."
"However, it is the way in which this support will be given that I wish to discuss."
"That is the matter I wish to address."
"I have been fighting on this front for many years, not just recently."
"That is why the report by Commissioner Patten is an insult to my intelligence, when it appears that he does not understand where this support will come from; from heading 3, which relates to countries in the European Union, or from heading 7, which relates to candidate countries."
"There is a big difference; it is not the projects which will be implemented in occupied Cyprus which are important, it is Cyprus itself."
"However, the Commissioner refuses to understand this state of affairs, which is perfectly clear to us, and I am sorry that he makes this distinction."
". Mr President, there were one or two points made during the debate which I should address very briefly."
"I hope that when these debates are held in future without my attendance they will, if I may say so, have as broad a base as possible in the points of view we hear."
"I should like to say to Mr Samuelsen that the Commission would be perfectly content to hold a debate on the Western Balkans in December."
"Mr Duff spoke about the trade regulation being done within three months."
"Again – speaking for myself – the Commission would be perfectly happy to accommodate that reasonable request."
"A couple of other Members suggested that we should concentrate our support on one place: Famugusta."
"That would not be sensible."
"We have to spread our assistance more generally than that."
"I wish to make three other points."
"First, on the Agency based in Thessaloniki, I would like without reservation to thank the Greek Government for its hospitality."
"It provided the facilities we have used in Thessaloniki."
"It was an imaginative proposal by the last government, which has been continued by the present one."
"It has given us a splendid headquarters."
"Everybody who has worked in the Agency is grateful for that and certainly, on behalf of the Commission, I am also very grateful."
"Second, Mr Lagendijk made the point – although he was too kind to put it this way – that there is a degree of intellectual incoherence, which I accept, between the policy which I have pursued vigorously around the world of deconcentrating our management of assistance and what we have been doing in the Western Balkans, which is to establish an agency rather than simply deconcentrate to our delegations."
"I have to say to justify that decision that my main concern – particularly given the position in the Western Balkans and given the position in Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – the position was so difficult it seemed to me that the most important thing was delivery of assistance."
"Since the Agency has been so effective it was not right to dismantle it and I thought it sensible to continue to use it as our main instrument for managing assistance."
"So, I plead guilty to a degree of intellectual incoherence, but the record of the Agency has justified it."
"Finally, I do not wish to make my last remarks in this Parliament into the beginning of a hot controversy."
"However, I would just say to the honourable Member who said that he wished Mr Verheugen, my distinguished colleague, had been able to state the advantages of the Annan plan more vigorously, that Mr Verheugen would have loved to do so, but when he tried in Cyprus, he was stopped."
"That is a matter of record and was not the happiest episode in this tale."
"It would have been better all round if during the course of the referendum campaign he had been able to say in Cyprus what he believed the advantages of the Annan plan were."
"It might have been that he would have given a more balanced view than some of the letters sent out by the government."
"I very much hope that we can have this debate in as calm a way as possible."
"I hope that all sides of the argument will be heard reasonably."
"The one thing I would like to say is that I recognise, as Mr Kasoulides said, that there is a genuine commitment on the part of many honourable Members to the betterment of everyone who lives on the island."
"I have no doubt at all about the honourable Member's commitment to that and I hope that we see everybody living a more prosperous, stable and peaceful life on that glorious island in the future."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on climate change."
". Mr President, concerning the issue of climate change there are two main areas in which the EU is playing a key role."
"The first is the implementation and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Member States and the Commission are currently preparing the European emissions trading system, which is due to be launched on 1 January 2005."
"The second focus of attention is climate policy in the longer term."
"In December this year, the Tenth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is due to take place in Buenos Aires."
"One of its tasks will be to assess the results of the Convention over the last ten years and future trends."
"A very important result so far has been the Kyoto Protocol."
"But the Protocol is only a first step and CO2 emissions will have to be reduced even more after 2012."
"I should like to convey the Council's thanks for the efforts Parliament has made to persuade Russia to commit itself to the Kyoto Protocol."
"The European Union welcomed the good news that on 5 November President Putin had signed a bill confirming ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Russian Federation."
"That signature clears the way for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force early next year."
"Once in force, it will legally oblige countries with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach these targets by 2012."
"The Kyoto Protocol is the main instrument in the global fight against climate change and a good example of the effectiveness of global cooperation."
"Leading by example, the European Union has passed legislation. It has already made these provisions legally binding in the European Union."
"The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol shows that the EU was right in its early implementation of the obligations then expected."
"In spring 2005, the European Council will adopt a position on the EU's future climate policy."
"The Heads of Government will consider mid- to long-term emission reduction strategies and their objectives."
"The basic aim of long-term EU climate policy is to limit the rise in temperature to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels."
"In preparation for that meeting, the European Commission is currently producing a cost-benefit analysis taking account of both environmental factors and competitiveness."
"Action on climate change demands the broadest possible worldwide coalition."
"I believe that will only be achieved through a dialogue between the European Union and other countries."
"The European Union presidency, in the framework of the troika, is currently implementing action with key countries all over the world regarding the forthcoming Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and early discussions on options for a regime for the period beyond 2012."
"Members of the European Parliament can also play a significant part in this process by discussing long-term climate policy with parliamentarians from countries outside the European Union, for example at the forthcoming Tenth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
". Mr President, by now 189 countries are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and I hope they will all turn up for the Tenth Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires."
"This event will also mark the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"The Russian decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol means that it will now enter into force, and this will give new impetus to the discussions during the conference of the parties in Buenos Aires. The Commission has four main objectives for COP 10, as it is called."
"Thirdly, to advance the discussions on what will happen after 2012. Fourthly, to contribute towards finding solutions for the technical issues on the agenda."
"The first thing is to take stock of what many parties have already done to address climate change."
"This is also an opportunity, especially for developing countries, to be able to explain that many of them have already taken action and to illustrate the way in which they are the first ones to be affected by climate change."
"This is important for the political debate in general."
"The second objective is to explain what the European Union is doing through our European Climate Change Programme as well as the emissions trading scheme that will start from January 2005."
"The system will also be officially presented to all ministers in an event that we are organising in close cooperation with the Dutch presidency and the Argentine Government."
"The third objective will be to begin looking to the future, at the global regime that we will have after 2012, and to have an exchange of views on the post-2012 framework."
"Again, this is extremely important in order to involve the developing countries and to show that there is a balance in the kind of actions that we are discussing post-2012."
"The fourth and final objective is to resolve some of the very important technical issues that are still on the COP agenda."
"In particular, these issues concern topics related to developing countries as well as the balance between adaptation and mitigation."
"I understand that several round-table discussions will be organised during COP 10."
"The Commission looks forward to working closely with the Members of the European Parliament who will be part of the delegation in Buenos Aires."
"We will ensure full briefing and also rapid transmission of information to the Members of the European Parliament and we hope that you can engage in a lot of outreaching activities during COP 10."
"Having a strong EU delegation – composed of representatives of all the European institutions at the COP – gives the Union an important opportunity to encourage the rest of the world to take more action now in response to the threat of climate change."
"With five years' experience of working with Members of the European Parliament, this has been one of our definite strengths, and the fact that we have held joint press conferences, etc. is a sign of strength and good cooperation."
"I hope that we can continue in a good atmosphere and in close cooperation both at COP 10 and in the future."
". Mr President, I would like to wish Commissioner Wallström every success in her future portfolio."
"We have enjoyed working with her over the last five years in the environmental portfolio."
"I would like to thank her for her particular contribution."
"My good wishes also go to the Dutch presidency as its term comes to an end."
"There are those who claim that the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is destined to fail as the rest of the world waits for those nations already taking part to fall short of their obligations and so provide the perfect cover for their decision not to participate in the first place."
"At the half-way point to the 2012 deadline set under the first Kyoto commitment period, the world is engaging in rationalisation, hammering nails in the coffin of attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before we even enter the second phase of implementation."
"The 'I told you so' mentality is one I suggest we cannot afford."
"Failure is relative."
"Failure to meet provisional targets – and my own country, Ireland, is currently 16% behind the target set – is very unfortunate."
"But failure to act at all would be downright catastrophic."
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, an international panel of experts which assesses the scientific, technical, social, and economic aspects of climate change estimates that we need to decrease our emissions of greenhouse gas by 60-80% on 1990 levels in order for our efforts to make an appreciable difference to rising global temperatures."
"I know there is debate in the scientific community as to whether the models used by the IPCC stand up, and that debate will continue, but the majority of people accept the IPCC modelling and the projections arising from it."
"Critics frequently cite the fact that under Kyoto the earth's temperature would only be 0.15°C lower than if we do nothing at all."
"Scepticism and climate change are two phenomena that have become so closely interlinked in the global debate on the future of our planet, that we are in danger of losing sight of the very real steps that have been taken, under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, towards setting a framework for future action to control the impact of human activities on the earth."
"To focus too closely on the negligible quantitative effect of Kyoto, in terms of immediate results of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, however, is to miss the point."
"Kyoto is only a first step towards addressing global warming but it provides a crucial foundation on which future, more comprehensive and effective policies and agreements must be built."
"It is a prototype for a much more far-reaching arrangement than the present one."
"The value of the Kyoto Protocol is in that it sets a market-based mechanism to translate environmental protection into economic terms."
"It puts a tradable price on global warming."
"Once properly implemented and extended to include all the other sectors, Kyoto will provide a flexible, market-based mechanism to spread the burden of paying for global warming equitably across all sectors."
"It would provide a financial incentive for the development of clean technologies that will safeguard the environmental heritage of future generations."
"In conclusion, the main obstacle at this point is diplomatic."
"We must engage in a continuing and vigorous dialogue with our transatlantic partners in the USA and with Russia where the very name of Kyoto has become discredited."
"Yes, Kyoto has flaws, but only through working together can these shortcomings be ironed out to the benefit of all."
"On a European level I welcome the Commission's recent stakeholder consultation and hope that we can make our voice heard at the forthcoming COP 10 conference in which I will be delighted to participate."
"It is time to banish the notion that the future of climate change policy is coterminous with the Kyoto Protocol."
"The question, and it is an important one, is what comes after Kyoto?"
". Mr President, Commissioner, we very nearly did not have this debate with you, but with your successor."
"In all honesty, I am really pleased that it is you we can talk to today about the EU’s climate policy and its contribution to the climate conference in Buenos Aires in December."
"It strikes me as a nice finale that you can pass on this climate dossier in the knowledge that the Kyoto Protocol will enter into effect shortly, now that the Russian State Duma and the Russian Federation Council have ratified it, which they did on 22 and 27 October respectively."
"Meanwhile, President Putin has signed the ratification act and we are waiting for the ratification to be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"The Kyoto Protocol will be able to enter into effect 90 days later."
"My group welcomes President Putin’s decision to join the European Union and the other countries in tackling the greenhouse problem."
"Europe and the European Commission have played an important role in achieving this result, and congratulations, also to you, are certainly in order."
"The climate policy can rely on immense support in Europe."
"Our group is delighted that the European Parliament and the Council of ministers hold on to an ambitious climate policy that aims to fight the greenhouse effect."
"Europe has confirmed its pioneering role in respect of the climate conference in Buenos Aires."
"I am pleased that Europe has reiterated that support must be provided to developing countries in order to adapt to the effects of climate change."
"It is not sufficient to say that we will be taking structural measures which will prove effective in the long term."
"Some countries, particularly developing and small ones, are already being faced with the effects of the greenhouse effect, and they need help."
"Although my group is satisfied, it does, of course, remain critical."
"Pleasing though it is to see Parliament and the Environment Ministers supporting an ambitious climate policy, we should not remain caught in fine rhetoric and good intentions."
"We should also bring about concrete measures in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases."
"As President of the European Union, the Netherlands has a special responsibility to table concrete results."
"The presidency’s ideas in the environmental field sound good but should be translated into results."
"That is what the Dutch Presidency will be judged on at the end of the year."
"It is in Buenos Aires that it remains to be seen whether our fine words will also be spoken and fulfilled at international level."
"In any event, I hope cooperation with both the Dutch Presidency and the European Commission will be excellent during the conference in Buenos Aires."
". Mr President, about two days after the US presidential elections I turned on my radio at home."
"I heard one of George Bush's climate change advisers telling us, firstly, that climate change was a myth; secondly, that European scientists were all funded by national governments, that none could be trusted and only American scientists were independent; and, thirdly, that Commissioner Wallström had admitted that the whole climate change agenda was designed to ensure that European industry was able to catch up and additional burdens were imposed on American industry in order to allow this level playing field to be established."
"And all that time I thought the Commissioner was out there trying to save the world!"
"In yesterday's I saw that one of Mr Putin's advisers, whom we have heard from before, is still telling us that it is all a myth and global warming will be a good thing!"
"It is like old Cold War warriors coming together again, trying to fight in a more globally warmed arena."
"It is to the Commissioner's credit that we have come this far, but we have a very long way to go."
"We have to ensure not only that we implement Kyoto – which, as we know, will do nothing to combat climate change but will simply slow down the process – but also that we involve developing nations, raise the targets and find ways of changing public policy in ways that are politically acceptable and involve the United States."
"I do not know how far we will get down this road."
"I hope at least that, in the Commissioner's new role, she will, over the next five years, at least have the opportunity to communicate a message of success."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the climate conference to take place in December will be a historic one, as now it is a known fact that the Kyoto Protocol is to enter into force."
"It should be realised, however, that Kyoto is only the first step on a long road and now is the time to prepare for the next round of reductions in emissions."
"We need to involve new countries, such as China and India."
"The EU should waste no time in putting forward, first of all, a proposal for its own long-term targets for reductions in emissions and, secondly, its proposal for a model for reductions in emissions internationally."
"In order for us to be able to prevent climate change turning into a catastrophe, global emissions must develop a downward trend within not more than twenty years, and the industrialised countries must cut their emissions by at least 60% within approximately 50 years."
"This sounds drastic, but we can manage with a gradual change if we act consistently."
"By reducing emissions by just under 2% every year we will achieve a 60% reduction in 50 years."
"Modern sustainable technology will make that possible."
"We need market mechanisms that favour clean technology, such as taxation on energy and emissions trading, but we also need other new measures."
"One possibility is a reduction in VAT on energy-efficient equipment on the market."
"This way we can achieve surprisingly large reductions in emissions, if consumers always choose the most energy-efficient option when shopping."
"In other words, there is still time to prevent a catastrophic change through a gradual series of measures, provided we are determined and consistent, and provided the EU maintains its leading position in international climate policy."
"Now that the Kyoto Protocol can enter into force, it is important to look forward to what we can do in terms of our work on climate after 2012."
"As we all know, the commitments in the Kyoto Protocol are quite inadequate in the longer term."
"It is especially important for us to enter into discussions with the big developing countries, such as India and China, about the fact that they too must make binding commitments to reduce their emissions in the future, emissions that are now increasing extremely quickly."
"If this is to be possible, I think that it is important to talk in terms of the fair and sustainable use of resources in the long term and that the only fair long-term distribution of the right to release emissions is one that is calculated for each of the world’s citizens."
"That is the fair objective in the very long term."
"The American presidential election is, of course, a serious setback for international environmental work, and the United States will probably appear as a global anarchist in the environmental sphere during the next four years too."
"We do not have time to wait for the Americans, but we know that the day will come when, for both economic and ecological reasons, they will be forced to commit themselves to this work."
"It is therefore important that the work in which they will be welcome to take part be firmly on course."
"I should like to use my last few seconds to thank you, Margot, for the work you have done on environmental issues over these five years."
"It is not easy to be EU Environment Commissioner."
"I am certain that there are opponents both outside and, sometimes perhaps, also within the European Commission, but I am convinced that you have done this work as well as it was humanly possible to, and for that you deserve sincere thanks."
". Mr President, it is almost seven years ago that the renowned protocol was drawn up in Kyoto, and thanks to Russia’s ratifications, it is, at last, set to enter into effect very soon."
"That is good news, not only for those – like you, Mrs Wallström – who have fought for this protocol, but also for those who experience the effects of climate change on a daily basis."
"In any event, it deserves heartfelt congratulations."
"Kyoto is a step in the right direction, towards a better environment, but we have a long way to go yet."
"I would therefore like to call on the Council and Commission, together with the European Parliament, to demonstrate that the EU not only wants to have a strong economy but also a strong environmental policy."
"This protocol still leaves a great deal to be desired; for example, aircraft emissions should be added to it, and the support base could also be further widened."
"Mrs Wallström, your new portfolio might prove useful in this respect."
"The EU can commit to this too."
"Involving more countries in this protocol also means better control of worldwide emissions."
"At present, 55% of the emissions of Annex 1 countries are covered."
"Let us work hard on the remaining 45%."
"Mr President, I want to talk about climate change, but above all about the report of the European Environment Agency, which two months ago published a prognosis for the future and points out that the areas at greatest risk, the areas which are going to suffer most as a result of climate change, are the Mediterranean areas."
"I believe it is very serious that this has not so far been said out loud."
"I believe it is essential to insist that the Mediterranean areas are going to suffer most from the increase in temperature, with the extremely serious risks to health that entails; they are going to suffer most from lack of water, from lack of rainfall; from an increase in desertification, from the advance of the desert; from a decrease in productivity."
"Furthermore, these areas are receiving immigration based on suffering, misery and hunger."
"It is our duty to help them."
"I would call on Europe to opt clearly for strategies to combat desertification and a policy for adapting to climate change, as recommended by the Agency."
"We must produce adaptable policies, as required by sustainable development."
"We need integrated strategies and much more in-depth studies and research into the problems we are facing."
"The United Nations Organisation, which has implemented a process of combating the desertification of Europe, has said almost nothing."
"I am therefore calling for a Mediterranean policy, a policy fundamentally of social balance and a more active policy for the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, while I congratulate you on your new duties, I am delighted that you are here tonight for this debate on climate change."
"The European Union’s strategy for the Buenos Aires Climate Change Conference is of very great importance."
"The European Union must maintain its leadership and, furthermore, make use of it to negotiate with a view to increasing the number of countries signing up to the Kyoto Protocol in the future."
"I believe it is essential to work towards including the debates initiated in Milan in the second period of commitments, with a view to incorporating emissions from flights and marine transport, and also to make progress on global commitments for reducing emissions from passenger and goods transport by road, which is currently a big problem in terms of atmospheric pollution."
"Furthermore, the Commission should consider producing more measures in the field of energy performance and also of more renewable energy sources because, as you stated on 26 August, Mrs Wallström, if all the public authorities of the European Union were to move over to ecological energy, CO2 production would be reduced by 62 million tonnes, which would allow us to comply with the 18% Kyoto commitments in the field of emissions reduction."
"Furthermore, I believe that the market requires clear and persistent signals in order to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"For all these reasons, Commissioner, I believe it would be positive for the Commission to promote proposals aimed at increasing measures in the field of energy performance and promoting alternative energy sources for the second period, and producing proposals is another way to maintain the European Union's leadership."
"We are now already seeing the effects. Glaciers are disappearing, the Arctic ice is melting and we have shorter winters and more storms, as well as natural disasters and environmental refugees."
"At the end of paragraph 2 of the resolution, there is a statement to the effect that, in the long term, everyone in the world must each be given the same emission quotas."
"This particular sentence places heavy demands on us to take drastic measures to reduce our emissions."
"We are stealing oil supplies not only from future generations, but also from the world’s poor."
"When, now, we debate the climate issue, there is a risk of our looking five years ahead to the next election and avoiding taking difficult decisions, but the EU – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – must collectively avert their gaze from the prospects of re-election and dare to take decisions that radically reduce emissions."
"Otherwise, we are committing crimes against humanity and the earth and are in danger of ending up, in the autumn of our years, at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, eternally condemned by future generations."
"Always assuming, of course, that The Hague is not already under water by then."
"Mr President, climate change presents the human race with a challenge to civilisation, because this is a question of maintaining the species and the major balances of nature."
"What is needed is a fresh perspective on our concept of progress and development."
"This problem will increasingly come to dominate people’s shared existence as this century progresses."
"The profusion of extreme climate phenomena confirms that the effects of global warming are already being felt."
"Profound changes are now inevitable."
"Whilst the EU appears determined to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, a great deal remains to be done, however, if we are to prepare our communities to face the changes that are already underway."
"A genuine adaptation policy must be drawn up and implemented, as a matter of the utmost priority."
"We must draw political conclusions from the work of scientists and, in particular, the European Environment Agency’s report, which sets out the various effects of global warming in Europe. Our continent, let us not forget, may be the smallest continent in the world, but it is also the continent with the most coastline."
"The 155 outlying coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean have already decided – on the initiative of the French National Observatory on the effects of global warming, of which I am the chairman – to meet in 2005, in Marseille, to debate this question of adaptation."
"We trust that we will have the Commission’s support on this measure, which can help to draw up a genuine European strategy for adapting to current climate change."
"This strand, which has become an integral part of the Community action programme on climate change, should now be extended."
"Mr President, we need cleaner energy and more efficient technologies and, in order to achieve that, we need incentives – negative incentives, if you like – such as a carbon tax."
"Ireland is currently 25% in excess of its targets and yet, a couple of months ago, the then Minister of Finance announced that he was abandoning a commitment to introduce a carbon tax."
"The day after tomorrow, the former Minister of Finance, Mr McCreevy, will be sitting on those benches beside you, Mrs Wallström, in charge of the internal market."
"What confidence can we have that the Commission will ensure that all Member States will comply and fulfil the commitments made in relation to reducing carbon?"
"It has been estimated that 100 of the largest companies in Ireland will exceed the current emission rates between 2005 and 2007."
"Ireland is losing ground in this battle in relation to climate change."
"It will be the Irish taxpayers who will pay the penalties!"
"The companies who are currently pleading that they will be uncompetitive if they have to invest in order to create clean energy and more efficient technologies are the ones who escape scot-free!"
"I appeal to the Commission and to the Council to insist that the Irish Government reverse its decision to abandon the carbon tax."
". Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"I thank Members of Parliament for their contributions and I agree with most of the remarks that were made."
"It is important to be aware that Parliament, the Commission and Council share almost the same views on this important issue."
"We indeed have to fight against scepticism, we have to look beyond 2012 and perhaps we do not agree with everybody in the world."
"But at least we agree on the main paths of the whole discussion here in Parliament with the Commission and the Council."
"It is very important that we continue the steps we have already taken."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their kind words and their cooperation over the years."
"I hope to continue to follow this discussion, because this concerns not only the environment but also our survival on this planet and the economic and social consequences that affect us now."
"Thus, in the years to come, I hope to support and be involved in the initiatives to tackle climate change taken by the Barroso Commission."
"I recall that we very rarely get reports from the Pacific Ocean – the vast expanse of water that covers one third of this planet – but where the effects of climate change are already affecting people living in small island states."
"It must be said that during all the debates on climate change over the past five years the speeches by representatives from the small island states have been the most impressive, because they can tell us their personal stories of how this affected their lives and the possibilities to continue to live on these small islands."
"A lot of people would say that the Kyoto Protocol did not work, that it was flawed, and they would mention its negative aspects."
"It is not perfect, but what is the alternative to that one international legal framework, which has now been negotiated for ten years?"
"Should we try to become involved in bilateral contacts between one state and another?"
"To solve a global problem we need a truly global solution and framework."
"I have tried to turn it around and say that it is an ingenious protocol, because it combines sound science and the way the United Nations has put together the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change is unprecedented."
"Of course individual scientists will question the whole thing – that is their job!"
"However, the fact remains that we have an in-depth knowledge of the problem."
"With sound science, we have common but differentiated responsibilities, meaning that the rich countries – those who emit eight or eighty times as much pollution the poor countries do – have a certain responsibility."
"But we involve them all."
"India and China sit at the same table as the rich countries, so we are able to talk to them and discuss what will happen after 2012."
"It also means that we have access to the so-called flexible mechanisms, meaning that we will do things in a cost-effective way."
"We will involve and mobilise different actors and use market forces for the good of the environment."
"That is why it is ingenious."
"We will have to revise it and work and change it for many years to come, but it is the one game there is in town in combating climate change."
"That is why I am also proud of the role the European Union has played over the years and I hope will continue to play."
"It is so important."
"For once we can show the rest of the world that sustainable development is possible; that we can find cost-effective means and measures and that we are willing to cooperate with each other."
"Thanks to the European Parliament we have a very ambitious climate-change policy."
"I hope that will continue with your help."
"I wish your delegation and our EU delegation to COP 10 in Buenos Aires all the best."
"At the end of the debate, I received a motion for a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.(1)"
"The debate is therefore closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12.30 p.m."
". I want to commend Mr Putin."
"The Kyoto Protocol is off life-support because the Russian Federation ratified it."
"The country with the highest levels of pollution– the United States- refuses to consider the global need for their ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
"I am deeply concerned that the United States has chosen to tackle this climate change issue through unilateral activities."
"Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem."
"If carbon dioxide is not reduced, the Arctic ice cover will disappear."
"This is particularly going to affect the quality of life of those living in coastal regions and on island communities."
"That is a scientific fact, not a passionate policy comment on my part."
"Ireland is much more energy efficient than a decade ago."
"I encourage other Member States to follow suit."
"Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy."
"But complacency in dealing with it, is worse."
"My duty as a MEP, is to stress the necessity of climate change protection to: the people we represent, our EU counterparts and our international partners."
"I urge the remaining countries that have not made their global commitment to combating climate change, to do so, via the Kyoto Protocol."
"The next item is the report (A6-0027/2004) by Mrs Corbey on the draft European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste."
". Mr President, in 2001 a total of 65 million tonnes of packaging waste was generated in the 15 old Member States of the European Union."
"That corresponds to around 17% of municipal solid waste and 3% of the total waste generation by weight."
"Of these 65 million tonnes, 34 million tonnes – 53% – were recycled, and 60% was recovered or incinerated with energy recovery."
"Our information gives good reason to assume that in 2002 not a single target out of the 75 different targets applying to Member States was missed."
"This is a success many would not have believed in even a few years ago."
"Therefore the Community has built on this success and adopted new and higher targets earlier this year."
"The new Member States started later in setting up their own recycling schemes."
"They have nevertheless made significant progress towards fulfilling their target under the old packaging directive at the end of the transition periods agreed in the Accession Treaty."
"For procedural reasons, a deadline for the targets of the revised packaging directive could not be set within that directive and this proposal was therefore necessary."
"The Commission believes that setting this deadline for the new Member States is a matter in which Parliament needs to be fully involved."
"We therefore consider that the appropriate legal procedure is codecision on the basis of Article 95."
"We can also understand, however, that the new Member States want to have legal security as soon as possible."
"They should be able to transpose the targets of the revision directive and the deadline under the present proposal at the same time."
"The deadline therefore needs to be agreed before the transposition deadline for targets expires in August 2005 and I hope that the efforts made to reach an agreement at first reading will be successful."
"The Commission has proposed a deadline of 2012 for all new Member States."
"This should allow discussion in Parliament and Council to start from an equal basis."
"However, I can also accept limited postponement for some of the countries concerned."
"I am also aware that many Members of Parliament wish to extend possibilities for Member States to encourage re-use systems."
"This is an important subject and the Commission agreed to study options during the last revision of the packaging directive."
"However, getting the right balance between encouraging re-use and preserving the internal market is also not easy."
"I think, therefore, that we should wait for the outcome of the two ongoing studies and discuss this issue on the basis of a report that the Commission will present to Parliament and the Council in 2005."
"However, if Parliament wishes to point out the importance of re-use in a recital, as suggested in Amendment 4, that is acceptable to the Commission."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2 and 3 in full, and Amendment 4 in principle."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are once again discussing packaging."
"Commissioner Wallström, this being your last debate as Commissioner for the Environment, I should like to congratulate you on your sterling work over the past five years, your significant personal involvement and commitment, and to thank you for the good cooperation which you have established with this House."
"You have been an excellent Environment Commissioner."
"This evening, we are discussing the leftoversof the revision of the Packaging Directive."
"The ten new countries need clear objectives."
"Recycling and reuse cannot be announced out of the blue from the capital or from Brussels."
"It takes time to persuade people to set up systems."
"That is why it seems best to retain the dates proposed by the new Member States themselves."
"Needless to say, I also checked out how the Members from the new countries felt about this, and this has not produced any other viewpoints."
"Hence my proposal for Amendment No 3."
"I agree with the Commission that we need to finalise this issue as quickly as possible and that we must try to create political clarity for the new Member States at the earliest opportunity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Packaging Directive is due for a general overhaul."
"One of the crucial points is the constant tension between, on the one hand, maintaining the internal market and, on the other hand, protecting the environment."
"In a number of cases, this has led to ambiguity and to long drawn-out procedures."
"Clarity must be created, for the sake of both manufacturers and consumers."
"On the basis of the Packaging Directive, which also covers the environment, the European Commission has called into question a number of reuse systems in Europe."
"Commissioner, that is very disappointing in my view and I have decided to focus on this revision."
"In Amendment No 4, on behalf of my group, I have suggested including in the directive the possibility of Member States encouraging the reuse of packaging material."
"Member States can introduce new systems for the reuse of packaging material or, alternatively, maintain existing systems if these yield an environmental advantage compared to recycling or recovery from packaging material."
"This amendment, which is also a recital, does not say that Member States encourage reuse."
"It states that Member States can promote reuse, provided that – and that is important – that is done in compliance with the Treaty and does not disrupt the internal market."
"You said, Commissioner, that you could accept this amendment, and I understand that it does not meet with any great resistance in the Council either."
"It is therefore beyond me that even this has provoked objections among the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and within the European packaging industry."
"The reaction from the PPE-DE and the industry is simply bewildering if we stop and think about the state of the environment and nature."
"The follow-up report to the recently-published report by the Club of Rome concludes that the limits of sustainable development are in sight."
"If we are not careful with natural resources, such as water and energy, the two worlds, the world of nature and the world of human civilisation, will clash."
"We have not sufficiently succeeded in integrating sustainable development in our production and in our patterns of consumption."
"Clearly, we need to make a complete change."
"The reuse of materials and carefulness with natural resources are vitally important."
"That too is the background to Amendment No 4."
"A packaging industry which itself objects to the possibility of encouraging reuse within the borders of the internal market is not facing the future."
"By 2010, European industry must be the world’s most competitive economy."
"This requires businesses that can assess social reality."
"It requires businesses that can turn sustainability into a trademark, businesses that realise that citizens and consumers are worried about the future of the planet and are prepared to make their contribution."
"Industry is right, of course, in saying that reuse should not be a front for protectionism."
"Reuse may not be an excuse for thwarting foreign suppliers."
"Similarly, reuse is not in all cases better for the environment, and there is no reason for making reuse compulsory."
"Reuse does fulfil an important role, though, that being persuading people that we need to be careful with nature and with materials."
"The last thing we need is to start reverting to being a throwaway society, not, incidentally, that the public appreciate that anyway, because many people consider discarding anything a waste, a waste of a bottle, a can or the material."
"Tomorrow, this Parliament will also be discussing the Kok report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Mr Wim Kok has concluded that the pursuit of a sustainable society, one in which man, the environment and the market are in harmony, has, although commendable, not been given due prominence, and that this is due to a lack of political will."
"He is not saying, though, that we should throw out the Lisbon strategy altogether, and I agree with him."
"We must set to it and demonstrate political will."
"In all its modesty, this packaging dossier will provide you with the opportunity of showing your political will tomorrow."
"Not only can we speak out in the resolution about what is yet to be done, we can also speak out in favour of a concrete, sustainable supplement to the Packaging Directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I urge all of you to nail your colours to the mast tomorrow."
"The choice is yours: a voice for a Europe that is striving towards a sustainable society and acts accordingly, or a voice for a Europe that is full of fine words about sustainable development and the Lisbon strategy, but lacks the energy or moral fibre to back these up with vigour."
"Commissioner Wallström, communication is your new key task in the European Commission."
"You have said that your intention is to continue to spread and promote the message of sustainable development."
"You have my heartfelt support in this, and I wish you much success in this respect."
"I hope that after the vote on the Packaging Directive tomorrow, you will be able to point out to the press that Europe not only speaks about sustainability, it also acts on it."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the proposal the Commission has presented to us is quite simply intended to establish time limits for compliance by the new Member States with the objectives of the directive we approved last year."
"During the negotiation of the modification of the directive on packaging, for which Mrs Corbey was also rapporteur, the problem was raised of what to do about the new Member States not included in the objectives of the directive."
"The new Member States negotiated transitional periods with the Commission of differing lengths according to their capacity to comply with these objectives or not, because, in reality, for many countries, these objectives are very ambitious and not at all easy to comply with."
"These time limits were laid down in Recital 6 of the modification of the directive carried out last year."
"I agree with the report as approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and in Amendment No 3 the rapporteur has replaced the date proposed by the Commission, a single date for everybody, which, as you are well aware, is 2012, as negotiated by the Member States."
"They may not agree but, in reality, each Member State has its own specific characteristics, its own problems, and is perfectly aware of when it can achieve these objectives or not."
"There is no point in producing legislation which is impossible to comply with."
"This proposal was intended to include the Member States in the objectives of the directive on packaging."
"For this reason, I am opposed to the new Amendment No 4, which is intended to introduce a new recital on the system of reuse, which gives the impression that the intention is to take advantage of one thing in order to impose another."
"This is not the time."
"I am not against systems of reuse, and nobody can be against it."
"But this is not the place to put this amendment."
"It is neither the time nor the place, particularly given that Article 5 of this directive already allows the Member States to promote methods of reuse provided that they conform to the Treaties."
"I believe it is premature to open up this debate when in June the Commission will have to present Parliament and the Council with a report on the application of the directive, its impact on the environment and the operation of the external market."
"Amongst other issues, this report will have to deal with promoting reuse and, in particular, compare the costs and benefits of reuse and recycling."
"So far no environmental or economic reason has been found to favour one type of packaging over another."
"The most important thing I wanted to say is that I am against Amendment No 4."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The objectives in the field of waste treatment to which the new Member States committed themselves during the accession negotiations are not a simple matter for the majority."
"This also applies to the various types of waste packaging set out in the European Union directive of 1994."
"All the new Member States have asked for transition periods to be granted."
"As we know, the Directive was revised during the accession negotiations and higher standards for waste treatment were introduced."
"In order for the Member States to remain within the realm of what can realistically be achieved, it was logical that they had to receive new, extended transition periods."
"It is those transition periods that we are discussing today."
"At present the new Member States are establishing their systems for dealing with waste packaging and in this respect the next three years will be crucial."
"Let these systems have high standards from the ecological point of view, but they must also be achievable and economically acceptable."
"In this respect the new Member States are pooling their previous experience and following the experiences of others in the area of legislative options."
"This entails the use of 'examples of best practice', which they wish to repeat, as well as the use of unsuccessful experiments, which they wish to avoid."
"In any case they will attempt to integrate various methods and to influence manufacturers to make packaging functional and, at the same time, safe and acceptable to consumers."
"The method for recycling packaging set out in Article 5 of the original Directive is one of the methods we wish to consider."
"My own country, Slovenia, supports recycling, as it is logical both from the environmental and the economic standpoint."
"It has not been possible, however, to overlook the fact that the interpretation of Article 5 of the original Directive has been the subject of numerous complaints as well as legal proceedings."
"So Parliament and the Council called on the Commission to prepare the statement which we have heard today, a statement that would examine various aspects of the effects on the environment and the internal market."
"Our political group is happy with the extended deadlines restored to the new Member States by the recommendation in the revised Directive."
"Taking all the various elements into account, we have reached the decision that it is reasonable if the wording is limited to its original purpose and we do not include anything that is in the process of development or is the subject of expert analysis and current proceedings in the European Court."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to Commissioner Wallström for all her work as Environment Commissioner."
"I know we are going to miss her very much and would like to extend our thanks to her."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Corbey for her report."
"This is a very important subject, which makes a real difference to our environment."
"It is an issue that constituents feel extremely strongly about."
"There are two key issues in Mrs Corbey's report."
"Firstly the dates."
"I understand very well why the rapporteur is proposing slightly later dates than the Commission."
"Our Group, the Verts/ALE, cancertainly go along with that, with the proviso that we believe we need to be very careful that these compliance time gaps between older and newer Member States begin to start closing afterwards."
"As we have seen before, these gaps have in some cases actually got wider over time, so we need to make sure that over time they begin to close."
"On balance, however, we can accept the amendment."
"Another key issue is Amendment 4, to which many other speakers have referred."
"We have great sympathy with what Mrs Corbey is trying to achieve with this amendment."
"The rapporteur is trying to safeguard Dutch national provisions on re-usable packaging."
"I would point out that at first reading, Green amendments were aimed specifically at enabling national re-use schemes to proceed, but on that occasion we unfortunately did not secure a big enough majority to get that through."
"The Greens strongly support re-use as an important way to reduce the environmental impact of packaging, but we share the reservations expressed by others about trying to tackle that in this directive by amending a recital."
"We appreciate the motivation, but we do not think this is the right place to do that."
"We are not sure anyway how an amendment will support the Dutch case, since it does not amend the current legislation."
"We are not convinced that this recital would have an impact on the Netherlands, since this legislation appears to be much more applicable to the ten new Member States than to the 'old' Member States."
"Even if it were applicable, I am not sure how much further forward it would take us."
"The main difference between what we already have in Directive 94/62/EC on re-use and what the rapporteur would like to introduce is a slight reinforcement of the level of encouragement to re-use."
"But given that the amendment is just to a recital, I do not see how it really strengthens the existing legal possibility."
"I strongly urge that we use all our efforts to promote re-use over recycling and recovery when we come to the full review of the packaging directive next year."
"I look forward to a strong Commission proposal next summer."
"That will be the right time to ensure that we give re-use the priority it deserves."
".The revised packaging and packaging waste directive marks another important step towards strategies and policies that focus on waste minimisation, recovery, reuse and recycling."
"In both the North and South of Ireland, similar directives are having a positive impact and changing both government practice and public mindsets with respect to domestic and commercial waste management. Much work remains to be done, but we now have many good examples to learn from, including innovative ideas on reuse."
"I also wish to stress the importance of deadlines for ensuring that Member States reach the targets agreed by the EU, and this includes deadlines for the newest Member States."
"At local government level in Ireland we have directives which show that recycling brings with it the notion of local authorities, from Belfast to Dublin, actively pursuing new forms of waste management, while at the same time government departments have been moved to concentrate their efforts as a result of these directives."
"It is important, however, that those countries which joined the European Union in June 2004 are treated fairly."
"I therefore support Mrs Corbey and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with respect to the amendments on this point."
"This is not about delay: it is about clarity, effectiveness and fairness."
"We need deadlines, but we also need clarity and fairness for all."
"On that basis the original agreement on dates should stand."
"It is also extremely important for us to ensure that countries can pursue policies on reuse and that we do not close down any possibilities in this respect."
"Mr President, in noting the delay in the implementation of the packaging waste directive that the accession states are to be allowed, I wish to say that, from our experience in Northern Ireland, they are fortunate to escape its requirements for several years."
"Under this directive, draconian regulations have been imposed on Northern Ireland."
"We now have the ludicrous requirement that a DIY retailer, for example, who buys in packaged goods and sells them on, is required to make returns detailing the net weight of the packaging of all such goods passing through his business, even though he never opens or discards any of the packaging."
"He is then liable to what amounts to a waste tax for merely handling the goods and, in addition, has to waste time and effort on trying to assess the weight of the packaging."
"I am therefore glad that the accession states are being spared this lunacy."
"I note with some surprise that the Republic of Ireland, although a long-established EU Member State, has also been permitted to defer full compliance until the beginning of 2012."
"Sadly, the United Kingdom did not seek equal derogation, so we are beset with the foolish regulations I have described."
"I am also somewhat surprised that the last speaker seems ignorant of the fact that there are different provisions in the Republic of Ireland and that it has been granted an extension and deferment until the end of 2011."
"Perhaps if she concentrated more on the documents, rather than speaking in a language that no one cares to understand, she might not have made such a fundamental mistake."
"Mr President, to follow on from what my two colleagues have just said, I took part in the adoption of this directive with Mrs Corbey and others."
"We were certainly under the impression that the dates mentioned in the preamble to the directive, as it was finally adopted, were the dates that would apply to the accession states."
"I therefore have some questions for the Commissioner."
"It is very nice to see her here for what must be one of her last debates as Environment Commissioner."
"First of all, have the accession states requested these earlier dates?"
"They are embarrassingly close to the Irish dates."
"Ireland, as we know, has been looking at this legislation for many years and has done absolutely nothing about it."
"Were these earlier dates that the Commission is proposing actually requested by the new Member States?"
"If not, on what basis have they been decided?"
"Second, are they based on any cost impact assessment?"
"There must be some additional cost between the dates that the new Member States wanted and the dates the Commission is proposing."
"I believe that these dates show the way in which the Commission operates."
"It sees much of this legislation as aspirational."
"As my colleague Mr Allister has said, we see it as legal texts that are put into operation."
"If we are not very careful, we will find a mass of used packaging being exported from the European Union to China and elsewhere in order to escape this situation."
"So could we please have those answers from the Commission?"
"Mr President, I have been provoked by several speakers but I will not be deterred from what I have to say."
"The key to achieving our ambitions in the area of the recycling and recovery of packaging waste is setting attainable targets based on realistic expectations."
"There is no point in setting a deadline that cannot be achieved and triggering the inevitable infringement procedures."
"As Mrs Corbey rightly points out in her report – and I thank her for her work – it is only fair and equitable that the same approach be taken with regard to our colleagues in the new Member States, as was indicted to them during the accession negotiations."
"Shifting the finishing line and imposing onerous time constraints at this stage would display a lack of good faith on our part as it unscrambles the hard-won result of the final trialogue on the revised directive earlier this year, as outlined in recital 6 to that directive, which I understood to list, for each new Member State, the date relating to the derogation."
"Our debate should focus not on argument about timetables, but on the reduction of the overall level of packaging and packaging waste through recycling and recovery."
"I would like to emphasise that the derogations in question are from the timetable and not from the substantive targets."
"This is an important distinction which demonstrates that we are not supporting a shirking of responsibilities."
"In advance of the Commission's report on the implementation of the original directive next June, I can report that a sensible policy of realistic derogation has already proved a success in my own country, and I hope Mrs Jackson will take note of what I am about to say."
"We have a specific problem of demographics, geography and lack of infrastructure, and no indigenous packaging industry, with 80% of our packaged goods being imported."
"Ireland has no energy recovery or incineration facilities so all our targets have to be met through recycling alone."
"However, we have seen the rate of recycling of packaging waste increase steadily from 93 000 tonnes in 1998 to just over 414 000 tonnes in 2003."
"This represents over 45% of the packaging waste on the Irish market, all of which would previously have gone to landfill."
"We have achieved our 2001 target of recycling 25% of packaging and we are well on our way to achieving the 2005 target of a 50% recycling rate thanks to proper, sensible timelines and derogations."
"There has been a clear shift in the public mindset in relation to recycling in Ireland."
"61% of adults visit their local Bring Centre at least once a month, as opposed to only 25% in 1998."
"Bringing about this change has taken – and will continue to take – time, effort and investment, a fact that is reflected in the 2011-2012 timetable set in the revised packaging directive for Greece, Portugal and Ireland."
"I was the author of that particular amendment and I thank my colleagues for their support."
"The same type of derogation and the same argument should apply to our colleagues in the new Member States."
"Our quest for better regulation as a Parliament must start with enforceable legislation."
"If we are to set unreasonable objectives for recycling and recovery of packaging waste which take no account of capacity constraints, we might just as well get it over with now, book our slot in advance at the ECJ for non-implementation and spare the Commission a waste of envelopes on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty."
"I would like to put on record my disappointment at Mr Allister's comment on Mrs de Brún speaking a language 'no one cares to understand'."
"It may well not be the time or place to speak in Irish, but I do not think that derogatory and disparaging remarks about anyone's language, albeit a minority language, have any place in this House and I take exception to them."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her outstanding work in this important and thought-provoking Directive on packaging waste."
"With the enlarged Europe we now find ourselves in a situation in which the common targets set to achieve harmonised legislation are particularly stringent for the newest Member States, and perhaps more so than ever before."
"In this sense, the proposal for a Directive on packaging and packaging waste is not exceptional."
"The entry into force of this directive must be based on the guarantee of an internal market that is as viable as possible without any risk of distortions."
"This is easier said than done."
"The area of the internal market has expanded, and there are perhaps greater differences in the basic standards of Member States than ever before."
"The Commission’s proposal to lay down a common deadline of December 2012 for the new Member States regarding recovery and recycling targets under the packaging waste directive can be justified for market convergence to be achieved as soon as possible."
"The proposal, however, is not without its problems."
"Consequently, it might well be prudent to take the long view and take basic standards in the new countries into greater consideration when setting the deadline."
"This way we will avoid any embarrassing repercussions that result from breaches of the conditions set and at the same time give priority to European convergence instead of market harmonisation which is now being discussed."
"There has also been much discussion in connection with the reading of the Directive on the recycling and recovery of packaging waste."
"The ecological value of reuse is incontestable."
"It should be realised, however, that the environmental friendliness of reused packaging is not always directly justifiable."
"For short transportation journeys it certainly is preferable, but problems arise when each producer has its own packaging and internal distances in the European market are long."
"A good example is the transportation of fruit from the countries in the south to the Nordic countries, where the retransportation of reused packaging would not promote sustainable development at all."
"For example, cardboard boxes and cartons are often collected and recycled locally, to avoid a large number of unnecessary journeys."
"Promoting reused packaging whilst ignoring environmental considerations would be ecologically hypocritical."
"From the point of view of the report under discussion now, it would be good if the objective of coherent adaptation were not unnecessarily compromised by vague reuse systems of packaging at national level."
"Before I call on Commissioner Wallström to speak, I shall remind Members who have intended to make use of unofficial Union languages that this institution has a profound respect for their decision but, at the same time, according to a Bureau decision of 27 October last, speeches made in these languages cannot be translated and, consequently, cannot be Minuted."
"Members are therefore free to choose whether to make use of the Union’s minority languages. At the same time let us remember that in the Constitution we have written , ‘united in diversity’."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I am sure you will appreciate it if I refrain from speaking northern Swedish – if there is such a thing."
"Firstly, Mrs Jackson, as you know, our proposal suggests a deadline of 31 December 2012 for all the new Member States."
"The amendment confirms the deadline for seven new Member States, but allows a deadline of 2013 for Malta, 2014 for Poland and 2015 for Latvia."
"In reply to your question, this reflects the wishes the new Member States expressed to the Commission in the consultation round in spring 2003."
"A recital in the revised directive states that the deadline to be agreed should not be later than those dates."
"It is also my understanding that no agreement was reached in conciliation on a particular date."
"The recital indicated specifically that the decision should be taken on the basis of requests from the acceding states for derogations, which would not in principle extend beyond the dates mentioned."
"So there is nothing to suggest that the date could not be earlier."
"The Commission considers that this matter should be debated openly, treating all countries equally."
"We have no problem in accepting differentiated dates, if that is what Parliament and the Council want."
"On the costs, we do not anticipate any significant change."
"There will be no dramatic change in costs if the dates are changed."
"Thank you for this important debate and your valuable cooperation on environmental issues."
"I hope we will meet again soon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Cuba."
". Mr President, the European Union's relations with Cuba are governed by the common position originally adopted by the Council in 1996, which has been updated and renewed regularly."
"The common position advocates a policy of constructive engagement with Cuba through enhanced dialogue with government and civil society with the objective of encouraging 'a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people'."
"This constructive engagement has remained our position."
"Following the large-scale imprisonment of dissidents in 2003, the Union took a series of political measures."
"In June 2003 the EU decided to limit bilateral high-level visits to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events, to invite Cuban members of the peaceful opposition to their national day celebrations alongside government representatives and to re-evaluate the common position ahead of time."
"The most recent re-evaluation of the common position in June this year re-affirmed the policy of constructive engagement as the basis of EU policy towards Cuba."
"The EU has repeatedly underscored the importance of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and has indicated its willingness to restart such a dialogue when conditions permit."
"The European Commission deplores the Cuban Government's decision to freeze relations with all embassies of EU Member States that have invited dissidents to their national days and with the Commission delegation in Havana, as well as the refusal of direct aid from the European Union."
"Despite Cuban decisions which impede our development cooperation activities, the Commission has continued funding actions by NGOs and humanitarian actions managed by ECHO."
"In October 2004 the Commission took a decision to provide EUR 1 million in humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable victims of hurricanes Ivan and Charlie in Cuba."
"We should not really talk about humanitarian assistance in this context because we would deliver humanitarian assistance in any case, without any political considerations."
"The decision by the Cuban Government to release certain dissidents on health grounds is a positive gesture to an improved situation, but not sufficient to warrant full revocation of the measures decided by the Council in June last year."
"The aim continues to be the release of all political prisoners in Cuba."
"The June measures are currently being reviewed by the Council."
"The European Council wishes to stress that the result of this review has to be consistent with the overall aims of the common position and the human rights policy of the EU."
"In the Commission's view, this could provide a basis for a constructive and future-oriented EU policy towards Cuba, which would be conducive to attaining the objectives of the common position."
"Some people have asked whether the delegation in Havana can really function meaningfully in the present circumstances."
"I want to make it clear that the delegation in Havana is essential to carry out the tasks that Parliament has asked the Commission to undertake."
"Our presence in Cuba is more important today than ever."
"The main tasks of the delegation are not only to assist with the implementation of eight programmes and projects, but also to promote a political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society, to monitor human rights issues and to protect the trade and investment interests of Member States."
"This is a heavy, important, and sometimes difficult agenda to pursue, but it is essential if we wish to promote political and economic improvements in Cuba."
"All in all, I would say that 2003 was a sad year in our relations with Cuba."
"In my view, it was a lost opportunity for Cuba and the EU that membership of the Cotonou Agreement did not succeed."
"I hope that what happened in 2003 will not turn out to be irreversible."
"I still find Cuban membership of the Cotonou Agreement a very meaningful framework for our relations."
"It represents the basic structure of how we would like to organise and govern north-south relations."
"Cuban participation in Cotonou also means that Cuba would be subject to peer pressure within the Cotonou Agreement."
"I hope that it is still possible to keep an open mind, but that also means an open mind inside Cuba."
". Mr President, few Members will have worked as hard to preserve our capacity for dialogue with the authorities of the regime and the Cuban people as I have during my period as chairman of this Parliament's committee responsible for relations with that country."
"But the dialogue that we advocate, that we believe in and which we put into practice, Mr President, has not been wrecked by any government of the European Union, nor by Osvaldo Payá, nor by Elisardo Sánchez, nor by Marta Beatriz Roque, but by the policy of executions, the arrest of independent journalists - such as Raúl Rivero, who is currently rotting in Cuban prisons, and others - and the policy of arresting peaceful dissidents and human rights campaigners."
"Faced with these events, our Parliament cannot remain deaf, dumb and blind."
"The Council's common position, which some people wish pointlessly to alter – and we have the results of today’s comparison, which have been a spectacular disaster for the approach of changing it - requesting a new report from the Ambassadors in Havana, has served, as expressed by Mario Vargas Llosa in an article published recently in the newspaper, to send a clear message to the millions of Cubans who cannot protest, vote or escape, that they are not alone, that they have not been abandoned and that the western democracies are with them."
"What is proposed to us by certain political groups in this Parliament in their resolution, where there is not even any mention of calling for the release of political prisoners?"
"To cooperate and talk with the villains and mock the victims?"
"To be complacent towards those who oppress them?"
"To seek a policy of appeasement and friendship with tyranny?"
"Mr President, Andrei Sakharov, who left us a legacy of moral integrity and a significant lesson in peaceful co-existence between peoples, said that the voices that count are often those which cannot be heard."
"Mr President, the forced absence from the Sakharov Prize award ceremony last year of one of its most honourable recipients, Osvaldo Payá, is the best possible argument for speaking out on behalf of those people inside and outside of Cuba who are fighting for their freedom and dignity, and for this Parliament, Mr President, to be very forceful in its demand for freedom, as it has always been."
"Mr President, in its relations with Cuba, as with any other country of the world, and particularly the developing world, the European Union must pursue two objectives: on the one hand, it must contribute to improving the lives of the Cuban people in all respects, including in terms of freedoms and human rights, areas in which we note serious shortcomings, and on the other, it must defend European interests of other types in Cuba."
"There have been two characteristics of the European Union’s policy on Cuba over recent years that have set that country apart, made it an exception, all in line with an unjustifiable approach which the founders of that policy were never able to justify."
"The European Union’s dialogue and cooperation with all the countries of the world includes a chapter on the human rights situation."
"It is an extremely important chapter, but there are others."
"Only in the case of Cuba is the human rights chapter exclusive, precluding any other chapter which should exist in our relations with that country."
"Furthermore, with all the countries of the world, the European Union’s dialogue and cooperation is aimed at overcoming shortcomings in the field of human rights."
"Only in the case of Cuba do those human rights shortcomings become a prior condition, preventing dialogue and cooperation."
"At this point we must carry out an objective evaluation of that policy, the results of which have been a complete failure."
"Such an objective view reveals that, through this policy, not the slightest progress has been made in relation to freedoms or human rights in Cuba."
"In addition to this, this policy has been a disaster for European interests in Cuba and it is condemned equally by businesspeople, non-governmental organisations, artists, religious leaders, etc. It has also been disastrous in terms of our diplomatic representatives carrying out their activities normally in that country."
"Furthermore, however, this policy has demonstrated a complete distancing of our European societies from their respective national governments and the European Union itself, and absolutely no notice has been taken of their views."
"Similarly, various initiatives ignored or even boycotted by official bodies have attracted a great deal of participation from artists, authors, businesspeople and citizens of our countries."
"I am referring, for example, to the art biennale, the book fair, the ballet festival or the trade fair in Havana."
"The Vice-Chairman of the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, has been in Cuba over recent days carrying out a programme of contacts at the highest level."
"It was no doubt to him that a distinguished colleague was referring when on Monday he talked about the visitors to the island, and I am sure it was with particular bitterness that his party colleague spoke of him."
"Finally, we believe that this policy has damaged Europe’s credibility in Cuba and in the whole of Latin America, by giving the impression that we are supporting US strategies in the region."
"Following this assessment, our conclusion is that the policy pursued so far by the European Union in relation to Cuba, and which is based on the common position and measures, must be reviewed, rationalised and updated."
"What we are saying is in line with what several Member State governments are saying in the European Council."
"Furthermore, we would make it absolutely clear that the change of policy we are advocating must not only mean not giving up on any of our objectives – expressed at the beginning of my speech – but must confirm them and aspire to contributing to achieving them more effectively than has been the case so far."
"We are convinced that the progress we are pursuing for Cubans and for European interests in Cuba will be achieved more easily through broad and rigorous dialogue and cooperation, which is critical whenever it needs to be, but never hostile and without making any prejudgements."
"Furthermore, in doing so we will be applying the same approach to that country as we do to China, Vietnam, Iran, Israel, Syria, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan and also the United States and dozens of other countries in which we note very serious shortcomings, which in many cases are much more serious than those in Cuba, in terms of freedoms, human rights and the Rule of Law, but with which we talk and cooperate precisely with a view to improving the things we do not like."
"Mr President, that is the aim of the resolution presented by our group and supported by other sections of the House."
"Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour. Exactly two years ago, we awarded the Cuban democracy activist, Oswaldo Payá our Sakharov Prize."
"It was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that had proposed him for this prize, and he received it for his courageous fight for democracy and justice in Cuba."
"He received it as a representative of all Cubans from different party groups: Christian Democrats, Liberals, Social Democrats and others who, by peaceful means, are trying to pave the way for a new Cuba without Castro, whether his name be Fidel or Raoul."
"Payá and the others are working for a Cuba in which democracy, human rights, pluralism, freedom and justice exist for all."
"It was not easy getting Oswaldo Payá here."
"On several occasions, the Cuban regime tried to prevent him from coming, but we succeeded in the end."
"Unfortunately, we did not succeed in getting him to come back."
"Since Oswaldo Payá was awarded the Sakharov Prize, the situation in Cuba has deteriorated."
"About eighty democracy activists have been arrested and sentenced, following farcical trials, to very long prison sentences."
"They are now spread out over the island."
"They are faring badly."
"Their living conditions are appalling, and they very rarely see their families."
"Many of them are ill."
"I have met many of these people."
"They are fantastic, courageous people who wish to adopt a peaceful route to establishing human dignity and democracy for themselves and their fellow countrymen."
"For Castro, the dictator pathetically romanticised by many in Europe, these people are, however, a grave threat."
"That is why they had to be silenced. That is why they have been imprisoned."
"Osvaldo himself is at liberty, and his family is harassed on a daily basis."
"The situation in Cuba, one of the world’s last Communist dictatorships, is worse."
"No progress has been made since the Council toughened its so-called common position."
"Castro continues to be intractable."
"He appears to want to isolate the country completely."
"Just as the Commissioner said, he is boycotting the EU and our Member States."
"Several Members of the European Parliament, including Swedish MEPs, have been denied entry to the country."
"There is a debate at the present moment as to whether the EU should modify its common position or make it less stringent."
"That would be very unfortunate."
"Why should we reward Castro when there is no progress on human rights?"
"For once, the EU has a consistent position on a dictatorship."
"Why, then, should we change it?"
"Oswaldo Payá and the other dissidents are appealing to us to hold fast to our values and to the policy we have adopted."
"That is why it is important to intensify our dialogue with the dissidents and to support a gradual transition to democracy."
"We honoured Oswaldo Payá and the other Cuban democracy activists here in this House, and that was a long-term commitment."
"We must stand up for human rights and vigorously reject a change to the common position."
"Just like ourselves, Cubans are entitled to democracy and human rights."
"Let us show them which side we are on."
". Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group is unequivocal in its defence of freedom and human rights."
"For us, the defence of all the rights of Cubans is a key issue."
"We have always called for the release of all prisoners and we also call for a clear transition to democracy."
"The question at the moment is how best to push Cuba towards democracy; after 40 years of embargo, and now with the European Union’s sanctions, we can see that this method is not effective and that the best way to help Cuban society is not to isolate it, but rather to create increasingly close and strong relations with Cuban civil society, to help the NGOs in society."
"The openness of Cuban society is at stake here."
"We cannot help a society which wants to move towards democracy by means of a confrontation which only seeks, through the resolution of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a break-off of relations with unforeseeable consequences, when what we want, as for any part of the world, is an agreed transition, without violence, which can lead to the democracy which everybody, in particular the Verts/ALE Group, is seeking."
"We therefore support this Resolution in favour of Cuban society and in favour of democracy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our friendly relations with Cuba are longstanding and ongoing."
"You see, Cuba is an example of a small island attempting to determine its own existence, and to do so in a way that is different compared with the great imperial power."
"We look on this with solidarity."
"Naturally, we are also able to express our criticisms, explicitly and without restraint, as we have done and continue to do, as regards the death penalty and certain judicial procedures, for example."
"However, we consider it mistaken, unjust and unacceptable that punitive measures should be taken against Cuba."
"For decades, Cuba has suffered from a ferocious economic blockade imposed by the US administration."
"Frankly, there is no reason why Europe should align itself with such measures."
"On the contrary, it is precisely relations, trade and engagement that can foster understanding and improvements."
"In Latin America important and historic events are taking place, as witnessed by the victory of progressive forces in countries such as Brazil, Venezuela and Uruguay."
"By comparison with the logic of laissez-faire globalisation and war – and today we have seen some terrible images – the need for an alternative politics is emerging: Cuba is part of this Latin America."
"The relationship with Europe helps this Latin America, and the relationship with Latin America helps Europe."
"We call for the abolition of all measures discriminating against Cuba and, consequently, of the Council’s common position; a similar demand must be addressed to the US Government."
"At the same time, we call for a strengthening of free and fruitful relations."
"Mr President, thank you. Fidel Castro’s antics are hard to follow, both literally and figuratively, but also politically, socio-economically and culturally speaking. stands his ground."
"His word is law."
"Just ask the opposition."
"It becomes the European Union that it wishes to recognise and support the independent Cuban spirits."
"Today, however, this policy is under internal pressure."
"According to reports, the Spanish Government in particular would like to leave Cuban dissidents out in the cold from now on, and Madrid is looking to recruit allies among the other Member States."
"This unfortunate development prompted the Christian trade union leader in my country, Doekle Terpstra, to send a letter to the Dutch Presidency earlier this week."
"This letter urges the European Union not to make any concessions in respect of Castro’s dictatorship in exchange for trade benefits."
"I am only too pleased to lend my backing to this appeal."
"At the same time, I would ask the Council and Commission whether there is any coordination between the EU’s human rights policy and that of the United States with regard to Castro’s Cuba?"
"If so, how do they intend to reinforce it?"
"Finally, I should like to make a request to the Commission."
"As a Member of this House, I am looking forward to a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Cuba, including future scenarios, from your point of view."
"The fact that we have an official delegation in Havana should make this feasible."
"I should like to finish off with the appeal by Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas. Thanks to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I have just read the letter that is addressed to the President of this House."
"This letter is basically saying that all governments, regional and international associations and institutions, should, if they really wish to enter into normal relations with Cuba, begin by demanding amnesty for the political prisoners."
"We should avoid at all costs forging relationships while the rights of all Cubans are still being violated."
"I thank you."
"I speak as a representative of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"On 5 June 2003, the Council voted unanimously to impose political sanctions on the Cuban regime, following the indictment of 75 dissidents and the death sentence imposed on three citizens who had tried to flee to the United States."
"This event unfortunately fits into a general picture of continued and repeated violations and negation of fundamental freedoms in Cuba, as also confirmed recently by COLAT."
"Fidel Castro’s regime, which is in severe difficulty following growing internal and international pressure, is becoming more and more oppressive and repressive, in particular towards the younger generation, which dreams of a future of freedom, true democracy and development, a new and open horizon, incompatible with the current communist establishment."
"Europe should therefore pursue the firm path it has embarked upon, taking particular care, however, to avoid at all costs any further negative repercussions for the population, with the aim of laying the foundations for a productive and renewed dialogue free of resentment between the Cuban people and Europe in the period after Fidel Castro: friends of Cuba, friends of the Cubans, enemies of all dictators."
"Mr President, there is manoeuvring going on by governments and Members of Parliament which is difficult to understand, for two reasons: firstly, because it is not always open and because it often smells of complicity."
"Secondly, because the manoeuvring is not consistent with the constant, repeated and dramatic demands of those people who are fighting peacefully and suffering in Cuba."
"They are shadowy manoeuvres and appear to show such a desire to betray our 2002 Sakharov Prize winner, that I am reminded of a poem by a great lady of Portuguese poetry, Sofia de Mello Breyner, who died a few weeks ago: ‘Tears for today’."
"We will never cry enough when we see a person with the courage to fight destroyed by contempt, malice and other means we know of which are so cunning, so subtle and so expert that they are almost beyond description’."
"When we talk about Cuba and the Cuban regime, we must always ask ourselves the question: what kind of Parliament is this?"
"That is the question we must answer."
"We are not talking on our own behalf, but on behalf of the actual people fighting and suffering for freedom and democracy."
"This is not a party-political issue; it is a fundamental political and human issue for the real people over in Cuba, where the pain is felt, who are watching us and listening to us: Bárbaro Sevilla García, 22 years old, executed;"
"Lorenzo Copello Castillo, 30 years old, executed;"
"Jorge Luis Martínez Izak, 40 years old, executed;"
"Víctor Rolando Arroyo Carmona, sentenced to 26 years in prison;"
"Miguel Galbán Gutiérrez, sentenced to 26 years in prison;"
"Jorge Vero Castañeda, sentenced to 20 years in prison;"
"Pablo Pacheco Ávila, sentenced to 20 years in prison."
"Mr President, I do not have time now to read all the names of the dozens of victims of the tragic March of 2003, and their families, friends and colleagues."
"There are so many of them that I do not have time."
"What is the significance of not having time to name them all?"
"It means that this is not the time to change our European policy, but rather for Fidel Castro and the Cuban regime to change theirs."
"That is what is needed."
"Amnesty first, and then dialogue."
"– Mr President, the resolution tabled for adoption by plenary in the European Parliament at the initiative of the Socialist Group comes along at a particularly crucial time for relations between the European Union and Cuba, for the Cuban people and for the future of the country. I would even add for our collective credibility as institutions of the European Union."
"Cuba has suffered for many years the unacceptable, unilateral and revengeful policy of isolation and commercial and economic exclusion of the United States, which has pushed the Cuban people into poverty and forced the regime to harden."
"Unfortunately, this deadlock policy, which is characterised by selective sensitivity to the question of human rights and democratic freedoms, was also applied by the European Union in its decisions to impose sanctions and freeze relations and dialogue."
"This had a very adverse effect at all levels."
"The planned objective was not achieved, in that European public opinion itself, non-governmental organisations and business and cultural associations ignored the official policy of the European Union and continued to maintain relations and work with Cuban society."
"We need to be honest."
"The situation in human rights, the rule of law and democratic freedoms in Cuba is not good."
"However, as international experience has proven, isolation and segregation are not a credible or effective policy."
"Wherever such a policy has been applied, the people have ultimately paid the price."
"The European Union, and the Council of Ministers in particular, should radically rethink its deadlock stand and have the courage to lift sanctions and restore relations with Cuba immediately."
"It should proceed to establish political dialogue, as a means of advancing relations and as a means of controlling the conduct of the Cuban authorities."
"It should proceed to open negotiations on the conclusion of a cooperation agreement."
"Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has no such agreement. The European Union should support the funding of programmes in the humanitarian aid and infrastructure sectors."
"The recent natural disasters have created serious problems for the Cuban people."
"Finally, the European Union should take an immediate decision to integrate Cuba into the Cotonou Agreement within the framework of relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"The Cuban people cannot suffer double punishment, both from the United States and from the European Union."
"If the fight for the defence of human rights and the building of a democratic society in Cuba is in fact an honest rather than an ostentatious fight, then the European Union should listen to the voice of European public opinion, of our people, and proceed to lift sanctions and develop relations and contacts with Cuba."
"Mr President, there are two facts here: Cuba does not have political freedom, and neither did Spain when, under the Franco regime, with the jails full of political prisoners, she signed a spectacular trade agreement with the European Union."
"That is a fact."
"Another true fact is that the European Union has maintained a common position since 1996 which has produced no positive result whatsoever and which has made no contribution to improving the situation on the island."
"Statements to the effect that those who do not agree, for example, with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or with the exiles in Miami, are on the side of Castro, are exactly the kind of things we have heard from the White House, saying that those who questioned the US position on Iraq were automatically allied with Saddam Hussein."
"They are poor arguments, devoid of content and entirely inconsistent with European political reality, with the way in which we in Europe have dealt with our relations with every other region of the world, where we have rejected the black and white approach, a dialogue between Saint Michael and Satan, and where we work in accordance with the specific reality, with political practice, with changes as they take place."
"We have done so in relation to Libya, in relation to Iran, in relation to Korea."
"We have done so in relation to other countries and we want to continue doing so with Cuba."
"The European Union’s position on Cuba cannot be based on a gut reaction or an instinctive rejection of the political reality of Cuba or the figure of Fidel Castro."
"The European Union’s policy on Cuba must be born of reason, as is the case with so many other places, and must take account of the real needs of the Cuban people."
"The resolution to be voted on tomorrow, if voted for in its original version, prohibits the Council from modifying or even reconsidering the position on Cuba until Cuban jails have been emptied."
"We would like to empty Cuban jails of political prisoners and we would like political freedom in Azerbaijan and in Ukraine and in Belarus and in Sudan, and in China as well."
"But we know that this is far from pragmatic and inconsistent with the political realism with which we in Europe can act and which has produced many results in many parts of the world."
"We would also like the fanaticism of certain people to be replaced with pragmatic thinking so that we can really move towards the peaceful transition in Cuba that some people are doing everything they can to prevent."
"Mr President, we have little time to deal with a situation as complex and as rich as that in Cuba."
"We certainly must in this short time remember the battle of David and Goliath: the battle of an island which, for over forty years, has suffered from a war waged by the world giant – the United States."
"But we are in Europe, and we must speak about Europe."
"I consider it quite right that the European Union should change its attitude towards Cuba, because our current position is entirely subservient to US Government pressure."
"Europe would in this way signal its independence, its autonomy – which does not mean conflict with the United States, but actually means autonomy and independence of judgment in international affairs."
"There is talk of the fight against terrorism, of the fight for human rights, but there is a question that I should like to ask."
"Why is it that in any part of the world someone who hijacks a ship or an aeroplane is called a terrorist, whereas someone who does the same in Cuba is called a defender of freedom or a dissident?"
"Why are there double standards when one speaks of Cuba and when one speaks of Iraq?"
"These are the reasons why – just to show that I am a romantic and love poetry – I should have no hesitation in supporting all actions and resolutions in favour of Cuba, its people and its original revolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cuba must not become some kind of fenced-off reserve, with a sign on the fence reading ‘human rights not respected here’."
"Cuba is not an ‘animal farm’, to use the title of a book by George Orwell, nor is it Fidel Castro’s ‘farm’."
"During yesterday’s one-minute speeches, it was said that Members of this House should not travel to Cuba on EU money, but that is not the issue at stake."
"We must stand firm and continue to call on the Cuban regime to respect human rights, and we must be rigorous in demanding the release of political prisoners."
"We should not, however, create additional barriers and obstacles."
"If we isolate Cuba, Castro is most likely to benefit, not the opposition."
"According to Human Rights Watch, Castro is not suffering under the US embargo, but the Cuban people as a whole most certainly are."
"The Eighth Session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will begin next Saturday in the Netherlands, and in view of this I should like to note that 77 of the countries that are Members of the Assembly believe that relations with Cuba should be stepped up, not scaled down."
"We would do well to fight for human rights, and we should do so effectively."
"Sometimes, even if our intentions are good and we defend the correct values, we may unintentionally cause harm to the people of Cuba and assist those who order them to chant ‘socialism or death!’"
"I hope the decision taken on Cuba by the EU’s 25 Foreign Affairs Ministers in December will be realistic and that it will defend human rights."
"Mr President, Cuba has regrettably failed to make any progress on human rights in the past year, indeed, since I last spoke on the subject."
"But it has had the recent good fortune of Mr Zapatero's new socialist government coming to power in Spain."
"Mr Zapatero seems keen to cosy up to Castro, aided and abetted – shamefully – by the British, Italian and French Governments, which have decided to try to change the tough policy of ostracising the Castro regime and regularly inviting Cuban dissidents to EU embassy functions."
"This was done last year in protest, after Mr Castro imprisoned 75 dissidents and human rights activists and executed three ferry highjackers fleeing the island."
"Castro has recently expelled visiting European MPs and NGO workers keen to engage with dissidents under the Varela Project."
"The role of Prime Minister Blair, as a close friend of President Bush, who is tough on Cuba, is a bit of a mystery, unless it is some shabby deal cut over Gibraltar, which is thankfully off the agenda in Madrid right now."
"For a long time the Cuban Government has been able to blame all the country's woes on the American embargo."
"That is why our resolution supports lifting it."
"I am not sure that will help, as lifting it might relieve the increasing economic hardship, worsened by Castro's stupidity in recently banning the dollar for trading purposes as a response to tighter travel restrictions by the US on Cuban exiles visiting their families."
"Oswaldo Payá, our Sakarov Prize winner, is still denied the right to visit the European Parliament, but he has written a letter to President Borrell, urging the EU to stand firm on its common European position for as long as the authorities continue their violations of fundamental rights, which included a disgraceful lack of adequate medical care for Cuban prisoners."
"I applaud the resolve of countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have been used to the tyranny of communism and have stood firm on any relaxation of the current arrangements."
"No doubt when the ailing tyrant finally passes away many in this House will sing his praises as the historic father of the nation, as they have recently done sycophantically on the death of President Arafat."
"I, however, will regard the departure of President Castro as a fresh chance to build a prosperous and democratic Cuba."
"Mr President, I very much agree with Commissioner Nielson that 2003 was a sad year for EU-Cuba relations, and one of lost opportunities."
"I was in Cuba recently with colleagues on an ad hoc delegation."
"I saw for myself the enormous potential of that country – a potential unrealised at present as a result, among other things, of the US sanctions and the current situation with the European Union."
"I also agree with Commissioner Nielson that we need a constructive EU policy towards Cuba."
"Others in this House do not seem to have been listening."
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra is not listening to me now, but he said a few moments ago that we should stand firm in demanding freedom."
"Mrs Malmström said that the Cubans have a right to democracy."
"Do they believe that people on this side of the House do not believe in human rights?"
"They were not listening to Mr Martinez earlier on."
"We have made it clear that we do believe in human rights."
"No one in this House has ever defended the death penalty."
"However, we have to be realistic."
"After 45 years, changes will not come quickly."
"Some people in this House will also argue that we should never talk to political opponents if we disagree fundamentally with their political and military tactics."
"Where has that ever got anyone?"
"Can anyone think of an example where that has improved the situation?"
"I think that some people have a fairly naive understanding of democracy and the way things work."
"I could respond to Mr Tannock's rather pathetic remarks, but it belittles this debate to bring in all sorts of other issues when we are talking about Cuba."
"I would remind Mr Tannock and others, when they are looking for parallels or examples around the world, that in different circumstances the UK Government never got anywhere with the Irish situation until we were prepared to enter into very difficult negotiations with our political opponents, people with whom we disagreed fundamentally. That is the only way we are going to achieve peace in the Middle East."
"We have to have dialogue in countries like Cuba."
"That is why I would argue that we need an exchange of ideas in order to promote change."
"The present EU policy, founded on the issue of who is invited to summer parties – or not – does not help Cuba or Europe, and needs to be changed."
"I urge Members to think very carefully and support a sensible and realistic compromise text that will move the EU forward, will help Cuba and will help the world."
"Mr President, the law passed in Cuba this year limiting access to the Internet is a clear violation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"It was adopted as a punishment to society, following the statements made last year by a group of 75 protesters fighting for the freedom to express their opinions."
"The law allows the Internet to be accessed only from selected businesses and government offices."
"It should also be noted that in 2002 the government placed a ban on the sale of computers to the public, making this year’s law merely one more in a series of measures aimed at protesters and independent journalists."
"Cuba and its left-wing allies all over the world constantly present us with the myth of the revolutionary event that took place several decades ago, when the corrupt Batista government was overthrown."
"Are we to allow this myth to blind us to the reality of life in the modern police state of Cuba, to the imprisonment, repression and persecution suffered by those who merely desire liberty and basic civil freedoms?"
"As citizens of a part of Europe that was occupied by Russia and its Communist allies for decades, we know how much meaning a small gesture of solidarity by the free world can have for activists campaigning on behalf of those who have been imprisoned and persecuted because of their views."
"We know from our own experience that the only thing anti-democratic regimes take any notice of is firmness and consistency, and that all the efforts of such regimes are directed towards breaking international solidarity with human rights defenders."
"This is the very reason why we must not disengage ourselves."
"Measures we can and should take as EU Member States include diplomatic sanctions and support for those who defend civil rights."
"It is also important to speak out on their behalf in the international arena."
"My message to those who thoughtlessly carry round gadgets bearing images of Che Guevara is merely that they should add to them the slogan ‘Cuba yes, we’re starting afresh’."
"The dissidents charged with conspiring against Cuba’s independence and territorial integrity were actually imprisoned simply because they exercised their fundamental rights in a peaceful manner."
"It should be noted that the number of those suffering persecution has increased and decreased in proportion to the level of pressure exerted by other countries, and also in proportion to the extent of Fidel Castro’s international interests."
"The current escalation is a step backwards for human rights in Cuba, and it is therefore crucially important that international support for Cuban democrats be reiterated, and that diplomatic sanctions be kept in place against the regime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been an atmosphere of suspense in Cuba for some time."
"External pressures are mounting, while internally there has been a relative worsening of the situation for freedom of expression and more generally for human rights."
"In this situation, the European Union must take up a clear position, without waiting for further events."
"What is Europe’s objective?"
"It is proper to ask ourselves this question, because there are those who, especially in the United States, are hoping for a traumatic collapse of the regime, based on a hegemonic vision that has not altered substantially ever since the embargo was imposed."
"Meanwhile, I must say that it is difficult to see what dynamic vision the ruling classes of Cuba now have for the future of their nation after the end of the cold war."
"All told, one can see a stalemate, caused by political immobilism both at home and abroad."
"In this situation, I believe that the Union cannot simply entrench itself behind the question of human rights, or, worse still, line up behind those who would use it as a political jemmy."
"There are plenty of examples to show that what applies to Cuba does not apply in equal measure to many other countries."
"The recent European Union–ASEAN summit, with the full participation of Burma, perfectly encapsulates the double standard that operates on human rights."
"Even today, in this Chamber, when Commissioner Patten was speaking on the subject of the arms embargo on China, he stated that the Commission has never established a direct link between a possible lifting of the embargo and human rights policy."
"He did clarify, however, and quite rightly, that further progress in the field of human rights could make a change in Europe’s attitude easier."
"Well then, I do not see why the same pragmatic attitude, based on a positive and motivational approach – and not simply one that is sanctions-based and punitive – cannot also be applied to Cuba."
"As we all know from experience, in the era of globalisation, helping to break Cuba’s isolation through greater economic cooperation would not fail to have positive repercussions on its internal politics, beginning precisely with human rights."
"Only those who look to the future with the eyes of the past, anticipating ideological revenge, can ignore this simple truth."
"That is why the European Union needs to change gear."
"We need more imagination and a new and autonomous policy towards Cuba."
"A more advanced and intense phase of political dialogue and cooperation must be opened up, which fully involves not only governments but also civil society in all its facets."
"We need to clear the path to a peaceful, negotiated transition towards a fully democratic and pluralistic change, and affirm the notion of a Cuban road to democracy."
"These must now be the objectives of the European Union."
"Mr President, to the things I condemned yesterday in this very House – that is to say, the obscure backroom manoeuvres of the Spanish Government aimed at reducing the sanctions imposed by the European Union on the Castro regime – I can now add the media manipulation of the results of the meeting of the European Council’s Committee on Latin America, which at no point has reduced the sanctions imposed on the regime in 2003."
"Those sanctions – I would remind certain confused Members – were not implemented by the ‘hordes’ of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but during the Greek Socialist Government’s Presidency of the Union."
"What has the Castro regime done over the last year to be thrown such an unexpected and generous lifeline?"
"The answer is simple: nothing."
"Or rather it has imprisoned and tortured more opponents and isolated the Cuban population even further, moving them further away from our dream: a free and democratic Cuba."
"I do not intend to give up on that dream and I know that many members of other groups in this Parliament, including the Socialist Group, will not do so either."
"This Parliament has always been a model and a pioneer in defence of human rights and at this critical time it must demonstrate that it will not throw in its lot with a corrupt dictator in full decline nor be carried along by the collaborationism of certain Members who have always been manipulated by that dictatorship."
"The democratic model of co-existence on the island and the hope of a peaceful political transition which will give Cuba and its people the important role on the international stage they have always deserved must win out today."
"In order to achieve that aim, it is essential that all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Castro’s jails be released immediately, that the torture and execution of dissidents cease immediately, that there be free dialogue amongst all the parties and the recognition by the regime that it is they who are isolated rather than the brave people of Cuba who are calling for freedom."
"I would call on all my fellow Members to share this dream with me and I hope that we will all wake up one day soon to a free Cuba in control of its own destiny."
"Mr President, I have always been surprised that Cuba should be used as a missile we launch against each other, depending on our individual ideological persuasions, and solely for the benefit of public opinion within certain European countries, in particular in my country, Spain."
"Can we not take this opportunity – it would appear not – to come together and think solely of the Cuban people, of their present and their future, rather than make the issue an excessively ideological one and exploit it for party political purposes?"
"What are the aspirations of the Cuban people?"
"I believe we would all agree that their aspiration is to overcome the immense deficiencies they suffer in both the economic field and in the field of freedoms and civil, social and political rights."
"I believe their aspiration is to have the hope of a better future, to begin, sooner rather than later, an ordered and peaceful democratic transition to bring reconciliation to all Cubans, those living in Cuba and those in exile."
"I believe they would like the Europeans not to fight amongst ourselves – as we are doing here tonight – but rather to unite to help them as much as possible, because they must be the masters of their future, not us."
"Mr President, our differences today relate to the common position adopted by the European Union in 1996."
"Some governments and some honourable Members propose reforming it; others propose not changing a thing, but both are legitimate positions, there are arguments for both, and they do not mean that one side are lackeys of the United States and the others are accomplices of Fidel Castro."
"Let us leave aside this type of argument, as the previous speaker said."
"I believe that, after eight years, the common position deserves evaluation and a possible but consensual reform, with a very broad, practically unanimous, agreement in the Council, which allows us to explore new positions on Cuba which are more effective but in no way provide a lifeline for the Cuban dictatorship and which in no way undermine the dissidents, the opposition or the political prisoners, many of whom are suffering dreadfully in prison."
"If the huge majority of this House is convinced that in Cuba there is a totalitarian dictatorship and an oppressed people who deserve our help and if we agree on the need to end the damaging US embargo and that dialogue between governments is a valid instrument, why are we going to find it so difficult to agree on a policy on Cuba?"
"As you will understand, however, I am very sceptical, given our debate tonight."
"Mr President, the Cuban political system is unique in the world."
"We, as a parliament, absolutely condemn the human rights situation in the country and the lack of free speech."
"However, that is not to say that the situation is all bad."
"On a recent visit to the country we found that schools, where there is a ratio of 15 pupils to one teacher, are the envy of Europe."
"The humanitarian work of educating doctors to transform health services in developing countries is not a case of talking about solidarity with Africa, but acting on solidarity with Africa."
"Today, however, relations between the EU and Cuba are at an all-time low."
"There has been no high-level contact between the governments of the EU and Cuba for over a year."
"The situation came about as a result of the EU pursuing sanctions against Cuba for a crackdown on dissidents in 2003."
"The sanctions came in the form of an invitation to Cuban dissidents to attend Member States' national day celebrations, alongside government representatives in Cuba."
"This action clearly infuriated the Cubans."
"They were the ones who cut off contact."
"My appeal tonight is that we should be consistent in our approach to human rights."
"By all means condemn human rights violations in Cuba, but do the same in China."
"If you are to impose these kinds of sanctions on Cuba, then impose them on China as well."
"I feel that the EU strategy relating to Cuba is to spread an incredible degree of naivety."
"Did we really think that we could shift the human rights agenda in Cuba by inviting a few dissidents to a party when 40 years of US embargo have failed? We need to adopt alternative strategies to push the human rights agenda."
"The current method is not working."
"Mr White argued for the freeing of all dissidents in Cuba."
"What about Spain?"
"Do you want to free all dissidents in Spain as well?"
"I will not be lectured to by the Spanish PPE on visiting Cuba when the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Ancram, was swanning around Havana last week."
"It is time that you and Mr Tannock got over losing the elections."
"Get over it and stop imposing your stupid obsessions on the rest of the European Parliament!"
"Mr President, Cuba is clearly a very sensitive, as well as a very complex, subject, and I do of course agree with those who say that the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, should work for more democracy and respect for human rights across the world, and that is also true of Cuba."
"The fundamental question we should be asking ourselves, though, is how we can best achieve this, how we can best help the Cuban people."
"Is it by rejecting dialogue with the Cuban authorities, and thus with a large majority of civil society?"
"I do not think so."
"Yet that, today, is the reality of the situation on the ground."
"Since the channels of communication with the Europeans have been closed, the EU’s common position has produced no satisfactory results."
"An assessment is therefore in order, provided it is a rational one, and the common position may need to be adapted."
"Indeed, along with a few other MEPs, I recently visited Cuba, and we were able to witness for ourselves a number of positive developments concerning education, for example, or health care."
"We ought to tell them this and we also ought to tell them that there are many aspects in Cuba we do not like at all, but at least we ought to strike up a dialogue, like we do with other countries including China, Saudi Arabia or Vietnam."
". Mr President, just one remark for the sake of good order."
"One Member mentioned that we should do more on humanitarian aid: this is not part of the political equation."
"We provide humanitarian aid in reaction to need, and provide it where that need is, without considering politics."
"This point is very important, and it is important that I take the time to repeat our position."
"We are in Cuba when needed for humanitarian reasons, as in all other places including North Korea etc."
"I am quite sure that this is not up for discussion here."
"I am not saying this because I feel it is a real problem in this House, but because it is important never to make that mistake."
"I tend to agree with those who have said that the common position has not produced any results."
"The problem is, however, what other instruments are available that will produce results?"
"It is not easy and the risk of being disappointed is always present."
"As I see it there is an ongoing struggle between hardliners and more constructive, open-minded people in the leadership in Havana."
"This moves back and forth in an unpredictable manner and is a reaction both to internal events and a reaction to the pressure from Cuba's big neighbour."
"There is a need to do more than putting our rhetoric on autopilot – referring to basic principles of human rights and so on."
"I do not think this discussion is necessary in Parliament."
"I do not see this Parliament as a place where we should have a discussion for or against human rights."
"This really is not the place."
"If we are serious about it we have to be pragmatic."
"The other approach is the easy one and we have to get into the game, we have to get closer to the real politics of change and progress in Cuba if possible."
"Nobody can give any guarantees."
"In 2003 I attempted to see what could be done and I was disappointed."
"However, this was a reaction resulting, in my view, from the very unpredictable inner circles in Havana."
"Another frustration that we run into in Europe again and again is that, whenever it is attractive to do so, it is a fashion in Cuba to put us in the same category as the US."
"It makes it very easy – even convenient – for hardliners in Havana to do this, supporting their view – driven by paranoia – that the whole world is against them."
"This is wrong, Europe is not against Cuba and definitely not against the Cubans."
"We do not like the regime, we do not like the old fashioned dictatorial way of managing a society, but we also do not want to be associated with the way in which the United States conducts its relationship with its neighbour."
"Europe is different; our thinking concerning Cuba is different and we have to pay some sort of investment to make this an inescapable reality in the internal discussions in Havana."
"For our part, we have to be willing to have some element of risk to make it impossible for the hardliners to portray Europe as if Europe and the US are the same thing."
"That is the investment we must be courageous, constructive and self-assured enough to make."
"If we are not ready to make an investment to create a real basis for a dialogue – one that is defined by us and not by a paranoid representation of the way the hardliners in Havana see the outside world – we are only relying on autopilot-defined rhetoric or, in other words, the old common position."
"We should not make it a straitjacket."
"Please remember that for a number of years the very same common position did not prohibit Europe from engaging in a bolder, closer and more critical dialogue on human rights with Cuba."
"We did that against the same background in terms of the common position."
"European investment in the Cuban economy also grew remarkably while we held the same common position."
"It did not make investment growth impossible."
"We should not interpret it in such a narrow sense that it becomes a straitjacket."
"In conclusion, there is a need for a more innovative approach."
"At the end of this debate, I received four motions for a resolution.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 17 November 2004 at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on the Report by the European Council and the Commission Statement on the European Council in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to report to you on the European Council that was held on 4 and 5 November, and which was a productive meeting."
"Central to that meeting were areas that are of major importance to the public, such as the economy, and the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We also discussed the issue of ‘Communicating Europe’,namely improving communication and interaction between politicians and citizens across Europe."
"Finally, we debated a number of topical external issues, including Iraq."
"Recent developments in my own country give me no choice but to start with the topic of freedom, security and justice."
"Those developments illustrate in an unpleasant but powerful manner that a further step in cooperation in those areas is indispensable."
"I am very indebted to you, Mr President, for the words of support and solidarity which you spoke to the Dutch Government and the entire Dutch community on 15 November."
"Allow me to react to those words in my national capacity."
"The Netherlands is proud of its diversity."
"Since the Second World War, we have received large groups of people from many countries – some because they were persecuted, others because they could build a better future with us and were welcome reinforcements on our labour market."
"The contribution of those people in terms of quality of our society is immense and is appreciated."
"Today, they, and their relatives, belong among us, and that ‘belonging’ requires consideration and effort from both parties."
"Integration is a complex issue that touches on identity, standards and values, as well as getting to know and understand each other."
"At the same time, integration also requires respect and compliance with the fundamental rules of our society: freedom of opinion, freedom of religion, and respect for the democratic rule of law, which must offer individuals the protection to which they are entitled."
"Last time I had the good fortune of addressing this Parliament, I said, referring to the prospect of Turkey’s accession to the Union, that Islam or religion are not the issue."
"I would repeat that today."
"In our European society, there is every chance that people with different beliefs can live alongside, and with, each other."
"What is not acceptable is to use religion as an excuse to attack people, schools, mosques or churches."
"That is what all of us, across Europe, have to fight with conviction and decisiveness."
"Mr President, in your expression of support last Monday, you drew attention to the significance of recent events in the Netherlands for the whole of European society, and in that I agree with you."
"The Netherlands is convinced that we must work together more effectively in fighting terrorism."
"The fierce reactions and counter-reactions in the wake of the killing of Mr Van Gogh once again demonstrated that there is tension in the make-up of our society."
"In Europe too, we have to learn from each other in terms of integrating minorities."
"I will presently examine in more detail the multi-annual programme for Justice and Home Affairs, the Hague Programme, that provides for a deepening in both areas."
"Last week, a ministerial conference was held, at which the subject of integration was discussed at length."
"Of course we immediately applied the existing operational instruments over the past week."
"In addition, the Justice and Home Affairs ministers have asked to discuss the events in the Netherlands and to deliberate on European aspects of these with their colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council next Friday."
"Let me now return to my role of President-in-Office of the European Council and to the actual topic of this debate."
"The European Council laid down the Hague Programme on 5 November."
"The programme outlines our cooperation in the area of freedom, security and justice for the next five years."
"Moreover, the Hague Programme is the first comprehensive package of measures to have been the subject of negotiation involving 25 Member States."
"That illustrates that in an enlarged Union, we can also reach agreement about important, complex issues, and that bodes well for the future."
"In a Europe with no internal borders, we have to join forces in order to tackle problems such as organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking."
"In addition, we must work closely together in the fields of asylum and immigration."
"After all, asylum seekers and immigrants are entitled to know where they stand in Europe."
"The Hague Programme builds on that of Tampere, which, in 1999, was the first programme to formulate cooperation in this area."
"It is based on Member State contributions, the Commission evaluation of Tampere and the European Parliament’s recommendation of 14 October of this year, particularly in respect of decision-making methods."
"The Hague Programme gives important new impulses."
"Loopholes in national systems are being closed, as a result of which phenomena such as cross-border crime will be given far fewer opportunities."
"Closer attention will be paid to the proper implementation of the measures taken, and the effectiveness thereof will be scrutinised on a regular basis."
"What does the Hague Programme specifically mean?"
"The Union will make it easier for police, justice and intelligence services of the Member States to exchange information on the basis of the principle of availability of information."
"With regard to terrorism, it has been agreed that Member States will go further than maintaining their own security; they will also extend their vista to the entire territory of the EU."
"Institutions such as Europol and Eurojust will be given a central role in fighting crime."
"We will continue to work hard on a European legal area, in which it is no longer possible to escape one’s sentence by moving to another EU Member State."
"Alongside this, we will work towards a common asylum system by 2010, in which the same procedures will be followed in all countries."
"We want a single system that is humane, but also unambiguous, so that ‘asylum hopping’ will become a thing of the past."
"Illegal immigration will also be tackled more effectively."
"This involves a common repatriation policy and better border control."
"We are now working on the basic principles for integration which will, if possible, be laid down during the Dutch Presidency."
"A start was made on this during an informal ministerial conference in Groningen."
"Another point I should like to mention in particular, is the introduction of Qualified Majority Voting and of codecision in the fields of asylum and immigration, something upon which you insisted in your recommendation of 14 November."
"We will comply with your request by making the Union more decisive and democratic in this respect."
"This will be effective on 1 April 2005."
"Although there were compelling requests among a few Member States to make various allowances, eventually, these remained restricted to the exception of legal immigration."
"All in all, it is an ambitious and realistic programme, in respect of which the European Commission will be presenting an action plan next year."
"The separate legislative proposals contained therein will be submitted to you under the consultation and codecision procedure."
"I am particularly pleased that agreement has now been reached among the Member States about the objectives and the way in which we want to achieve these."
"A safer Europe for free citizens whose constitutional rights are protected effectively. That is what this is all about."
"I would now like to turn to the other important topic of the latest European Council, namely the European economy, in other words the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy."
"The year 2004 is marked by a slight recovery in the European economy."
"That recovery, however, is not a matter of course."
"In order to safeguard our European social model, we will need to make further adjustments."
"The main feat of the Kok report is that it clearly demonstrates the relevance, if not, necessity, of the Lisbon strategy."
"The key objective of the strategy is still very much alive."
"There is no alternative."
"The world around us is changing because in addition to the US, there are economies, including China and India, which not only compete in terms of labour costs, but also increasingly so in terms of quality and innovation."
"Europe itself is changing too, though: the population is ageing, with all the consequences that this entails for labour participation and tenability of pension schemes and health care."
"Despite this, the road ahead is clear: only by facing the challenge of the future can we retain the achievements of today."
"Knowledge, innovation and competitiveness must be the pillars underlying the adaptability of the European economy."
"Europe must develop its strengths further."
"Founded on a broad-based and highly-qualified population, flexible labour markets, activating social systems and innovative ecology, Europe will be able to meet the global challenge."
"The Kok report thus clearly demonstrates that the Lisbon strategy must be pursued with force."
"Progress has been made on a number of scores: in the fields of labour participation, the internal market and the dissemination of ICT and the Internet in schools, universities, governments and households."
"We should not fool ourselves, though."
"At the same time, Mr Kok has indicated that the efforts, particularly by the Member States themselves, have to be stepped up."
"If not, we will assuredly not achieve the objectives."
"It is this very process, where structural change is being carried out while retaining the public support base, which was the topic of a very lively discussion between myself and my colleagues during the past European Council."
"There was an exchange of practical experience, and future prospects were outlined."
"It was a sound discussion, particularly because the Kok report refers to the Member States themselves."
"What struck me during that informative discussion was the unanimity about the need for reforms and about the need for good communication about this with the public and civil society."
"In addition, the Heads of Government were unanimous in their willingness to take upon themselves political responsibility for the Lisbon strategy at European level, but also at home, in their own countries."
"It was gratifying in that respect that the future President of the new European Commission, Mr Barroso, also confirmed that he considers the Lisbon strategy to be at the centre of his policy and he personally will take responsibility for this in the Commission."
"I have discussed the roles which the European Council, the Commission and the Member States must play."
"However, the Kok report also addressed the European Parliament directly, which should have greater involvement in this strategy."
"For example, it contains a suggestion for you to set up a permanent parliamentary committee that focuses on the Lisbon strategy and growth and employment."
"I am, naturally, interested to find out how you will act upon this recommendation."
"Mr President, I should now like to turn to another topic, one which you yourself have discussed with us, namely that of ‘Communicating Europe’."
"The awareness that we need to communicate more effectively with the public about what Europe is and what it is doing requires constant attention."
"I see it as positive that future presidencies have indicated that they will be continuing the discussions on this subject."
"The ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is an important occasion to further improve communication with the public."
"The citizens of Europe share essential values and it is up to the politicians, you and I, to convey the European project."
"Creating a truly open debate requires teamwork between the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"I therefore welcome the intention of the future President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to entrust a Vice-President with the portfolio of communication."
"We are looking forward to the announced communication strategy which will be tabled even before the European Council of June."
"I have now come to the areas of external policy that have been the subject of discussion."
"First of all, Iraq."
"The European Council managed to reach agreement about a package of support measures for Iraq in the short term."
"We presented this package to the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mr Allawi, who we had invited especially for the occasion, during a lunch meeting on 5 November."
"Moreover, we then offered Iraq scope for cooperation and dialogue for the long term."
"Mr Allawi thanked us for the support for the Iraqi reconstruction process."
"In this process, the elections play an important role."
"I therefore set great store by Prime Minister Allawi’s communication that, despite persistent security problems, these elections will be taking place in January at the latest."
"Our meeting with Mr Allawi and the aid package we presented to him demonstrate that the European Union is willing and able to play a greater role in granting concrete support to the political and economic reconstruction process in Iraq."
"Moreover, a similar signal of unanimity has been given within the Union with regard to Iraq."
"A second item of external policy on which the European Council expressed a view is Iran."
"Let there be no mistake: we want complete and permanent suspension of all enrichment and improvement activities by Iran on a voluntary basis."
"Only then can the European Union offer Iran a prospect of discussions about long-term cooperation which will benefit both the European Union and Iran."
"Although the agreement that was reached with Teheran at the weekend is a step in the right direction, we should satisfy ourselves first that the suspension by the International Atomic Energy Agency can be determined promptly."
"If that attempt fails too, then we seem to have no choice but to resort to the UN Security Council."
"This brings me to the Middle East, where there seems to be another window of opportunity for the peace process."
"It is to be hoped that the Israeli decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip will offer a new opportunity for carrying out the roadmap."
"The European Council has tried to cash in on this."
"At the proposal of Javier Solana, we have now drawn up a short-term action programme to support the Palestinians in the areas of security, reforms, elections and economic development."
"Needless to say, we need cooperation from both the Palestinians and the Israelis for this programme to be successful."
"Although, at the moment, there is mourning for the death of President Arafat, I hope that the Palestinian Authority will, when a new president is elected in January, make a new start promptly and decisively."
"The situation in Sudan remains extremely difficult."
"The European Council has urged the Government of Sudan and all other parties to meet the international requirements."
"In this respect, we have an obvious stick, namely the possibility of instituting sanctions, if need be."
"If that is what it takes, that is what we will do."
"Three weeks ago, the European Parliament held a debate with the Council about Ukraine."
"I hope that the message which the European Council sent is being properly understood by the Ukrainian authorities."
"The second round of the presidential elections is taking place this Sunday."
"This round will need to be more democratic than the first one."
"If not, we will need to consider the implications we want to attach to this."
"As is evident from the conclusions, the European Council has not discussed the Union’s enlargement."
"We will do this in December."
"We will then know the outcome of the debate which Parliament will devote to this."
"The decisions we are facing regarding the four candidate countries can change the Union drastically."
"A clear, positive and future-oriented view of Parliament is crucial in order to face the decision-making and implementation of the decisions with confidence."
"I hope that that will be the result on 2 December."
"Let me finally say a few words about Parliament itself and about the Commission."
"First of all, I share your wish to resolve the long-standing issue of the statute of the Members of this Parliament."
"Transparent and unequivocal agreements about the salary and other working conditions of the Members of your House avoid perceptions which undermine confidence in the institutions and the Union as a whole."
"In the next few weeks, the presidency, in the form of the European Affairs Minister, Mr Nicolaï, will be examining the possibilities that exist in order to reach agreement on this issue that has remained unresolved for far too long."
"Mr President, you too will be consulted in this matter in the next few days."
"Strictly speaking, the outcome of the debate which this Parliament held three weeks ago about the proposed Commission was not on the agenda of the European Council."
"Mr President, you were right to pay attention to it in your contribution to the European Council nevertheless."
"I should like to do the same now."
"The Union did not end up in crisis because of this debate; on the contrary, it drew strength from it."
"In the Treaty, Parliament has been assigned an important role in the appointment of the Commission."
"Parliament has every right to reject the proposed Commission."
"Had Parliament done so as a result of a vote, then that would have been an expression of political self-awareness."
"Similarly, it is good that Mr Barroso, the President-designate, has drawn the political lessons he needed to draw from the debate."
"He has been able to adjust his Commission with a view to receiving the broadest possible support in this Parliament."
"In this way, he is laying a strong foundation for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"From the Council’s point of view, the outcome is also positive."
"The Council wants to set to work with Parliament and the Commission."
"We are facing important issues and important choices."
"I have high hopes that tomorrow, the European Parliament will express its confidence in the Commission, and we will be able to roll up our sleeves thereafter."
". Mr President, of the many issues dealt with at the European Council, I would like to focus on two: promoting the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and the process of economic and social modernisation of Europe, also known as the Lisbon Process."
"I would like to congratulate the Dutch Presidency on the exhaustive Hague Programme in relation to the area of freedom, but I would like to add a brief comment."
"We still need to establish emphases, priorities, with regard to promoting this area."
"Governing means making choices and establishing priorities."
"Times have changed since Tampere I. The time has come to choose priorities and identify the most urgent problems affecting the co-existence of the Europeans and, above all, those which are going to affect its future."
"We must have the courage to choose and to accept the risk."
"Courage is what the future of this area of freedom and justice in the European Union is going to require."
"The Council says, for example, that the fight against terrorism must be given impetus, but it still does not have sufficient impetus to identify Islamist terrorism as the main problem threatening the co-existence of the Europeans."
"Madrid, Beslan, the tragedies of the European hostages and last week’s events in the Netherlands confirm this."
"More Union means more ability to choose and select."
"So this area must be promoted on the basis of a few, very few, but solid and identifiable European political projects which deal with the real problems facing us, the first of which is Islamist terrorism."
"The greatest risk to Europe in this field is inaction, paralysis and not knowing what to do."
"The Hague Programme does not mention the necessary protection for the victims of terrorism, and I regret that the conclusions have not mentioned this Parliament’s request concerning the creation of the European Office for Assistance for Victims or the consolidation over the coming years of a political project, a political programme aimed in this direction."
"Mr President, having seen the report on the mid-term review of Lisbon, the most important thing is that we are aware that we are seriously behind schedule."
"The European Parliament must promote this Lisbon Process on the basis of three very simple and fundamental ideas: the first is that this Parliament must encourage governments to show signs of courage and to promote the necessary structural reforms, since more Union requires more Europe and more structural reforms; the second is to accept that employment is undoubtedly the best social policy, since more Union means more emphasis on job creation; and, finally, in order to implement Lisbon, the States need streamlined public finances, since more Union requires more budgetary stability demands and no more relaxation of finances amongst the European States as a whole."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for the work you have done over recent months."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Désir will be speaking on behalf of our group to make some points about the issues raised by the Lisbon process, but I would like to point out that it is to evaluating the outcome of this process that my group in this House, and, I think, the Union as a whole must primarily devote their efforts, for the Kok Report, which you are discussing in the Council, has plain words to say about it."
"We are, quite simply, not fit enough, and it is on this that all our efforts – those of the new Commission, of the Council and of this House – must be concentrated."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will lay great stress on this."
"Rather like Mr Mayor Oreja, though, who has already spoken, I would like to say something about the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It was decided in the Council that 1 April of next year would be the latest possible date for the transition to majority voting and codecision in the areas of immigration and asylum policy and in other areas of justice and internal cooperation."
"As has already been said, we demanded this in a resolution on 14 October."
"The only thing is that it was not this resolution of 14 October, but a lengthy process lasting five years, and so I want to make reference to someone who is not here, namely our former colleague and Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, as it is not least thanks to his tenacity that we are where we are at the end of the Tampere process."
"That is something I want to say loud and clear on behalf of our group."
"What is this about?"
"What I am going to talk about is the way in which the Commission, the Council and Parliament share in the responsibility for the balanced policy we will be putting together."
"The words you used at the beginning of your speech, when you drew attention to your own country’s situation, were, I think, extremely well chosen."
"The European Union and its citizens make demands where security policy is concerned, demands made of the Member States and of the EU, and with these demands we must comply."
"There is no time to be wasted; we cannot leave any room, any room whatever, to the enemies of fundamental citizens’ rights, to the enemies of democracy, to those who give expression to their blind hatred through murder and assassination in order to destroy the order that we defend."
"A strong democracy has the right to be strong and to take vigorous action against its enemies."
"In that, our group is always right alongside you."
"That, though, is but one side of the coin."
"The other is that the state, the Union, the forces of law and order that are there to defend fundamental democratic freedoms, cannot curtail these rights while at the same time claiming to be defending them."
"It is easier to say that in this House than to do it in the real world – that I do know, but even so, we cannot stint in our efforts to keep on correcting the balance between the public’s right to be protected from uncertainty and the guarantee of their fundamental rights."
"When, though, I hear certain of the debates in the Council or in the Commission, when I hear speeches by unsuccessful candidates for the Commission, I sometimes get the impression that this has to be said with more energy."
"Speaking as a German MEP, I cannot imagine that Libya, to take one example, is a country with much experience of the observance of fundamental rights."
"It follows that the quick and appealing solutions offered in the media market are not always the best ones."
"Let me reiterate that if we want to combat illegal immigration – and it has for some time been one of my group’s articles of faith that we do – we must at last create the possibility of legal immigration."
"This House’s debate on the subject, which begins on 1 April next year, will open the door to that, to our being able – and we are willing – as legislators to help bring about a situation in which, if we want to establish security, we cannot simply talk in terms of illegal people, but can establish a framework within which they can become legal."
"That too is an opportunity that we will have from next 1 April onwards."
". Mr President, just a very brief word to Mr Schulz: please bring the statement you have just made to the attention of the German Minister for the Interior."
"That would seem to be urgently needed."
"On 4 and 5 November this year, the European Council laid down its priorities for the further development of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is probable that these developments will do more to shape the EU’s character than any previous joint initiative, for it is on the realisation of this Union governed by the rule of law that a common European community will be founded."
"The character of our society will be determined not only by to what extent the European Union wants our 450 million citizens to be protected against the dangers of terrorism, among other things, or the degree to which it wants judicial cooperation to be organised in future practice, but also by joint action in the areas of asylum, immigration and integration."
"We must not forget that the foundations we will be laying down over the coming five years will determine not only the futures of 450 million people, but also those of their children and grandchildren."
"I would just like to take this opportunity not merely to remind you, but also perhaps to make you again aware, of the responsibility we all took on when we made the decision to be policymakers in this House."
"We shape societies and fashion their futures; it is, alas, only in retrospect that we will learn whether our efforts are crowned with success."
"We will then, however, have to answer our children’s questions, as our parents and grandparents had to answer our own, and I will be able to tell them that I did indeed prevent freedom being sacrificed to security, that I did indeed help to keep this great society open, tolerant and free, a society that would never tolerate intolerance, that I did indeed offer those persecuted in foreign lands the opportunity to seek safety in this Europe of ours, and gave that same opportunity to those who wanted to live and work here."
"And when my children ask me how I achieved that, I hope I will be able to tell them how we, the citizens’ directly elected representatives, would not stand for the interior ministers of a few countries joining together in what they called ‘G5’ and taking essential decisions without reference to Parliament."
"We have seen how important it is to integrate the foreigners living in Europe, in a way which respects them and likewise demands that they respect it."
"I will tell them how we overcame those who sought to burn a free society to the ground, how we, in fighting terrorism, always took account of the need to preserve citizens’ rights and freedoms."
"Such measures as biometric data in identity documents are to be assessed most stringently by reference to their necessity and proportionality."
"I will tell them how we stamped out every form of traffic in human beings, which was slavery in a modern guise, combating it at every level and making it possible for people to enter Europe legally, and how we discharged our obligations to those who seek asylum, without making it easy for ourselves by shifting our responsibility to states beyond our borders and without our laws."
"I will tell them that we did not merely create empty institutions, but such bodies as the European Human Rights Agency, endowed with funding and a mandate."
"The Hague Programme is a beginning; it is certainly not an end."
"Before we make irreversible changes to our society, we must think, discuss and argue, and do it time and time again."
"For it is the protection of human and civil rights, of freedom and security, that underpins this Europe of ours, which we must defend – even, and something particularly, within its own institutions."
". Mr President, I would like to confine my remarks to two aspects of the Council's presentation: Lisbon and the Hague Programme."
"Firstly, on a personal basis I always worry when I hear a politician use the phrase 'there is no alternative', because Mrs Thatcher used that phrase when we were all perfectly well aware that there were plenty of alternatives."
"I worry, therefore, that we only look on the Lisbon Agenda as some sort of Holy Grail that we have to pursue, and genuinely welcome the Netherlands presidency's recognition of the breadth of that Agenda."
"All too often in this House the Lisbon Agenda is limited to the issue of competitiveness, and we omit all the other facets concerning more and better quality jobs, social cohesion and sustainable development, which went on to be developed more fully at Gothenburg."
"If we reduce the Lisbon Agenda to the sphere of competition we are selling ourselves short and will not solve many of the problems facing our societies."
"The relevance of a partial reading of the agenda is thus highly questionable, and it is partly because of that partial reading that we have had such problems in implementing much of the agenda."
"We have totally forgotten the Cardiff Process on integration of the environment into all the processes and policies of the European Union."
"When one looks at social cohesion issues, which are linked to some of the other topics touched on today, we would also seem to have forgotten the dynamic approach needed in the implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination."
"We would do well to reconsider the role of the Equal Programme in future, rather than consigning it to the dustbin."
"The implementation of legislation on anti-discrimination deals with issues surrounding the marginalisation of many in our societies, and also deals with some of the issues people have talked about this morning, in terms of respect for individuals and for what they can offer."
"When looking at the Hague Programme itself, one of the things not to have come through strongly enough is political leadership on issues concerning anti-discrimination."
"A directive on anti-racism and xenophobia is still stuck in Council and we are not giving the political leadership that the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has identified as being necessary to move forward."
"I wonder whether the EU Human Rights Agency will provide that."
"We obviously welcome the moves towards qualified majority voting and codecision, and assume that this will also bring the European Court of Justice into play, although this is something not yet made explicit."
"However, I regret that legal migration has not been included because, as the Council conclusions state, and as we have again heard this morning, illegal migration cannot be separated from legal migration."
"This is not just a home affairs issue."
"It also has real resonance for employment policy."
"People prefer to have a legal status, and we need to look at the bureaucratic complexities which stand in the way of this, and which Parliament clearly identified in the previous legislature."
"Rather than simply dwelling on the negatives – of which we have heard many this morning – we are looking for greater political leadership in terms of the sort of Europe we want to create."
". Mr President, I too am stunned by Mr Balkenende’s proclamation that there is no alternative to the Lisbon strategy, which implies that there is no alternative to the way in which it is implemented."
"My group takes a critical view of the Lisbon strategy to date, and we do so not because it aims for more and better, not because it demands social cohesion and sustainability; we take a critical view of it because this Lisbon strategy makes the world’s problems even worse."
"The message that now goes out from the Council meeting in Brussels and also from the conferences held under the presidency of the Netherlands is that the creation of more meaningful jobs that actually pay a living wage, the strengthening of social cohesion, and the rational use of the natural world, now take second place to the competitiveness of conglomerates and to the EU’s ability to compete as a global player."
"Rather than hearing of how political priorities have been responsibly adjusted for the sake of social, environmental and global sustainability and seeing proposals submitted for consideration by the Spring 2005 Council, we now hear that, firstly, Europe is to be made more competitive, labour markets to be made more dynamic, and that the social security systems are to be adapted to meet the challenges presented by the need for competitiveness and by population change."
"Let me tell you, in plain terms, that this will not enable us to solve the world’s and society’s problems."
"Mr Kok’s report was presented during the session, and it, too, has no alternatives to offer."
"It does not help to develop a social and employment policy for our own time."
"I therefore take the same view of it as the European Anti-Poverty Network and am more than willing to discuss these proposals for something like a social policy agenda for the years from 2006 to 2010."
"With the summit in mind and looking forward to the proposals that the Commission will be putting forward next January, I call upon the Commission, the European Council and the Member States to adjust their political priorities within the Lisbon strategy along the lines to which I referred earlier."
". Mr President, allow me to congratulate Prime Minister Balkenende on the dynamic manner in which he has dealt with the shocking assassination of Theo van Gogh and the subsequent riots."
"In these difficult circumstances, leadership is indispensable."
"Without solidarity and unanimity in tackling those who threaten the rule of law, we would not achieve our goals."
"What is positive is that this need also appears to exist in society."
"I wish you God’s blessing in your work, particularly in bringing, and keeping, together the different ethnic groups."
"During the last meeting of the European Heads of Government, Mr Kok presented his report on the Lisbon strategy, a report to which we in this House were very much looking forward."
"The conclusions and recommendations are not new."
"What new is that an advisor consulted by the Council has put the ball back in the Member States’ court."
"Those Member States must make a start on structural reforms, which they have apparently not yet done."
"No choices were made from the excess of objectives."
"However, it remains to be seen whether reducing the number of objectives would be sufficient."
"I doubt it."
"More should be done, but that implies that there is a will."
"Which Member State will be the first to stick its neck out?"
"Since 2001, we in this House have had many a debate on the question why this strategy has not had the desired effect."
"This Parliament has restricted powers in the process of Lisbon, and in the open coordination method, it is in any event difficult to make the Union’s role concrete."
"Environmental policy and social policy are under pressure."
"Despite this, we will need to adopt a sustainability strategy if we want to maintain our level of prosperity and welfare for future generations in the longer term."
"The parties are largely agreed on the analysis."
"Which Member State, though, will take the actual first step?"
"My question, therefore, to Mr Balkenende is what we can expect from the Dutch Presidency in the next six weeks in terms of follow-up."
"After all, the Netherlands has always been a great champion of reforms in order to make the Lisbon process a success."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has been confronted with extremely serious challenges in the field of internal policy."
"These include security and economic growth."
"Essentially, the latter is conspicuous by its absence across Europe as a whole, in spite of the Lisbon strategy’s unusually ambitious provisions."
"This state of affairs is due firstly to the fact that we still have an extremely naïve belief in the power and force of regulation as an agent of change, in particular as far as the regulation of economic life is concerned."
"This naïve belief has led to Europe becoming completely defenceless on the global market, and to our citizens and entrepreneurs being overwhelmed with reams of legislation, legislation that is very frequently detrimental."
"The second reason for poor economic growth is that our societies are ageing extremely rapidly indeed."
"Ageing at the rate currently experienced in Europe would ruin even an economy that was at the height of its development, to say nothing of the European economy."
"In view of the impending Council, it is worth touching on the harmonisation of legislation."
"There are some areas in which harmonisation could have positive effects, yet there are also areas in which harmonisation is nothing short of impossible."
"Such areas include family law, for the simple reason that radically different opinions on the family are held within Europe."
"The Buttiglione affair is an excellent example of this."
"It would be a serious error to think that it might be possible to use European law to ensure that homosexual relationships are legally recognised in countries that have not agreed to such an experiment."
"Still with the Council meeting in mind, the Council is to be commended for taking an interest in Ukraine."
"It must be added that this interest has come too late, and indeed we must hope it has not come altogether too late."
"If this crisis had not arisen, the exceptionally passive policies adopted with regard to the East would presumably have remained in place."
"The crisis we are witnessing within the pro-Western and pro-European forces in Ukraine would presumably not have come about had our neighbourhood policy been more courageous in political terms, more generous in economic terms, and above all, more open to the accession of countries such as Ukraine to the EU."
"Mr President, Mr Balkenende, ladies and gentlemen, in Communist times the authorities said the ideology was good and the people were bad because they did not wish to put it into practice."
"Upon reading this motion for a resolution, I found a statement to the effect that the Lisbon strategy is good, but that the bad Member States, who do not wish to put it into practice, are the ‘chief obstacle to faster progress’."
"This sounds worryingly familiar, and I must concur with the comments made by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Zimmer on the issue."
"With regard to paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution, the reference made by its authors to investment in people, research and innovation might lead one to fear that this will, unfortunately, be implemented by favouring the old Member States over Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as is the case in the provisions of the draft EU budget for 2007-2013."
"Fine words can, and alas sometimes are, put into practice in a way that is far from fine."
"After those words of criticism, I should like to commend the Council for having finally recognised the importance of the demographic factor, and the authors of the resolution for having asked the Council that ‘action to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population of Europe be considered a policy priority’."
"Mr President, at present, the Netherlands is in despair, because we are more than ever compelled to reconsider the questions, not only of the balance between freedom and tolerance, but also of how to set boundaries in order to guarantee safety."
"I wholly concur with Mr Blokland’s congratulations addressed to Prime Minister Balkenende on the way in which he is taking charge, and giving direction in channelling the feeling of our population towards a more tolerant society in which people respect one another."
"Respect for those values is also something which we in this House will need to defend at all times."
"Tolerance, however, goes hand in hand with setting and demarcating boundaries."
"I welcome the way in which the Hague agenda is building on Tampere."
"My congratulations on the way in which agreement has been reached."
"I do share the views of Mr Oreja, who stated a moment ago that what matters now is to take concrete action, and to give priorities to concrete action points in the short term."
"The President of the Council may be able to elaborate on this."
"I would in any case like to mention one of my personal priorities, one I have mentioned before."
"It is unacceptable to me that, following the attacks in New York and Madrid, we hear the Justice and Home Affairs Council say that we will now automatically start exchanging information about possible attacks without delay."
"It is inconceivable that this has not happened to date, that the urgency has sunk to that level again, while we noticed once again that there may be international links in the case of the political assassination and subsequent events in the Netherlands."
"I would also like to make a brief comment about the Lisbon strategy."
"It is the only way, according to Mr Balkenende, and he is right."
"It is the only way, and we will need to continue on this path."
"What matters is the way in which we negotiate it."
"Not with the ‘super-Commissioner’, as proposed in the past by Chancellor Schröder of Germany, but by learning from each other."
"Does he think it possible that innovation councils chaired by himself would make for a more effective way of exchanging good examples?"
"Does he also think it possible that national parliaments might be called to account much more emphatically with regard to delivering on their share in responsibility for this?"
"Finally, communication in Europe is also an important item."
"Indeed, Mr Balkenende, it is essential that the statute should come into being, for as long as we do not have one, we will have a negative image at every election."
"I thank you."
"I am interested to see how far you will take this point."
"The Council has received the Kok report on revision of the Lisbon strategy."
"The progress made with this strategy lags a long way behind the objectives set in 2000, something which is down to the fact that far too many priorities were set."
"Advances have been made on all aspects relating to the Community method, or liberalisation, whereas no progress has been made with any aspects which required the commitment of the Member States and which depended on the open method of coordination, such as investment in research, innovation, training, the quality of social dialogue and human capital."
"Greater national ownership has also not been achieved, and much remains to be done in this field."
"We are delighted that the need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy, the economic, social and environmental dimensions, has been reiterated, and it is our belief that the European economy needs a higher level of growth and competitiveness in order to preserve the European environmental and social model."
"Yet we must continue to discuss the links between these dimensions and the conditions required for sustainable growth in Europe."
"There appears to be a growing temptation to take the easy way out, namely to have recourse to liberalisation in an ever increasing number of areas, including services, the labour market and welfare systems."
"If we carry on down this path, there will soon be little left over of the European model, of its uniqueness, its strengths and its advantages, which lie not in a downward adjustment towards the social level of some of our new international competitors – and here I have China and India in mind – but in competition to achieve excellence, quality, top-of-the-range products and innovation."
"This is why we are sure that investments in human capital, in a high standard of lifelong employee training, in quality of public services, in European environmental standards and in good social dialogue are all productive factors, competitive factors and prerequisites for ensuring that reforms are adopted as and when they are needed."
"This is why these things do not merely entail costs, expenses and inflexibility, but instead provide support to ensure the success of a new growth and development strategy for the European Union."
"We want growth and jobs to be a priority, and I believe that this also involves better links between all European policy instruments, or in other words a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure that it has tighter links with the broad outlines of economic policy, the new financial perspective and, indeed, the revised Lisbon objectives."
"Mr President, I should like to start with the Lisbon process."
"I think that Mr Kok’s report is very welcome and that it identifies where things are wrong."
"Indeed, the remedy is already well enough known; what is lacking is action."
"Slowly but surely, I am growing a little despondent when I see that we have said this so many times and we still have not found a way of galvanising the Member States into action."
"I should like to hear from the EU Presidency what it intends to do about this."
"Secondly, from time to time, I hear that a false dichotomy is being created between competitiveness and solidarity."
"Those elements complement each other; they certainly do not contradict each other."
"We all agreed in Lisbon that liberalisation is necessary, and liberalisation does not undermine our European socio-economic model but in fact strengthens it."
"If we examine the facts – and here I am particularly addressing the Left of this House – liberalisation and free markets have brought more products and more services within the reach of more people."
"That is the reality, and I think that we should not have recourse to the old instruments of protectionism or state support, which is an inefficient way of spending taxpayers’ money, and monopolies."
"Secondly, I should like to comment on the Hague Programme."
"That is extremely welcome and cannot, of course, be seen in isolation from the events in the Netherlands."
"It is not a Dutch issue, but a European one."
"What is more, freedom and a peaceful society are the of the European Union, and so we should fight extremely hard to maintain them."
"That means, on the one hand, that we will work very hard on security, and in that light, I should like to underline that I cannot comprehend the way in which the Member States, over the past few years, have cited national sovereignty as a justification for their unwillingness to step up cooperation."
"Human lives, our democracy and social cohesion are at stake."
"Finally, alongside this unilateral approach towards repression and terrorism, we should also consider the other side of these phenomena."
"A unilateral approach on its own is ineffective; we might as well be fighting a running battle."
"It follows that we must also fight hatred and racism."
"And I should like to conclude by drawing your attention to the tone of this debate which contributes greatly to the solution of this problem."
"Mr President, this debate represents a really crucial stage in the development of the European Union."
"We have put such emphasis on the Lisbon Strategy and, like Mrs Lambert, I welcome the Council's recognition that there has to be a real balance between the economic, social and environmental dimensions."
"But the cultural dimension also needs to be addressed more effectively, especially if we are to celebrate our diversity, as the Minister said earlier."
"I also welcome the emphasis that was put on communication in this meeting."
"Within the European Free Alliance parties we have different positions on the Constitution, but we all agree with the urgency of improving the relationship and communication between the EU and the peoples of Europe."
"There is no more effective way of doing that than by using people's own languages and this is why I take the opportunity presented by the Bureau Decision of 13 October to allow the use of other languages in this Chamber."
"I conclude by saying this in Welsh, even though there is no official interpretation."
"Mr President, I wish to comment on the Council’s decisions on Iraq."
"I believe that the package adopted is expensive and pointless, and Fallujah is its failure foretold."
"Fallujah is not only a further human tragedy – with 1 500 more deaths, thousands more people wounded, tens of thousands more people made homeless – it is also the graveyard of the January elections."
"Because of Fallujah, neither the Sunnis nor the Shiites, who oppose the occupation, will go to the polls."
"Nothing is guaranteed in the January elections. There is no guarantee that voters will be able to register, nor that opposition parties will take part, nor that the candidates or the voters will be able to move freely and safely."
"Iraq’s electoral platform must not be US or British tanks."
"This is not the way to rebuild hope or restore confidence."
"Elections must be Europe’s priority in Palestine, however. Arafat’s death points up the urgent need for a new leader who is the indisputable embodiment of the will of its people."
"Europe must therefore be on hand to monitor the entire electoral process, so that no doubt is cast upon its transparency."
"That is not all, however."
"Europe must tell Israel that what is required is a return to political dialogue and a respite from hostilities – no suicide bombs, on the one side, no collective punishment or selective executions, on the other."
"Signals must be sent out that voter registration can take place in Jerusalem and that restrictions in the Occupied Territories will be lifted, so that mobility can be guaranteed during the campaign and, most importantly, that Marwan Barghouti can be freed."
"Contrary to what George W. Bush thinks, the road to Baghdad passes through Jerusalem. This should constitute the European difference."
"Mr President, Parliament will be pleased to know that the UK Independence Party were the lead players in the recent 'No' to the North-East Regional Assembly campaign in Britain."
"Seventy-three per cent of people in that region said they did not want any more Euro-bureaucracy."
"I wonder what percentage would vote to get rid of the already-existing regional assemblies, with their awful appointees and their corrupt practices?"
"We will shortly have the opportunity to say 'No' to the EU Constitution and I mean any European Constitution, because the gap between Euro-rhetoric and reality has never been wider."
"The pretence here is that there will be no further integration until there has been a referendum."
"The reality is that the referendum is being pushed ever more backwards, while integration is being speeded up, with, for example, a common visa policy by 2006 and a European evidence warrant by 2005."
"I could produce 25 other examples, the most important being the common asylum system, which will be introduced in 2005, with coordination in place by the end of that year."
"All these things will be in place before a referendum takes place."
"As Members of this Parliament we are therefore entitled to ask what the effect will be of a nation saying 'No' in a referendum."
"Does it mean we will remain members of the Fourth Reich?"
"Does it mean we will just be associate members, or will we be out?"
"In particular, does it mean that any prior legislation will perish?"
"We need assurance on this point."
"In fact, Europe cannot tell us what 'No' means."
"Britain will vote 'No' in the referendum by a massive majority, and will show you what 'No' means."
"Mr President, the coordination of the economies of Europe is vital for the development of the EU."
"The European Union must complete the internal market, improve the European regulatory environment and make the whole European Union less complicated."
"All new EU legislation must be subject to strict tests to measure its impact on enterprise and competitiveness."
"The European Union leaders have set the goal that the EU must become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"A strong and well-functioning internal market is necessary if the European Union is to become the most competitive economy and meet the objective of the social cohesion strategy."
"The internal market has helped to create 2.5 million jobs in Europe over the last 10 years alone."
"Europe needs better regulation."
"That does not mean more regulation; as a matter of fact it means less."
"A new corporate governance and action plan must be supported, ensuring that European business practice operates at the highest international standards."
"A new Community patenting system must be put in place within the EU and the Community customs codes must be changed to strengthen and modernise EU customs policy."
"I support the action for growth initiative, which will ensure that the research and development investment target of 3% of GDP within the European Union must be met by the year 2010."
"These are not easy challenges, but they must be prioritised."
"The European Union economy is lagging behind that of our counterparts."
"We must improve our methodology."
"These are key challenges now facing Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"We must ensure that we work together."
"Like Mrs Evans I should like to say in Gaelic, a language which I hope will become a working language of this Parliament:"
"There is strength in partnership."
"Let us get on with it and work together."
"Mr President, this House talks about Lisbon, but even after the changes proposed in the Commission you are still faced with electing to offices of great power politicians whose primary qualification is that they failed at home."
"Few, if any, bring aptitude and experience to their portfolios, except of course the Competition Commissioner, who has been mixed up in corruption and the manipulation of major commercial contracts for her personal benefit and that of her friends for almost 20 years."
"I have seen proof of this, and also proof that Mrs Kroes grossly, persistently and deliberately misled her hearing."
"More than a thousand pages of evidence are now undergoing forensic investigation and we, a handful of MEPs, will finish the job that the nominating governments should have done in the first place."
"Assuming that it survives tomorrow, the Council and Mr Barroso should know that his team of Commissioners is unlikely to survive intact for long."
"Mr President, while I should like to devote the time that is allotted to me to the Lisbon agenda, I would also like to make one comment beforehand."
"I have great admiration for the fine results that have been achieved with what is known as the Hague agenda."
"Unfortunately, these have remained virtually unnoticed in the Netherlands amidst the commotion and unrest in recent weeks."
"I would nevertheless like to say that it is thanks to Mr Donner, and to the many sound agreements in the area of home affairs, security and justice, that we are one step closer again to freedom for our citizens."
"I would now like to turn to Lisbon."
"I could not agree more – and the Dutch Presidency has certainly played a part in this – that the three pillars of the strategy, namely economic reforms, social cohesion and sustainability, remain the guiding principle for the Lisbon process in terms of balance and coherence."
"Social cohesion and sustainability, however, can be achieved only if we can again make Europe a true player in the world market."
"Economic improvement, incidentally, is not a goal in itself, but a necessary condition if we want to retain for generations to come the European social model that was built on solidarity between the working population and those entitled to benefits, between the young and the old."
"The presidency was also successful in another area."
"As Mr Kok’s report mentioned, the key goal of the presidency was to cut back on the pressure resulting from rules and regulations."
"Allow me to remind you of Mr Doorn’s report of April 2004; we are reportedly the very first parliament that is also prepared to subject its own amendment proposals to an impact test."
"That is an example that deserves to be followed by other parliaments."
"Finally, Lisbon."
"The goal is clear."
"I truly hope that in March 2005, we will be able once again to make the Lisbon strategy into a strategy for opportunity, but then with simpler procedures and tighter agreements, especially for the Member States, as Mr van Nistelrooij rightly points out, where that process is now too strategic, with a consequent lack of positive outcomes."
"Parliament is happy to lend a hand in this respect."
"It is hard to accept that of all the founding ideals and principles that hold together the European Union, there remain shortcomings even today regarding the implementation of human rights, and that fundamental human rights are being infringed."
"It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions to try from time to time to place human rights in their social context when examining and defining future goals."
"This task is not easy."
"Our whole life is defined by a network of human rights ranging from the inviolability of human dignity to equal opportunities for individuals, communities and generations."
"Therefore, after the two examples of Tampere and Lisbon, we should be thankful to the Dutch presidency for the Hague Programme and their examination of these questions in their social context."
"I would like to highlight the section in the document and in the related European Parliament resolution that tries to bring together the decisions on the protection and exercise of human rights into a complex system and suggests that these decisions should be interconnected and build on one another instead of just following each other."
"And if this is to happen, then we must think back from The Hague to Lisbon when it comes to human rights."
"Why?"
"Because today the strategic programme for competitiveness and social cohesion also sends us messages concerning human rights."
"People living in a united Europe will only become European citizens if they do not become marginalised, if their security is not breached by the threat of war or terrorism, by the evils of unemployment, the danger of homelessness or the grim prospects of unassisted old age, and if they are not threatened by discrimination and labelling."
"While welcoming the Hague Programme, therefore, I believe that the forthcoming Luxembourg presidency will also have a lot of work to do in this area, and I would like to wish them good luck with it."
"Mr President, the Hague Council took place 48 hours after the election of a new American President – I repeat, a new American President."
"This is the best way for us to regard that presidency if we want to preserve the transatlantic relationship."
"It is very important for Europe now, under the leadership of the Council and the Commission always acting together, to manage at least two very important concerns."
"If we do that, we will preserve the transatlantic relationship, or at least we will not be blamed for damaging it."
"First, we must look to the future and stop thinking about how we got to this point."
"We must stop thinking about the past and all that has happened in the last four years and must now look to the future in a creative and pragmatic way in order to do our best to solve the different problems on the international agenda."
"Second, the Commission, and in particular the Council, must do everything to prevent the United States – willingly or not – from dividing Europe to its own advantage between pro-American and anti-American, pro-Bush and anti-Bush."
"Our strength will be based only on our unity."
"If we are united it will strengthen us and then we can solve many problems on the international agenda based on strong cooperation with the new, democratically elected leader of a democratic country, whether we like him or not."
"Mr President, I should like to return to the issue of the Hague Programme and to ask the Council a number of questions relating to this Programme, which undoubtedly represents a major innovation in its introduction of a move to qualified majority voting for Title IV."
"Some Members have expressed reservations with regard to legal immigration, but I should like to ask more detailed questions on the external dimension of asylum and immigration policies, something that is acquiring an ever greater significance."
"It is apparent that these policies are becoming increasingly dependent on the EU’s ability to conclude Partnership and Cooperation Agreements on returns, readmissions, the strengthening of capacities, border control and police and judicial cooperation, or in other words on a set of agreements with third countries which are not subject to codecision."
"We are doubly concerned because we have absolutely no trust in people such as Mr Schily or Mr Pisanu, who have put forward various proposals such as those on the establishment of camps, immigration gateways or checkpoints outside the EU."
"Despite the fact that these high-flown ideas have mainly been rejected, that they do not form part of the Hague Programme and that they have aroused the fierce opposition of hundreds of NGOs and of a great many members both of national parliaments and of this House, we remain concerned, because the Hague Programme includes a reference to a feasibility study on the processing of asylum applications outside the EU and because we are also aware that EUR 1 million has been released to enable the High Commissioner for Refugees to strengthen its capacities for dealing with asylum seekers in North African countries."
"The question we are therefore asking ourselves is whether this does not represent both a violation of this House’s democratic powers and a relinquishing of the duties incumbent upon this House and the EU in the field of asylum and immigration, with these duties being handed over to third countries whose capacities are a great deal less developed than our own."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate that President-in-Office Balkenende should have begun with the dramatic events in the Netherlands, which have disturbed that tolerant country."
"The Netherlands of integration, even if that word was completely absent from today’s discourse by the President-in-Office."
"I did not appreciate at all, however, the fact that today no mention was made of the grave events in Iraq."
"Yesterday, devastating images of American marines killing injured Iraqis were bounced into our homes, as if all this barbarity and horror were routine business not even worthy of mention."
"I believe that Europe cannot stand idly by at these events, nor can it confine itself to voting appropriations for reconstruction – as the Council did recently – nor limit itself to meeting Mr Allawi or placing confidence in the forthcoming elections as the event that will resolve the conflict."
"As regards the Hague Programme, I do not consider there to be continuity with Tampere; on the contrary, I note a qualitative leap based on a misapprehension."
"The fact is, the issues of organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and immigration cannot all be thrown into one big pot, as if they all constituted a single problem."
"What this is in reality is a scheme for limiting Europe’s sphere of action to that of security, leaving out justice and freedom."
"I believe that Islamic terrorism should be combated by dialogue between cultures and religions."
"That is not what was done by your deputy, Mr Balkenende, who the day after the murder of Mr Van Gogh declared war on Islam, or what your country does in financing faith schools."
"I believe instead that we must build a school where Catholics, Muslims, Protestants and atheists can all live together."
"In conclusion, trafficking in human beings and immigration are not the same thing."
"We need to punish the criminals, but above all we must satisfy people’s needs: the needs of those who flee from wars and from hunger, who come onto our territory, seeking shelter in our sympathetic and integrated Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that it has not escaped your attention that the Council of the European Union has already approved one of the most controversial ideas contained in the draft Constitutional Treaty, namely qualified majority voting on immigration and asylum."
"What does this mean in practice?"
"What it means is that by resorting to a qualified majority, the European Union will be able to force a country to accept asylum seekers, even if that country does not wish to do so."
"By resorting to a qualified majority, the European Union may decide, for example, that my country, Poland, is ethnically too homogenous, and that it should be sent some Asian or African asylum seekers, as there are already too many of these in other Member States."
"We would be unable to object to this."
"Countries accept immigrants because of their proximity to various neighbouring countries, their former colonial policies or their labour market requirements, and each country must make its own decisions on whether it is prepared to grant asylum and, if so, to whom."
"It is also for each country to decide on who should be allowed to immigrate."
"Depriving Member States of the right of veto on such matters is a violation of sovereignty on an extremely important issue."
"The Constitutional Treaty will be rejected in the referendums, and yet the Council of the European Union is already forcing us to implement one of its most controversial ideas."
"There is no consensus on this."
"Mr President. I acknowledge the first coordination act of the enlarged 25-member group under the Dutch presidency."
"You have carried it out without any significant problems."
"Permit me to mention something negative, however."
"In spite of the fact that all the key documents concerning equality have in their preamble equality between men and women, I regard it as a disgrace to the 21st century and all strategies that the Council you lead was composed (particularly in November) of 25 men and two invited guests, messieurs Chirac and Schröder."
"We have all criticised Mr Buttiglioni for his views, but this is the reality in this key European Union body."
"You have not succeeded in adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, thereby perpetuating the virtual division of Europe and discrimination within this body as well."
"We are working under different conditions here."
"In spite of this, we state in the Lisbon Strategy, as a very important chapter, that we should be equal in both rights and responsibilities."
"It is a good thing that you have considered immigration into Europe from the security point of view."
"It would, however, be a good thing, and I would welcome it, if you also looked at emigration in relation to the future."
"The most valuable people are leaving Europe and are directly assisting our competitors in other countries."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider it very important that the European Council confirmed the validity of the Lisbon process and the need to promote it, and it is a fortunate coincidence that this objective is at the forefront of the political platform of the new European Commission, which I believe will obtain a vote of confidence from the European Parliament tomorrow and will take up office."
"We are therefore waiting for the European Commission's proposals in the run up to the interim review of the Lisbon strategy with great interest."
"This interim review, which will be carried out at the spring European Council, will be a good opportunity for honest evaluation and intervention on our part, in cooperation with the Member States, the national governments and social agencies at all levels, because this strategy lies at the heart of all present and future economic and social challenges."
"It includes all the policies which directly concern citizens: unemployment, poverty, job insecurity, the standard of education, health and social protection."
"An important tool in our work on this interim review and the new impetus which we need to give will be the report by Mr Wim Kok."
"We certainly need to find ways to bring this strategy close to the citizens and organised social agencies because, without their participation, we cannot succeed in such complex policies."
"This issue relates directly to the broader presentation of the Commission to citizens and it is important and encouraging that the European Council in November turned its attention to the subject of an essential information and communication strategy policy for the policy of the European Union."
"We must not forget the results of the European elections, which prove that citizens are alienated from the development of the European venture."
"This is not the first time we have noted this, but the time has come for us to take it on board."
"The time has come for us to understand that the communication and information policies which we applied every year in the past did not perform well."
"We need to take action because we face major social and strategic choices, enlargement choices which require both information for and the participation of citizens."
"Mr President, we harbour great concern at the worsening situation in Iraq."
"The attack on Fallujah and the way in which the civil population has become embroiled are feeding the spiral of hatred, besides being the umpteenth violation of international law and the Geneva Convention."
"I should like us here to turn our thoughts to poor Margaret Hassan, who was brutally murdered yesterday."
"Both terrorism and war in response to terrorism make the prospect of pacification and democratisation of the country still more remote."
"We therefore call for the Union to play its part in the Sharm el Sheikh conference on 23 November and to make its weight felt, in the light of the unity we have attained, in insisting on full acceptance by all sides of UN Resolution 1546, based on respect for international law and human rights."
"In these circumstances, it is valid to harbour strong doubts about the real possibility of holding the elections in January 2005."
"The result of the US elections and the replacement of Colin Powell may give even greater encouragement to the extremists, both in Iraq and in the Middle East."
"As far as the Middle East is concerned, I am less optimistic, as it does not seem that Mr Sharon has conceded more to Abu Mazen during the period of his Prime Ministership than he conceded to Yasser Arafat."
"On this question, besides renewing our solidarity with the Palestinian people in the loss of their historic leader, we demand that the Union commit itself by political and financial means to ensuring fair local and presidential elections in Palestine, and resuming progress on the currently stalled Road Map."
"That would make it possible to replace, I repeat replace, the unilateral actions of the Sharon government with honest and proper negotiations, which, by resolving the more controversial issues, such as the settlements and the right of return, would lead to the birth of the Palestinian state and the coexistence of the two peoples."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these Decisions of the European Council come at a time of delicate transition for the institutional life of the Union, following the historic signing of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome and in the excitement of a new interinstitutional dialectic, emanating from Parliament’s refusal to vote in the new Commission."
"The text of the Council’s conclusions finds a Parliament that is more aware of the new era of parliamentary democracy that has opened in Europe and deserves some reflection."
"First and foremost, the goals set at Lisbon must be pursued with more momentum and rigour and with the courage to choose, as Mr Kok maintains."
"The challenge of global competition forces us not to draw back from our ambition and requires a strong sense of political responsibility and determination from governments in order to carry through the structural reforms and to sustain the change in the field of social security."
"A reasonable balance is necessary, however, so that the Lisbon Strategy can remain a fundamental political element of the Commission, as President Prodi has ensured."
"This is also important in order to achieve progress on the fundamental European Pact for Youth, the lodestones of which are education, training, jobs and research."
"Such issues require wise, generous and coordinated policies, but above all the certainty of investment."
"Finally, the strategy for Communicating Europe and making people familiar with the Constitutional Treaty also requires similar investment, but, until now, it does not seem to me that an adequate amount of expenditure has been allocated to this head."
"Mr President, I consider the Hague Programme for fighting terrorism to be insufficient and hamstrung, with measures that in the end should have been effective."
"Besides, this phenomenon is never called by its name: Islamic terrorism, for that is what is terrifying Europe."
"Various measures are called for, the need to counter money laundering as a means of financing terrorism is indicated, but there is no clear statement of the need to police banks and financial institutions, because European banks are also used to launder funds originating from the apparently legitimate activities of Islamic fundamentalism – butcher’s shops, and ostensibly religious networks and support centres."
"The Netherlands is learning!"
"I call on the European Union to adopt severe measures against terrorism, measures foreshadowed only after the barbarous murder of the film director, Mr Van Gogh."
"Europe must follow the good example of the Netherlands, which has had the courage to recommend the most important measure: the closure of all mosques and Islamic centres that have been infiltrated by extremist and terrorist propaganda."
"These are places where such propaganda is broadcast and funds are collected to fuel the barbarous murder of innocent people, as in Madrid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this European Parliament, there is a lot of talk of human rights across the world, but last week in my own country, my own party, the , was outlawed by politically appointed judges, a spectacle applauded by the parties who consider themselves to be democratic."
"Following a legal comedy that lasted four years, the Court of Cassation outlawed our party – which is the largest opposition party – after a political centre for the fight against racism, at the request of the Prime Minister, and with public money, instituted legal proceedings against it on account of what was purely the offence of giving an opinion."
"Politically appointed judges have, no doubt in exchange for some future appointment, dutifully complied with this request from the Belgian state to outlaw Flanders’ largest party."
"I therefore hope that within Europe, if this institution wants to retain its credibility, there will be loud protest against the totalitarian methods that are being used in a Member State of the Union to outlaw political parties."
"Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome the ambitions of the Council of Europe and particularly those of the Netherlands regarding the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, but at the same time, with a certain amount of disquiet, I have to agree with the Council of Europe that this strategy has not brought the expected results during the last four years."
"I also agree with the findings of the Kok report on the feeble level of implementation on the part of the Member States."
"I am not talking about the problems of distant galaxies, but about a key project of the Union which would bring about the most dynamic and competitive economy by the year 2010, together with a balanced respect for the social and environmental aspects of development."
"We have fewer than six years ahead of us."
"I am convinced that we will not achieve success by repeating what are clearly acceptable goals, but by supplementing, from the technical point of view, a strategy which is essentially a good one."
"What is genuinely lacking is political will and a European spirit."
"It would appear that at times of crisis everyone thinks of themselves first, but the history of the Union tells us that it has made progress in the past when it has acted in a spirit of solidarity and with a collective will."
"Thus, the lofty ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be achieved through discordant, disunited and partial activity with different rules of the game for different Member States."
"What is important is the simultaneous action of the key players on all the important fronts and at all levels."
"I would like the European Parliament, as the most legitimate representative of the interests of the citizens of the Union, to accompany the responsible implementation of the Lisbon Strategy with a contribution to a more powerful political will on the part of the Member States and to the leadership of excellence on the part of the participating collective institutions."
"Of course I understand that the global economic context is unfavourable, nevertheless I would not like to perceive it as an excuse, but rather as a stimulus for an enlarged European Union to find the answers to those questions which others cannot answer."
"On behalf of my group, I too should like to comment on the spring meeting and the Kok II report."
"Economic and social policy and sustainability policy are the hallmarks of the Lisbon strategy, and it is right that the report and the Council’s conclusions do not interfere with the coherence of them."
"Even if growth and employment take centre stage, objectives in the social and environmental areas should in no way be made subordinate."
"It is unfortunate that the mandate of the High-Level Group to develop a consistent strategy in a bid to achieve the Lisbon objectives does not focus more on common macro-economic policy at European level."
"After all, in that respect, there are no longer any economies in the plural, and there have not been any for a long time, but only one European economy."
"We were pleased to find out about the intention to involve the European Parliament more effectively in the preparations of the spring meeting and the Lisbon strategy."
"Mr Balkenende was interested to learn about our plans to set up a standing committee."
"I can tell him that indeed, we are carefully considering how we would give this shape, but I, in turn, would like to ask him to take into account the timeframe for the various reports, including the planning we need to draw up here in this House."
"In our experience, there is often too little space to make adequate use of this."
"We also intend to involve national parliaments more obviously in the strategy."
"I think that this is also a very important aspect."
"Along with the Luxembourg Presidency, we would like to examine how we, together with the national parliaments, can prepare the spring meeting."
"It is evident that making the Lisbon strategy more effective depends, first and foremost, on the willingness of the Member States to work truly at EU level."
"In my view, we are heading for a change from mutual competition among the Member States towards a focus on stronger, common, European strategy."
"That is where our strength lies compared to other economic blocs, including the US and China which also work as unities."
"In that light, we should therefore not only consider the balance of revenue and expenditure of Member States in the framework of the Stability Pact, but, as Commissioner Almunia said in the on Monday, we should also consider the quality of public finances."
"The Council, the Commission, national parliaments and the European Parliament should all join in the discussion about national budget policy."
"The economic policy could then be more than the sum of the 25 constituent parts."
"That is the challenge we are facing."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for having turned its attention to Ukraine, the EU’s largest neighbour to the East."
"This is a country of 50 million inhabitants that covers an area greater than France."
"At present presidential elections are taking place in Ukraine."
"The Council is to be commended for highlighting the irregularities that occurred during the first round of voting, but I do not believe it has gone far enough in highlighting what is really happening in Ukraine."
"A civil society is coming into being in that country."
"There is no sign at all of anything of the kind happening in Russia or Belarus at present."
"Tens of thousands of people are demonstrating every day in Ukraine, with the aim of making their country democratic and honest, and of ensuring that links are built between Ukraine and the European Union."
"I do not believe it is enough merely to reprimand the current Ukrainian authorities for their failure to enforce democratic electoral rules."
"It is essential to boost the hopes of the people of Ukraine and open the door to their European ambitions."
"Mr President, it is perhaps a sign that I am speaking on the Lisbon strategy when the member of the Commission with responsibility for development aid is present."
"Although there is no argument about the fact that the goal of making Europe the world’s most competitive region is the right one, we have to look to see who, in Europe, is responsible for what, and I can tell Mr Balkenende that it is when I look at the Council that I find it intolerable that, every month and every year, heads of government and ministers of the economy meet together, agree upon exalted objectives, make Europe responsible for meeting the goals of the Lisbon strategy, then go home and fail to do their homework when they get there."
"Indeed, they go even further and stand in the way of those things that Europe has to contribute."
"Take, for example, the European patent: that would be a step ahead as part of a European initiative."
"Think of the moves towards deregulation, and how the French President and the German Chancellor delayed them for end-users."
"What Europe achieves is frustrated in the Council, and what ought to be done by the nation states does not get done."
"The bottom line is that it is Europe that fails to make a success of the Lisbon strategy."
"I am grateful for the Kok report; what we now urgently need – as the Lisbon strategy is the right one – is an orientation for it."
"The goal, although perhaps too ambitiously defined, is the right one."
"With Member States like ours in Europe, we can now be happy that the gap between us and America is not widening."
"We have to put forward a concept for this in Europe, one that compares the nation states, providing a transparent view of which European government is failing to implement this strategy and which is good at it, in order, by way of this transparency in the political process, to make the public aware that we cannot do this other than together."
"Apart from that, I hope that the presence of the Commissioner with responsibility for development aid is not an indication of the direction in which Europe will be drifting in future."
"Mr President, we are undoubtedly at a crucial moment in the development of the Union."
"Wherever we look, whether it is at the Lisbon Strategy, or the security question and the demand for greater police and judicial cooperation, or even this week's report of the Court of Auditors, we see time and again that Member States that talk about European cooperation do not put it into practice."
"We cannot continue with a system where Member States pick and choose which bits of decisions they are going to implement and when – and these are decisions they themselves have agreed."
"This is undermining political support in the European Union."
"I hope that once we get a full-time President of the Council he or she will regard this as an absolute priority, but in the meantime, in order to keep the Lisbon process on track, the Commission should publish a regular annual scoreboard outlining which Member States have done what and when."
"We can then judge, name and shame the villains."
"My colleagues Mr Désir and Mrs van den Berg have set out many of the key elements that we would like to see emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy."
"I would like to add to that the need for more active labour market policies at national level."
"We seem very happy to pay out money to keep people on the unemployment scrap heap, to pay people to be written off and marginalised, when we should be investing in helping them back into work."
"There is not enough emphasis on this, although it was originally in the Kok report and I hope will continue to be."
"The President-in-Office said that Mr Barroso is to be applauded for drawing the appropriate lessons from last month's debate on the Commission."
"It is a pity that the same cannot be said about the Dutch presidency."
"Mrs Kroes undoubtedly has the experience and expertise that will be of benefit to the Commission, but given the concerns that are being raised it is wrong for her to retain the competition portfolio."
"Whenever she has to adjudicate in a controversial matter, rightly or wrongly her integrity is going to be called into question."
"The presidency should act in the interests of the European Union, not from narrow national concerns."
"I fear that the Dutch presidency has failed in this respect."
"Mr President, the words of the Prime Minister about the situation in the Netherlands were loud and clear, and Members of this House have also said a great deal since."
"I nevertheless regret that the Council has not made use of the European Council of 4 and 5 November to forcefully distance itself from the appalling events in the Netherlands."
"It was, in my view, the ideal platform for us, including as a Union, to take a hard line against radical Muslims with a fundamentalist interpretation of the Koran."
"Unfortunately, European cooperation in the fight against terrorism is currently typified by the well-known sacred cows of the Member States."
"The declaration that was adopted following the attacks in Madrid, the appointment of Gijs de Vries or the Hague Programme, all of them are of little consequence if Member States do not translate fine words into action."
"This is where decisiveness, on the part of Europe and of the Member States, is an absolute must."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office, and the Netherlands presidency as a whole, on the very clear orientation given on the whole issue of competitiveness and delivery of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I wish to thank you in particular, Mr President-in-Office, for the lead your government has given on the whole question of tackling the regulatory burden and improving the climate for business in Europe."
"I was delighted to see in the presidency conclusions the substantial commitment that you, together with other governments – I know the British Government is associated with this – have made to improving the business climate."
"I was disappointed you did not mention it in your speech, because this is one of the really important parts of your presidency."
"It is quite clear – and this is highlighted in the Kok report – that cutting back on regulatory costs and encouraging new business start-ups is crucial to delivery of the Lisbon Agenda."
"We know about the very effective work you do in Holland, where I believe you set your ministers targets on cutting the cost of the regulatory burden every year."
"That is an example of best practice that should be copied not only in all the Member States but also within the European Commission."
"I say to Mr Nielson, the Commission's representative today, that we expect the Commission to deliver on this."
"It is one of the commitments set out in the Council's conclusions."
"Our side of the House strongly supports this and wants to encourage it, and I would say to all Members that this House has a role to play here."
"You asked us, President-in-Office, how we were going to respond to the challenge of the Kok report in becoming more engaged in the Lisbon Agenda."
"We need an effective committee in this House to look at the Lisbon Agenda."
"Not one that substitutes for committees like mine, but one that tackles issues that cut across Parliament's work, such as improving the regulatory agenda and acknowledging that we can sometimes be responsible for making life more difficult for European businesses."
"These are the real issues which I hope Parliament will tackle in future, and I congratulate you and your government on the foundations you have laid for helping us to move this vital agenda forward."
"Mr President, in adopting the Hague Programme on 4 and 5 November, the Council has set new priorities for Europe with regard to strengthening the area of security, freedom and justice."
"We are pleased to see that the Council has heeded this House’s demands, in particular those relating to the move to codecision and qualified majority voting in such areas as asylum, immigration and the fight against terrorism, not to mention, of course, civil justice."
"Yet we regret to see that this Programme appears to be yet another example of the Council doing little other than stating its good intentions."
"It is all well and good for it to congratulate itself on progress made during the past five years, particularly with regard to the establishment of a common asylum and immigration policy, the harmonisation of border controls and improvements to judicial cooperation, yet it would have only been fair to include references to the obstacles which certain Member States have placed in the way of progress in the field of justice and to note that only a minimum level of harmonisation in the field of asylum has been achieved."
"Although the Council expresses its regret that not all objectives were met, it has made no provision for specific measures to ensure that this does not happen again in future years."
"Finally, we are particularly concerned at the parallel drawn between the fight against terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration."
"This implies that illegal immigrants are assumed to be potential criminals or terrorists, an assumption which is entirely unacceptable."
"These are people who have been forced to leave their country of origin as a result of unbearable living conditions or persecution."
"Whilst it is true that we need a global approach to policies relating to asylum, immigration and external border controls, I am sure you will agree that such an approach should not be adopted at the cost of migrants’ basic rights."
"Mr President, today provides a welcome opportunity to thank Mr Nielson and his team for the splendid work they have carried out during his time in office as Commissioner."
"It is also very good to hear from the President-in-Office of his successful meeting with President Allawi."
"I was in Iraq last week. I have a suggestion to make as to how our aid might be most effectively targeted."
"As we all know, security is the major issue."
"European Union support, carefully targeted, could make all the difference in the training and the equipment of the Iraqi police service."
"Security is what the Iraqi people need and the lack of a strategic plan may already have cost many lives and will cost many more if we do not address this effectively."
"We need a strategic plan worked out with the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and, as a matter of urgency, proper forensic capabilities."
"Westernised tactics should be adopted for the use of those capabilities and we should provide advanced surveillance equipment and the right training."
"Then there is a real need to train senior Iraqi police officers to plan and manage strategically, and that must be combined with an ethos of service and fairness within the Iraqi police service."
"In other words, we must move on from a reliance on countering insurgency by military tactics alone to a mixed plan."
"The police should no longer be treated as a second-rate military force but, with European Union funding, commitment and training, given a real chance of becoming a proper police service."
"Finally, the Iraqi people want the election to be held in January."
"A properly trained and effective police service is integral to its success."
"With our funding and our training competence, we in the European Union can make all the difference."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us call to mind our strengths, put our money where our mouth is, do away with the blockages within ourselves, and stop making ourselves ill with worry."
"Let us fashion a single European policy on Europe rather than several from each nation state!"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe it to be a matter of urgent necessity that you should make the Lisbon objectives concrete and workable."
"Everyone must know who is to do what and by when; you should see to it that, after every spring summit, every Head of Government makes an official statement in his own country and that the parliaments debate the action plans specific to their own countries and vote on them, that you reinforce the Commission’s prerogatives of monitoring, coordinating and taking initiatives where the Lisbon process is concerned."
"Let us introduce at European level, in the national governments, and in the national parliaments, a Lisbon Steering Committee with an interdisciplinary approach!"
"We are not a carbon copy of America."
"We Europeans do not play off competitiveness against social cohesion, both of which express the European model of the sustainable social market economy."
"There is a second point I would like to make about the Constitution. Everyone has signed it."
"Is that it then?"
"What about a joint publicity campaign by the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Committee of the Regions?"
"What about a Week of the Constitution, in which all the Member States would ratify it?"
"Why were you so opposed to a Europe-wide referendum?"
"There is more to be done, and more is possible, provided that we have the political will and more determination."
"As you have mentioned the Members’ Statute, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me tell you that you need only to accept Parliament’s resolution, and then we will have a Members’ Statute, and new rules on expenses."
"There are some – but in fact only a few – Member States that are engaging in tactical games; put a stop to them!"
"Mr President, Yasser Arafat’s death means the start of a new era for Palestine, and one which is filled with uncertainty."
"Under the Palestinian Constitution, presidential elections must be held within a period of 60 days."
"If elections were to be held today, however, they could be hampered by a number of obstacles."
"The first of these obstacles relates to the freedom of movement of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, something which is essential both for the electoral campaign and for election preparations, the holding of elections and the counting of votes, but which is far from guaranteed."
"East Jerusalem poses the most problems, as the Israeli authorities there refuse to allow Palestinians to be registered on the electoral roll."
"I am therefore calling on the Council to take joint action with the United States in bringing pressure to bear on Israel so that it withdraws the troops currently deployed in the occupied territories."
"The second obstacle faced is that of challenges to the eligibility of a candidate."
"It is up to the Palestinian authorities, and to them alone, to decide who is eligible on the basis of their own criteria."
"The third obstacle relates to practical organisational issues and ensuring that the vote is fair, and this is an area in which the EU’s practical experience and support will be essential."
"The fourth obstacle is that of ensuring that the elections are safe, something which should be guaranteed for candidates, voters and observers alike."
"Palestinian police officers do not carry arms, and struggle to ensure the safety of civilians."
"Political security is dependent on the extent to which extremist groups are kept under control."
"The recent attempts by Fatah to include Hamas in a government of national unity, as long as it renounces the armed struggle, are something which should be monitored very closely by the EU."
"I should like to know what plans have been made at this stage with the Palestinians to ensure that the elections are safe."
"I am sorry to have to say it, Mr President, but to date Europe’s voice within the Quartet has been almost inaudible, and we should take this opportunity to make ourselves heard."
"We must now provide Palestine with staunch support to ensure that elections at any level are held freely, and we will of course always do the same for Israel to ensure that the indiscriminate attacks which plunge entire families into mourning are brought to an end."
"It is my firm belief that, more than ever before, the future of one nation is inextricably bound up with the future of other nations."
"– I would like to speak about the present state of the Lisbon Process."
"I remember the time when Soviet dictator Khrushchev declared that the Soviet Union would catch up with the USA in seven years."
"I also remember that he failed."
"Although the European Union has every opportunity of accomplishing its aims, the Lisbon report is nevertheless a cause for concern."
"As Wim Kok has said, the dreams of catching up with the USA have been put on the back burner."
"Instead, the European Union is dealing with the question of how to halt economic decline."
"I would join with my colleague Mr Radwan in giving credit to the Dutch presidency, and its bold and vigorous leadership."
"This is promising."
"However, in order to regain lost time, we need to concentrate more on one aspect – the motivation of the Process."
"Indeed, clear and strong motivation, together with an emphasis on results, has been the driving force behind the success of our competitors, USA and Japan."
"Second, the European Union should aim for a systemic approach to research and development activities and innovation."
"Wim Kok’s report stresses the need to give top priority to research and development, but special emphasis ought to be placed on the applied side of research in particular."
"So what is required is not less research, but more development work."
"Third, it is especially important to base all our planned activities on the needs of innovation as a whole, and to motivate business leaders accordingly."
"Fourth, the present funding schemes for innovation in research are unfortunately too administration-centred, and do not promote the practical application of results."
"One of the biggest problems is that funding is often directed into closed and ineffective systems."
"Therefore it is our task today not just to rely on attractive plans, but to show the political will to actually implement those plans."
"This is our responsibility to our voters."
"Thank you."
"Mr Balkenende, I should like to offer my condolences on recent events in the Netherlands."
"Up until now, we had associated the name of Van Gogh with art and bold colours."
"The painting symbolises sun, warmth and freedom."
"Is it not an irony of history that a person bearing the same name should die because he exercised his freedom of speech and of thought, and because he sought the truth?"
"Against this background, it is particularly significant that it was the Dutch Presidency that raised the complex issue of security for the EU, its Member States and its citizens."
"The public expects, and rightly so, that the EU, an institution that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, will adopt effective solutions with regard to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"These expectations are to be met by the Hague Programme."
"I should like to stress that this programme sets out objectives that were already included in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Indeed, it meets the majority of those expectations."
"The announcement that this programme is to include an anti-drugs strategy is also to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Council Presidency has chosen to make information on Europe its priority."
"It is clear that awareness of Europe must be heightened amongst its citizens, especially given the turnouts in the last elections."
"The EU must be brought closer to its citizens, but will this be achieved by broadcasting public debates on European issues before Council meetings, an idea contained in the conclusions?"
"Will that be enough to bring the EU closer to its citizens?"
"I am also concerned at the announcement that we will have to wait until June 2005 for a full information strategy."
"Why should this take so long?"
"We need such a strategy now, especially in view of the fact that the campaigns to inform the public about the European Constitution began immediately after the Constitution was signed."
"Finally I should like to turn to one last issue which relates to our future."
"The leaders of four Member States were quite right when they highlighted the importance of demographic factors for the EU’s future economic and social development, and when they called for a European Pact for Youth to be drawn up."
"This is a worthwhile initiative."
"Young people have a different view of Europe."
"They are well educated, full of energy and free of the fears and prejudices of the older generation."
"This is a good sign for Europe, for the EU and for all of us."
"The Pact for Youth should therefore be drawn up as quickly as possible, with the participation of young people."
"I should like to pay tribute to Mr Kok, the former Dutch Prime Minister."
"With the support of a team, he drafted the report on the Lisbon strategy."
"This coincided with the Dutch Presidency."
"We all agree with the findings of the report."
"The European Union is lagging a long way behind, and the responsibility for this lies mainly with the Member States and national governments."
"I agree that we need to draw up national strategies for the Lisbon process and implement them consistently, but these strategies must be coherent, and not developed separately."
"We must create added value on the basis of regional cooperation between neighbouring EU Member States, and I can provide three examples of ways in which this could happen."
"Poland has a particularly large number of extremely well-educated young people, whereas the neighbouring countries of Germany and Sweden have well-developed high-tech industries."
"There are opportunities for development if we were to join forces."
"The Baltic countries have particular opportunities for cooperation in the field of secure energy supply, an issue that is important for Europe as a whole."
"The Czech Republic, Germany and Poland can make the greatest contribution to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"To this end, European clean coal and carbon dioxide capture technologies must be developed."
"Regional cooperation also involves cooperation with the EU’s new neighbours, and the position taken by the Council on the issue of neighbourly relations with Ukraine is therefore key."
"We should assure Ukraine that the doors are open to its European ambitions, and we should promptly put in place an action plan for Ukraine with a view to promoting the development of civil society."
"Indeed there is also a need for measures to improve civil society within the EU."
"If this does not happen, we will not achieve our ambitious goals and crucially, millions of citizens will fail to understand the Lisbon process."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, a Greek friend who recently visited Holland told me that what had impressed him most was that the police on the streets of Amsterdam gave the impression that they were there to protect citizens and their diversity, not to watch and suspect them."
"The tragic events with Van Gogh and the extremists from the other side illustrate, unfortunately, that terrorism is working and what it is seeking: to ultimately suppress the obvious."
"Racial violence deserves zero tolerance, but the victory of the terrorists will be that we in Europe, unfortunately like others elsewhere, also consider that, in order to combat violence, war means peace and restricting personal freedoms means protecting them."
"Consequently, congratulations are in order for the Dutch presidency for the fact that, on the very days when these horrendous incidents occurred, it organised an informal conference for the 11 common authorities on the subject of integration."
"You have got the right emphasis."
"Integration. Not policing."
"I have just three comments to make on the foregoing:"
"First, the Hague five-year programme which we are debating today makes provision for special funds to return immigrants and guard borders, but it makes no provision for a special integration fund, even though integration is one of the basic actions."
"We are asking for a commitment that the financing for integration be given the same priority, so that we get beyond words."
"Secondly, when we lay down policies for integration, we cannot ignore the fact that we have millions of European citizens in countries the world over who are themselves immigrants."
"Their experience cannot be ignored."
"From this point of view, we must be prepared to grant immigrants who settle in the countries of the European Union a similar level of treatment to that which we demand for European immigrants in third countries."
"Otherwise we are not being consistent."
"Thirdly, attention to personal rights when dealing with terrorism."
"Biometric data in passports and other similar measures may be important; on the other hand, however, they may add little to security in relation to what they take away in civil liberties."
"Only if they are absolutely necessary and effective in addressing very clearly predefined objectives can they be the subject of discussion in my opinion."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have here the conclusions of the November Council on the Union's foreign policy. I have to say that, while I consider it a good thing that the Council turned its attention to four European foreign policy issues, events lead us to prioritise at least two at the moment."
"The first is the situation in Iraq."
"War is being waged again and the war is condemnable just as, of course, the terrorist action and kidnaps are condemnable."
"Armed conflicts and operations do not resolve problems; on the contrary, they increase the obligation of the European Union to submit, at long last, a full and integrated programme on the subject of addressing the crisis in Iraq."
"The first step in this process must be elections."
"Elections in Iraq must be held and as many forces as possible must participate, so that the elections really are not an end in themselves but a means which will allow Iraq to shortly become a progressive democracy."
"The second parallel and related issue is the situation in the Middle East."
"The post-Arafat era is, of course, a new page in the history of this area."
"Over and above all, the European Union has an obligation here to intervene so that the political testament of Yasser Arafat is respected, because it is certain that the crisis in the Middle East will be addressed through the political testament left by Yasser Arafat."
"Mr President, on 4 and 5 November, as we all know, on considering how to communicate Europe to the citizen, the European Council made a very lucid analysis of the situation facing us."
"Europe still lacks its own personality; it does not have a face of its own; knowledge of Europe reaches the citizens with difficulty and it therefore has a long way to go in terms of selling the idea of European political union."
"The Council was naturally extremely concerned, given the very imminent challenges we are facing, including the ratification of the European Constitution by each of the Member States."
"And it made a very specific recommendation, taking a practical approach that I would like to praise, which is to promote television debates in each of the countries in order to stimulate interest in this process of ratifying the Constitution amongst the citizens."
"I would like to draw the attention of the honourable Members to a problem facing us: the first country to have called a referendum on the ratification of the European Constitution is Spain."
"Spain is governed by the Socialist Party, which is the Party of the President of this House, Mr Borrell, as we all know, since he does nothing to hide it. Although, given his role as arbitrator, he should take care to keep his ideological positions rather more hidden."
"We are facing a dilemma: this Parliament, which should occupy a vigilant position, can either promote party positions or promote institutional positions."
"From that point of view, Mr President, I would like to call on everybody to bear this in mind, and not to abandon that vigilant position, and we should make it very clear that this European institution must also put aside sectarian or party political behaviour and think of the common project we have before us."
"Mr President, I congratulate the Dutch Presidency on developing the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is vital to ensure the general public’s security and fundamental rights, mutual trust and the primacy of law throughout the EU."
"I congratulate the Council particularly on its decision to implement in full Article 67 of the Treaty, so that qualified majority voting and a process of codecision can be applied for a range of topics under Heading IV."
"This is a step forward not only in terms of efficiency, but also in terms of democratic legitimacy, as it reinforces Parliament’s key role in adopting standards on topics as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and all policies involving the general public’s fundamental rights."
"The five-year post-Tampere period has come to an end, with significant achievements in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Not all of the objectives have been met, but progress has been made."
"The balance is clearly in the black, something to which Commissioner Vitorino’s work contributed greatly."
"An impressive body of legislation has been built up, but we regret that, as regards its transposition into national legislation, major shortcomings have come to light, in terms both of meeting deadlines and of the quality of transposition."
"I welcome the Hague Programme for the next five years."
"It is now up to the Commission to table practical initiatives and to set out a timetable for adopting and implementing those initiatives."
"I welcome the Hague Programme, but I should point out that, here too, if we are to construct Europe we will need the necessary financial resources."
"There is no point in stating our priorities if we do not allocate the necessary resources."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of creating the European asylum system is underway."
"It is only by means of a common European asylum and immigration policy that we will be able to address problems such as illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"In view of issues such as civil and corporate justice, cooperation in the area of criminal justice and, lastly, EU security, which remains one of the major priorities – the importance of condemning any kind of violence, but especially terrorism, cannot be over-emphasised – it is essential that Europol and Eurojust work in close cooperation."
"Thank you very much."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate the committee on its report and I will comment on only one aspect, the Lisbon strategy."
"The Wim Kok report is undoubtedly an important step on the bumpy road toward achieving the goals set forth in Lisbon."
"It is apparent today that it will be almost impossible to adhere to the original schedule without deeper political commitment and serious effort."
"The submitted report makes a valuable contribution to accelerating the Lisbon process and every, and I would like to stress , recommendation in the document is worthy of consideration."
"The holistic approach suggesting a direct correlation between the question of job creation, the need to increase employment and developments in the macroeconomic environment is especially valuable."
"It also points out the important role of slowdowns and acceleration in economic growth trends."
"Nevertheless, a few of the statements connected with this in the Report should be treated with caution."
"I am sure the few sentences adopting a critical tone with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact did not escape your attention either."
"As far as sustaining economic growth is concerned, the report paints a rather negative image of such an important instrument of public finances and budgetary discipline."
"We must not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact plays an important part in ensuring economic stability and consequently in ensuring that money retains its value."
"It must be emphasised that the assumption that reforming the Stability Pact and slackening economic discipline would in themselves create jobs through additional expenditure is something of an oversimplification of economic logic."
"It is evident that this assumption would only be true if governments used their budgetary expenditures only for development purposes."
"This, however, is far from the truth."
"Therefore, I do not believe that fundamental reform of the Stability and Growth Pact would be in the economic interests of the Union; quite the contrary: it would reduce competitiveness even in the short-term."
"Nevertheless, the criticism of the Stability Pact expressed in the Wim Kok report undoubtedly addresses real concern, namely the key role of economic growth in creating and increasing employment."
"I, for my part, would suggest a different approach to solve this problem: I am thinking primarily of creating an enterprise-friendly economic environment."
". Mr President, I should first and foremost like to thank your Members of Parliament warmly for their contribution."
"You have dealt with issues that affect the European citizen directly at great length."
"I have also noticed that there has been support from many quarters for the keystones discussed by the Council, namely more cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, working on safety in Europe, working on more balanced economic growth, the Lisbon strategy, and promoting public involvement."
"Let me start with the Hague Programme."
"Mr Schulz was right to draw attention to Commissioner Vitorino’s important role, because the excellent result has been achieved partly thanks to his input and influence."
"I think that now is an appropriate time to thank Mr Vitorino for this."
"Mr Mayor Oreja was right to talk about the importance of priorities being set in the programme for freedom and security."
"For example, these priorities are in place for the first item, being asylum and immigration."
"We are working on better decision-making."
"Qualified Majority Voting is being introduced and an asylum procedure will enter into effect in 2010."
"With regard to terrorism, we need to take decisive action to fight it and that is exactly why, as Mrs in ‘t Veld already stated, cooperation between police, justice and intelligence services needs to be stepped up."
"Terrorism will also be discussed in more detail at the meeting of the European Council in December."
"For the rest, I would draw your attention to the action plan to be compiled by the European Commission."
"Mr Schulz was right to indicate that certain ingredients should always be present, namely security for the citizen, together with the promotion of safety on the one hand and respect for basic rights on the other."
"I think that the Hague Programme succeeded in striking the right balance in this respect."
"Mrs Kósáné Kovács has drawn our attention to the need to do justice to fundamental rights in Europe, in which context she defended the Hague Programme."
"Mr Alvaro spoke about a good combination of scope for investigations and doing justice to basic rights."
"Subsequently, the subject of what is meant by QMV, Qualified Majority Voting, has also been raised."
"This is already in place in many areas, but not in respect of illegal immigration."
"That will change when the new Constitutional Treaty enters into effect, for then QMV will apply across the board."
"Mr Giertych mentioned the fact that Member States are given compulsory immigration quotas."
"It so happens that asylum immigration, in terms of procedures, is a joint responsibility."
"That is why the Hague Programme is also so important, but that does not mean that in respect of QMV, immigration quotas can be imposed on Member States."
"Mr Eurlings spoke wise words when he talked about the meaning of values and tolerance in society."
"Particularly in Europe, people should approach each other with respect, but that presupposes two things."
"On the one hand, due account must be taken of respect for the different values which typify Europe; on the other hand, boundaries must be set when people resort to hatred, intimidation and humiliation."
"This is exactly how we want to build on freedom and a peaceful society."
"That also means that we must watch the place hatred and racism take in the debate."
"Respectful cooperation and co-existence are precisely what is required."
"In that respect, you also have to choose your words carefully."
"I have noticed, also in my contacts with representatives of the Islam community, that extremism and terrorism are unequivocally repudiated in the Islam community too."
"That is why it is dangerous to immediately associate Islam, for example, with terrorism."
"It is precisely the terrorists who take advantage of religion in order to commit immoral deeds, which must be emphatically repudiated."
"That is why it is also so important for different groups, whether they be Christian, Humanist, non-religious or Islamic, to join forces in order to put a stop to violence and extremism."
"In this Parliament, the importance of aid to victims was mentioned, and rightly so; this was a question raised by Mr Mayor Oreja."
"There is a European action plan against terrorism that was laid down in the European Council of March, which contains a section on solidarity with victims of terrorism."
"The Dutch Presidency plans to elaborate on that aspect in the December European Council."
"Mrs Lambert mooted the idea of a human rights centre."
"The Commission published a communication about changing the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna to a European human rights centre."
"That is currently being discussed in the Council and decisions in this respect will be taken under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Finally, with regard to the Hague Programme, Mrs Flautre has spoken, and expressed her concerns, about reception in the region."
"It is useful to note that when we mention reception in the region, this will always be done in consultation with the UNHCR."
"I should now like to turn to the Lisbon strategy."
"I have noticed that there is much support for the strategy within this Parliament too, which is geared to strengthening Europe’s economy, and the need for reforms has been underlined."
"In that context, I would also refer to Mr Kok’s report, the report of the Employment Task Force, that was discussed some time ago."
"In addition to these favourable comments, though, some voices of criticism have also been heard."
"Mrs Lambert and Mrs Zimmer spring to mind."
"They claim from time to time that there is no alternative to the Lisbon strategy."
"Is that true?"
"I should like to note once again that the Lisbon strategy combines economic dynamism, social cohesion and doing justice to sustainable development."
"It is the combination of those three components which has also come to the fore in the conclusions of the European Council."
"I therefore beg to differ with those who claim that Mr Kok, along with his high-level group, has paid insufficient attention to the social and environmental dimensions."
"The environment has been sufficiently covered, particularly since it is based on the idea of a win-win situation."
"In the European Council, Mr Kok maintains that we need growth precisely in order to retain the European social model."
"Finally, I would refer to Paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the European Council in which it is stated, and rightly so, that a balanced strategy with economic, social and environmental dimensions is needed in order to strengthen competitiveness."
"Mr Blokland claimed that Mr Kok put the ball back in the court of the Member States, and went on to enquire after the Dutch Presidency’s agenda for the near future."
"I should like to draw your attention to three things in this respect."
"First of all, we have analysed the remarks, suggestions and opinions of the Heads of Government during the informal working lunch."
"Secondly, we will be consulting the Luxembourg Presidency about future conclusions and needless to say, we will be in contact with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, provided he and his team receive your consent."
"I have also noticed that you demand concrete action. What is needed is not only declarations, but also that we simply examine what the matter in hand is and deal with it."
"In that framework, the suggestion made by Mr Eurlings is interesting."
"He states that different Member States boast innovation platforms and that those should, where possible, join forces."
"Mrs van den Burg was right to draw the attention to cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Mrs in 't Veld also re-emphasised the need for action."
"We will convey this message to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"It is useful to remind ourselves that liberalisation, the very element we need in order to strengthen market forces, does not have to be at odds with the European social model."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was right to point out that the actions must be concrete and that national responsibilities must, in fact, be taken."
"It is also for that reason that I, as President of the European Council, have opted for a different working formula, namely for a very in-depth dialogue during the working lunch to exchange experiences with regard to the reform policy in the different European Member States."
"I think that that was a sound formula."
"I also think that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was right to talk about the need for better regulations and an easing in the rules with a view to strengthening the entrepreneurial climate in Europe and economic growth."
"I agree with you that there, too, the European Parliament can play an important role."
"Finally, Mrs Staniszewska mentioned the Lisbon objectives in relation to the financial perspectives."
"These objectives will obviously be given a prominent place in the new financial perspectives and needless to say, we have yet to agree on the level of those amounts."
"I will now turn to the third item, that of communication."
"People from different political persuasions have pointed at the need for good communication."
"Mr Eurlings was right to point out that a prompt solution must be found to the problem of the statute, and that of your provision of income, because continuous discussion of this subject does not create a good impression."
"Mr Nicolaï, my European Affairs Minister will also commit to this matter for that reason."
"Certain Members have raised the subject of language, and we had the pleasure of hearing Welsh and Irish."
"I have understood your message."
"The Constitution was also mentioned."
"In this context, the idea of a referendum week was mooted."
"It so happens that referendums deal with different situations in the Member States."
"Legislation is not the same everywhere."
"There are a number of practical and legal objections to having the referendums in the space of one week."
"Mr Nicolaï discussed this with your Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, and this produced three elements."
"First of all, it is recognised that this primarily concerns national matters."
"Secondly, the European character can be emphasised by, for example, joint and simultaneous action, which also accommodates what you stated here before."
"We will also be working on subtle coordination by, for example, ensuring that consultation between the European Affairs Ministers is good in terms of planning campaigns, and suchlike."
"Mr Knapman raised the possible issues that could arise when the referendums and decisions made at Member State level have a negative outcome."
"You know what the deal is."
"It has been agreed in the European Council that, if ratification has been completed by 4/5 of the number of Member States and if a few Member States were to have issues at that point, the situation will be discussed."
"A treaty cannot be signed and ratified if not all countries sign. However, I urge you to do what we can in order to have a positive outcome and in order to receive support for the Constitutional Treaty."
"In all honesty, I have high hopes and high expectations."
"Let there be no mistake, though, it does require excellent communication."
"Finally, also in the framework of communication, Professor Grabowska mentioned a youth pact."
"She supported us in this and I am pleased with what she had to say."
"Finally, different remarks have been made about external relations, foreign policy and the concern that exists about various developments in the world."
"This brings me to the remarks made by Mr Catania, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mrs Napoletano concerning the situation in Iraq."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to the events in Iraq."
"Obviously, international legal rules will need to be adhered to."
"We assume that the US authorities will be mounting an in-depth investigation straight away further to the images we saw yesterday and will take measures in order to prevent similar events in future."
"I would also like to express my abhorrence in respect of the persistent attacks and hostage takings in Iraq, the recent low being the killing of aid worker Margaret Hassan."
"We sympathise with the relatives of the victims of the atrocious violence in Iraq."
"At the same time, we must all contribute to stability in Iraq."
"The conference to be held in Sharm El Sheikh next Tuesday offers the neighbouring countries and major international actors a good opportunity to send a joint message to Iraq and the Iraqi people."
"I hope and trust that this will be a clear message in support of the Iraqi interim government, together with democracy, freedom, security and justice in Iraq."
"Mrs De Keyser expressed concerns about the Middle East."
"I should like to emphasise that the Union will pull out all the stops to ensure that the Palestinian elections are a success."
"That was also the reason for the short-term programme that we in the European Council have approved."
"Mr Bot and the High Representative, Mr Solana, are in consultation with Arab countries and with the members of the quartet of the party involved."
"We in the Presidency are also working in close consultation with Javier Solana on a package of direct measures to support the Palestinians, particularly in the run-up to the presidential elections."
"Let me finally turn to Mrs Staniszewska’s observation about Ukraine."
"There is no doubt that the Union is offering Ukraine a prospect for the future, and it is not for nothing that we developed an action plan, with and for Ukraine, in the framework of the European neighbourhood programme."
"Hopefully, this will be laid down formally in December, which will give us a fresh basis for future cooperation."
"In this respect, we will not be considering who will win the elections, but the way in which those elections are being held."
"Only by fair and free elections can the Ukrainian Government demonstrate that it observes European standards not only in words, but also in deeds."
"This brings me to the end of my speech."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I should like to thank the Members of this House for their in-depth and interesting contributions."
"You have sent out signals that are important for future international policy-making."
"Europe means a great deal to the public."
"Communication will be tremendously enhanced when Europe contributes to employment, to a prospect for the future for the economy, when Europe helps reinforce security and if Europe succeeds in achieving results in these areas."
"I will naturally convey your opinions to the Council, and would thank you again for your input."
". Mr President, during the debate it was said that to talk about there being no alternative to the Lisbon Strategy was questionable, but that reflects an incorrect perception of what it is really about."
"It is not a simple and easy fix that drew us to defining this position in Lisbon, it is a more complex and broadly defined strategy."
"It is not an list, available for selective political shopping, but one balanced menu."
"Of course it is complex, and that is why we needed to re-evaluate where we are and how we can improve performance."
"If we did not have it at all, we would have to invent it."
"One aspect links the challenge of the ageing population in Europe with the challenge of increasing competitiveness."
"In a broad sense, that aspect is education."
"In my view, we are not entitled to life-long earning without life-long learning and this has to be very broadly defined."
"It is not just about elevating the elite in Europe, it is also important to look at the broader definition of education for the labour market."
"Here, the challenge for Europe to improve its competitiveness is not to say 'work harder' but to say 'work smarter'."
"This is the only way forward and is also why increasing the focus on education is essential."
"Money is also essential."
"One per cent is not enough!"
"It does not make sense to talk about ambition and to define and identify with the ambition of Lisbon without doing something to the budget."
"This is not just about the Community budget, but it does include it."
"We cannot have a credible ambition for Europe without a credible budget for Europe."
"Mr Titley suggested a scoreboard to show the performance of Member States' implementation efforts."
"I see the Kok report as an initial step along those lines."
"I am totally convinced that President Barroso and the incoming Commission will do its utmost in this respect."
"Mr Harbour mentioned the need for the Commission to reduce red tape and to simplify procedures."
"An important point on the European agenda should be to look again at the existing of directives and find out whether they could be simplified by transforming them and clarifying things to have more regulations and fewer directives."
"This would make it easier for economic players in Europe to find out what the existing legal situation is by reading it in a regulation instead of having to find out how directives have been implemented in all the different Member States."
"To mention just one example, the Prodi Commission has reduced the different ways of tendering from 48 to 8."
"This is not the answer to all the problems and I would say that the Financial Regulation is still a monster."
"We have not reached the point of simplification that we had hoped for."
"One reason for this is that in reacting to the problems of the previous Commission, we perhaps added too many layers of futile controls."
"I hope the Commission and Parliament will continue to look at the Financial Regulation."
"Confidence-building between our European institutions is necessary, but it is now necessary to build self-confidence."
"We can do better."
"Let me turn now to some final remarks on external relations."
"I add my voice to the sympathy being expressed to the family of the aid worker, Margaret Hassan, particularly because we in the Commission have been funding her work and the work of her organisation in Iraq over many years."
"It seems to be perpetually necessary to remind the strongest power in the world about the need to respect international humanitarian law."
"I was totally shocked to learn the other day that Red Crescent aid workers were not given access to Fallujah by the United States Army there."
"This is very, very bad and the international community – if we have one – should react very strongly against this type of behaviour."
"We, as Europeans, cannot create a credible basis for our relationship with an emerging democratic Iraq if we do not invest and do not clarify that it is possible for our views to differ from those of others on some points."
"On the issue of the readmission problem I would also say that confidence-building is necessary."
"It is not just about telling our neighbours and some developing countries far away from here that they have to take back refused asylum seekers from their own country or maybe their neighbouring country."
"We have to consider Europe's image in this."
"We have to offer some burden-sharing when we do these things."
"We must make it clear that we should not fund these activities with money earmarked for development cooperation."
"We have to talk about additionality, because we are adding to the list of things to do."
"This is the last time I will address this House."
"I want, on a personal note, to thank you for five very good years, both on the level of the results we have achieved together and on a personal level."
"Thank you, and good luck."
"Thank you, Mr Nielson."
"On behalf of Parliament, I should also like to thank you for your work."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, and a vote will take place on these at 12.30 p.m. today."
"The debate on the Council and Commission statements is now closed, and I should like to thank all speakers, as well as Mr Balkenende and Mr Nielson."
"The sitting will resume at 12 noon, when we will examine the issue of ..., when there will be a formal sitting on South Africa."
"The European Council of 5 November was the first since the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed in Rome on 29 October. It is therefore important that we highlight our opposition to this Treaty and our criticisms of economic, monetary and competition policy."
"The Treaty contains a profoundly neoliberal slant, to the detriment of social policy, and a narrow outlook on social rights and fundamental freedoms, with the emphasis placed on centralism and federalism in their various forms. As highlighted in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European United Left, the conception of a European security policy in the Treaty contains a major military dimension, and provides for close cooperation with NATO and an increase in Member States’ military efforts."
"As regards the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy, we strongly criticise the Kok report on the interim review of the Lisbon Strategy, particularly in view of its emphasis on ‘competitiveness’, on further increasing the flexibility of labour markets, on structural reforms in the internal market and on the liberalisation and privatisation policies, despite the disastrous impact that those policies have already had."
"We strongly believe that the Stability and Growth Pact must be revoked and replaced with a Growth and Employment Pact, as stated in our Group’s motion for a resolution."
"Mr President of the Republic of South Africa, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and pleasure for me to welcome Mr Mbeki, President of the Republic of South Africa, on behalf of the European Parliament."
"I would also like to welcome Mrs Mbeki and the Ministers and Members of Parliament accompanying the President, who are seated in the gallery."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has always followed events in your country very closely."
"During the apartheid era, not so long ago, we adopted numerous resolutions condemning those practices and supporting the humanitarian aid that the European Commission provides via numerous NGOs."
"A delegation from this Parliament also participated as observers in the first democratic elections held in your country in April 1994."
"On this 10th anniversary of your country's freedom, it is truly extraordinary to see the profound changes that have taken place in South African society in less than ten years, between apartheid and your Presidency of the Republic."
"Mr President, we know that your life has been characterised by your fight for freedom and democracy."
"Since you were 14 years old you have been linked to the activities of the African National Congress in South Africa and in many foreign countries, then as Vice-President of Nelson Mandela's government, and now as President of your nation."
"Yes, we should all be amazed and delighted by the incredible development of your country over these last ten years of democracy, the improvements in living conditions, access to housing, running water, education and health."
"The economic results are also very positive: you have recovered sustainable growth, controlled inflation and a significant increase in your currency reserves."
"Apart from these achievements, however, the most important thing you have achieved is national reconciliation."
"It does you honour, not just you but the whole of humanity, to have put an end to racial separation, not just in a physical sense but also in your citizens’ hearts and minds, where it is surely more difficult to make changes, moving from apartheid to an interracial society, which is more egalitarian, in which there are no gender inequalities either."
"Of course, a decade is not long enough to resolve these problems completely."
"We know that you are facing difficult challenges, particularly in relation to combating Aids and security amongst your citizens."
"Our relations have developed significantly by means of the multilateralism represented by the Cotonou Agreements and also by means of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa in the field of trade and development, which is now fully in force following ratification by all the States of the Union."
"Finally, I would like to refer to the important role your country is playing as a mediator in the regional and civil conflicts afflicting your continent."
"Your country, and yourself personally, have demonstrated this in the Great Lakes region and you are doing so at this very moment in Ivory Coast."
"Mr President, believe me that this Parliament has followed the creation of the Pan-African Parliament with great interest, which is now in the Republic of South Africa and with which we hope to maintain close relations in the future."
"For all these reasons, Mr President, it is an honour for the European Parliament to have you here today, and I am sure that what you are now going to say will be of the greatest interest to all of us."
"You have the floor, Mr President."
". Mr President, honourable Members, on 31 January last year, the published an article by a David Harland, described by the newspaper as 'a senior policy adviser on humanitarian affairs with the United Nations in Geneva'."
"Headed 'Talk of emergencies misses the point', the article discussed the situation in Africa."
"In part it said: 'Overshadowed by the Iraq crisis, quite a lot has been happening in Africa recently."
"Ivory Coast, having first taken a step away from war, may be edging back towards the precipice. Sudan is walking a fine line between war and peace, with an agreement possible to end what is now Africa's longest-running conflict'."
"It said: 'Civil wars in Burundi and even Congo may be a little closer to resolution than they were a year ago."
"As has Angola, until recently the scene of Africa's Thirty Years' War.'"
"It said that the peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea is holding and then asked the question, 'Is Africa rejoicing offstage while the world worries about Iraq?'"
"In reply it said, 'Not at all'."
"It said that despite the small flashes of good news, Africa remains in a horrible mess."
"It said that Pliny the Elder said that 'out of Africa there is always something new.' ."
"Mr Harland said that these days it seems the opposite is true: out of Africa there is always something depressingly familiar."
"Africa's weak states need long-term assistance."
"Six months after this article appeared, on 13 July, published yet another opinion about Africa. This one, entitled 'An invitation to disaster' was written by one Arnold Beichman, described as 'a Hoover Institution research fellow'."
"Returning to Pliny's famous expression, Mr Beichman wrote, 'Pliny the Elder, Roman naturalist and philosopher, wrote in his multivolume 'Natural History': '', or for those who have forgotten their high-school Latin: 'There is always something new out of Africa'."
"He asked what could be more new than Africa south of the Sahara, supported by the United Nations, pleading with Europe and America for a return of western soldiers to bring peace to Liberia?"
"Pleading, if you please, for American troops to oust Liberia's President Charles Taylor, since it was American slaves who had been freed and sent to form their own country in 1847."
"He said how strange it was for Europe's one-time African colonies to have made such a request, even if it could mean many years of occupation of Liberia by once-hated western armies."
"From African emancipation to African reoccupation."
"He said, 'So what am I yakking about?"
"No American troops in Liberia or any other part of Africa."
"Not one."
"We've done our share, more than our share in Afghanistan and Iraq. And we're still not finished in those two countries and we won't be for years to come."
"Let Europe - Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, all one-time colonial powers - send in their troops."
"Enough already.'"
"Arnold Beichman's response to David Harland's observation that Africa's weak states need long-term assistance was to suggest that rather than the United States, the countries of Europe represented in this esteemed Parliament should reoccupy Africa, and be prepared to stay on for some time, just as the United States, according to Beichman, is prepared to stay on in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"If indeed this were the eventuality with which all of us must contend, that to solve the problems of the developing south the developed north has to resurrect old colonial empires, then the well-used expression '' would necessarily have to be rewritten to extend beyond the African shores."
"I am certain that you will understand that as Africans we have absolutely no desire to entertain Arnold Beichman's wishes, and have no wish to have it said that the newest thing out of Africa is its recolonialisation."
"I am equally certain that neither do you, or the peoples of Europe that you represent, want to impose on yourselves what the British writer, Rudyard Kipling, arrogantly described as 'the white man's burden'."
"But before I go any further, let me return to Pliny the Elder."
"The motto of the South African Museum, the premier museum in our country, says in Latin: ''."
"This translates into 'Africa always brings forth or contributes something new'."
"You may question why this corruption of a famous Latin saying, that is seemingly so beloved to observers of African actuality, has come about."
"If I may digress briefly into the world of the study of ancient languages and literature, let me explain how the South African Museum arrived at this particular rendition of the famous saying by Pliny the Elder."
"It transpires that Pliny translated into Latin what had originally been written by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle."
"Referring to what he described as a common Greek saying, Pliny wrote, ''."
"The expression '' is a later adaptation of what Pliny actually wrote."
"It is for this reason that, for its motto, the South African Museum reverted to the original Pliny."
"As a repository of extraordinary exhibits that contribute something new to our understanding of the evolution of our common universe, the earliest being the first fossils of prehistoric animals to be found in our country, the Museum chose a motto that says Africa always contributes something new to human knowledge."
"I want to argue that as you are doing in Europe, Africa is today involved in an extraordinary and creative endeavour that might contribute something new to the understanding of the capacity and ability of human beings to overcome adversity and build a new world of hope."
"I come from an African country whose future was highly uncertain a mere decade ago."
"As we approached the end of three-and-a half cruel centuries of white minority rule, many in the world held their breath, foreseeing a cataclysmic clash of races that would transform the streets of our towns and cities into rivers of blood."
"However, because of what the black and white Africans of South Africa did, understanding that the taking of even one life would neither remove the great harm that had been visited on millions for centuries, nor create the possibility to repair the damage that had been done, Africa's South Africa is today at peace with itself."
"Black and white South Africans, and others from elsewhere in the world who have chosen to join in this effort, are hard at work, striving together every day to build a new African country that will, in all respects, truly belong to all who live in it."
"Many across the globe who feared for the worst describe what has been achieved as a miracle."
"If it is, it is, remarkably, a human miracle brought about by the triumphant resurgence of everything that is good and noble in the human soul."
"As Africans, we are proud that this, in addition, is an African miracle."
"Ten years ago, a mere 21 days before South Africa held the first democratic elections that gave us our freedom, the most terrible genocide began in the African country of Rwanda."
"In a hundred days a million Africans had been butchered by other Africans in a barbaric and savage manner that would have been difficult to imagine and is still difficult to understand."
"The Government and people of Rwanda have left some of the places where the slaughter occurred as they were when the murderous insanity was brought to an end."
"So today, a decade later, you can see the skeletons with cracked or punctured skulls of those who were butchered mercilessly and for no reason except as an expression of the same criminal hatred for other human beings that resulted in the annihilation of millions of Jews in the Holocaust that took place in Europe, as Nazism gave meaning to its vile project."
"But even as a South African, well educated in the unbridled savagery of human beings towards other human beings, I have wondered at what could have driven the to commit the high crimes that were visited on the people of Rwanda."
"But, much more than this, I have marvelled at the unfathomable depths of forgiveness that have allowed the people of Rwanda to sit together in village assemblies to discuss what happened, the killers, together with those who carry the indelible scars of the savagery or who lost relatives and friends as a result of the blood-letting orgy."
"I have marvelled that simple African folk could convene under the African sky, without even the sophistication of a simple village hall, the hunters and hunted together, and decide to forgive, choosing the path of national reconciliation rather than angry vengeance."
"In the end, I have felt proud that other Africans, the Rwandans, could give our continent and all humanity the priceless gift and the miracle of understanding what it means to say 'let bygones be bygones'."
"Because the thunder of the guns broke the uneasy silence in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi, in Algeria and the Côte d'Ivoire, in Sudan and Uganda, it has seemed to some that Africa is defined by the chatter of the weapons of war rather than the striving for peace, exemplified by what the African peoples of South Africa and Rwanda have, within the last ten years, sought to do, to address some of the grossest injustices that have occurred on African soil or, indeed, the peace that has prevailed in the overwhelmingly majority of African countries."
"Nevertheless, as an African, I will make bold to state what I believe are some incontrovertible truths about my continent."
"Under the leadership of African Algeria, the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea came to an end."
"Whatever Africa needs to do to ensure that these two sister African countries do not go to war again to resolve border disputes, Africa will do."
"As Africans we rejoice that peace in this part of our world is holding and will hold."
"Under African leadership the wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Burundi have come to an end."
"As Africans we again rejoice that peace in this part of our world is holding and will hold, and that these two sister countries continue to advance, despite the odds, towards the formation of new governments that will be elected by the African masses in democratic elections, which will be held during 2005."
"Under the leadership of the African Republic of Kenya, Sudan is about to end the long drawn out war between the Northern and Southern parts of this sister African country, and proceed to the formation of a new Government of National Unity."
"Similarly, under the leadership of the African Union, and whatever the current difficulties, the conflict in Darfur and other parts of the Sudan will be resolved, leading, among other things, to the redesign of the Sudanese system of governance to entrench the principles of tolerance and unity in diversity."
"The terrorist wars in Algeria and Uganda are also coming to their conclusion."
"Difficult as this may be for some to understand, as Africans we have no doubt that the people of Côte d'Ivoire will find one another and will together establish a stable peace, reunify their country and join together in electing a government representative of the people of Côte d'Ivoire as a whole."
"The commitment of the leadership therefore to the holding of elections by October 2005 is an important signal of their common commitment."
"You will have recognised the fact that what I have tried to communicate exemplifies the new Africa that is striving to be born."
"This is the new Africa defined by the African Union and its socio-economic programme, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD."
"Accordingly, I am talking about an Africa that is using enforceable legal instruments to commit itself to the fundamental objectives of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, good governance, development and a better life for all."
"This is a new Africa in the process of birth, which has established or is in the process of establishing such institutions as an African Commission similar to the European Commission, a Pan-African Parliament, a Peace and Security Council, Pan African Criminal and Human Rights Courts, an Economic, Social and Cultural Council representative of African civil society, an African Peer Review Mechanism specifically dedicated to the objective of promoting good political, economic and corporate governance and, of course, the NEPAD programme."
"This is a new Africa that has taken firm steps to give concrete meaning to the goal of the political and economic integration of Africa, in pursuit of the objective of African unity that is based on the understanding that, as Africans, we share a common destiny."
"It is a new Africa that has finally made the statement to itself that it must take responsibility for its destiny, that it must take ownership of its own future."
"In that sense I speak of an Africa that is saying it must be its own liberator from the ills of war and conflict, dictatorship, corruption and the regression that have characterised much of Africa over the last few decades."
"In this context, we therefore contest the assertion made by David Harland that 'out of Africa there is always something depressingly familiar.'"
"I also contest the argument advanced by Arnold Beichman, that Europe must dispatch expeditionary forces to our continent to rescue the hapless African masses from weak states."
"A long history of interaction and interdependence binds Europe and Africa together."
"That history, as well as current realities, dictate that our two continents should build a mutually beneficial partnership for change."
"The Africa you know so well is poor."
"Yet it is committed to engage in a struggle to eradicate that poverty."
"It is underdeveloped."
"But it is determined to extricate itself from this terrible condition."
"It continues to suffer from such conflicts as you experienced not so long ago in the Balkans."
"Nevertheless, it is resolved to act firmly and consistently to guarantee itself the gift of peace."
"It exports some of its best-prepared human resources to your countries to your benefit."
"It is obliged to receive back into its borders those driven by hunger to undertake hazardous journeys out of Africa, to enter Europe illegally, and whom you catch and expel."
"Current global realities that threaten us all, concerning failed states, seemingly unbridgeable ideological differences and international terrorism, are other factors that communicate the message that during this period of globalisation, no country or continent can be an island."
"In the end, the European Union will not succeed in its noble objectives if neighbouring Africa fails to achieve the same objectives."
"As you have worked to build the new Europe after the costly Second World War and the end of the Cold War, you have taken firmly on board two related and critically important objectives of cohesion and solidarity within the EU."
"On this basis, you have made the determination that you are one to the other your brother's and sister's keeper."
"Through what you have done and are doing through your Regional Policy, you have succeeded to combine what is practically necessary with what is morally correct."
"As a consequence of this, millions throughout the Union have had their human dignity restored, guaranteeing the possibility for all to thrive in conditions of peace, friendship, mutually beneficial cooperation, and prosperity."
"We would like to believe that your experience, stretching over many centuries, will have communicated the message to you that were these ever to be built, the walls of a 'Fortress Europe' would always be easy to breach."
"We would also like to believe that as you act to help the millions of Africans who are working to help themselves, you would understand that, as you come to help us as Africans secure our own human dignity you would guarantee for yourselves, as well as ourselves, the possibility to thrive in conditions of peace, friendship, mutually beneficial cooperation, and prosperity."
"Simply put, it is difficult to see how Africa can extricate itself from its terrible condition of poverty and underdevelopment without resort to the development model epitomised by the EU Regional Policy, which has recorded the successes it has with regard to the poor and underdeveloped regions within the EU."
"In this regard, I believe that we should engage in a serious dialogue between ourselves, to answer the question of whether the existing framework of cooperation between Africa and the EU, to address a challenge of poverty and underdevelopment greater than that experienced within the EU, is informed by considerations akin to those that inform your own internal regional policy."
"Perhaps the European and Pan-African Parliaments could take the initiative to begin this dialogue."
"It would seem obvious that we should avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby, because of what was not done, we would say that David Harland was correct when he said that 'out of Africa there is always something depressingly familiar.'"
"I would like to thank you most sincerely for the opportunity you have given us to speak to you, fully aware of the heartfelt importance of this gesture of solidarity."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to wish you the best as you grapple with the challenge, among others, of making a success of the enlarged Union."
"I am certain that you understand this better than I do, that the more you succeed to establish a strong, effective and successful European Union, the more your responsibilities will increase to contribute to the realisation of the goal of a better world for all."
"Success breeds its own responsibilities."
"And one of the greatest responsibilities of our time is to end the obscene reality of endemic poverty for millions when the means and know-how exist within human society to achieve the goal of a better life for all."
"As I end and thank you very much again Mr President and Members of the European Parliament for having us, and salute you for what you did to end the system of apartheid, a victory of which we celebrate the 10th anniversary this year, I would like to assure you that regardless of what the sceptics might say, '."
"Something new, Africa will always contribute something new."
"I thank you very much, Mr President, and thank you all for your attention."
"Thank you very much for your words, Mr President."
"I am sure your presence here today has satisfied our expectations."
"I would also like, Mr President, to thank the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, Mr Balkenende, for being here today. Parliament appreciates his presence."
"The next item is the vote."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I would like to point out that there has been an error by the services of the House and that this amendment has not been presented by the PPE-DE Group."
"Naturally, we are against."
"Thank you for pointing that out, Mr Salafranca."
"I note that it is not a PPE-DE Group amendment."
"(2)"
"That concludes the vote."
"Various points should be raised with regard to the objectives of the ARGO Programme, which is a programme that we believe should be rejected outright."
"The aim of this programme is to foster the communitarisation of the management of Member States’ borders, and of the policies on visas, asylum and immigration, with funds from the Community budget that require national cofinancing. In other words, this is yet another tool used to construct a ‘fortress Europe’ built on restricting the fundamental competences of Member States’ sovereignty."
"It strikes me that the implementation of this programme is one of those instances in which the overbearing eagerness of the most federalist plans is at variance with reality."
"This is firstly because there is no evidence that there is any actual need for the departments in the Member States – along with partners from other Member States – to organise and mobilise the resources required to carry out those projects and secondly because, as we have stated, given the monetary policy and the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact by the European Central Bank and by the governments of the 12 countries of the euro zone, Member States have not been able to mobilise the national resources required to obtain funding for this programme. As the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining."
". On behalf of the VVD delegation in the European Parliament, Mr Manders has voted against Mrs Corbey’s Amendment No 4 to the Packaging Directive, because that amendment does not call for examining the manner in which packaging material is reused which is best suited to the Internal Market."
"By doing this, the VVD delegation in the European Parliament is not voting against the environment, but it fails to see how this amendment offers any additional environmental benefit, it being unclear, in the case of single-use packaging being refilled, what costs are incurred for such things as extra transport, use of cleaning products and the associated water pollution. Moreover, 80% to 90% of single-use packaging is already at present being recycled successfully."
"Furthermore, extra environmental measures may not lead to a disruption in the Internal Market, as did the deposit system for single-use packaging in Germany."
"This system, which is still before the Court of Justice awaiting a final ruling, has, since its introduction, resulted in some EUR 0.5 billion worth of damage to the customer, industry, and has, last not least, dealt a devastating blow to employment."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Corbey (A6-0027/2004) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste."
"On 31 December 1994, Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste entered into force. At the time when the proposal for the revised packaging directive was submitted to Parliament and the Council, accession negotiations with ten countries were ongoing."
"The new Member States have now acceded to the EU as of 1 May 2004. At the time of the adoption of the revised packaging directive, however, the transition periods for the original directive were not yet finalised for all acceding States."
"Furthermore, information on the conditions for further increasing the recovery and recycling targets in the acceding States was insufficient."
"The revised packaging directive does not therefore contain specific proposals for the acceding States in its operational part."
"The current proposal lays down a deadline of 31 December 2012 by which the ten new Member States must fulfil the targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste. I feel that this entire report is crucial because it fosters systems of reusing packaging with the aim of ensuring"
". As I have said on a number of occasions, the recovery and recycling of packaging waste must be stepped up throughout EU territory, in order to reduce its impact on the environment."
"The positive results achieved by the EU Member States in the Union of 15 can and must also be achieved by the new arrivals."
"The proposal before us accords the acceding States temporary derogations with respect to the targets set in the ‘Revised Packaging Directive’, which will allow them to make the step soon."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal based on the idea that all Member States should still be encouraged to implement packaging reuse systems, with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection and giving the new Member States a period in which to adapt properly."
"For the past 30 years, one third of the island of Cyprus has been occupied by the Turkish army."
"This army has committed ethnic cleansing by driving Orthodox Cypriots from their land in order to give it to Turkish settlers from Anatolia."
"Not only have the European institutions failed to condemn this violation of international law which affects a Member State; from now on they will be funding it. Why is this the case?"
"The reason is that our leaders wish to remove all obstacles to the accession of Turkey, an Asian and Muslim country, to the EU. After having flouted the basic rules of geography which tell us that Turkey is not a European country, they are now flouting the principles of international law, although they constantly claim to adhere to these latter in order to preach at the rest of the world."
"The only course of action left open to European nations is to reject the Constitution of this Brussels-inspired Europe next year."
"The system of blocs in place until the collapse of Communist totalitarianism led both sides carelessly to sell and distribute arms to all and sundry for use against the local ideological opponent."
"Given the current strategic situation in the world, it is increasingly important to control arms exports and to ensure transparency in this field."
"Indeed, the splintered nature of the threats against the free world, as illustrated by the tragedies of 11 September and 11 March, demonstrates that strict conditions must be placed on international arms sales, for the sake of overall security."
"The actions given priority status and the cross-checking of confidential data are welcome contributions to enhancing our knowledge of the arms market in Europe. Various missionary organisations have repeatedly warned of the serious proliferation of light arms, especially in Africa, and of the violent conflicts that those arms facilitate and exacerbate and the millions of innocent victims that they tragically cause."
"In 1998 this groundbreaking measure was introduced. Yet already we see it needs to be strengthened, become legally binding and widened to cover arms brokering, the transit trade and activities of EU nationals outside of the EU."
"In the debate the continuing embargo on arms sales to China was argued. It was entirely right to have an embargo after the terrible events of Tiananmen Square in 1989."
"Human rights albeit far from perfect, have begun to improve. Democratic practices are being introduced at village level."
"With the code of conduct this embargo is no longer necessary."
"China should be treated the same as everyone else. Many arms sales would be forbidden under the code of conduct and rightly so."
"But it would encourage China to continue its tangible progress on human rights if each transaction was to be judged on its individual merits rather than by a blanket ban."
"We are of the view that individual Member States should monitor arms exports through their national legislation and through cooperation within the framework of the United Nations."
"We resolutely oppose consideration being given to setting up a European arms export control agency."
"Regarding the issue of an arms embargo against the People’s Republic of China, we have chosen to abstain in the votes on this issue in the report."
"We believe it is an issue for each of the national parliaments, such as Sweden’s, to decide upon."
"We have also chosen to abstain in the final vote on this report because it deals with issues upon which the national parliaments should decide."
"."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports this resolution, in particular calls to strengthen the Code of Conduct through the current review process."
"However, the interesting debate on a possible future EU-wide tax on Arms Sales is still in its infancy, and there are many implications that need to be fully explored and discussed, as outlined by the Dutch Presidency in the debate yesterday."
"We Europeans have committed ourselves to making a contribution to global peace and security through arms limitations and disarmament. We attach high priority to strict controls on arms exports."
"There is not the least reason to lift the arms embargo on the People’s Republic of China merely because Member States have an interest in developing their lucrative trading relationships with it."
"When the Council, in 1989, imposed by unanimous vote the embargo in response to the massacre in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, it was quite right to do so. How, then, is it to be annulled now?"
"Have political prisoners been given fair trials? Are Tibetans being allowed to practise their religion, or enjoy their cultural activities?"
"The EU must, as a matter of urgent necessity, keep in place its restrictions on the sale of weapons to the Chinese."
"No longer must the EU-China dialogue treat human rights as marginal – they deserve to be given pride of place."
"Today, the European Parliament has adopted a report on the European Union’s Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"I voted in favour of the report as a whole. That the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports should be binding and that the Council and the Member States are being urged to maintain the arms embargo against China are important signals in the report."
"The principle behind such a tax, the income from which is intended to benefit victims of armed conflicts and the combating of poverty in general is laudable. In order to be effective, such a tax should, however, be levied at global, rather than European, level."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the ALTHEA military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina B6-0162/2004. I feel that the ALTHEA operation must strengthen the EU’s global approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina and support progress in the country."
"The purpose of this operation is to strengthen the capacity of the local police and to combat organised crime by gradually handing over responsibility for security to the local authorities."
"The Stabilisation and Association Process in Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes an essential framework for the country’s journey towards stability and development."
"I wish to reiterate that the country should rely principally on its own efforts for its journey towards peace and stability."
"I welcome the EU’s decision to have recourse to NATO assets and capabilities for the ALTHEA mission, thereby confirming the collaboration between the two organisations and implementing the agreement of December 2002 on EU access to NATO planning and command facilities ('Berlin Plus')."
". – The declarations by the Commission and the decision by the ΕU to organise a mission code-named 'Althea' to send an expeditionary force of 7 000 soldiers to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to change the guard, in order to replace the occupying military forces of the USA and NATO, confirm the aggressive and imperialistic character of the ΕU and its identification with the strategy of the USA against the people."
"The objective of this new Euro-army force is to maintain the occupation in the Balkans, in order to protect and promote the interests of big business in the area as a whole."
"The demagogic pronouncements of the ΕU, that the sending of the expeditionary force to Bosnia-Herzegovina will allegedly help democracy move forward, is an insult to the Balkan people, who have paid for the imperialist armed interventions in the area with blood and misery."
"Recent developments following the intervention of the USA for FYROM, despite the fact that there were discussions with Greece within the framework of the UN, the fact that 2005 will be crucial for the situation in Kosovo, within the framework of the competition between and interventions by the imperialists in the area as a whole, are creating a minefield for the people."
"The people of Yugoslavia and of the Balkans in general need to unite in their fight against imperialist plans and interventions in order to remove all foreign military forces and bases in the area."
". –The resolution is a wish list which is not up to the serious problem threatening the future of the planet."
"They confine themselves solely to renewable energy sources, to the strengthening of energy performance and to the production of energy from biomass, without including other measures such as using biofuels as partial substitutes for mineral fuels, making greater use of the heat generated in electricity stations, improving the techniques available for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases per produced energy unit and providing essential protection for and developing forests to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere."
"The endeavours of the ΕU to 'set an example' are belied by the Commission's data, which illustrate that the EU of the 15 is well behind schedule if it is to meet the target of reducing greenhouse gases by 8% in 2010 compared with 1990."
"We confirm our categorical and unwavering opposition to trading in greenhouse gases as inefficient and hypocritical. As the resolution not only accepts but also strengthens trading in pollutants, proving that the multinationals and their political mouthpieces can pollute as long as they pay and that they have little interest in really reversing these dangerous developments, we shall vote against the motion."
"Mr President, it is important that we should send a quite unmistakeable message to Cuba, to the effect that Castro’s dictatorship must be done away with once and for all."
"The fact is that, firstly, what we are dealing with here is an oppressed people, obliged to contend with one of the last of the Communist dictatorships that have been in existence since the Second World War, or, in this instance, since the 1960s; secondly, Cuba continues to be what one might call a source of infection for Latin America. We see Castro suddenly enjoying renewed prestige in a whole array of Latin American states, and that is something we cannot simply wink at."
"Although we do not support a policy of unilateral sanctions, we do see democracy and human rights as fundamental, and if the observance of basic human rights is not introduced into Cuba at long last, then not only does that make proper relations between Cuba and the European Union impossible, but it also imposes a burden on Latin America as a whole."
"We are probably the only Members of this House who find the conclusions of the Brussels Summit unacceptable."
"Its ultimate aim is to dismantle public services and downgrade our social welfare systems."
"We are strongly opposed to an accelerated Europeanisation of immigration policies, the aim of the latter being merely to organise migratory flows so that Europe’s ageing populations are replenished. Europeanisation of this kind provides for even fewer internal border controls, without any guarantee that Europe’s external borders will be strengthened."
"This is why we will vote against all the motions for resolutions tabled today."
"I want to return to my invitation last July to build a partnership for Europe, a partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security."
"Now we urgently need to get back to work."
"Both in July and last month, I set out our policy priorities and concerns in some detail, so I do not wish to repeat them today."
"Nevertheless, whatever our priorities and objectives, we can do more by acting together than we can by acting separately."
"Let me add two comments. First, I believe the Union, the European Commission and this Parliament can emerge stronger from this process of approval."
"We may not agree on every issue."
"Like any family, we will have arguments and differences."
"However, let me assure you that this Commission will, with your help, play its leadership role."
"It will strive to lead a dynamic coalition reflecting the views of this Parliament and promoting the common European interest."
"Second, with this new strength comes greater responsibility; a responsibility to work together; a responsibility to forge a relationship built on mutual respect and shared confidence in Europe's future; a responsibility to deliver results which make a difference to the lives of Europeans."
"We must create the conditions for growth and jobs, sharing prosperity and opportunity across the whole Union. To do this we must put a premium on innovation, education and research."
"If I refer to the economy first, it is not because it is an end in itself, but because a strong and dynamic economy is a precondition for our ambitious social and environmental goals."
"We must reinforce European democracy, reconnecting the Union with the people, and work towards the ratification of our new Constitution."
"We must reach out across our continent to make a success of our recent enlargement. We must work to improve the quality of life within a modern European model based on economic dynamism and social justice."
"We must reaffirm the Union's pre-eminent role as an area of freedom and justice and we must consolidate our leadership in striving for peace, security and sustainable development around the globe."
"We must, therefore, shape a Europe for future generations and capture the imagination and enthusiasm of our young people."
"Today, I ask you for your confidence so that we can start this task."
"With your support we can build a better Europe."
"My team is ready and anxious to play its part. So let us now get on with our job!"
"That is progress, and it could have been much better than it is. It is at this point that I will address Mr Balkenende and say that it could have been much better than it is if your government, Mr Balkenende, had acted to resolve an issue about which we have had very lively discussions and will continue to do so."
"However much regard I have for your Presidency of the Council and for you personally, I found it regrettable that the Italian Government took a more flexible approach than did its Dutch counterpart."
"I think we will have to have further discussions about the conclusions we should draw from what happened. Mr Barroso has alluded to some of them, and it is a subject to which I shall shortly return."
"One thing, though, is perfectly clear, and that is that if this House has become stronger in relation to the Commission and also the Council – and it has become stronger – then my group has played a decisive part in that."
"Of that I am proud, but, as we have just heard, there are always many who can claim a share in credit for victory."
"That those who sat out the battle hiding in the bushes should now, apparently, be the loudest in proclaiming victory, may well be understandable in human terms, but it is not politically justified."
"There are another two points that we will have to sort out with Mr Barroso. Firstly, you have announced that you will be carrying on with the agreements that Mr Prodi made with Parliament following the change of Commission in 1999."
"You will have to be more precise about what you mean by that. This is an issue to which we have returned in the resolutions we have submitted."
"Making things more precise means that we assume that the undertaking still stands according to which Commissioners leave the Commission as and when you demand that they do so and that this will initially be dealt with within the Commission."
"We also take it as read that you accept, in individual cases where there is hard evidence from Commissioners’ conduct in office of incompatibilities with their previous activities, that you will have recourse to this when Parliament requires it."
"That is what we expect of you, and I think there were indications in what you said today, that you do, and that you will go into more detail about it tomorrow. It also features in our resolution and is something on which we insist."
"In the previous part-session, Mr Barroso, you attempted – and were, I think, ill-advised to do so – to get together a majority to defeat the Socialist Group, but in that you did not succeed."
"If there have been changes in this Commission, they have come about as a result of proposals made by the Socialist Group and of vigorous pressure exerted by it."
"If you want a broad majority in this House, you will not get one without the Socialist Group."
"For that reason, and also because a large proportion of your Commissioners belongs to our political family, I recommend that you seek our group’s cooperation."
"A Commission supported by a broad majority in this House is a strong Commission; that would in any case be better than to depend on the votes of the extreme Right."
"That, today, is something I want to have set down."
"If you gain our approval, that is approval for the composition of this Commission and a signal for the work to begin. It is not a statement about the legislative programme that you will be putting forward in January, which we will judge, not by the people in the Commission, but by its contents."
"That is particularly true of the Lisbon process, which is a process of growth, but must also be a process leading to social cohesion and social stability. By that we shall judge you."
"It is for that reason that we are willing to cooperate constructively with you and with your Commission."
"Mr Barroso, I have had many opportunities for discussions with you over the past weeks, and it was only yesterday that I saw at first hand your own hard work, for which you have my personal respect. I sometimes wonder whether that hard work is a response to the pressures of the situation."
"If it were no more than that, that would be a bad thing, but if what we have here is an ongoing endeavour, if you – as you stated in your speech – know that the Commission whose President you are is composed of diverse political tendencies, the same as are to be found in the Council, in the make-up of the governments represented in it, and in this House, and that in all three institutions Social Democrats have a decisive role to play, and if you bear that in mind in your own personal work, in the work of the Commission and in your legislative proposals, then you can expect the Social Democrats in this House to support you. If you fail to take that to heart, then remember October 2004, for that is what will then happen again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has considered it very important to fight for the European Parliament to make its own voice heard on an important issue: respect for a common European feeling in the matter of freedom and non-discrimination."
"The choice of those – among whom I include you, Mr Pottering, Mr Watson – who cried sacrilege, an apocalyptic crisis over something so mundane as the demand to change a team that was not working, has proved to be mistaken."
"Contrary to what was thought, public opinion has understood and supported what happened here perfectly."
"This, it seems to me, is something that should be strongly emphasised. Nevertheless, my group has decided unanimously not to support your Commission."
"The modifications that you have made are minimal, and even if they have cleared the field of the awkward presence of Rocco Buttiglione, they have not solved the more serious problems."
"Above all, they keep your Commission in an unacceptably weak and vulnerable position. It is true, Mr Watson, this Commission is better than the one we had on 27 October, but we could have had one that was better still."
"We continue to regard it as an error, leaving aside his personal competence, for a Commissioner for Justice to be nominated who is a minister who has signed a farcical law on conflict of interest and who comes from a government led by a man, Silvio Berlusconi, for whom a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment for corruption has just been demanded."
"Yet, alas, the Berlusconisation of Europe proceeds apace, and with your Commission conflict of interest becomes a European vice."
"It is precisely from the Netherlands, a country that is always ready to deliver grand lectures on morality, that there arises a case that we see as more problematic."
"Without wishing to underestimate the negative impact that Mrs Fischer Boel’s conflict of interest may have on the common agricultural policy, it is the clear that the case of Mrs Kroes represents the most dangerous landmine on the road to credibility for your Commission, Mr Barroso."
"The ridiculous statistics produced by the Commission on the basis of invalid calculations cannot disguise the fact that if Mrs Kroes had been in Mr Monti’s post, she would have had to stand aside in no less than 35 cases."
"What is more, the statistics indicate that there are three cases at the moment on which the Commission will be a lame duck and will have little credibility: reform of the competition rules in the maritime transport sector, the investigations under way in the so-called ‘bitumen cartel’ (which is a particularly serious case because Mrs Kroes was until a few weeks ago a member of one of the businesses in question), and finally, the inquiry into a possible abuse of its dominant position by the British mobile telephone operator ."
"Competition – frankly, it is a little ridiculous that a ‘Green’ should bring this to Parliament’s attention when it and the Commission are full of liberals – represents one of the cornerstones of the Union’s credibility, and the responsible Commissioner must be above all suspicion."
"Now, please explain to us why you want to make Europe run this risk. Why, after having lived through the Santer crisis, the Eurostat polemics and the Buttiglione psychodrama, do you take responsibility for weakening your Commission to this level?"
"It is true that you are not alone in sharing this responsibility: Messrs Shultz, Poettering and Watson have helped to shoulder it."
"They took fright at their great success on 27 October and wished to return to being an acquiescent Parliament."
"That is not for us and the responsibility will not be ours if there is trouble."
"The responsibility for the future of your institution will lie with you, and with the groups who have offered sacrifices to contingent party interests and to counting how many Commissioners belong to their own political families."
"In closing, Mr President, in our opinion the choice of Stavros Dimas for the environment is not by chance. It reflects the precise hierarchy of priorities in your Commission, where the environment is not to be found."
"Nevertheless, we are certainly ready to try a sort of charm offensive towards Commissioner Dimas and also to admit that we were wrong if he proves to have more energy and more competence."
"Very quickly, Mr President, I should like to conclude by saying that not only is the composition of your Commission a problem but also the direction in which this Commission wishes to go. We shall try to act as an opposition in an absolutely constructive spirit, and we hope occasionally to convince you that our road is the correct one."
"Mr President, what happened during the last plenary part-session was important for the European Parliament."
"Forced by the democratic will of the Chamber, Mr Barroso had to withdraw his proposal."
"That was important in strengthening the European institutions and Europe itself as a political entity."
"The danger of a Commission not supported by this Parliament forced Mr Barroso to make new proposals and that was a good day for our institution."
"The most visible problem was supposed to be Mr Buttiglione's controversial statement during the hearing, but that was merely symptomatic."
"In the past we have had several Commissioners with the same opinions and nothing happened. In fact, the problem was that the majority of Parliament thought that the Commission should be a better one, more in accordance with real European needs and with European institutions and more sensitive to European peoples and stateless nations."
"The members of the European Free Alliance, part of the Verts/ALE Group, are convinced that your new proposal is not substantially different from the old one."
"Mr Barroso, when you asked for more time three weeks ago in Strasbourg, we hoped you would bring us a better proposal."
"But we have seen that you are in a way a prisoner of the will of the Member States. You are not free to build a Commission based on the general interests of Europe, as distinct from the interests of each Member State."
"We parliamentarians have no freedom to choose the Commission and each of its members on our own. For that reason, Mr Barroso, we cannot back your proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Law and Justice (PiS) delegation within the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was faced with a serious dilemma. On the one hand, we supported Mr Barroso and we are not ashamed of this."
"We believe we were right to do so, as he is a guarantee that this Commission will achieve good results and be a good European Commission."
"We also believe it is in the interest of many Member States, especially those whose economies are weaker, for us to have a strong Commission, and we hope Mr Barroso’s Commission will be a strong Commission serving the idea of European solidarity."
"On the other hand, however, we were confronted with an extremely worrying precedent, namely that under the influence of the extreme Left in this House, and of ideological prejudices held by Members of this House, Mr Buttiglione’s, nomination was withdrawn."
"We believe he would have been a good Commissioner."
"In fact, Mr Buttiglione is no longer a member of this Commission."
"By way of contrast, this House was ready to overlook the totalitarian past of certain Commissioners and their membership of the criminal Communist Party."
"In our opinion, this means that double moral standards are currently being applied."
"The standards applied to European citizens who hold conservative views, notably Catholics, are not those applied to Communists, people who worked to promote a criminal ideology and the subjugation of their own countries."
"For the members of the Law and Justice (PiS) delegation within the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, however, the principle of Member States’ sovereignty is of paramount importance. We recognise that the European Commission as it stands has been negotiated by sovereign states and the sovereign governments of sovereign European nations, and we therefore reject this House’s right to question the decisions of the Member States."
"We cannot, however, vote against this Commission, because we believe, and this is a point I should like to stress, that the House has no right to question the decisions of the Member States’ governments. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, however, we will at the same time be unable to vote in favour of this Commission, despite our great respect for Mr Barroso and many of his Commissioners."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the Council had taken you hostage."
"Tomorrow, Parliament will free you, and it is time it did so, for there is work awaiting you."
"Your task has not been easy, faced with the inertia of the Council, which is more concerned about defending national interests than about presenting a vision of Europe. Mr Barroso, the events of these last few weeks will, I hope, have brought you closer to the European Parliament."
"Admittedly, we have regrets. We regret that the Dutch Government did not accept our recommendation of a change of portfolio for Mrs Kroes."
"Her task will not be easy, for all her decisions will be subjected to debate. We regret that you have been required to keep Mr Kovács."
"I have the gravest doubts as to his ability, given his origins, to deal with tax issues. That being said, we appreciate the withdrawal of Mrs Udre, and bravo Mr Frattini for his very commendable performance."
"We were already able to gauge his interest in a more efficient EU."
"We shall therefore put our confidence in your Commission, Mr Barroso, for you have shown responsibility."
"Let us look at the future, then. Our Parliament has spoken, and it intends to play its role alongside yourselves."
"It will be your partner for, as I have already said to you, Europe will only make progress by means of a strong Commission and a strong Parliament working in tandem. We are in fact only too aware of the paralysis due to the Council."
"Your task is a huge one, involving a vote in favour of the Constitution, together with the issues of employment, competitiveness and support for our SMEs and our self-employed. What we expect from you is a genuine industrial policy conducive to supporting growth."
"Above all, however, priority should be given to defending the interests of Europeans. What I took from your speech was your desire to create an EU that speaks to young people and to their generation, an EU that, as I myself see it, should pave the way for their future through professional training and through language learning accessible to everyone."
"Two major challenges await you: the ageing of the population and the demographic downturn."
"What we ask of you is that you lead a visionary team for Europe."
"Mr Barroso, what has happened is in actual fact not only a victory for the European Parliament, but also a victory for yourself."
"Overcoming difficulties always makes people stronger, and I believe that you too have become stronger now that you have seen things through."
"You have now put together a Commission that is better than the one you chose not to present to Parliament. You deserve that recognition, also accorded to you by my group chairman."
"I should also like to accord you the same recognition on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"You said today that you wanted to strengthen the connection between ordinary people and the European Union."
"That is incredibly important, and I believe that your Vice-President, Margot Wallström, has the required talents and ability to communicate."
"I sincerely hope, therefore, that you and the whole of the College will correspondingly give this high priority."
"The European Union’s problem is, however, not just a problem of communication but also one of action."
"For ourselves in the PSE Group and for the party of which I am chairman, it is now very important for you to confirm that your highest priority – as you expressed it within the confines of the European Union – is jobs, jobs and more jobs."
"You have to understand that there is a prevailing uncertainty among people in Europe. They wonder if they will be able to get jobs in the future and what will happen to their children and families."
"Genuine answers can only be given to those questions if the European Union can present a comprehensive strategy that provides jobs, jobs and more jobs."
"If we are to deal with globalisation in a pro-active, rather than defensive, way and if we are to offer a pro-active response during the forthcoming trade negotiations with the United States, China, India and all the developing countries, we must be able to create jobs, jobs and more jobs in Europe."
"I therefore believe that, in the last analysis, it is perhaps the governments that are the most important interlocutors."
"The Lisbon process – which all of us, or many of us in any case, are solidly behind – must be taken seriously by the governments."
"I would appeal to you to make an effort to ensure that, in particular, the responsible ministers in the governments – that is to say, most notably the finance ministers and, of course, the prime ministers – understand that social security and economic growth are not incompatible but are prerequisites of each other."
"It would be of vital importance if you could confirm this in your response."
"They are a gaggle of rejects, failures, has-beens, no-marks, liars, dodgy characters and communists, epitomised by the British Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, who lied on his mortgage application form so that he could live above his means; who was twice dumped from the British Cabinet and who is synonymous in his own country with lies, deceit, evasion and spin. And he and that lot down there are now going to make the laws for my country on immigration, asylum, foreign policy and defence?"
"Oh!"
"I see that the gavel is going down very quickly when I am speaking, Mr President!"
"My country deserves better and it will get better!"
"I notice that the gavel is going down after exactly one minute, and not 30 seconds later, as it has done for everyone else."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with Mr Kilroy-Silk’s comments, and this is not merely because he was until recently a member of the Labour Party in the British Parliament, something which I should like to draw to the attention of some of his critics. Mr Cohn-Bendit recently quoted Mao Zedong in one of his speeches before this House, a leader whose writings you are acquainted with, Mr Barroso."
"I should like to quote Lenin, who taught that it is sometimes necessary to take one step back in order to take two steps forward. You did not heed Lenin’s advice."
"Instead you took two steps back and only one step forward. I remain unconvinced that the Commission’s current line-up is any better than the previous one, yet I understand that we must vote in favour of this Commission, as there has been enough confusion within EU structures."
"I certainly agree this has been the case. Mr Barroso, I would like to say that the members of the Polish political party Self-defence (Samoobrona) will vote in favour of the Commission line-up you have proposed, even though we still have reservations concerning some of the Commissioner-designates nominated."
"We will vote in favour of the Commission, but this is not a vote of confidence for the next five years. We are doing so merely for the purposes of this vote, and we will keep a close eye on your actions."
"Finally, Mr President-elect of the Commission, I should like to say that we are also voting in favour of your Commission because you appear to be an honest person, and there is a lack of honesty in European politics."
"I hope you will remedy this lack."
"Mr President, what are we going to vote on tomorrow?"
"On two things: firstly, and in accordance with Article 214, on a list of Commissioners drawn up by the Council of Ministers of the European Union."
"It could have been better, and it could have been worse."
"I do not believe there is reason for contesting it."
"We are also going to vote, however, on the way in which, in application of Article 217, the President of the Commission has assumed his obligations in terms of organising tasks, and here we clearly see that things have not been done in a satisfactory way."
"They were not done in a satisfactory way to begin with."
"It is absurd to appoint a representative of the Berlusconi government to the freedom portfolio."
"It is absurd to appoint to the competition portfolio someone who, whatever her merits, will not be in a position to exercise her powers in full."
"One point emerges from these two considerations: either Mr Barroso is responsible for these choices, in which case that is a serious matter because he has made bad choices; or he has allowed these choices to be imposed upon him by the governments, which would be even worse."
"Mr Barroso, instead of doing some thorough spring-cleaning when you moved in, you have just brushed some of the problems under the carpet where they will fester until, one day, they reappear and cause problems."
"By putting off problems, you yourself have created obstacles to a successful Commission."
"You should have changed the portfolios of those Commissioners who have financial interests in their allotted areas."
"Ski instructor Frattini has performed a skilful political slalom between the hearings, but he comes a cropper through not having put up a serious fight against collective deportations."
"Mr Dimas inspires confidence, but he appears more interested in industrial policy than the environment."
"If a Viagra-style pill now exists for raising interest in environmental issues, I hope you have a supply ready for him so that the Commission does not end up with an impotent environmental policy."
"Until you have fixed these problems, I must unfortunately vote against the Commission."
"Mr President, between July and November, Mr Durão Barroso has followed a tortuous route strewn with obstacles such as the October crisis, which meant that he had to change the membership of the Commission, thereby demonstrating that pride comes before a fall."
"There remains a major bias towards neoliberal capitalism in this Commission, firstly in view of some of its Members’ known links with large European business groups, and particularly in view of the proposals that they intend to put forward, which will mean that serious issues such as social and economic problems, unemployment, massive social and territorial inequality, poverty and social exclusion will still not be addressed."
"Accordingly, our position is clear and remains as it was in July. We shall vote against – not because we know Mr Durão Barroso and his disastrous policies in Portugal, but because we are fighting for fresh policies to establish jobs with rights, high-quality public services and major commitments towards peace, by which we mean peace throughout the world, including Iraq."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, you have displayed necessary and unavoidable flexibility which will enable you to obtain the majority of the votes of the European Parliament tomorrow."
"Today, you have promised us a genuine partnership, which is imperative because the European Union is facing huge challenges."
"Firstly, the Lisbon strategy needs to be revitalised, as it is clinically dead."
"Secondly, a deeper European Union must be dependent on the implementation of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Thirdly, the current enlargement needs to be consolidated, with the new Member States fully integrated and guaranteed equal treatment and the enlarged European Union made into a coherent whole."
"Finally, Europe needs to be publicised because there is an enormous gulf between Europeans and the European Union."
"For us – that is to say, for the new Member States – equal treatment is crucial."
"We are very well aware that there are no reserves left in terms of financial resources but, like the Hungarian Socialists and the former Portuguese minister, who empathised with the new Member States, we ask you to do what Mrs Fischer Boel promised us during her hearing and find new means and methods more appropriate to specific conditions, for example in the sphere of rural development."
"We wish you and the European governments success in these tasks and hope that you will achieve these common objectives that are necessary for an enlarged European Union."
"Mr Barroso, you persuaded me to vote for you this summer, and, now that the gun smoke is clearing and I can now inspect the battlefield, I have to say that I was right to give you my vote back then. I said at the time that I thought that a President of the Commission had to be a leader and a democrat at the same time."
"If you take their thinking to its logical conclusion, it would follow that a doctor could not be responsible for public health, a former trade union leader could not handle social policy, a woman could not deal with emancipation, and a Green could not head up environmental policy. If ever I need a referee, I prefer to choose someone who can play football."
"Moreover, nobody is bound by so stringent a code of conduct as a Commissioner, and that too is institutional reform. Mr Barroso, your Commission has outstanding ambitions in the field of economic regeneration and the combating of discrimination."
"To sum up, the European Commission, as an institution, has, in fact, been held up in its work of submitting proposals for legislation since last Christmas, and I think it has slept for long enough now."
"President Barroso, get on with waking up Sleeping Beauty and go in to bat."
"Tomorrow, I think, this House will put you in a position to do so."
"Mr President-elect of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in relation to the Commission presented to Parliament, there are several points that I am pleased about. I should like to refer to one in particular."
"That is the choice of seasoned and experienced personalities, as we have seen in the enormous majority of hearings before Parliament, including the hearing that I attended in the Committee on Transport for Commissioner Jacques Barrot."
"I make no secret, however, of the fact, Mr President-designate, that certain issues have yet to be dealt with."
"Mr Barroso, you organised the Azores Summit for President Bush and today, eighteen months after the start of the war, that war has not yet ended."
"We are unfortunately aware of the number of victims it claims every day: I would like to know your views on that matter today."
"The second point that should be considered, and which has just been mentioned, is the reshuffle of the Commission. Reshuffle; that is a fine word, since it has changed little."
"Do you not fear, Mr Barroso, that by appointing as Commissioner for competition a person who, whatever their qualities, which have been highlighted, will be at constant risk of conflicting interests."
"Do you not fear that the decisions that your Commission will have to take in such a sensitive area as competition will be permanently in question?"
"The third and last point, which is particularly close to my heart, is the case of Turkey, and everyone here knows your views on the subject. In our view, Turkey, as we have said many times, should not become a member of the European Union, and there are many reasons for this."
"I will mention just one, however: its accession would put an end to the Community project."
"For several years, Mr Barroso, our group – and I did so myself in November 2002 – has been calling for a privileged partnership between the European Union and Turkey."
"Are you open to that third option, which would resolve the dilemma between accession and exclusion?"
"As you can see, Mr President-designate, certain questions remain and we hope that this debate will serve to reassure us this evening."
"Mr President, Mr Kilroy-Silk's remarks on the Commission were correct, especially so in the case of Mr Mandelson, whose name is a by-word for sleaze in the United Kingdom. Your remarks accusing Mr Kilroy-Silk of slander demonstrate the anti-democratic nature of this Parliament and of all EU institutions if such a further example ..."
"Mr President, I have no intention of taking part in this charade."
"I would simply like to say, Mr President, on a point of order, that I was present on Monday at midday, but that I was not listed in the Minutes. I would like that to be rectified."
"Thank you very much, Mr Toubon."
"We shall verify what you say and make corrections where necessary."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is Question Time, during which we will examine questions to the Council."
"I should like to begin with Question No 1 by Mr Papadimoulis, which deals with the execution of the arrest warrant for Kenan Akin."
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Nicolaï to answer the question on behalf of the Council."
"Does the President-in-Office believe that the national administrations now support European action in a way that they simply did not a year ago? In particular, does he believe that on 1 April, Ireland and the United Kingdom will sign up to a joint approach to tackling these problems?"
"."
"That is rather a new question and one which I regret to say I cannot answer immediately."
"."
"I cannot say much more but I can elaborate a little bit."
"You may have read in the press that an initial discussion on the revision of the common position took place yesterday in one of the competent preparatory bodies of the Council. We will continue this discussion which, among other matters, concerns the celebration of national days in the coming weeks."
"However, I would like to emphasise that all Member States agree on the importance of a broad strategic EU policy vis-à-vis Cuba, based on the common position. This includes a package of measures aimed at intensifying and structuring the contexts with dissidents and civil society as well as with the Cuban authorities."
"I do not have anything to add. I hope my answer was enough to explain the position."
"."
"That is what I tried to explain in my first answer."
"It is really an issue for the Commission."
"However, I understand the remarks."
"In general, the EU presidency tries to enhance relations with the US in various fields, for instance through business dialogue."
"Stimulating mutual understanding for, on the one hand, justified security concerns and, on the other hand, possible trade difficulties will, I hope, lead to practical solutions that achieve the right balance between those different interests."
"Mr President-in-Office, can I take your words to mean that you agree that there are unacceptable delays on the part of the American authorities with regard to European goods imported into the United States?"
"Would you therefore accept that retaliatory measures should perhaps be taken in order to ensure that our exports are properly treated by the American authorities?"
"."
"I hope you will understand that I cannot add to what I have already said, and that this is a matter for the Commission."
"I just think you are here, Madam President, to defend the interests of the Members of this Parliament. It is not worth our while turning up to Question Time if the Minister is not going to respond or try to respond – as he could well do – to our questions."
"I am not going to bother sitting around here listening to these non-answers!"
"If I understand correctly, Mr Purvis, that was a comment and not a point of order."
"I have taken note of it."
"What information does the Council have on the case of Abdelkadar Bouchama, an Algerian citizen who was detained on 18 May 1994, some ten years ago, and has since disappeared?"
"In the light of this case and on the basis of the Association Agreement with Algeria, will the Council take steps to ensure that the Algerian government's human rights commission is at last filled with independent members, including NGO representatives, with a broad mandate?"
"."
"Madam President, we in the Council cannot put forward individual cases in the way that has been suggested."
"I expect the next Ministerial troika with Algeria to be held in 2005 – in other words, next year – and I am sure this will be an opportunity for the European Union and Algeria to discuss the issue of human rights, when these cases will be able to be considered as well."
"Nevertheless, according to the Constitutional Treaty, the environment is an exclusive competence of the European Union. I would like to know the Council’s view on the idea of the European Commission participating in the WTO on behalf of the Union."
"Also, an amendment to the Directive on penalties for marine pollution approved at first reading by the European Parliament proposes that ships with Community flags should be responsible in any part of the world. The Council is opposed to this."
"."
"Thank you for your remark."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of the status of the PSSA, a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area."
"In the IMO framework protection measures for a PSSA can include ship routing measures such as an area to be avoided - an area within defined limits in which either navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and is one which should be avoided by all ships, or certain classes of ships."
"You have not in any way answered my question."
"Will the Council explain how it drew up the list of Burmese state-owned enterprises identified in Council Common Position 2004/730/CFSP(2)?"
"In particular, will the Council explain why Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), Myanmar Timber Enterprise, and Myanmar Post and Telecoms have been left off the list; and why no EU joint venture companies were listed?"
"How does the Council propose to ensure that EU corporate involvement in Burma's important energy sector will be blocked?"
"How it propose to monitor and update its list by including other relevant companies?"
"Does it intend to identify those European companies already involved in contracts or agreements, and does it intend to seek to influence those companies to withdraw from such contracts or agreements once their current contractual obligations so allow?"
"In view of the Commission's statement in response to question H-0339/04(3) does the Council propose to achieve the utmost compliance from Member States with the common position?"
"You cannot inform the House which Member States are opposing the inclusion of these three companies? The Council is either open or it is not."
"Why is it opposing the inclusion of these three companies in the common position and how can these sanctions be effective if they are not including the energy, timber and telecoms sectors?"
"."
"My reaction is the same."
"I cannot tell you what is under discussion in the Council and between Member States."
"Mr President, I have risen to make a personal statement in accordance with Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I was astonished at the accusations levelled at me by the President of the Commission during a debate held yesterday in this House, accusations in which I was not named, but from which it was plain that it was myself they were intended for."
"Mr Barroso said that he had been surprised to hear certain members of a parliamentary group voice sharp criticism of a Commissioner, in this case the Commissioner for competition, when the same group had called strongly for the Commissioner in question to remain in that post. During these comments it was obvious that it was me he had in mind, as he even turned to face us while speaking."
"I should like to note that Mr Watson has formally denied having said anything of the kind."
"He simply pointed out that the letter signed by Mrs Berès had been intended to show that the committee in question and members of this committee who belonged to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe approved the appointment of Mrs Kroes."
"I believe that this is a crucial issue, as what right does the President of the Commission have to challenge not the substance of a Member’s arguments, but his rights and legitimacy?"
"He has spoken of the unique relations that exist between Parliament and the Commission Presidency."
"What gives him the right to restrict a Member’s freedom of action?"
"Is Mr Barroso in charge of inter-group discipline?"
"Is it to be the case, merely because he has held conversations, and conversations he has interpreted wrongly, that the freedom of action of each Member of this House is to be restricted?"
"This is unacceptable, and I should like to ask that Mr Barroso provide a clear explanation of his statements before the vote at noon."
"Mr Bourlanges, I note your personal statement, which will be followed up in the appropriate manner, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the report (A6-0030/2004) by Mr De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for the year 2003."
"Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament for the first time since the historic enlargement of the European Union and to present the European Ombudsman's annual report for 2003."
"I took up my duties as Ombudsman on 1 April 2003, following the retirement of the first Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman."
"This report therefore covers his three final months in office, as well as my first nine months of work."
"I would like to pay tribute to Mr Söderman for his excellent work and many achievements on behalf of European citizens, foremost of which is the establishment of the European Ombudsman as an effective, dynamic and well-respected institution, promoting openness, accountability and good administration."
"I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing Commission for all its constructive work for citizens during its term of office and in particular to thank Vice-President Loyola de Palacio for her collaboration and support."
"I look forward to working with Vice-President-designate Margot Wallström, whom I hope to be meeting soon in her new role."
"The annual report for 2003 records the progress made by the institution of the European Ombudsman in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making itself better known to citizens, including, not least, the efforts to prepare the institution for enlargement and equip it to reach out to citizens in 25 Member States in the 21 Treaty languages."
"In 2003, the total number of complaints received by the European Ombudsman was 2 436, representing a 10% increase on the previous year."
"In almost 70% of cases handled during 2003, help was provided to the complainant by opening an inquiry into the case, transferring it to a competent body or giving concrete advice on where to turn for prompt and effective action."
"As I already indicated when appearing before the Committee on Petitions in April this year, the upward trend in complaints is continuing."
"In the first 10 months of 2004, there has been an unprecedented 54% rise as compared to the same period last year."
"I am confident that this does not reflect worsening administrative behaviour by European institutions, but rather an increased awareness by citizens of how to exercise their rights."
"With the support and encouragement of Members of this House, we have made strenuous efforts in recent years to raise awareness among citizens of their right to complain."
"I am convinced that these efforts have contributed to the increased use that is being made of our services and was heartened to see that Mr De Rossa's excellent report acknowledges these endeavours."
"In 2003, 180 decisions closing cases following inquiries were made."
"In 47% of cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration."
"Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of an explanation from the institutional body concerned."
"In 28% of cases, the inquiry resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the full satisfaction of the complainant, or in a friendly solution."
"When a friendly solution was not possible, the case was closed with a critical remark or a draft recommendation was made."
"Nine new draft recommendations were made during 2003, including one that led the Council to come into line with Parliament and the Commission by giving candidates in recruitment competitions access to their own marked examination scripts."
"If an institutional body fails to cooperate, I can put the matter before this House in a special report."
"I am happy to state that I saw no need to make such a special report concerning any of the cases closed during 2003."
"Five new own-initiative investigations were launched in 2003, including an inquiry concerning the integration of persons with disabilities, particularly as regards measures to ensure that they are not discriminated against in their relations with the Commission."
"Two own-initiative inquiries were closed with positive results during the year."
"One of these led the Commission to change its tender procedures by allowing unsuccessful bidders time to challenge contract award decisions."
"Most of these successes could not have been achieved without the active cooperation of other institutions in answering complaints rapidly, fully and correctly."
"The 2003 report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to the Ombudsman's proposals and recommendations."
"When I address Members and officials of the European Union institutions and bodies in person, as I did eight times in 2003, I am keen to underline the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints."
"I would like to think that the Ombudsman can be seen as a valuable source of information for all institutions that wish to improve the quality of their administration."
"The ultimate goal for all of us must be to provide the best possible service to the citizen."
"Ombudsman institutions and similar bodies now exist at national level throughout the European Union, including all the new Member States."
"The sole exception is Italy. Cooperation with these institutions and with their regional equivalents plays a vital role in improving the service to citizens through the exchange of information and experiences, the transfer of complaints between the European, national and regional levels and the provision of information to citizens about their rights under European law and about how to exercise and defend those rights."
"The network of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and national and regional Ombudsmen throughout Europe, which comprises some 90 offices in 30 countries, was strengthened and intensified in 2003 with four high-level meetings in Athens, Valencia, Warsaw and Strasbourg."
"Such cooperation is reinforced through regular communication initiatives by the European Ombudsman."
"When I took office in April 2003, I committed myself to reaching out to citizens in every Member State, to inform them about the work of the European Ombudsman."
"I therefore visited many Member States in 2003 and by 1 May 2004 had visited all ten accession countries."
"I met national and regional Ombudsmen, high government officials and members of the judiciary and presented my work to non-governmental organisations, chambers of commerce, universities, the press and EU representatives."
"The regular Eurobarometer surveys suggest that these visits are effective in promoting awareness of the European Ombudsman, which often increases after a visit."
"Hits on the Ombudsman's website tend to confirm this."
"The sharp rise in the number of complaints and, indeed, the number of admissible complaints further bears this out."
"These information visits are complementary to the regular press and communication activities of the European Ombudsman which, in 2003, included over 80 speeches by the Ombudsman and the staff of the institution and a press release on average every nine working days."
"Given the increased workload for the institution in terms of complaint handling, communications activities and liaison with national and regional Ombudsmen in the enlarged Europe, I proposed an increase in resources for the institution in the 2005 budget."
"I am grateful to Parliament for having responded positively to that call, thereby allowing me to continue to serve citizens effectively."
"I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Petitions for their support and constructive proposals, as set out in Mr De Rossa's report, and to put on record my appreciation of the work and positive contribution of that committee in the previous Parliament and of its then chairman, Mr Gemelli."
"Many of the issues identified in this report will have to be addressed by the institutions, including, not least, access to documents, the infringement procedure and the Ombudsman's Statute."
"However, let me react to some issues that are of direct concern to me as Ombudsman."
"Firstly, we should not underestimate the importance of transparency in winning the trust of citizens."
"As the De Rossa report rightly points out, there is still room for improvement, as evidenced by the fact that the lack or refusal of information still accounts for the greatest proportion of admissible complaints to my office."
"Only last week, in response to a complaint from a Member of this House, I called on the Council to review its refusal to decide to meet publicly whenever it is acting in its legislative capacity."
"The Constitution for Europe provides for the Council to meet in public when considering and voting on a draft legislative act, but surely citizens should not have to wait until the Constitution enters into force for this basic advance in openness."
"I firmly believe that deliberating behind closed doors on issues that affect the daily lives of our citizens is something we cannot reasonably defend, especially now when all Member States have solemnly signed the text of the Constitution."
"I was delighted to see that the De Rossa report emphasised the importance of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which elaborates on crucial elements of openness such as providing reasons for decisions and being service-minded and accessible in relations with the public."
"I too regret that the Code is not yet fully applied by all the institutions and bodies, but expect the incoming Commission to build upon the commitments of Mrs de Palacio and begin working promptly towards a European administrative law, as envisaged in the Constitution for Europe."
"Secondly, on the Ombudsman's Statute, in order to maintain confidence in the institution, the Ombudsman must be able to investigate the complaints that citizens entrust to him as thoroughly and as rigorously as possible."
"During this legislature, I very much hope to have the opportunity to revisit the issue of the Statute, notably on the questions raised by the rapporteur regarding the Ombudsman's access to documents and the hearing of witnesses."
"Thirdly and lastly, on enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Petitions, this is something that I am eager to develop."
"In direct response to the suggestion in the De Rossa report, I see only advantages in the committee becoming a fully integrated member of the European network of Ombudsmen and similar bodies."
"This network has proved a vital tool in terms of effective complaint handling and exchange of best practice."
"We will continue to strengthen the network, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that the rights provided for under EU law become a daily reality for citizens."
"I would therefore be delighted if the committee were to become fully engaged in this initiative."
"With Parliament's agreement, I will see to it that my office makes the practical arrangements to implement this proposal in the very near future."
"Next year the European Ombudsman will be celebrating its first ten years of existence."
"It is my sincere belief that the relationships of goodwill, trust and understanding that have been built up over this period provide an excellent basis for further improving the quality of administration, to the benefit of citizens."
"The European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions are vital partners for the European Ombudsman in this regard."
"I look forward to ever stronger cooperation between our institutions in the future and I thank you very much for your attention."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that having become accustomed to compressing my thoughts into 60 seconds, it is something of a luxury to have five minutes to expound upon any issue."
"I would like to thank the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the report."
"I would also like to thank him for the excellent job he has done since his appointment."
"He has confirmed the confidence that this Parliament placed in him on his appointment in April 2003."
"In my view, he has more than justified that confidence."
"I would also like to pay tribute to the former Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, who undertook groundbreaking work in establishing the Ombudsman's office."
"Mr Diamandouros has engaged in an astonishing level of activity, not only in dealing with the thousands of complaints he has received, but in preparing his office for enlargement and in visiting almost all of the Member States, including all ten new Member States."
"One of the most striking statistics in his report – apart from the ever rising number of complaints, which the Ombudsman quite rightly points out is not necessarily a feature of deteriorating administration – is the fact that 75% of the complaints received by the Ombudsman's office did not in fact relate to his mandate."
"That is not necessarily a bad thing, because it clearly indicates that the citizens see the Ombudsman's office as a port of call for problems they have with European institutions."
"The Ombudsman very correctly ensures that all of those complaints are redirected to those bodies which can provide some redress for citizens, whether that is the Petitions Committee, the national Ombudsman offices, or other national institutions."
"The role of the Ombudsman's office clearly is to ensure that there is good administration by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The important role that the Petitions Committee plays is of course at the other side of that equation, where we seek to ensure that national governments and local authorities comply with European law in the interests of the citizen."
"The report that we are dealing with today identifies a number of key reforms which in the view of the Petitions Committee need to be carried out if we are to ensure the democratic functioning of the European Union."
"Openness, transparency and accountability are key building blocks to building a European demos."
"We argue therefore that there is now a need, in the light of ten years' experience of the Ombudsman's office, to review its statute."
"This need is also a result of the establishment of OLAF and indeed the fact that, quite shortly, we are hopefully going to ratify a constitution which contains a charter of citizens' rights and which will clearly enhance the role of the citizen in Europe."
"The review must be undertaken by the European Parliament in cooperation with the Ombudsman's office and I hope that we can get review under way quite soon."
"The Commission also needs to amend its procedures to allow parliamentary scrutiny and investigation by the Ombudsman of the infringement procedures."
"We are currently denied the right to scrutinise those procedures, which I believe is improper."
"The Council, in my view, must now accept Parliament's amendments to the Ombudsman's statute on access to documents, as the Ombudsman pointed out."
"This Parliament, through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Almeida Garrett report, pointed out that there was a need to amend that statute, because at the moment, Article 3(2) imposes restrictions in terms of the Ombudsman's investigative powers and, as it is currently worded, denies access to documents which can be refused on duly substantiated grounds of secrecy and accuracy."
"Access to documents from a Member State that are classified as secret may be granted only where that Member State has given its prior agreement."
"In addition, employees of the institutions called on to testify must speak 'in accordance with the instructions from their administrations and shall continue to be bound by their duty of professional secrecy'."
"This is not an acceptable situation in this day and age."
"The Ombudsman, in whom Parliament and the other institutions have put their confidence, does not have access to documents and is denied access in this way."
"Finally, I would also like to urge the Commission – pending the adoption of a legally binding code of good administration for all three institutions, which is provided for in the new constitution – to now buy into the voluntary common code which the Council and the Parliament are already applying."
"It would be right and proper that they should do that."
"I have one final brief remark to make."
"This Parliament needs to review the manner in which the Council deals with Question Time in this House."
"I sat in on Question Time yesterday and the President-in-Office refused to answer virtually every single supplementary question put to him."
"I believe this to be contempt for Parliament and I intend to make a formal complaint, but I also believe we need to review how we deal with this."
"We either have a real Question Time where the Council is held to account in this Parliament, or we abandon Question Time entirely."
"Mr President, Mr De Rossa, the Commission has read the report on the activities of the Ombudsman for the year 2003 with great interest."
"As you are aware, this debate comes at a critical time, when the new parliamentary term has just begun and the procedure for appointing the future European Ombudsman is underway."
"During last year’s debate on the report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2002, the Commission took the opportunity to congratulate the first European Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, on the role he had played in establishing a European ombudsman system, and I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros, his successor, for the excellent work he has carried out."
"Mr Diamandouros took up his post in April 2003, and has improved the efficiency of the institution he represents in promoting good public administration and respect for the rule of law and human rights."
"The contribution he has made has been an invaluable one, both for the Commission and for the European public as a whole."
"The Commission believes that the stepping up of contacts with national and regional authorities which act as mediators between citizens and public administrations in the Member States has made it possible to heighten the role of the European Ombudsman and bring the institution to the attention of the European public, something which the Ombudsman has highlighted."
"This is of paramount importance, as institutions which no one knows about will not be used, and their value will not be demonstrated."
"Both the Commission and the Ombudsman have taken note of the increase in the number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman, and the Commission believes that this increase will continue as the effects of enlargement become apparent."
"Furthermore, I agree entirely with the Ombudsman’s comments to the effect that an increase in the number of complaints does not mean that the situation on the ground is lacking in any way; it simply means that citizens are gaining an ever greater awareness of their rights, and this can only be a good thing."
"With regard to the handling of cases, the Commission is delighted that in many instances the European authorities have taken measures which are likely to lead to a solution."
"As far as amendments to the Statute of the European Ombudsman are concerned, it is now up to Parliament to take the initiative and to take a majority decision, with the approval of the Council, as the Commission’s role will merely be to give an opinion."
"You can however be sure, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission will examine any new initiative carefully and with an open mind."
"The Commission did not wish to act hastily with regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which will be binding upon all EU institutions and bodies."
"The inspiration for the Commission’s Code, which entered into force in November 2000, mainly came from proposals put forward by the Ombudsman."
"The first implementation report only covers the year 2001, and so we do not yet have the hindsight needed to put forward a proposal on an interinstitutional code."
"We will therefore continue to work on the basis of more thorough information to ascertain whether this Code needs amending, and, if so, how it should be amended."
"The Commission concurs with Parliament’s proposals relating to EPSO, the interinstitutional body which was recently established to draw up reserve lists from among the best candidates in open competitions in line with the needs indicated by each institution."
"Selection procedures must respect the rules and practices relating to transparency and openness which have been established over time, thanks in particular to the Ombudsman’s activities."
"The Commission supports Parliament’s call to the EU institutions and bodies to apply the Regulation regarding public access to documents."
"The Commission would like to point out that Regulation 1049/2001 will in future also apply to EU agencies, which should make it easier to resolve various complaints."
"With regard to access to documents relating to infringement procedures, what matters is that the Commission has the room for manoeuvre it needs to conduct its enquiries independently."
"A balance must be found between the principle of transparency and the confidentiality necessary for dialogue between the Commission and the Member States."
"The Commission’s practices comply with the case-law of the Court of First Instance."
"The Commission has revised its working practices for infringement procedures which have been closed, and documents are frequently made available on the basis of a case-by-case analysis."
"So, Mr De Rossa, Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is what the Commission has to say for the time being in response to the report that has been put forward."
"The Commission would also like to extend its sincere thanks, on its own behalf and on behalf of all citizens, to the Committee on Petitions for its excellent work."
"I should like to take this opportunity to remind the chairman of this committee that I myself held this office 15 years ago."
"The Committee on Petitions is making a tremendous contribution to citizenship."
"– Mr President, the 2003 annual report submitted by the European Ombudsman to the President of the European Parliament and presented to the Committee on Petitions deserves to be approved by all of us in keeping both with Mr De Rossa's report and the relevant resolution."
"However, our duties do not end with approving the annual report."
"We all need to take note of its basic conclusions and bear them in mind for further action."
"We need to take account of the information given and to call for the lack of open character and absence of transparency in the operation of the European institutions to be addressed."
"The fact that 75% of complaints do not come within the scope of the European Ombudsman does not reflect badly on the institution, because these complaints were referred to other agencies."
"However, what is important for us is the analysis of the 25% of complaints accepted, two-thirds of which relate to the European Commission, in other words, the Community institution which takes decisions which impact on citizens."
"Complaints were, of course, also made about the European Parliament and the Council, but for services such as the Personnel Selection Office."
"One might, however, say that, even if we take account of the 40% increase in the number of complaints which Mr Diamandouros announced in 2004, few of the 425 million European citizens took recourse to the European Ombudsman, an institution which has already been up and running for ten years and which has been served with acknowledged success and strengthened by the presence of both the first Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, and his current successor, Nikiforos Diamandouros."
"As the elected representatives of European citizens, however, we cannot permit that even one citizen should not enjoy the provisions of Articles 41, 42 and 43 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which now forms part of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, as approved by the Council."
"It may not recognise extrajudicial remedies, but if, in accordance with Article 1(2) of the new Constitution, decisions must be taken both as openly and closely to citizens as possible, the role of the European Ombudsman and of the administrative Commissioners is a guarantee of honest administration, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Nor must we forget that our obligations to reinforce the efficiency of the institution must be implemented and we welcome the Commissioner's statements."
"Finally, I would emphasise that it is to the credit of the European Ombudsman that he is conducting five own initiative investigations, the most exemplary being into the abolition of discrimination against the disabled on the part of European institutions."
"As vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I should also like to express thanks for the proper and mutual transmission of cases, for the benefit of European citizens."
". We would like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on his outstanding report, which accomplishment was certainly the outcome of hard work."
"We would also like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his outstanding speech in which he outlined his activity as European Ombudsman."
"To the socialists the most important thing is to reinforce the quality of democracy by placing the citizen in the centre of our work."
"Most of our goals were echoed in both Mr Diamandouros’ and Mr De Rossa’s report; however, there are lots of areas to be further improved in order to provide the best possible service to citizens."
"First of all, we call upon institutions to act as if the Constitutional Treaty were in force, especially with regard to the Council."
"When acting as a legislative body, they should do so in a public and transparent manner."
"I especially welcomed the Ombudsman’s recommendation in this field."
"The strengthening of European democracy is not possible without openness and transparency and it is unfortunate that there is still no transparency and that the Council continues to act behind closed doors."
"Secondly, we support the work of the European Fundamental Rights Agency."
"As you know, the committee has just recently published a discussion document."
"I sincerely hope that the committee will thoroughly and comprehensively consult those who are involved in the representation and protection of citizenship rights, namely the Committee on Petitions of this House and the European Ombudsman."
"The institution of the Ombudsman will be ten years old next year, and therefore it would be timely to review the reform of the Ombudsman’s status."
"Let us define the areas in which the institution of the European Ombudsman can be strengthened, for instance in the area of accessibility to documents."
"Finally, I would like to welcome Mr Diamandouros’ commitment, with which he deepened mutual cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and his liaison network."
"I am grateful for his help with our information campaign, which aims to familiarise citizens with the rights granted to them by the Constitutional Treaty and to make known to them their right to petition Parliament and lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman."
"Mr President, dear colleagues, I would like to conclude my remarks by pointing out to you, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out so many times, that the only way citizens will trust and believe in the Union is if their rights become part of their daily reality."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on his successful and comprehensive report."
"The Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has improved the definition of the content of European citizenship, which had already been introduced by the Maastricht Treaty."
"The protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens has thus made progress, in an improvement of relations between the Union and its citizens."
"Even though they enjoy rights and are subject to Community rules relating to their activities, citizens today have few options for defending themselves against any cases of maladministration, and there is thus an ever more urgent need to guarantee civil coexistence in the best possible way and to come up with practical responses to society’s needs."
"The Ombudsman’s task is to put forward appropriate solutions and to assert the fundamental rights and safeguards of the individual."
"The institution of the Ombudsman is the most obvious expression of that sovereignty which is rooted in the people, and which acts in defence of individual rights against the institutions, from which citizens ask to be protected."
"At heart, the European Ombudsman and the whole system of European local ombudsmen offer every citizen the opportunity to refer to them and, if necessary, to make use of their services, to make the European institutions more transparent and efficient, and to contribute to the Union’s enlargement to include other applicant countries, while fostering the development of a culture of protecting citizenship rights."
"The European Ombudsman is, therefore, the port of call for any citizen who feels his or her rights have been violated: he may investigate and put forward solutions in cases of maladministration by the Community institutions and, if the conciliation solutions he suggests fail, he may make recommendations or refer the issue to the European Parliament."
"According to the annual report which our Ombudsman has presented to us, to date he has been busy – and in this he has also been effectively aided by the network of European national and local ombudsmen – with a huge range of issues: tax provisions, project funding, rules on competition, discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, health, income or other reasons, late payments, contractual disputes, arbitrary discrimination, lack of transparency or the refusal of various EU institutions to provide access to information."
"The importance of his timely and impartial actions is therefore obvious to all."
"His office, introduced into the Community system by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, now mainly operates within the area of defending citizens faced with a jungle of regulations and orders, which are already extensive within individual countries, and which will become ever more complex as a more complete supranational legal system is built."
"For this reason the European Parliament, in thanking the Ombudsman, ought to undertake to highlight the importance of his office, as well as the Committee on Petitions itself, which is its operational arm for analysis, monitoring and making proposals, so as to foster the process of democratisation and social cohesion."
"With the work of the European Ombudsman, assisted by the Commission and its technical systems, it is now possible to better consolidate the concept of European citizenship, to publicise and promote a culture of defence of the people in Europe, moving from a model of bureaucracy which weighs upon the EU institutions to one of defence of the people, and above all of power to the people – in other words, democracy in action."
"In the light of this qualitative leap, I approve in organisational terms of the report which was presented to us today."
"In this way we will be able to continue to reinforce the system protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the principles of cooperation and subsidiarity, in such a way that European citizens truly become masters, and not merely an electorate that is called upon to vote."
". Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, on having produced such a sensible report and on his willingness to defend the amendments we have proposed to the Commission, sometimes by means of compromises."
"The report on the European Ombudsman offers a very clear picture of the type of problems facing the citizens when dealing with European administration."
"Amongst other things, the report notes that, despite the work done, in particular by the European Ombudsman and his team, the citizens are still experiencing problems obtaining information and documents from the institutions."
"It is also necessary to do considerably more work to ensure that the process for selecting civil servants is more transparent and more based on merit."
"This report also shows us that, if we want to ensure that the European Union is more accepted by the citizens, and that the citizens comply with the laws laid down by the Union, it is essential not to give the impression that some people are above the law."
"This does not just affect the European institutions, but also the Member States, since they participate in the development of Europe via the Council and they are equally responsible for applying European legislation."
"In this regard, we have presented amendments stressing the need to take account of the Commission’s future role as guardian of the Treaties, particularly at this time, with the European Constitution about to be ratified."
"While we are all aware that the mandate of the European Ombudsman only applies, amongst other things, to the European institutions, his office plays an important role in terms of monitoring the correct application of Community legislation."
"I would therefore urge the European Ombudsman, in cooperation with Parliament and its Committee on Petitions, as well as the European Commission, to establish the necessary criteria to clarify when an infringement procedure should be opened and the principles on which those measures will be based."
"Finally, I would like to refer to the amendments I have presented concerning the need to establish a general system of non-judicial measures, in order to give the citizens more power."
"This amendment is based, once again, on the fact that the role of the European Ombudsman is to give the citizens the opportunity to express their views on issues that affect them."
"I welcome both the European Ombudsman's report and that of the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, and congratulate them on their work."
"Sinn Fein is committed to an EU that is accessible to the people."
"We support measures that make the work of the EU more transparent, accountable, efficient and effective."
"The citizens of the European Union demand and deserve institutions that deal with their concerns and complaints in a professional and open manner, and which are prepared to admit their failures and bring about adequate redress."
"However, as the rapporteur makes clear in his report, a number of bodies, including the European Commission, have not adhered to recommendations and regulations on access to public documents."
"It is both regrettable and unacceptable that a number of institutions did not give full disclosure of documents to the Ombudsman's office."
"I want to reinforce the recommendation in the rapporteur's report that the Ombudsman should have unlimited access to documents in connection with any inquiries."
"The work of the EU Ombudsman brings into focus the wider debate on accountability – or, more accurately, the lack of accountability – within the European Union."
"As welcome and as necessary as the work of the EU Ombudsman is, that office is not a panacea for the European Union's democratic deficit."
"Let us be realistic and clear."
"Transparency, accountability and trust will not be secured through the effective operation of the EU Ombudsman's office alone."
"Significant political change is required."
"We must seriously go about the job of democratising the European Union."
"We must create an EU that complements the role of the Member State, not one that undermines it."
"We need an EU that allows local and regional democracy to flourish and which respects the sovereignty of Member States and their people."
"Without this reorientation the Ombudsman's role, however worthy, can only be overwhelmed by our democratic deficit."
". Mr President, I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his report, as well as the Ombudsman."
"Given the situation, aren't we lucky to have Mr Diamandouros!"
"Please consider first, however, the situation that gives rise to an Ombudsman: a fundamental shift from real democracy to process democracy."
"It is a shift of power from the people to the bureaucrats, creating not a democracy, but a democracy-flavoured bureaucracy."
"In a real democracy there is no need for an Ombudsman."
"People speak for themselves, directly through their votes and through local participation."
"If their representatives do not reflect their will, they are replaced."
"Do the people know that they have lost their power?"
"They certainly have not been told."
"If a vote were a unit of currency and real power was an item in a shop, it would be interesting to compare our buying power now to that we enjoyed 20 years ago or 20 years before that."
"I believe we would find that there has been a cheapening of democracy."
"At some level people know that their democratic currency has been devalued."
"A growing awareness is mirrored in the chronically low election polls in European elections."
"In view of this democratic deficit, I must be thankful that we have an Ombudsman to fight our corner – a corner that, in a democracy, we should be able to fight ourselves."
"I am even more thankful that given the endless, faceless bureaucracy that people have to deal with in our process democracy, we have, as this report points out, a well-intentioned Ombudsman."
"In the meantime, even as I direct constituents to the Ombudsman, I will continue to insist on a return of power to the people, which will lead to a real democracy."
". Mr President, Mr Ombudsman, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor not only on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, but also as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions."
"Extremely close cooperation exists between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, as both these institutions deal directly with citizens’ concerns, as well as contacting citizens directly and being directly contacted by citizens."
"Nowadays, it is often said that EU institutions are removed from the life of citizens."
"When the public feels that it has no connection with what is happening in the European Union, the office of Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are institutions to which all citizens can turn with their concerns and be sure that these concerns will be dealt with, or at least that they will receive a satisfactory explanation."
"Citizens’ problems are of paramount importance, and the roles played by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are therefore also of great significance."
"We cooperate very closely with the Ombudsman, and believe he does a very good job."
"As well as cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, cooperation also exists with this House in the case of extremely important matters, including those which Parliament examines on the initiative of the Ombudsman and those upon which the Committee on Petitions has given an opinion."
"It has now become abundantly clear that the role played by the Ombudsman, an institution set up in opposition, so to speak, to the other institutions, is a fundamental one."
"Today we are examining the report for the year 2003, upon which Mr De Rossa has spoken on behalf of our committee."
"We have a very high opinion of the Ombudsman’s work."
"I should merely like to add that, for obvious reasons, the institution of ombudsman never used to exist in Communist countries."
"It was only as Communism declined, in its final days, that the post of ombudsman was created in Poland."
"This post is gaining greater authority in my homeland with every parliamentary term."
"It was also a pleasure for me to hear that Mrs Reding, the Commission representative, once held the post that it is my privilege to hold today."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"I am the mayor of a small town just outside Rome and, in the course of my administrative duties, I have had occasion to remark on the importance of the role of the ombudsman, as an interface and filter between the administration and citizens."
"Although he operates in a different context, the European Ombudsman must – or ought to – be a modern, effective and efficient point of contact between the Community institutions and Europeans, bringing us closer to making a reality of every citizen’s fundamental right to sound administration conducted by means of transparent and fair criteria, as enshrined in the Nice Charter."
"I welcome the course that has been embarked upon, of instituting a network of ombudsmen and other national and local bodies to which the complaints may be referred where the Ombudsman does not have jurisdiction."
"Efforts to create a complete and useful system of extra-judicial resources for European citizens should be stepped up."
"Additionally, following these first months of work as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I must nevertheless say that, as demonstrated by the data in the report we are debating, excellently drafted by Mr De Rossa, there is still considerable disinformation and confusion over the precise areas of competence of the European Ombudsman."
"Even though in 2003 work progressed in due fashion, in accordance with the procedures, it is important to make a significant change in the way that individual European citizens perceive the Ombudsman by bringing his office, which up to now has been too remote, closer to daily life."
"The hoped-for review of the Ombudsman’s statute ought to focus on this aspect to increase the real, concrete chances of finding solutions to the problems submitted to him."
"We need a European Ombudsman who can become a genuine link between the Community, the and the institutions which govern it."
"Mr President, I wish to place on record my thanks and those of Parliament first and foremost to Roy Perry, my predecessor, who did so much to enhance the role of the Committee on Petitions, of which the Ombudsman's role is such an important feature."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr De Rossa on a cogent report, and join him in thanking Mr Söderman for his services as Ombudsman and Mr Diamandouros for his time served to date."
"I wish to make five quick points."
"One, the Commission should reconsider its antipathy to a more open and effective control of Member States, particularly in regard to the implementation of Community law on public access to documents relating to the infringement procedure."
"Two, the Code of Administrative Behaviour should be observed by all the EU's institutions and bodies, not excluding the Commission itself."
"My Group will press this cause until it is achieved."
"Three, my Group is wholly in support of an increase and improvement in the Ombudsman's investigative powers."
"Four, we have heard that 75% of the complaints are declared inadmissible."
"We must have a continuing education campaign throughout the European Union to improve the awareness of the Ombudsman and indeed the petitions procedure amongst our citizens."
"Five, finally I would urge the Commission and the Council to insist on – indeed to demand – firm deadlines by which responses to the Ombudsman, the Committee on Petitions and, above all, to the petitioners or complainants, are made."
"As a school report might say, all in all, so far so good."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros and the rapporteur on their work."
"I should now like to turn to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"Contrary to criticism, the regulation on public access to documents works quite well."
"I urge the Commission to accept our demand for a revision of that regulation, especially in respect of the new Constitution."
"If the Council is to meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity, we need a definition of a 'legislative capacity'."
"I should like to mention Mrs Sinnott's remarks."
"It seems she has left the Chamber, but she indicated that the Ombudsman is a manifestation of an undemocratic process."
"Is she stating that the Scandinavian countries with an ombudsman enshrined in their constitutions are undemocratic?"
"If that is what she means to say, then she should apologise."
"I should also like to say to another honourable Member, who I believe is a member of UKIP – she must be sleeping! – that the role of an ombudsman reinvigorates and reinforces the democratic process."
"It is a part of the appeal process and it is about recourse to natural justice."
"With regard to the infringement proceedings, I do not share the opinion that the infringement proceeding process is being abused by the Commission."
"The infringement process often leads to a judicial process."
"To make such documents public before a decision to go to the courts is made is to undermine either side in that legal process."
"I thank Mr Diamandouros and the House for listening so politely."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the biggest majority at the European elections last June was won by the abstainers."
"European citizens would all agree that they sent a clear message in every direction."
"They do not feel that Europe expresses their views, concerns them or protects them on a daily basis."
"In particular young people, women and socially excluded groups of citizens in general ascribe the disdain which they experience on a daily basis to the policy of the European Union."
"Nonetheless, compared with this more general trend, we see that European citizens' confidence in the institution of the European Ombudsman has risen astronomically."
"As the statistics show, complaints by European citizens this year alone are expected to increase by 40%."
"If we interpret these statistics, apart from confirming that the institution was worthily represented both by Mr Söderman and by my compatriot, Mr Diamandouros, we find that European citizens are rewarding an institution which satisfies the obvious for them, by which I mean access to the institutions of the European Union."
"However, what is needed in order for the institutions to function better and be considered worthy, apart from the personalities which represent them, is for them to be strengthened."
"We often speak of the democratic deficit, of the lack of transparency or political will in a way which automatically forces my generation to classify them using political ."
"So let us therefore simply stop stating the problems and let us look for feasible solutions, solutions in deed, not in word, while at the same time supporting the institutions."
"It is, of course, a fact that the new Constitution safeguards the institution of the Ombudsman and promotes, perhaps not perfectly, but certainly better than today, transparency and democratic participation in the Union."
"If we support both, perhaps at the next elections we shall be surprised, this time pleasantly."
"Perhaps we shall start to regain the confidence of the citizens and convince them to participate more in the common ventures of Europe."
"Europe is changing."
"That was the slogan of the last European elections."
"Personally, I am convinced."
"However, it is up to all of us to change in a positive direction."
"Mr President, where there are systems there will be failures, and despite the comments by Kathy Sinnott, we have a very effective Office of the Ombudsman in Ireland and we are a democracy, so both go hand in hand."
"I note that 2,500 complaints were received by your Office in 2003."
"In my view that is very low."
"In Ireland roughly the same number of complaints are made annually, and we are rather small compared to the EU."
"I also note, however, that there was a 40% increase in the number of complaints over the year in question."
"I suppose that is because of the work you have done in making your office more familiar to the public."
"I do not think it is because the EU institutions work better than Member State institutions."
"All institutions suffer from the problem of protecting themselves rather than looking after the public."
"I know that many of the complaints you receive do not fall within your remit, but this serves yet again to prove the point that citizens simply do not know where to turn when they run into administrative and other difficulties."
"As a newly elected MEP I too have difficulties with this Institution, so I share the problems that the citizens have."
"I would like to say that, in general, a more client-focused approach by all of the institutions would make you redundant, though I do not think that will happen in the near future."
"At national level, at least in Ireland, the Office of the Ombudsman has been a very positive force for change."
"It has changed the system and the culture, and I believe that your office should be a similar force for change, not just a problem-solving office for the individual but one that can change the system for all citizens and for the better."
"I wish you well in your work."
"Mr President, in 2003 the European Ombudsman dealt with 363 inquiries."
"Of the 2 436 complaints received, 250 of those inquiries were initiated in 2003 and 110 were inquiries which were not closed at the end of December 2002."
"I would like to make two observations about these figures."
"Firstly, on the face of it this seems a very small number of inquiries compared with the complaints received and begs the question, even if the EU citizen knows that the European Ombudsman exists, does he or she know what he know what he actually does?"
"It may upset the consensus here this morning, and I do not mean any offence by this, but could many of the new Members of this Parliament even name the Ombudsman?"
"I doubt very much that they could."
"I would like to point out that 66.9% of those inquiries related to the European Commission – so much for the Commission as guardian of the Treaties."
"However, for fear that we will become complacent in this House, 10.7% of the inquiries referred to the European Parliament, the second highest number."
"Secondly, while the 10% increase in complaints to the Ombudsman is not to be welcomed, we should recognise and interpret these figures within the context of the efforts that the office has made to increase its profile."
"However, could the 54% increase announced today by the Ombudsman be connected to the fact that a lot of Members of the European Parliament were in election mode and generating publicity?"
"I note what has been said about EPSO and I would urge that greater efforts be made to remove the difficulties which exist there."
"In conclusion I would like to reiterate the importance of the many roles of the Ombudsman and to wish him well in his duties."
". Mr President, I very much appreciate the willingness of the House to listen to my concluding remarks."
"I will be very brief."
"I wish to thank all the Members of the House who honoured me with their remarks for the constructive nature of those remarks."
"I wish to thank Mrs Reding for her comments and to point out that, as 13 years ago she was chairman of the Committee on Petitions, she has the experience needed to appreciate the kind of work done by that committee and by the Office of the Ombudsman."
"I wish to thank Mr Libicki, chairman of the Committee on Petitions, for his comments, and to assure him that I look forward to working closely with him in promoting the joint and common goals of the Ombudsman in that committee."
"I will not answer all the comments individually, but would like to make some general points."
"I would urge the Commission to revisit the issue of the Code."
"The Commissioner might have been too modest in saying that she does not have the information at the moment to be able to assess the possibility of moving forward."
"To the extent that this is possible, I assure her that I am at her and the Commission's disposal to help move this issue forward for the benefit of all citizens."
"Access to documents, transparency and the promotion of non-judicial means are, and will remain, at the top of my priorities."
"Let me conclude by making three remarks."
"In addition to the 54% increase in complaints this year, we have also experienced a 62% increase in admissible complaints."
"This suggests that more and more people are coming to us for the right reasons."
"That suggests, in turn, that we have been successful in informing people of how to proceed correctly and about what we can do for them."
"My second point concerns the fact that 70% of the complaints were made against the Commission."
"This clearly does not suggest that the Commission is working worse."
"It simply reflects the fact that it is with the Commission that the vast majority of citizens have dealings."
"It is inevitable that the majority of complaints made will be against the Commission."
"The degree of resolution and cooperation we receive from the Commission is high."
"I will keep on top of this situation, and remain very conscious of the need for me to act as a control mechanism in respect of the institutions, including the Commission."
"Lastly, I want to go on record again in thanking Mr De Rossa for his report, thanking the Committee on Petitions and thanking this House for its support."
"I remain committed to serving the citizens with your cooperation and support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"I would like to welcome the delegation of the Swiss Federal Assembly, chaired by Mr David Eugen."
"The delegations from Switzerland and from the European Parliament are holding their twenty-third inter-parliamentary meeting today in Strasbourg."
"I would like to stress the important role played by the inter-parliamentary meetings between Switzerland and the European Union in terms of promoting cooperation and mutual understanding between our citizens."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I wish them a fruitful and productive meeting."
"I would also like to welcome the Delegation of the Parliament of Azerbaijan, headed by Mr Siruz Tebrizli, Chairman of that Parliament’s Committee on Human Rights and head of Azerbaijan’s delegation in the Parliamentary Committee on EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation."
"That delegation is here for its annual meeting with the delegation of the European Parliament."
"I wish them a happy stay in Strasbourg."
"(1)"
". Mr President, I believe that we share a common ambition: a strong and independent Commission that can drive Europe forward with this Parliament and with all those who have that same vision."
"I take note of the resolution on which you have just voted."
"I look forward to examining it closely."
"However, my first impression is that it can provide a good basis for us to reach agreement on how we will work together over the next five years."
"These arrangements should be formalised through an early updating of the framework agreement adopted in 1999, to guide the cooperation between our two institutions."
"I would only ask that our agreed approach takes account of our respective roles and obligations and the European Union Treaty."
"Before dealing with detailed points set out in point 5 of your resolution, let me reconfirm that I stand by my commitments regarding the creation of a Commissioners' Group on Fundamental Rights and new proposals in this important area."
"Turning to the specific issues in point 5, let me give a first response."
"With regard to points 5 (a), (b) and (c), as I indicated yesterday, I have sought and received a commitment from my team that the Commissioners will resign if I ask them to do so."
"I will examine very seriously any criticism expressed by this Parliament regarding the performance of Commissioners."
"I stand ready to explain to Parliament the conclusions that I draw."
"In this way we are affirming the principle of individual responsibility of every Commissioner, without calling into question the principle of collegiality for which, under the Treaty, the President of the Commission is guarantor."
"With regard to the replacement of Commissioners, we must make a distinction between the current situation, which foresees no role for either the Commission President or Parliament, and the future situation under the Constitution."
"The Constitution will bring the procedure for replacing Commissioners closer to the procedure for the confirmation of the Commission at the start of its mandate."
"In this transitional phase, I can therefore agree that new Commission members should not appear officially before this Parliament until they have met with the relevant parliamentary committee."
"As regards their appearance before Council, that is not entirely in my hands, since a nominated new Commissioner will have to carry out duties linked to his or her portfolio."
"In the event of a reshuffle of my team, I accept a similar obligation that Commissioners whose portfolios change should not appear officially before this Parliament until they have met with the relevant parliamentary committee."
"With regard to points 2 and 5 (d), your resolution suggests that we have not yet taken the necessary steps to avoid potential conflicts of interest."
"Yesterday I explained the detailed arrangements for dealing with potential conflict of interest problems that might arise in a portfolio."
"Let us now implement them."
"We will have the opportunity to assess their effectiveness at a later stage."
"I will make any further changes that prove necessary in the light of experience."
"With regard to point 5 (e), as I indicated in July, I share Parliament's view of the need to strengthen multiannual programming and strategic planning, together with the Council."
"I will therefore present to you in January draft proposals for the five-year strategic objectives of the Union, which should be jointly adopted by all institutions."
"I will listen to your debate on the subject in December and take account of your main concerns."
"This anticipates this important new area of cooperation, also provided for in the Constitution."
"Now points 5 (f) and 5 (g)."
"Our relationship must be built on trust and regular contacts."
"My team will therefore give priority to appearing before this Parliament."
"Both I and Vice-President Wallström intend to maintain regular and active contact with the Conference of Presidents."
"The announcement of Commission decisions and proposals to Parliament reflects the current arrangements under the framework agreement, which I am, of course, willing to respect."
"Nevertheless, I believe that this has not always been implemented satisfactorily, either for the Parliament or for the Commission, particularly as regards communicating effectively to the wider public what the Union does."
"I hope that we can discuss improvements to this arrangement, focused on identifying the most important proposals deserving the attention of Parliament and our joint communication effort."
"Presentation of these proposals should be timed as far as possible to coincide with plenary sessions."
"If we can do this, I would argue for greater flexibility on other more routine initiatives."
"Point 5 (h). The Commission already explains how it will follow up the positions of Parliament on legislative proposals."
"Experience shows that this mechanism is useful and I will be happy to extend it to positions taken by Parliament in cases other than legislation."
"Point 5 (i). We need to distinguish between issues related to the flow of information between the Commission and the European Parliament and issues linked more generally to access to European documents covered by existing legislation (Regulation 1049/01)"
"I am happy to look with you at ways of improving the flow of information between Parliament and the Commission."
"As I stated last July, it is a fundamental requirement for this Parliament to provide democratic oversight."
"In relation to Regulation 1049/01, we should consider practical experience with the rules on access to documents."
"Nevertheless, we should not forget that those rules have been enforced for only a little over two years."
"We should not therefore plan an immediate review, but rather agree a timetable for a review during the lifetime of this Parliament."
"Since the rules on access to documents were agreed by codecision, we should not forget that this is an area where the agreement of the Council will also be required."
"Point 5 (j). The main guidelines of the code of conduct governing the behaviour and operation of the new Commission have already been endorsed by my team."
"I am willing to inform the European Parliament of any changes to the provisions of the code on conflicts of interests or ethical behaviour and will take due account of any views it expresses on such changes."
"Point 5 (k). I believe the common approach to setting agreed priorities and planning our work and the more regular contacts between our institutions will help to improve the flow of information in these two areas."
"However, we should look at possible improvements in the light of current experience."
"Mr President, honourable Members, generally speaking I consider this resolution a good basis."
"Vice-President Wallström and I will work with you constructively, addressing the points I have just made and any others that our two institutions might think appropriate, with the aim of reinforcing the roles of the European Parliament and the Commission in their work for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few weeks we have been witness to what I believe to be a valuable exercise in European democracy."
"Not once have you heard me utter a single word in criticism of Parliament, even during the most difficult times and even when no agreement could be reached."
"Quite the contrary, I have always given you constructive answers, which were proof of my desire to cooperate with your institution."
"It is my opinion that we have now resolved all the problems in a spirit of compromise, and, after all, the only way in which Europe can be built is in a spirit of compromise."
"It is impossible to please all the people all the time; compromises must always be made."
"We have reached an outcome which is, on the whole, satisfactory, and I am delighted at this fact."
"We owe it to the people of Europe to ensure that the European institutions which come out of this exercise are stronger and better able to meet the public’s expectations."
"You will be aware of what these expectations are: more growth, more jobs and a strengthening of the European model, which combines reforms and economic dynamism with solidarity and social cohesion."
"You have before you a competent and efficient Commission, and I can assure you that as its leader I will devote all my energies to achieving these objectives and to ensuring that the men and women of Europe notice what has changed."
"I am counting on your support."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has just adopted, and by a very, very large majority, a resolution which – I am firmly convinced – represents further progress towards a more parliamentary European Union."
"It is clear from this convincing result that this House is united in its desire to work constructively with the Commission while also exercising its parliamentary and democratic control over it."
"Our resolution expresses a desire for a good working relationship between the Commission and this House."
"The Commission and Parliament need to regard each other, in principle, as allies, and that not only because of the attitude of some governments."
"Necessary though it is that this House should monitor the Commission, we would have you know, Mr President of the Commission, that we are, in principle, always shoulder to shoulder with it, for it is an important European Union institution."
"When acting as the guardian of the Treaties and watching over adherence to the law, you will always have us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, at your side."
"As you mentioned in your response, we want to implement the content of this resolution in the form of a framework agreement with you, just as we had done with the Prodi Commission, and we should start working on that together soon."
"It will then be for Mrs Wallström, as the future Vice-President, to continue the work of her remarkable predecessor Mrs de Palacio, with whom we negotiated the framework agreement."
"What is very important is what we have resolved as regards the confidence that we place in the members of the Commission or deny them, and, if Parliament adopts a motion of no confidence in one of them, it is then that you, Mr President of the Commission, must give serious thought – as is already stated in the agreement with the Prodi Commission – as to whether you should dismiss him or her."
"If you do not do as this House demands, then you must appear before it to justify yourself, and that, in parliamentary terms, represents an advance over the situation that existed before."
"At no time in the course of the next five years must your Commission include among its members anyone who has not gone through the parliamentary process."
"If changes are made in the Commission, for whatever reason, we insist that every new member of the Commission should undergo hearings in this House. That is what it says in the resolution, and we are going to make sure that it is in the framework agreement."
"It is good to see the whole college of the Commission here, and what we expect of you throughout your mandate is that you should always give an account of yourselves to Parliament whenever it – through the plenary, its committees, or any other of its bodies – so demands."
"When Parliament summons you, your presence before it takes precedence over all other commitments you may have made, and that is important, for it is to Parliament that you are responsible."
"On this we will insist, and – in view of the widely divergent conduct of the members of the former Commission in their dealings with this House – we will be very vigilant to see that this is actually done."
"Your strategic programme will be very important, and we expect you to present it in January."
"In an earlier resolution, the Conference of Presidents had in fact decided that, had the process not been delayed, we would have had a debate in November, in this part-session, on what this House’s expectations of this are."
"We have now decided that the House will set out its principles in a resolution in December."
"It is then that you can, and must, not only take note of Parliament’s positions, but also bring them and the Commission’s strategic programme into line."
"Let me also say that our group finds it regrettable that the motion on subsidiarity tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was not adopted."
"It is our contention that, where Europe has the competence to act, it must do so, with strength and reason, but it must not claim every task and role for itself; there are still the municipalities, the districts, the regions, and the nation states."
"Each of these four levels has its own tasks to perform, and that is why we adhere to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Let me conclude by saying that our group will, today, be united in expressing our confidence in you."
"While being alongside you, we will express criticisms in a positive way, but will also be determined to exercise our right of parliamentary control, and so, with that in mind, we wish you, Mr President, and your college of Commissioners, all the best and every success for the next five years."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to quote from something once said by Willy Brandt, a great European, a Member of this House, and one of the most significant of MEPs."
"Willy Brandt said that the European Parliament was not given rights; it had to fight for them."
"This House has indeed fought for rights for itself over the past three weeks, and we can all take pride in the fact that it succeeded, for we have put a stop to a trend – the trend towards excessive governmental power in the European Union."
"We have made it clear that Parliament, being the freely-elected representative assembly of the peoples, is equal to, and possesses the same prerogatives as, the bodies representing the states and their governments."
"What we have seen happening here in this House over the past three weeks is a demonstration of how far democracy has advanced in Europe."
"This struggle against governments, and also against executives with which one does not agree, is what parliaments are elected for; it is the reason why they exist, and it is in order to engage in this struggle that delegates are elected to parliaments."
"If our struggle is attended by the same success as we have had, we gain – as we have all noticed – popular confidence in our institution."
"People understand that."
"From the North Cape to Sicily, from the Azores to the border with Russia by way of East Frisia, they understood what this struggle was about."
"Their approval of this Parliament of ours has never been as high as it is now, and that is something we should make use of."
"It makes this institution stronger."
"Both institutions – Parliament and the Commission – have come out of this process stronger, and you, Mr President, with the Commission over which you now preside, have every opportunity to bring about change."
"Let me pick up what you said about a blind date, which was a fine phrase to choose."
"Some blind dates can be exciting; not all of those you have been on were."
"If you no longer want to go on blind dates, then tell the governments, quite plainly, that the procedure under which you, Mr Barroso, have to accept everyone they propose to you, and then pay the political price for their proposals – that, with the Barroso Commission, that procedure has come to an end."
"If you do that, both you and the Commission will be winners."
"You will both be the stronger for it."
"In the debate that has gone on over the past few weeks, we have concentrated on core messages."
"If I may remind you of the hearings and of what came out of them – for it was from these that the conflict arose – these core messages can be summed up in one sentence, which is that a broad majority in this House stood up in defence of the civil fundamental values of the European Union."
"The freedom of opinion of each and every individual is indeed one of these, but another is the right of Parliament to decide who shall join the executive and who shall not."
"Yet another is the strengthening of democracy."
"The freely-elected assembly of the people has come out of this with renewed strength, and that is a good thing."
"It is a good thing, because without it, we cannot treat one another as equals."
"President Barroso, you are quite entitled to criticise Parliament."
"I can recall how, in one of this House’s debates a few days ago, you certainly did have criticisms to make, albeit of only one side of this House."
"You are quite entitled to do that, but we are obliged to check up on what the executive does."
"So let me repeat that we will, whenever – and I mean whenever! – incompatibilities arise, and whenever we think your Commission or the policy guidance are going in the wrong direction, take exactly the same action as we have done over the past three weeks."
"The interplay between the executive and parliament at European level lies in the fact that you have the monopoly of initiative, while it is our duty to ensure that the laws made are just and socially balanced, and that is precisely what we will be doing over the five years that lie ahead of us."
"What we learn from the experience of history is that more democracy always brings with it more social justice."
"For that reason, the democratic progress we have achieved is, for us, the beginning of a battle that we will be waging for five years."
"I said it yesterday, and I shall repeat it today, that Europe’s social achievements, which have come to pass in the Member States, cannot be sacrificed at European level."
"It is there that they must be secured, and this we see as your Commission’s crucial task."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will approve the proposals you have put forward today."
"A number of Members in our group are not yet convinced and will not be giving you a vote of confidence today."
"It is now for you, over the coming years, to win them, too, over to your side."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament approves your proposal."
"I wish you success in working for social cohesion and social justice in Europe."
"Mr President, today a majority of Liberals and Democrats will vote for Mr Barrosso's Commission."
"Some of our Members will not."
"There is work to be done and we feel on balance, Mr Barrosso, that your Commission is now ready to do it."
"My Group listened to your closing remarks in the debate last night with some concern."
"Frankly, we listened with concern about your ability to understand this House."
"I was surprised to hear you say that a political group had been given a veto over the movement of a Commissioner, because we all know that is a privilege normally reserved for national capitals."
"I was surprised to hear you suggest that a political group in this House had tied your hands, because I thought they had already been tied in Rome, in Budapest, in The Hague!"
"If the group you referred to was mine, I am not aware of it issuing any statements insisting on any of the Commissioners being kept in their post."
"Indeed, I have said publicly that you must have the freedom to make your own decisions on the distribution of portfolios for your new team."
"We want you to have that freedom."
"You blamed the House for the lack of freedom to manoeuvre when, in fact, we have worked with you to build this compromise and when not one of us in this Parliament faces the European government that we might have chosen for ourselves."
"The approval process for the Commission does not end here."
"This House is not in the business of granting tenure."
"Today you get your driving licence."
"Tomorrow we start on the rules of the road."
"We want a new framework agreement because without the ability to scrutinise your Commission effectively, we cannot do our job properly."
"Parliamentary oversight without some possibility of sanction is paper tiger democracy and we want something better."
"A month ago we insisted on something better."
"The motion for a resolution tabled today makes it clear that we do not take lightly the issues of propriety or competence or conflict of interest for any Commissioner in any portfolio."
"Where concerns exist, this Parliament will be watching."
"Liberals and Democrats will be watching."
"I welcome your willingness to renew the framework agreement on stronger terms."
"We do not want to tie your hands or hold you hostage."
"Every power that Parliament gains carries with it a burden of responsibility and that is something we must shoulder along with you and your college."
"But good European government means accountable European government as you have said yourself."
"Mr President-elect, Liberals and Democrats offer you a licence to get to work."
"You will have our constructive partnership, but we do not have the gift of authority."
"That is something that you and your Commissioners will have to earn: every day, every month, brick by brick, in this stronger, closer European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, times are changing."
"The notion of ‘all power to the imagination’ has been replaced today by ‘all power to hypocrisy’, and it is very clear what is happening."
"We showed that the majority of the Members of this House did not agree with the chairmen of Parliament’s largest groups, including the Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and even, at one point, the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"A majority of Members believed that we should be more vocal in our criticism of Mr Barroso’s proposals than the chairmen wanted to be."
"This has been the truth of the matter over the past few months."
"Yet we have now suddenly discovered that all our criticisms of this Commission were only of limited value."
"Mr Barroso delivered a strong and forceful speech to this House in July in which he told us that he would not obey the wishes of Mr Chirac or Mr Schröder."
"Now, however, he is telling us that he will obey the wishes of Harry Potter, alias Mr Balkenende; this is a compliment to Mr Balkenende, by the way, as I am a big fan of Harry Potter."
"Yet why does the Dutch Prime Minister receive a thumbs-up with regard to Mrs Kroes, whereas Mr Schröder was refused a super-commissioner?"
"The independence of these great democrats is truly astonishing."
"Mr Poettering himself said in a television interview that the presence in the Commission of Mrs Kroes, who has so many scandals behind her, would not be tolerated."
"Yet today no one is interested in discussing the problem, which nonetheless remains a problem, that we now have a Commissioner responsible for competition who is unable to stand for the independence of the Commission as she is the product of her history."
"Seen in such a context, the situation really is unthinkable, and I should like to say to those many Members of this House who are critical of the sections of the Commission that have remained unchanged that by voting ‘yes’, and by giving Mr Barroso a blank cheque in doing so, you will undermine your criticism."
"We are well aware that Mr Barroso will gain a majority, but why on earth should he be given a majority which will allow him to walk all over us when it comes to policy-making?"
"To all of you who consider yourselves politicians today – and I am addressing all those who are still wondering whether they should vote for, vote against or abstain – I should like to say that I am aware that the rest of you are followers, not leaders, and indeed the majority of the PPE-DE Group would have voted in favour of the Commission last time."
"When one is a follower, one remains so from beginning to end; my remarks are therefore not directed at you, but at those who did not wish to hand Mr Barroso a blank cheque."
"I ask you to think it over, to vote no or to abstain, in order to prove that we take a critical stance and that Mr Barroso has made another poor job of his proposals."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, in a few moments your Commission will be sworn in."
"Yet we believe that this is an illusory success, as it is the product of one of these top-level schemes that give rise to the crises they are intended to resolve."
"The Commission is now as good as in place, but it has had an easy start compared with what is to come."
"Five months ago, a clear majority of European citizens showed their deep disaffection with the European institutions, accusing us of building a Europe in which they felt increasingly lost."
"Since your appointment, Mr Barroso, have you sent any kind of message to these citizens which is likely to imbue European integration with renewed meaning?"
"Firstly, you have achieved celebrity by surreptitiously attempting to give the Commission a slant which in other climes would pass for being neo-conservative, in assigning the highly symbolic portfolio of freedom, security and justice to a proponent of an obscurantist and old-fashioned mode of thinking."
"This caused a general outcry in many sectors of the European public, an outcry you had not anticipated, and it is much to Parliament’s credit that it echoed this feeling by halting last month’s proposal in its tracks."
"Yet it is not to the credit of the President of the Commission that he has once again entrusted such sensitive tasks to someone from the same government, which is the least credible of all the European governments in terms of justice and the defence of freedoms."
"Secondly, you have given still more impetus than your predecessors to what is at the root of the European public’s crisis of confidence in the Europe being built today, a Europe based on the trend towards neo-liberalism and the cult of ‘everything for sale’."
"In this respect, your refusal to hear the objections which came from all quarters as a result of your approach to the competition portfolio is unlikely to appease people’s fears."
"Finally, Mr President of the Commission, you should not forget that the majority of Europeans have been opposed to President Bush’s warmongering exploits from the very beginning."
"Despite the painful lessons delivered daily by events on the ground, we are still waiting for you to express any kind of doubts with regard to your unfortunate Azores initiative, which served to divide Europe on a matter of crucial importance to all of civilisation."
"A vote in favour of investiture is a vote of confidence."
"For the three reasons I have given, and without my wishing to pass judgment on individual Commissioners, we have no confidence in this Commission as a whole."
"Guided by our commitment to a vision of Europe in which our fellow citizens feel at home, we will vote against the Barroso Commission."
". Mr President, Mr Barroso said: 'I think my team is of high quality'."
"Well, let us conduct a human audit."
"I am mindful that audits are not very popular in the European Commission and that auditors – if they do their job properly – get fired, but nonetheless here goes:"
"From France we have Mr Barrot, who will take on transport."
"In 2000 he received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for his involvement in an embezzlement case and was banned from holding public office for two years."
"From Hungary we have Mr Kovács, who will take on taxation."
"For many years he was a Communist apparatchik, a friend of Mr Kádár, the dictator in Hungary, and an outspoken opponent of the values that we hold dear in the West."
"His new empire will produce taxation policy and he will look after the customs union from Cork to Vilnius."
"Are the PPE Group and the British Conservatives really going to vote for that?"
"From Estonia we have Mr Kallas, who for 20 years was a Soviet Party apparatchik until his newly acquired taste for capitalism got him into trouble."
"However, to be fair, he was acquitted of abuse and fraud but convicted for providing false information."
"He is going to be in charge of the anti-fraud drive!"
"You could not make this up!"
"From the UK we have Mr Mandelson, who will take on the trade portfolio."
"He, of course, was removed twice from the British Government, but to be fair, he is one of the more competent ones!"
"From the Netherlands we have Mrs Kroes, who will take on competition."
"She is accused of lying to the European Parliament."
"These may be only allegations, but they are made by Mr van Buitenen and should be listened to."
"Ask yourself a question: would you buy a used car from this Commission?"
"The answer simply must be 'No'!"
"Even if they were competent and even if this were a high-quality Commission – sorry, Mr Barroso, but I do not think it is – we would still vote 'No' on the political principle that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties; the Commission is the motor for integration; the Commission initiates the legislation that is damaging our businesses across Europe so badly; the Commission is the embodiment of all that is worst in this European Union; the Commission is the government of Europe and is not directly accountable to anybody."
"Please, when you vote, take note that 20 of these Commissioners have already said that they intend to attempt to implement the Constitution even before it has been ratified by Member State governments."
"In the face of such breathtaking arrogance, nobody in the Independence and Democracy Group will vote for this Commission."
". Mr President, I should like to join in welcoming the commitments given by Mr Barroso with regard to the resolution on which we have just voted."
"Rather than going over ground already covered by previous speakers, I would just like to underline that the overall content of what we want to see happening within Parliament with regard to the new Commission is clearly laid out and enunciated within that resolution, which also takes into account the framework agreement as revised."
"It is important that when we reflect on what has taken place over the past month to six weeks that we remember that Parliament has a responsibility."
"It has lived up to that responsibility ..."
"I am sorry, Mr President, I cannot carry on with this disruption."
"Mr Toubon, during the vote there are no points of order and I am not going to give you the floor."
"Points of order will be taken at the end of the vote."
"I would ask you not to disrupt the sitting."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"It is important that we reflect on what has taken place, and remember that Parliament has insisted on its democratic and executive control over the Commission."
"Mr Toubon, please sit down or leave."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"As was saying, it is important that we reflect on what has taken place."
"Firstly, I would have welcomed the opportunity during the last part-session to have voted on the composition of the Commission as it was presented to us at that juncture."
"Unfortunately, a majority in this Parliament convinced others that the vote should not go ahead."
"However, the Council and the Commission have responded to the concerns which Parliament raised and brought forward a new proposal and a new team, which we now have the responsibility to endorse."
"In no way would I disallow any Member' right to express a negative opinion on individual members of the Commission."
"However, it is important and incumbent upon us to ensure that Members of this Parliament do not use Parliament to fight domestic political battles with governments they do not ideologically agree with. It denigrates this House and its Members when we refuse to allow people to hold opinions that we may not agree with."
"If anything, Europe should be about defending freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of ideas, even though we may not agree with those ideas or thoughts."
"Once the dust has settled, the people of Europe will not be judging us on the agility of political groupings within this Parliament or on whether we can get one over on another institution."
"They will not judge us on whether Parliament is stronger than the Council or equal to the Council or the Commission."
"They will not judge us on who we stopped from becoming a Commissioner."
"They will judge us and the Commission on the basis of what we can deliver to the people of Europe."
"It is time to stop the political games and get on with the real agenda of making the Lisbon Strategy work, of ensuring that the people of Europe have better access to better-quality jobs and better-quality opportunities and of promoting Europe's role on the wider stage."
"In six months' time the people of Europe will not know who the individual Commissioners that we rejected were."
"What they will be asking, however, is what Europe did about Darfur, what Europe did about the Ivory Coast and what Europe did to help the people most marginalised within our society."
"Within this House we have a voice."
"We are elected to use that voice to speak on behalf of the people who put us here to be their representatives."
"But who will speak for the lonely and the unfairly treated?"
"If not us, then who?"
"Who will speak for the downtrodden and the oppressed?"
"If not us, then who?"
"Who will give us the right to speak on behalf of all of those people if we use our time and energy trying to get one over on a neo-Liberal, neo-Conservative, Communist – or whatever – approach?"
"The great thing about this Commission and the European Union is that they have allowed people of different political ideologies to put aside their individual ideologies in order to arrive at a consensus for the common good."
"We should never start at a consensus, but we should always end with a consensus and compromise."
"Mr Barroso, you and your team have shown a willingness to listen to the concerns of this Parliament."
"I hope and believe that will continue."
"Likewise, your responsibilities and duties under the Treaties are important."
"Occasionally you will have to stand up and not give in to every demand from governments or this Parliament."
"It is only when we have that kind of interinstitutional friction that we will truly achieve the best results."
"I welcome this Commission."
"Most of our group will support it, as indeed most of Parliament will support it."
"We ask for fair play in return for that support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Buttiglione circus has closed its doors, and pro-European order will prevail henceforth in Strasbourg."
"Mr Buttiglione, a free man of Catholic faith, has been replaced by Mr Frattini, a model freemason. Mrs Udre, a Latvian accused of being a Eurosceptic by one of her fellow citizens, has also been replaced."
"Yet neither Mr Kovács, the former Stalinist found by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to be entirely incompetent, nor Mrs Fischer Boel and Mrs Kroes, who have attracted criticism over potential conflicts of interest, have been replaced."
"It appears to me that a moral can be drawn from the Buttiglione affair, and that this affair has claimed three victims."
"The moral is that to be a European Commissioner, one must be Euro-compatible, that is to say politically, mentally and even religiously correct, as well as being an aficionado of tolerance, of the principle of non-discrimination and, above all, of human rights, the latter-day bible of right-thinking people."
"Any kind of deviation will from now on be harshly punished."
"Let us now turn to the victims, the first of which is the future European Constitution."
"The European Parliament has flouted both Article II-70, on freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and Article II-71, on freedom of expression and opinion, and in some ways Mr Buttiglione is the first secular martyr of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The second victim is Italy, which gave in to the European Parliament when the latter forced Mr Berlusconi to replace the Commissioner he had appointed, and whose competence and honesty had not been challenged by anyone before his hearing."
"The third and final victim is the European Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, as both have emerged weakened from this trial of strength with Parliament."
"No, Mr Barroso, you were neither held hostage to the extreme right nor were you its victim, as you wrongly claimed; you fell victim to your own errors of judgment."
"You realised a little too late that we were heading for a confrontation, and that this House intended to make you capitulate in order to reaffirm its authority the Council and the Commission."
"As for us European right-wingers, proud of our beliefs and relying on the support of the people, we will defend our fellow citizens from both the European super-state and the accession of Turkey by voting against the investiture of your Commission. I should like to make one final point."
"Mr President, you yourself have admitted that you interfered in French affairs by lending the Portuguese Government’s support to Mr Chirac during the 2002 presidential elections."
"Mr Chirac, who everyone knows is unfamiliar with both Europe’s geography and its history, recently said that we are all children of Byzantium."
"It is hard to think of a more sinister omen, since the children of Byzantium, busy discussing the sex of angels with their parents and their councillors, were overwhelmed by the Islamic army of Sultan Mehmet II on 29 May 1453 after a month-and-a-half-long siege."
"In a symbolic and barbaric gesture, the Sultan dipped his hand in the blood of the dead Christians and daubed this blood on the wall of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which became and has remained Istanbul’s main mosque."
"Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement on my own behalf and on behalf of my group."
"Mr Farage’s assertion is unworthy of this European Parliament."
"At no time has Mr Barrot ever committed a criminal offence – at no time whatever!"
"Although Mr Barrot belongs to another institution, I have known him for many years, and so I take this opportunity to say, on behalf of our group, that Mr Barrot is an extraordinary person; he is honourable, he is credible, and we have complete confidence in him."
"Mr President, I ask that it be investigated whether the insulting utterances that Mr Farage has come out with in this debate, could result in prosecution under criminal law."
"I most firmly repudiate these utterances and wish to express our wholehearted confidence in Mr Barrot."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Poettering has just said is true of my own group as well."
"We have been forthrightly critical of some candidates, but the critical onslaught that is customary in political debates must never result in people’s integrity being damaged, or in their being condemned in advance."
"So let me say, right now and very clearly, that, no matter what criticisms we have had to make in this matter, there can be no doubt about the human and personal integrity of the candidates."
"I want Mr Barrot to know that, even though he is from a political family other than our own, his political integrity, in particular, is beyond any doubt."
"I absolutely endorse what the honourable Member said, and would say that what has been said about the English Member applies likewise to Mr Le Pen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will be aware that we have been highly vocal in our criticism of certain Commissioners, but I should like to tell Mr Barroso in person that we too find the way in which he has been attacked unacceptable."
"Problems relating to the funding of political parties in France have affected all parties …"
"… have affected all parties."
"Yes, I am aware that I could have said that the Greens have not been affected, but that is not the issue at stake."
"This is why I am calling upon all Members of this House to continue with their political attacks on the Commission, but to avoid indulging in personal attacks, as I believe that talk of this kind will get us nowhere."
"Mr President, I do not wish to comment on the accusations made by Mr Farage."
"He can assume legal responsibility for any allegations he has made."
"I must say that I am surprised and disappointed by the behaviour of his Group in this Chamber over a number of weeks."
"Last time, one of his members, Mr Kilroy-Silk, bellowed like a bull through the microphone."
"I am sometimes ashamed of Britain's reputation across Europe for its football hooligans."
"I fear we now have their representatives here in Parliament."
"Mr President, I believe that our time would be well spent in giving the floor to the group chairmen to state their opinions on this incident."
"The idea of politics we must stand for is one which incorporates ethical considerations."
"Although I personally believe that anything goes in political debate, I do not believe that slander is acceptable."
"I should therefore like to say that, although Mr Barroso may be my political adversary, I respect him as a person, and would like to say, on behalf of our group, that we do not in any way agree with the slander to which he has been subjected."
"Mr Farage, you will speak when I give you the floor."
"I would ask you to use your speech to reflect on what you have said."
"You have the right to request that your words do not appear in the Minutes."
"If they do appear, you will have to be prepared to accept any legal consequences which may result from them."
"Mr President, I am not sure whether I take your comments as being a neutral intervention or perhaps more of a veiled threat."
"I suspect the latter."
"I would like to make it perfectly clear that I did not make these comments without having done substantial research."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit implied that he knew rather more about the case by trying to say that these difficulties and problems have affected many parties in France."
"I made the comments about Mr Barrot having researched the case very carefully."
"I believed it was a function of parliaments – even though I am not a particular fan of this one – that their Members be able to speak freely, to make statements and to ask questions."
"I thought that was what parliaments were all about, so I find Mr Poettering's comments very surprising."
"I will make it perfectly clear: if it is proved that what I have said is wrong, if it is proved that my research is flawed, then of course, in those circumstances, I would withdraw the remarks and apologise wholeheartedly."
"Mr Barroso, Commissioners, the European Parliament has just expressed its confidence in you and I congratulate you. This brings to an end an important episode in the history of European parliamentary democracy."
"Europe needs a strong Commission and a credible Parliament and this is more the case today than it was yesterday."
"Whatever our differences of opinion, I believe we can take pleasure from the fact that our debate has reached the citizens of Europe."
"I would like to say, Mr Barroso, that Parliament, like you, wants a new partnership between our two institutions based on mutual respect and mutual trust, so that the European Union can become increasingly democratic, legitimate and effective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to express, on my own behalf and on behalf of all the Members of the Commission, my sincerest gratitude for the confidence that has just been placed in this Commission. I wish to say to you that I appreciate this is a large, indeed an enormous, responsibility, and that we will strive, we will make every effort, to serve Europe, to serve the Institutions of the European Union and to serve all of our citizens."
"I do not have anything else to say at this point, but we do have a great deal to do."
"Thank you very much."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate the new Commission, which has the broad support of the European Parliament."
"I look forward to working with this new Commission."
"I should also like to congratulate the European Parliament."
"What has happened today has strengthened European democracy as well as the European Union as a whole."
"That concludes voting. We can now move on to the explanations of vote."
". As Dutch members of the Independence and Democracy Group, we were faced with a dilemma for this vote."
"During October’s plenary session in Strasbourg, the Left and Liberal groups reacted with great animosity to Mr Buttiglione’s biblical views on marriage and sexuality – views with which we can identify."
"We take a critical view of the position adopted by the European Parliament."
"There is a mental climate here that rejects any other views of principle."
"We therefore have difficulty in assenting to a Commission without Mr Buttiglione."
"Too much has happened for an assessment of the proposed Commission’s capabilities to suffice."
"After all, this vote cannot be seen in isolation from the injustice done to Mr Buttiglione, particularly as he was loyal to the Treaty."
"We find it difficult to say which of the two is more important: the pain and indignation about the European Parliament’s conduct, or an assessment of the proposed Commission’s capabilities."
"There is, after all, only one vote, which has to reflect all our feelings and considerations."
"Given the dilemma we have outlined, we abstained from the vote, thereby demonstrating that freedom of religion and opinion are just as dear to us as is Europe’s administrative capacity."
". I believe the way in which this House forced through changes to the European Commission under Mr Barroso’s leadership is a violation of Parliament’s powers and of the principle of freedom of conscience."
"I believe the nomination of Commissioners should be a sovereign decision by the governments of the Member States, and that the European Parliament should not dispute their choices."
"The negative view taken by Parliament’s committee of Mr Buttiglione, the Commissioner-designate for justice, freedom and security, was based on ideological considerations, not on an assessment of Mr Buttiglione’s merits."
"Essentially, he was discriminated against by the Left for having acknowledged his Christian beliefs."
"Finally, I believe it is disgraceful that although Parliament prevented a man of faith, whose honesty is evident from the life he leads, from becoming a Commissioner, there is room in this same Commission for people whose names featured prominently in anti-democratic Communist regimes."
"This is evidence of the double standards applied by this House."
"I therefore abstained from voting on the approval."
". I and my UK Conservative colleagues have abstained in the vote on the Barroso Commission because, whilst broadly supporting the President-designate, we have a major issue with the Commission as a whole."
"We recognise that Mr Barroso has the qualities needed to fulfil his duties and that he broadly shares our views on the Lisbon Strategy and on transatlantic relations and we also recognise that his Commission, on balance, shares his approach."
"We regard this as a positive and are thus, in principle, supportive."
"However, for us there are significant problems with, in particular, the debate over the withdrawal of Mr Buttiglione as candidate Commissioner whilst at the same time retaining at least one other Commissioner-designate who was the subject of serious criticism at his previous committee hearing."
"I consider that this is a blatant example of discrimination."
"We find this unacceptable, as we do the pledges given by Commissioners-designate to endeavour to implement provisions of the Constitution prior to its formal adoption."
"This we regard as anti-democratic."
"Given these conflicting aspects of the Commission proposed by Mr Barroso, we have, with regret, decided that we have no alternative but to abstain."
"I voted against the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission last July, as in my opinion he was not the candidate European citizens were entitled to expect."
"His position of support for the attack on Iraq, an attack which violated all the rules of international law, was also unacceptable."
"During the October part-session I made known my opposition to the first Barroso Commission, which was in no way acceptable."
"If Mr Barroso had not climbed down at the very last moment in order to avoid a crushing personal defeat, I would of course have voted against this Commission. Mr Barroso has, however, made minor changes to the original line-up he tried to impose on us."
"Today I remain strongly opposed to the fact that Mrs Kroes holds the portfolio for competition, as her presence brings with it the significant risk that conflicts of interest might occur."
"It is crucial, however, that a new Commission finally be able to get down to work."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this Commission, although I did so reluctantly."
"In common with many of my fellow Members, I am now eagerly waiting for Mr Barroso to set out his political agenda."
"I will be looking very carefully to see if this agenda is one that gives an important place to the social issues that citizens expect to see tackled there."
"In accordance with Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure, …"
". I did not vote against the proposed new Commission, presented by Mr Durão Barroso, partly because of the political backtracking that the President-designate has been forced into by recent decisions by Parliament, but more importantly because I believe that by voting this way I have helped to strengthen the unity of the Socialist Group in Parliament."
"The Commission that has been approved is, however, a poor solution, which is a great pity in the current political situation. Unfortunately, this is essentially due to the fragility and powerlessness of its President."
"This is the real crux of the problem."
"The fact that Mrs Kroes has been retained in the post of Commissioner responsible for competition is tantamount to a time bomb that may do serious damage to the Commission in the future."
"The President of the Commission has already been elected by Parliament. To reject the Commission at this time would therefore only lead to a worsening situation and to an unwanted political crisis."
"I therefore abstained."
". I did not vote against the Commission proposed by Mr Durão Barroso – by abstaining I helped to ensure it was not brought down – for three crucial reasons:"
"1."
"The President of the Commission attempted to satisfy the demands made by Parliament, in general, and by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in particular, by making significant changes."
"2."
"Despite the fact that, to my mind, this is not the Commission that Europe needs and the fact that its bias is strongly neoliberal, the current proposal is substantially better than the one before."
"3."
"There are, however, some problematical cases in which Commissioners-designate are not suited to the portfolio that they have been assigned, and this may lead to serious conflicts of interest."
". The Commission was never going to entirely reflect my views and opinions as a member of the Labour Party."
"While the reality is that not all European governments are left-wing, the Commission is the representative face of those governments in Europe."
"I am voting in favour of this Commission, not because I agree with everything it stands for, but because it is the embodiment of the broad church of European governments."
"Three weeks ago Mr Barroso put forward a candidate who was out of step with European attitudes and values."
"Parliament, the directly elected representatives of the citizens of Europe, made a stand, proving that we MEPs are strong of will and not just a rubber stamp for the Commission."
"It is now clear that all Commissioners are on probation and we should be paying particular attention to Neelie Kroes in her role as Competition Commissioner, as her previous job as a lobbyist could well bring about a conflict of interest."
"We have flexed our muscles and in doing so we have strengthened Parliament, now the Commission must earn our trust."
"The first round of hearings of Commissioners-designate held by Parliament made it clear to Members of this House that some of these Commissioners-designate had an extremely poor grasp of matters falling under the portfolios for which they might have been responsible."
"What is more, following the example set by Mr Buttiglione in his statements, positions were revealed during these hearings which were ideologically outrageous and which violated the EU’s basic values, such as tolerance, cultural pluralism and freedom of thought."
"The line-up of the new Commission, upon whose investiture Parliament was asked to vote today, admittedly takes these problems into account."
"Yet it does not provide any kind of response to the political issues and to some of the ethical issues which aroused the opposition of a majority of Members of this House on 27 October."
"The replacement of Mr Buttiglione by Mr Frattini means that the post of Commissioner for freedom, security and justice is held by a man known for having drafted Italian laws intended to shield Mr Berlusconi from accusations against him, most notably those relating to corruption."
"Moreover, the portfolio for competition continues to be held by Mrs Kroes, whose links with the world of business mean that there is a real risk that conflicts of interest will occur."
"The psychological drama to which we have been witness in the shape of the appointment of the European Commission will end today with the approval of the new Commission, something which will come as no surprise to anyone."
"A mere three changes will have been enough to secure this approval, changes which are of secondary importance on the face of it, but which are in fact extremely telling."
"These changes include the removal of Mr Buttiglione, who dared to make a distinction between the natural family and homosexuality, as well as that of Mrs Udre, whom you believed to be guilty of putting up too spirited a defence of her country’s farmers."
"A place remains within the Commission for Mr Kovács, however, the erstwhile Hungarian Stalinist turned model socialist, who excelled in his incompetence."
"Mrs Kroes is still to be in charge of competition, despite her links with multinational corporations, and Mrs Fischer Boel is still to be in charge of agriculture, despite the fact that her husband farms pigs in Russia, which creates an obvious conflict of interest."
"Such a line-up of Commissioners means that the Commission as a whole is only putting on a pretence of ‘independence’."
"It is indeed independent of nations and of the Member States, but it is a long way from being independent of multinational corporations or of doctrines which enforce the majority opinion and destroy freedom, as recently seen in Belgium."
"Yet the sad truth is that the Barroso Commission is perfect for the tasks which await it: accelerated globalisation under America’s thumb, the de-industrialisation of Europe, the accession of Turkey, the disappearance of nation states to be replaced by a European super-state endowed with a Constitution, the dismantling of the European social model and the organisation of immigration …"
". I opted to make the Commission proposed by President Barroso viable because I feel that, in light of recent events, to bring down the new Commission would cause a major crisis in the running of the EU and would trigger serious conflict between the institutions."
"Although the most inappropriate of the original Commissioners-designate has, thanks to Parliament’s intervention, been prevented from taking up his post in the college of Commissioners, I feel that this is a Commission with an excessively neoliberal bias, under a leadership that could do a good job provided it does not backslide on the democratic principles and objectives of European integration."
"I could not, however, vote in favour of the Commission due to serious misgivings about the fact that Mrs Kroes has retained her competition portfolio."
"I have no doubts as to her skills, not least because her appointment would be a case of ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’."
"What is at stake, however, is her personal suitability – essential in a Commissioner – given that, among the numerous multinationals to which she has declared professional links, she omitted the arms producer Lockheed Martin."
"I also have reservations about the portfolio of Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs going to an ex-Minister under Mr Berlusconi, jointly responsible for the delay in adopting the arrest warrant (…)"
"The Swedish party, the June List, intended voting against Mr Barroso’s first proposal for two reasons."
"Firstly, we believed he had negotiated with the governments in order to obtain an extremely federalist Commission."
"Secondly, we believed he had shown very poor judgment in proposing Mr Buttiglione as the person responsible for female equality and the rights of homosexuals."
"We did not, however, have any objection to Mr Buttiglione’s being appointed to another Commission post."
"Obviously, there must be no discrimination against Catholics or those holding other religious positions."
"Now, this latter mistake has been rectified, but the new proposal is even more federalist than the first."
"It reflects the will of the political elite instead of that of the people."
"The June List has obtained its mandate from voters opposed to the continued centralisation and bureaucratisation of the European project."
"We have therefore voted against Mr Barroso’s proposal."
"Despite the fact that pressure brought to bear on Mr Barroso by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament resulted in a climb-down on his part after he had presented his first Commission in October, I do not believe that the changes he has since made are anywhere near substantial enough to allow me to lend him my support."
"This is why I have voted against the investiture of the Commission he has put forward."
"In contrast to the majority of members of the Socialist Group, my ‘no’ to the minimally reshuffled Barroso Commission, as well as that of my delegation as a whole, is an indication of my refusal to hand a blank cheque to a Commission which does not share my values of tolerance, pluralism and freedoms and which has made clear its free-market and conservative leanings."
"It will now be necessary for us to remain on our guard, given that Mrs Kroes will be responsible for competition and Mrs Fischer Boel for agriculture, meaning that there is a serious risk that conflicts of interest might arise within the European Commission, and given that Mr Frattini, Mr Berlusconi’s ambassador for justice and freedom, will also be a member of this Commission."
". I have abstained in the vote on the Barroso Commission because, while I broadly support President-designate Barroso, I have a fundamental problem with his Commission as a whole."
"I recognise that Mr Barroso comes from the centre right and that he is an Atlanticist."
"I also recognise that his Commission, on balance, has a significant centre-right orientation."
"I regard this as positive, and I am therefore minded to be supportive."
"However, the Barroso Commission supports ratification of the EU Constitution, and my party, the British Conservatives, oppose ratification and believe that the Constitution is inimical to the interests of the British people."
"Worse still, a majority of Commissioners-designate have indicated in their hearings that they fully intend to implement aspects of the Constitution falling within their respective portfolio areas, in advance of ratification."
"I believe that this is quite unacceptable and an affront to democracy."
"Given these conflicting aspects of the Barroso Commission, I have reluctantly decided that I have no alternative but to abstain."
"I shall vote in favour of nominating the European Commission in the course of this week, just as I was already resolved to do three weeks ago before Mr Barroso withdrew his proposal."
"The changes in the composition of the Commission that have been made since then have not altered my opinion that, taken as a whole, the Commission is in a position to take up the many challenges awaiting it."
"The Commission therefore deserves my confidence, even if, as was the case three weeks ago, certain choices seem to me to be questionable."
"In general, I doubt if the recent events, which have however been described as a great victory for the European Parliament, have really served the cause of a more democratic Europe and smoothed the way for inter-institutional dialogue."
"In particular, I deplore the climate of witch-hunting that has been introduced following unfortunate statements by one Commissioner-designate."
"It is now clear that the ‘individual nomination’ procedure for Commissioners – a procedure that does not appear at all in the treaties but that has, in the event, just been applied by Parliament – has quickly got out of hand by being employed in an iniquitous and arbitrary fashion."
"In the eyes of some of my colleagues, incompetence passes for a venial sin."
". I have just voted in favour of the new Commission."
"I have confidence in Mr Barroso as a good conductor for an orchestra that has yet to tune up."
"He will master scores of different levels of difficulty, including the one that Parliament has offered him today."
"I would have liked the Hungarians to display a great deal of sensitivity."
"Mr Kovács should not have been a candidate for a second time, and not only because of his Communist mindset."
"Whether his abilities, which were not up to coping with energy issues, will be adequate for the tax portfolio remains to be seen."
"Mrs Kroes from the Netherlands is likely to become the Commission’s specialist for discord."
"She lacks the independence that competition issues demand, and so the current Presidency of the Council ought to have withdrawn her."
"I take a rather unsympathetic view of the withdrawal of Mr Buttiglione, whose high level of expertise would have enriched the whole Commission."
"Many members of the public would have liked to see him – perhaps in another position – as an interpreter, even though not all of them share his views."
"Europe must remain a platform for the free expression of opinions, the free practice of religion, and for cultural pluralism."
"Mr Buttiglione, a former Member of this House, repeatedly affirmed his adherence to European values and undertook to abide by the law as it stands."
"I hope that future Commissioners nominated by the Member States will, without exception, be qualified for the job, with it then being left to the President of the Commission to make his own choice from among a number of talented actors."
"In addition to the universal figures of Vasco da Gama and Magellan, Portugal’s notable politicians included Pombal, the Lusitanian Richelieu."
"Until Black Wednesday in October 2004, there was also yourself, President Barroso."
"Like Pombal, you tried to resist the petty dignitaries of this Parliament and the cartoon tigresses of this Coliseum-style Assembly."
"Whereas there was a pervasive silence when Théo Van Gogh had his throat slit in a manner reminiscent of Rembrandt's painting, Abraham's Sacrifice,Mr Buttiglione deserved support."
"That is why, although we do not agree with the unbridled euroliberalism of the budget austerity pact or with the Turco-Europeanism that you will be obliged to apply, we decided to support your resistance on this point of freedom."
"Since then, French political inquisitors have been the factor that has forced you to give way."
"I would distinguish between the man and the institution and wish the former good luck as he commands the European caravel, even if it is heading towards a burned-out star, given that the adventure of the twenty-first century is no longer to organise 500 million Europeans, but six billion people across the planet."
". During an explanation of vote on 15 September 1999, I particularly objected to the nomination of the proposed new Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein."
"At the time, he was the candidate with the most outspoken preferences for the forced privatisation of government tasks and for cancelling all manner of EU tasks that do not fit into his ultra-liberal view of the economy."
"He has bequeathed to us a draft services directive that is already known to be horrific, deactivating as it does national rules intended to protect labour by getting them to compete against each other."
"I objected to Mr Bolkestein because he is an ideologist of the wrong kind of Europe, although I have always taken his qualities as politician completely seriously."
"That cannot be said about the equally Liberal successor that the Netherlands has provided this time round."
"She disappeared from the Dutch political scene fifteen years ago and has since, on a number of occasions, been the subject of adverse news coverage because of her previous actions as minister and her subsequent conduct as a businesswoman."
"As I indicated in yesterday’s debate, she always made controversial choices to the sole benefit of small groups of interested parties rather than the public interest."
"That is why we should very much consider the fact that she …"
". In light of the reasons – strictly political reasons – why we voted against Mr Durão Barroso’s nomination for President of the Commission in July and in light of the selections and the hearings of those who were selected that led to the composition of the Commission, which will result in political choices that are against what we stand for and that we fight against, we voted against the Commission."
"In the proposed line-up, nothing has changed, let alone improved, as regards the political conditions that led to our vote in July. We also voted this way for reasons that we made clear in the explanation of vote on the Joint Resolution on this issue."
"We reaffirm our defence of and struggle for alternative political options that attach importance to social, regional and environmental strands, the objective of economic and social cohesion that is always left out."
". I voted in favour of the nominated Commission, as I should like to have done when the first team led by Mr Durão Barroso was put forward."
"At this time of enlargement and of public debate on the new Constitutional Treaty – a time that is so loaded with desires and opportunities – one would expect that the decisions made by all of the political groups in this House might have been guided by a sense of responsibility."
"Unfortunately, this has not been the case."
"I am disappointed that the first opportunity was thwarted three weeks ago. I am appalled by the disgraceful way in which Members of this House and certain parliamentary services were predisposed towards an orchestrated smear campaign against Mr Buttiglione, and were even found to be directly promoting that campaign."
"The lies were served up in bad faith to feed groups of activists and do not correspond in any objective way to what was said in the parliamentary hearings."
"Today, coming from Portugal as I do, I believe that no compatriot of mine with the slightest awareness of the reality of Europe could, as a Portuguese Member of this House, vote against a Commission that for the first time has a Portuguese President."
"I did not expect Members to persist in such blindness, which is somewhat sectarian and missing the point."
"I wish the best of luck to the President of the Commission and to his team, and I trust that under his leadership the Union can progress in respect for diversity."
". Whilst I do not agree with some of the aspects of this Resolution, I voted in favour because I feel that, of all the proposals put before us, this one represents an acceptable compromise, particularly as regards point 5(a), which I consider fundamental, given that the final, reasoned, decision on retaining a Commissioner who has lost Parliament’s confidence rests with the President of the Commission."
"The remaining compromises are generally aimed at improving working relations between Parliament and the Council, and this is something that I welcome."
"What remains is the question of subsidiarity."
"Regrettably, the compromise resolution did not include any call for compliance with this principle, which was contained in an amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"The fact that that amendment was not adopted does not exempt Parliament, or the other European institutions, from complying strictly with the principle, in accordance with both the current Treaties and the future Constitutional Treaty."
"Consequently, this did not prevent me from voting in favour."
". This motion for a joint resolution – joint for those groups who signed it – is highly significant."
"‘Whereas’, ‘welcomes’, ‘applauds’, ‘hopes that’, ‘requests that’ (and although), the signatories voted in favour of the new Commission in its patched-up line-up."
"What those signatories welcome, applaud, hope for and request does not, however, in any way change, let alone improve upon, the reasons – political reasons – why we voted against Mr Durão Barroso’s appointment as President of the Commission."
"The Commission in its current form is simply the team that will press ahead with political choices that go against what we stand for and what we fight for."
"The October episode and the one-off show of unity that it gave rise to left one in no doubt."
"The Commissioners-designate who are scandalous examples of the sordid relationship between economic and financial power and the political institutions have been retained, and indeed their position has been strengthened."
"The replacement for the Commissioner who so offended some Members’ human rights sensitivities in the hearings trotted out the same answers prepared by the services for the supposed Commissioner he was replacing because of statements that he had made during the hearings."
"We have no choice but to vote against this draft resolution, as we did in July,"
". I naturally voted in favour of the compromise motion for a resolution, which, with our characteristic sense of responsibility, was the point at which the various political groups that signed up were able to converge."
"I also wish to mention, however, the importance of the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which I voted in favour of, calling for the new Commission, which is finally about to get down to work, strictly to observe the principle of subsidiarity."
"Compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, quite apart from being a long-standing fundamental requirement and something that merits greater emphasis, is the yardstick by which fervent pro-Europeans can be measured. These are people who are loyal both in rhetoric and in action to the idea and the maxim encapsulated by the draft Constitutional Treaty: ‘United in diversity’."
"I am appalled that the Members from the Portuguese left – the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Left Block – voted against the proposal to defend and prioritise subsidiarity. With their 15 potential votes it was because of them that it was not adopted."
"I should also like to welcome a point raised in the speech by Mr Poettering, the Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the new Commission must begin its duties and must be able to forge an entirely new approach, in which the national parliaments will be closely involved in the European project, and this will ideally be reflected in an interinstitutional agreement."
"On 26 October 2004, Mr Barroso preferred not to submit his College of Commissioners to the vote of the European Parliament."
"This decision was taken in the wake of our opposition to a number of Commissioners following their hearings."
"We have today expressed an opinion on the nomination of the Barroso Commission, which is presented to us as the ‘new’ Barroso Commission."
"I shall not refer again to the previous episodes, of which we are all aware."
"As coordinator of my group, I participated in Mr Frattini’s hearing on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Mr Frattini is an intelligent, ‘politically correct’ man, but it worries me that the justice portfolio should be given to the minister in Mr Berlusconi’s government who has shown his elastic conception of justice."
"Mrs Kroes retains the same portfolio, and, sooner or later, conflicts of interest will arise."
"We have no guarantees of independence and impartiality."
"Mr Barroso has heard our comments. I should have preferred him to have listened to them."
"The changes proposed by Mr Barroso are cosmetic."
"These few modifications do not satisfy me."
"I stand by my previous votes, and that is why I voted against the nomination of this Commission."
". The EU is at a stage where a series of important reforms are necessary, aimed at ensuring the development of the social model, which is an integral part of our heritage."
"In order to continue to see itself as a project for peace, Europe must grow economically, must be capable of creating more jobs, must foster sustainable development, must show signs within itself of greater social and territorial cohesion and must play a more prominent role on the international stage and in the fight against terrorism."
"In order to meet those objectives the EU and the Member States must adopt highly proactive policies."
"Against this backdrop, the Commission requires leadership that is capable of taking charge of the reforms to be carried out, within a framework of compromises with the different political forces represented in Parliament."
"I see a reforming spirit in Mr Durão Barroso and he has the leadership qualities that the EU’s executive body badly needs at this time."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Commission led by Mr Durão Barroso."
"The fact that the leader of the European Commission happens to be a compatriot of mine makes me proud to vote this way."
".– We voted against the candidature of Mr Barroso and the new Commission because they stand for the continuation and hardening of the anti-grass roots, autocratic, warmongering policy of the ΕU."
"The withdrawal of the proposal and the change in certain Commissioners were to do with internal oppositions and the effort to find people who will implement the same policy more efficiently, in order to give a 'democratic' pretext for a new agreement between social democrat and conservative parties."
"That is why the debate focused on the people rather than the policy of the new Commission, in order to disorientate the people."
"The statements by the new Commissioners designate confirm our estimation that they will serve the interests of big business with passion."
"They defended the promotion and application of the reactionary Constitutional Treaty, the autocratic – and for the workers – terrifying Hague programme, the speeding up of new anti-labour measures under the Lisbon Strategy and the escalation of the imperialist aggressiveness of the ΕU."
"The Socialist Group, the Greens, the liberals and anyone else celebrating the change in certain Commissioners as a victory for democracy, are deceiving people about the policy and character of the ΕU."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the Commission and we shall help to develop the grass-roots fight to reject and overturn the anti-grass roots policies which the election of the new Commission marks with the 'blessing' of all the governments of the Member States."
". Despite my reservations, I have voted in favour of the Barroso Commission."
"The positive image of a predominantly Christian Europe has suffered as a result of the propaganda campaign led by the Left in this House."
"Mr Barroso, Commissioners, you have also had the vote of Mr Fatuzzo of the Pensioners’ Party, within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I would like to call on President Barroso – who I am told is 48 years old and therefore very young – precisely because of his youth, to take seriously – as I am sure he will and as young people usually do – the fate and the problems of old people throughout Europe."
"Large numbers of the elderly, in fact, are in very difficult financial situations, since many of them have pensions which are hardly sufficient to pay for a glass of water and a slice of bread."
"In my opinion, coming to the aid of needy elderly people throughout Europe is one of the goals which we would be very happy to see achieved over these next five years."
"Mr President, the interesting thing about the last six weeks has been that we have proved that politics is not a zero-sum game, and that more than one institution can win when we have a dispute."
"The Commission has emerged from this process better equipped and more able to perform its tasks over the next five years."
"Parliament has benefited because we have demonstrated that we can control the executive and that we have an influence on the formation of the executive."
"That is good for this House."
"Turning briefly to my own area – I am now a member of the Committee on International Trade – Mr Mandelson performed extremely well in front of the committee."
"He demonstrated a firm grasp of the subject matter he will have to deal with over the next five years and he also showed a powerful desire to work with the European Parliament."
"These are all very positive things."
"Mr President, my delegation voted in favour of this Commission because all along we believed this was a matter of competence of the Commissioners."
"We were not happy with the original proposal, although we feel that if Mr Barroso had handled matters better we could have avoided the problems that arose."
"However, we recognise the difficulties he faced with certain governments."
"We still have reservations about this Commission and we will be looking to call it to account in the future."
"We will also hold the Commission to account on the promises President Barroso has made to Parliament today, not least in relation to human rights."
"I have this morning written to President Borrell, drawing his attention to the disgraceful incidents that took place last night and on Tuesday night in football matches between England and Spain, where there was racist abuse of black English players."
"I would like the Commission to take an initiative, along the lines of President Barroso's commitment, to deal with the problem of racism in football."
"Mr President, there was at least one good thing about removing the candidate Commissioner, Mr Buttiglione, from the new European Commission."
"It made it very easy for me today to vote against it."
"It is a downright shame – and we have to take note of this once again today – that a capable person is being sacrificed on the altar of political correctness, for the simple reason that he also has a personal conviction that does not appear to correspond to that of the majority in this Parliament."
"That in the light of the fact that the self-same Commission that we approved today includes the likes of Louis Michel, the personal friend, fellow worker and the help and stay of dictators with blood on their hands, such as Laurent Kabila in the past, or Fidel Castro these days."
"It is a disgrace, but at least we know where we stand."
"This Commission is politically correct; this Commission is intent on forcing even more sameness down our throats with the European Constitution."
"This Commission wants to saddle us with a non-European country like Turkey."
"We will not renounce our true European ideals."
"We will fight this Commission tooth and nail in the coming years."
"Mr President, the President of the Commission has referred to the composition of his team as a compromise."
"It is at any rate an unsatisfactory one."
"Following a hate campaign from the Left, Mr Buttiglione had to disappear on account of expressing opinions that are reported to be politically incorrect."
"It appears that the possible conflict of interests of which Mrs Kroes and Mrs Fischer-Boel are suspected is not a problem."
"Similarly, the Communist, Stalinist past of Mr Kovács does not seem to be an issue."
"This is simply a case of double standards, and that is all that has to be said on the subject."
"There is much talk about democracy, but in reality, freedom of opinion is being curbed, and no consideration is given to what the public wants."
"The issue of Turkey is a classic example of this."
"The new Commission intends to force through Turkey’s accession at all costs, against the will of the overwhelming majority of Europeans."
"That is another reason why today’s Commission is a Commission that does not deserve any support or confidence whatsoever."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a large minority of democrats in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe abstained, and it is in witness of the fact that I am offering you an explanation of vote."
"A comfortable majority had already supported and approved President Barroso in July."
"In October, his political authority was, however, weakened due to a lack of rigour, initially in connection with the Italian affair."
"As if that were not enough, no lessons were learned, either by certain Member States or by the President of the Commission, who gave way by agreeing to have at least one Commissioner – in fact, there are probably two – remain subject to suspicion because of a permanent risk of a conflict of interests."
"There are no doubts about the actual individual, who is to be commended; but her appointment is really quite unwise."
"We are disappointed. We shall distrust this Commission, and we shall make it our duty to monitor matters and be vigilant."
"Europe needs rigour and clarity."
"Good luck to this Commission if it can reach the end of its term of office."
"We have now concluded the explanations of vote."
"We have voted in favour of this report since it mainly gives an account of the European Ombudsman’s annual report for 2003."
"We object to the fact that the report refers both to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.We do not support these parts of the report in spite of the fact that we are voting for the report."
". I welcome this report, emphasising the importance of every European Citizen having the right to an accessible independent arbiter for impartial handling of their complaints."
"This remains loyal to Article 41 (Right to good administration) in Chapter V (Citizens' Rights) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"I applaud the report's call for even greater transparency within the European Institutions."
"I also agree with the point that an increase in the complaints to the Ombudsman over the past year may not necessarily be seen as a bad thing, as the facility is becoming more widely known throughout Europe as a practical port of call for complaints."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr De Rossa (A6-0030/2004)."
"I feel that the Ombudsman’s role in fostering accountability and democratic responsibility in the EU’s decision-making processes and in the administration of the EU represents a major contribution towards a Union in which decision-making is as genuinely close to the citizens as possible."
"Let us not forget that Parliament adopted unanimously the European Union Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and that the Commission has not adopted that Code."
"Furthermore, following a request from the European Ombudsman to amend the provisions of the Ombudsman’s Statute concerning his right of access to documents and the hearing of witnesses, Parliament recommended amending those provisions, but they have yet to be amended due to reservations on the part of the Commission and the Council."
"The Ombudsman’s role has had the positive effect of informing the citizens of their rights and obligations concerning the European Institutions. This House must therefore make every effort to hold a joint review of the Ombudsman’s Statute with the aim of making it more efficient and better able to address the citizens’ requests."
". Like the rapporteur, I endorse the ratification of the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2003, covering the latter part of the activities of the previous incumbent in the post and the first months of the current European Ombudsman’s activities."
"I should like to highlight the previous Ombudsman’s efforts towards public access to Community documents, towards total transparency in recruitment competitions, and in advocating that all Community acts directly concerning the general public have a proper basis."
"I should also like to emphasise the importance of putting forward a European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which only the Commission has yet to adopt."
"As regards the current Ombudsman, there are also positive signs, not least the appreciable increase in the number of complaints duly dealt with (30% in 2004)."
"Lastly, the document notes that the general public is not aware of the Ombudsman’s activities, given that an overwhelming percentage of complaints fall outside his competence."
"This only serves to demonstrate the need to support the various solutions which have been enshrined at EU level and which, in practice, fall short of what is required both in terms of the reasons why they were put forward and in terms of their own intrinsic value."
"Mr President, I raise this point while keeping in mind the difficulty that the President was facing."
"I was very unhappy that an ordinary Member of this Parliament – a backbench Member – wishing to raise a point of order was refused the floor and yet when the leader of a group asked for the floor, he was immediately accorded that right."
"As I said, I raise this issue mindful of the difficult circumstances in which we were conducting our business at that point in time."
"But it is important that one of the few rights that backbench Members of Parliament have, namely to raise points of order and to take part in sessions such as with these explanations of vote, is not eroded."
"The President should respect all Members equally in these circumstances."
"There is no preference for group leaders when it comes to points of order."
"I would ask you, in a gentle way, to point this out to the President of Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Martin, this will obviously be passed on to the President but, having been an eminent vice-president yourself, you know just how difficult these matters are."
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Côte d'Ivoire."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish firstly, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to express my delight in the decisions taken by the Security Council this week, particularly concerning the arms embargo, on condition however that this embargo is genuinely respected and that arms sales can be controlled much more effectively, as is also emphasised in the report presented by our colleague, Mr Romeva i Rueda."
"If, however, it is indeed a question of reacting firmly to the violence being committed in Côte d'Ivoire, we also have to take much longer-term action, and not only when the situation becomes untenable."
"That is why we think we need far-reaching reforms not only of France’s, but also of the European Union’s, policies on Africa. The reforms should relate, in particular, to issues of sustainable economic development in the foreign policy we conduct with regard to these countries."
"In the case of Côte d'Ivoire, it must, even so, be emphasised that the falls in the cost of raw materials and of cocoa have plunged a large portion of the population into extreme poverty, which is helping to destabilise the country still more."
"The European Union has also very recently renewed its fishing agreement with Côte d'Ivoire, which poses huge problems at a time when Côte d'Ivoire is in a state of civil war and there is no means of monitoring these fishing agreements."
"There are also the structural adjustment policies which have hugely destabilised the education and health systems and the public services."
"In short, all these policies – economic, commercial and financial – also play a considerable role in the political situation in these countries, a fact that obviously does not in any way detract from the responsibility of the African and Côte d'Ivoire politicians themselves."
"We most certainly need, however, to take long-term action to link these policies."
"Indeed, we cannot, on the one hand, advocate the development of armed forces in the North – albeit in the good cause of disarming forces to whom, incidentally, we have previously sold arms – and, on the other hand, help thrust whole populations into extreme poverty by means of inequitable and destructive financial and commercial policies, thereby making it that much more difficult to establish a democratic state governed by the rule of law."
"We therefore want to see the European Union steer a totally different course regarding Côte d'Ivoire and all the African countries so that all these aspects might be reconciled and so that we are not content merely to react – react though we must – to extremely difficult crises."
"Mr President, the dramatic events in Côte d'Ivoire have once again alerted us to the fragility of the situation in that country, which in the past was recognised as a great economic success in an otherwise very volatile region of Africa."
"People used to flock there in search of work and prosperity."
"The situation is very worrying because there has been clear incitement to violence."
"This is particularly resonant when one recalls that exactly the same situation arose in Rwanda, where the militias were urged to attack civilians, and French civilians in particular, in messages broadcast both on government and private radio stations."
"I welcome the fact that this incitement to violence through broadcasts has been dealt with in the UN resolution, but would also like to see the United Nations being granted, as part of its mandate, a peacekeeper's right to deal with such situations."
"The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is primarily about the blame game."
"When I was there around a year ago on an ACP-EP mission, there was a great deal of talk from the North and the South, the rebels and the government, about which side was responsible for the failure of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement."
"The resentment in that country is not just against France."
"The weight of history is now being used as a potent weapon to arouse popular resentment against President Gbagbo and France."
"Some fear that Abidjan is going the way of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country whose skyscrapers and boulevards now lie in ruins."
"My view is based on what I saw when I was in Côte d'Ivoire, and is that this confrontation is much more between African and African."
"It pits ethnic groups from the North against ethnic groups from the South and landowners against migrant workers who want to be landowners."
"It is also a confrontation over Côte d'Ivoire's most valuable asset, cocoa."
"What makes the situation particularly intractable is that there are issues that were never resolved at independence and which have continued to fester ever since."
"These are questions such as: who exactly is a citizen of the Ivory Coast?"
"Who can rule the Ivory Coast?"
"Who can stand for election in the Ivory Coast?"
"Who can own land in the Ivory Coast?"
"The northerners claim that they are being disenfranchised and are continuously being discriminated against by the elites – as they see them – in the South."
"The problems in Côte d'Ivoire will never be resolved until property rights and other demands are addressed."
"Finally, with reference to the UN resolution, I agree that the arms embargo is of great importance."
"What the previous speaker did not mention, however, was the very important fact that this embargo was strongly supported by the African Union, which is a very positive development."
"Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorises the use of force in the event of the arms embargo not being respected."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission how it will ensure the EU supports and works with the UN in its efforts in Côte d'Ivoire and takes stronger action, over and above Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, in respect of the situation there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this item is called ‘Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law’, and I believe that these principles should be generally observed, regardless of who is and who is not regarded to be a citizen of a certain state."
"We should not forget that in the case of one of West Africa’s most important countries, it was claimed for years that the democratic framework of society was stable, and the presence of several tens of thousands of Europeans and the relatively stable economic situation of one of the world’s largest exporters of cocoa meant that observers of events from Abidjan failed to notice the racial problems present in the country, and, above all, the inherent risk of tension between the Christian south, the Islamic north and any refugees."
"There can be no question that today’s difficult situation is the result on the one hand of rivalry between France and the United States over West Africa, and on the other hand of a deterioration in the country’s economic situation, which has triggered social tension and acted as a breeding ground for religious groupings of an extremist bent."
"Something which is particularly alarming is the number of acts of violence carried out against the civilian population on grounds of nationality, race and religion."
"Despite the fact that this issue involves a conflict between two imperialist powers, we must therefore do everything in our power to support the deployment of international peace troops, with a majority of these troops being African, as only in this way will we be able to put the basic conditions in place for the crisis to be resolved."
"This would also be one way of appeasing the anti-French sentiment aroused by the intervention of the former colonial power’s army."
"I do not believe it is appropriate to paralyse the regime’s air force merely because a number of opposition armed groups exist in the country, and should like to note that such measures offer no kind of solution to the situation."
"The only thing which is certain is that they bring nothing but suffering to the vast majority of citizens, as well as a deterioration of health and social services."
"We cannot look idly on while human rights are violated and while the population is incited to commit violence, destroy infrastructures and silence the opposition, and indeed putting an end to such actions is one of the aims of the motion for a resolution."
"I should like to urge you in favour of this resolution."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire has a whole host of varying causes, all of which require thorough analysis."
"As in the majority of West African countries, of course, there is tension between the Christian and animistic South and the predominantly Muslim North, as well as problems relating to borders, which were drawn by the colonial powers in a highly arbitrary manner and which generally separate ethnic groups, and sometimes even entire nations, living on either side of them."
"There is of course also economic and social instability, which is another consequence of the mistakes made by colonial powers. Yet there is one thing of which we must be aware; none of these factors can justify the use of violence or human rights violations."
"We must also remind those in positions of responsibility in these countries and within the Organisation of African Unity, or the African Union, of their duty to become heavily involved in achieving stabilisation in the region."
"Item 6 in our joint motion for a resolution – a resolution which is also supported by my group – could be interpreted as criticism of France, but I should like to make it clear that such criticism would be unfounded."
"It is of course true that everyone makes mistakes, France included, and it is indeed to blame for some of its colonial problems in West Africa."
"On the other hand, however, it must be said that without the French we would have absolutely no hope of ever putting an end to the murders, robberies and looting in Côte d’Ivoire."
"It is all well and good for this House to hold speeches and adopt resolutions, but it is the French soldiers, and sometimes French civilians, in Côte d’Ivoire who have to put their heads on the line for a peaceful solution."
"This is why we must show our solidarity with them."
"Item 6 of the resolution is not, as I understand it, a criticism of France, but of the other countries in Europe and the rest of the world which have left France to deal with this matter alone, very conveniently beating a retreat and shirking their responsibilities."
"I should therefore like to counter Mr Kohlíček’s comments by saying that the former imperial and colonial powers do, of course, have responsibilities, but it must also be said that without the French presence in Africa in the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union would have occupied central positions on the continent, and so France prevented these positions from falling under the control of the Communists and their expansionist ideology."
"Moreover, it would perhaps not have been possible to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, as we did yesterday, had there been no opposition forces in the 1970s and 1980s."
"Today we are faced with the responsibility of ensuring that a fresh start is made in Africa, by working in partnership with the nations of Africa and not by acting as a colonial tyrant."
"In order for a fresh start to be made, of course, the acts of violence must first come to an end."
"When this has happened, it will be important to achieve a new ethnic balance, to promote statehood, to build civil society, to solve problems relating to the different nationalities living within countries, and, above all, to bring about decentralisation."
"Experts on issues of church-based development aid, such as my colleague Mr Dess, are doing exemplary work in supporting decentralised projects, by which I mean not flagship projects, but projects which really help people."
"This is the way of the future; building democracy from grass roots upwards by means of local self-government, decentralised projects, helping people to help themselves and not – and this is another point upon which I agree with the critics – by means of flagship projects, which are more reminiscent of the colonial past."
"The responsibility is ours, as Europeans; we are grateful to France for acting on this responsibility, but we must be more proactive in building a genuine peace which is more than just a ceasefire."
"Mr President, nine French soldiers killed and 38 injured; 15 000 civilians in danger, and unacceptable violence."
"These figures reveal the disastrous consequences of the French intervention in Côte d'Ivoire."
"France’s role has proved ambiguous, as the whole of its African policy now is."
"What is the lesson to be drawn from these grave events in Côte d'Ivoire?"
"Global anarchy in the area of migration leads to grave dangers on which terrorism feeds."
"The Arab-Islamic world is in a state of high agitation, and the West is a privileged target for radical Islamists embarked upon the conquest of our continent, as demonstrated by the development of networks in Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, France or the Netherlands."
"Not wanting to regulate migratory flows constitutes a danger to the future of Europe."
"Like it or not, immigration is the key problem of the new century."
"It is time to correct a number of drastic mistakes and to think in terms of a balanced and realistic project of North-South cooperation that respects everyone’s identities, territories, cultures and religions."
"The only reasonable course for the European and African continents lies in close cooperation."
"Europeans and the French need to know that they have everything to gain from the success of better cooperation, for the balanced development of Africa will help loosen the threatening stranglehold of migration and help reverse the flows."
"It is with this aim in mind that we propose another North-South dialogue based upon confidence, honesty and the protection of our reciprocal vital interests."
"To paraphrase President Mbeki’s favourite quotation, it is time that something new in this area came from Europe."
"Very briefly and by way of exception, before Commissioner Figel’ speaks, I should like to congratulate him warmly on his election today, and to say that I am delighted that he is to be the first Commissioner to speak to this House today in this topical and urgent debate."
". Mr President, still on behalf of Mr Prodi's Commission, I would like to share with you some views of the Commission that simply reflect some of the concerns which you have raised now and which are raised in the resolution about the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and recent violations of human rights."
"The European Union has consistently expressed its deep concern at the violence by both camps since the start of the crisis in September 2002."
"While the situation improved slightly last year, it has deteriorated again since the beginning of this year, particularly recently."
"As Mrs Kinnock said, Côte d'Ivoire was known as an economically successful country, but clearly there is no long-term economic prosperity without political stability and respect for human rights."
"In March, the government security forces and parallel militias indiscriminately killed innocent civilians in Abidjan and committed massive human rights violations."
"We know that at least 120 people were killed."
"Abidjan has changed and Mrs Kinnock compared it to Kinshasa."
"As Mrs Aubert and others have stressed, several mass graves containing more than 100 bodies were discovered in June in the northern part of the country now controlled by the ex-rebels of the new forces."
"Freedom of expression and the media have been serially breached."
"On 1 November the main opposition newspapers were looted and vandalised by the young patriots."
"Pro-Gbagbo extremists took control of the public radio and television."
"They have been inciting violence against foreigners."
"International radio transmissions have been sabotaged."
"Another issue of concern is the government's decision to cut off electricity supplies."
"In the northern part of the country water supplies are also cut off."
"Under pressure from the international community, including the Commission, electricity supplies were resumed, only to be cut off again."
"If the government continues to cut electricity this will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe."
"The Commission is considering preparing a new humanitarian aid decision to improve the situation, notably in the north of the country."
"The international community must react to the situation and to the violation of human rights."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the UN sanctions, the arms embargo, the travel ban and the freezing of assets, not only for those who block the full implementation of the Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements, but also for anyone else found to be responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."
"The Commission fully supports the African Union and President Mbeki's mediation efforts."
"On 15 November President Mbeki met President-designate Barroso in Brussels."
"The Commission shares the concerns expressed by President Mbeki about Côte d'Ivoire's future."
"In August this year the Commission proposed to the Council that consultations be opened under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"At that time the Member States did not wish to proceed with the proposal."
"They did not want to jeopardise the Accra III Agreement, which was signed just a few days before."
"Recent developments and the non-implementation of the Accra III Agreement demonstrate the importance of opening Article 96 consultations to put pressure on the Côte d'Ivoire authorities to resume talks."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Tibet (the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for many years, and with every justification, Tibet was a focus of EU initiatives."
"Over recent months, though, the impression has unfortunately been that the voices calling for such initiatives are becoming rather more muted, in order to ensure that good trade relations are maintained with China."
"I am therefore delighted that this House has responded to the urgent need for joint measures, and made known its opposition to the imminent execution of the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, who was not given a fair trial, and whose execution is scheduled for early December, without there being any proof of his guilt."
"We therefore call on China, as a matter of urgency, to abandon its plans to carry out this execution, and to guarantee a fair trial in accordance with international legal standards."
"China must in any case put an end to its use of the death sentence in general – that is one of our key demands – and must also finally respect the religious freedom of the Tibetan people, a people which has used no violence in defending its rights and calling for these rights to be respected, thereby earning our deepest respect."
"At the forthcoming EU-China Summit, the Commission must express its concern at the use of the death sentence, and press for an acceptable solution to the Tibet issue as a whole."
"There are international precedents for such a solution, and it is our duty to make repeated reference to these precedents in order to secure the peaceful coexistence of Tibet and China."
"If there is to be a good partnership between the European Union and China, then Tibet is a key to it, and the performance of this task is for us a duty."
"Mr President, the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche was raised with me by several of my constituents in Scotland, including Iain Thom and Naomi Ness of the University of Edinburgh Tibet Society."
"On 3 December 2002, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche was condemned to death after being convicted of trumped-up and politically-motivated charges in a court in Tibetan China."
"He was framed for a crime he did not commit, and this is backed up by independent research by Human Rights Watch."
"He remains in Chinese custody, waiting to die, and his current whereabouts are unknown."
"However, Tenzin Delek has always maintained his innocence."
"He is quoted as saying: 'I have been wrongly accused."
"I have always said that we should not so much as raise a hand against another.'"
"Indeed, his moderate and peaceful way of dealing with the problems that the Tibetans face and with the repression in Tibet, his work as an active lama to foster Tibetan Buddhism, and his practical work in Tibetan communities have earned him many supporters."
"He is a symbol of Tibetan identity and a champion of the Tibetan cause."
"He is no friend of the Chinese authorities."
"The arrest, detention and sham trial of Tenzin Delek mark the culmination of a clampdown on his activities and on those of his associates who, even now, face severe penalties if they dare advocate on his behalf."
"The paradoxical silence that followed the death sentence on Tenzin Delek, who is such a popular figure, is attributed by Human Rights Watch to a campaign of intimidation and terror executed by the Chinese authorities."
"International human rights organisations have also expressed acute concern that he was tortured while being detained – a likelihood rather than a suspicion."
"Human Rights Watch also reports that he was denied the most basic of rights under international law: the right to a fair hearing."
"The Chinese authorities, claiming that state secrets were involved, still refuse to disclose what actually happened in court."
"In short, his trial was a sham."
"Regrettably, the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche must be placed in the context of a catalogue of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese authorities against the Tibetan people both in the Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan China."
"The systematic repression of all things Tibetan just about sums up Chinese policy on the matter."
"The European Parliament must send a clear message to China that this policy is unacceptable and it must do all it can to ensure the protection of human rights and the cultural, political, environmental and religious identity of the Tibetan people."
"The miscarriage of justice suffered by Tenzin Delek must be put right."
"I would therefore ask all Members to support this resolution."
"Mr President, in the past, large and growing populations have often sought out sparsely populated and remote areas as living space."
"That is always at the expense of the freedom and the culture of the people already inhabiting that area, if the culture concerned is different from the dominant culture."
"Tibet, which, like its neighbours East Turkestan or Xinjiang, has, against the will of its people, for a long time been recognised internationally as part of China’s territory, is no exception."
"Chinese people from the densely populated central and eastern areas of the country have been colonising that country, and many newcomers have taken on the role of civil servant, policeman or soldier."
"Opposition to this humiliating situation has been suppressed for many years with all, mainly violent, means."
"As is often the case in similar situations, it looks like the rulers in China do want the Tibetan territory but not the inhabitants."
"I am no admirer of the traditional theocracy in the old pre-1951 Tibet, which temporarily managed, in practice, to defy the authority of a China that was for a long time ravaged by war."
"Even so, I find the present situation wholly unacceptable and it seems to me sensible that China should negotiate solutions with the Tibetans in exile in India, led by the Dalai Lama."
"The problems are only growing if what the government terms as separatism is being punished with the death penalty or with a suspended death penalty."
"That also applies if prisoners are kept in isolation and tortured."
"A country that is into that kind of practice should certainly be prohibited from buying weapons from the EU Member States."
"Where relations with China are concerned, the main consideration for the Commission and Council should not be that this is a large country with a fast growing economy."
"Indeed, this is a country that refuses to release colonised peoples, puts economic growth above everything else and moreover, violates human rights."
"If Europe makes it clear that we do not consider this Chinese policy acceptable as a matter of course, then that would be a contribution to the much-needed change."
"Mr President, nearly two years ago, this House did everything in its power to prevent the execution of two Tibetans, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and Lobsang Dhondup."
"Despite the resolution we adopted unanimously, despite appeals from all over the world and demonstrations held in front of national parliaments, despite numerous vigils held by volunteers and despite strong protests voiced by diplomats, Lobsang Dhondup was executed in January 2003."
"His teacher, the highly-regarded lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, is facing the same fate in a matter of days, as his two-year reprieve will come to an end in two weeks’ time on 2 December."
"Rinpoche is still treated like a terrorist by the Chinese authorities, which continue to refuse him a proper trial and independent legal representation."
"His alleged confession to involvement in the bomb attacks was forced out of him, and his state of health is unknown after several reports of torture."
"The solitary confinement in which he is kept is a clear violation of the UN Convention against Torture."
"I concur with the view held by the three previous speakers, namely that our remaining silent would be the worst thing that could happen to a culture and a people we value."
"The real reason why Rinpoche has been imprisoned is his enormous influence on the population and his support for the Dalai Lama, which certain Chinese hardliners found intolerable."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I call on the European institutions to bring more pressure to bear on the Chinese authorities."
"I should like to remind Mr Figel’’ that this case must be raised at the EU-China Summit on 8 December, by which time it will hopefully not be too late."
"I should also like to remind the Council that this House has repeatedly made joint calls for a special representative for Tibet, who would be able to make a productive contribution to the finding of a peaceful solution."
"In 2008, the People’s Republic of China will host the Olympic Games, and the country is a permanent member of the UN Security Council."
"Yet how is China to gain trust or approval if it does not observe human rights or respect minorities?"
"We have had some experience of this in this House since Monday."
"People have joined in creating a mandala; people have been meditating."
"The monks who led them in these activities took the opportunity to tell us about their culture in Tibet, and what it would mean if it were to be destroyed, if it were no longer possible to speak in one’s native tongue in one’s homeland, and if visible manifestations of culture and religion were to be forbidden – this would be the worst thing that could happen."
"I was delighted that many Members of this House, including the previous speakers, as well as assistants, journalists and many visitors, were present at the creation of this mandala, which has just been completed."
"We greatly welcome the fact that China has made some progress, such as initiating dialogue with representatives of the Dalai Lama and releasing, after decades of martyrdom in various prisons, the nun Ngawang Sangdrol, whom we were delighted to welcome to the European Parliament, having, indeed, played a part in her release."
"Yet is this to be the end of such a reasonable approach?"
"Is it appropriate, in such a context, for sentences to be passed which have no kind of legal basis?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us use all our power and influence to ensure that the death sentence against Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is not carried out, and that he is given a fair trial in the presence of independent observers."
"The Chinese authorities must no longer resist the voice of common sense."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation being what it is, it is difficult to discuss the fate of Tibet and the fate of the Tibetan people without emotion and without personal involvement."
"The Tibetan people live in unique circumstances imposed by nature and have always been somewhat isolated from the surrounding world."
"They have developed a unique culture and a unique approach to international affairs."
"Yet for several decades, the Tibetan people have been subjected to fierce persecution by China, an imperialist and Communist country that took advantage of the fact that Tibet has never aspired to any kind of special international standing."
"Given the unique circumstances imposed by nature I mentioned earlier, Tibet has never seen any reason to send ambassadors to other countries or to aspire to any kind of international standing."
"In consequence of this, China declared it to be a state and a nation without sovereignty and without any right to sovereignty."
"The Tibetan nation and state did indeed have a right to sovereignty, but not in the sense in which this is generally understood in Europe."
"We are in the habit of recognising states if they have their own ambassadors and diplomatic representations and take part in international conferences."
"We cannot condone the unlawful actions of the Chinese authorities, as a result of which this peaceful nation has become a victim of Chinese imperialism."
"What we are now witnessing is the infliction of violence on this peaceful nation, a violence that is escalating and causing the mass exodus of Tibetans to Europe and to other countries round the world."
"We cannot condone the wholesale persecution of a peaceful society and the destruction of this society’s culture, language and religion."
"Nowadays, the world today is prepared to turn a blind eye to a great many wicked acts, provided these acts are committed by those who provide economic contracts and who offer the chance of some kind of material benefit."
"The House should not accept moral principles of this kind, principles held by people who would agree to a nation being eradicated from the international arena provided they gained some small material benefit."
"It might not even be that small a benefit; it might actually be quite considerable."
"We have tabled a joint motion for a resolution intended as an appeal to all the EU governments and those who will participate in the EU-China summit to ensure that China puts a stop to such persecution."
"In particular, we appeal for action to be taken on a very topical case involving a prisoner of conscience."
"We call for the release of the monk Tenzin Delek Rinpoche."
". Mr President, I sympathise with the people of Tibet."
"They lost their independence and cultural identity when columns of uninvited troops came over the border."
"Tibetans were forced to comply with foreign regulations aimed at changing their traditions and eliminating their country."
"I sympathise because the United Kingdom lost its independence and identity when a referendum on trade turned out to be a political take-over."
"Uninvited foreign regulations poured over the border attempting to change traditions and eliminate the country."
"I support the Tibetans in their peaceful struggle to leave the grip of China and hope that they will pray for the people of the UK in their struggle to leave the dead hand of the European Union."
"I respect the peaceful objectives of the Buddhist tradition of Tibet and realise that the rest of the world has much to learn from them."
"On Monday, the President told this Parliament that the First World War, a war in which both of my grandfathers defended their country, was a civil war."
"This is an untruth."
"I am aware that Tibet's proud history is also being rewritten by the same species of bureaucrat."
"If you do not learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it."
"I can only offer a little 1940's anglicised Latin in sympathy which I believe follows the Buddhist teachings, – don't let the bastards grind you down."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sentence from the Sichuan court ought not to have attracted the attention of the international press, since this is only one in a long line of death sentences imposed by the Beijing regime during the course of the long history of repression by the Chinese police of the Tibetan domestic struggle."
"One of the many – too many – ugly stories of common, ordinary, everyday violation of human rights."
"However, this was not how this story went."
"Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is an emblem: he is an important lama of Lithang county in Kardze, arrested in 2002 just after an attack in Chengdu."
"The procedures during the trial were clearly far from complying with international standards and the suspension of the death sentence is due to expire in two weeks’ time."
"Tenzin is a Buddhist monk who is very popular among Tibetans for his unshakable loyalty to the Dalai Lama, which he has openly professed on many occasions, and for always having refused to recognise the Panchen Lama chosen by Beijing in 1995."
"He is therefore a symbol that China wishes to eliminate and destroy."
"Europe should, especially within the framework of the forthcoming bilateral summit, forcefully demand that the death sentence imposed on Tenzin be lifted and, in more general terms, call for a moratorium on executions."
"Let us raise our voices, Commissioner Figel’, to prevent the umpteenth bloody, unjust, gory insult to Tibet and the Tibetans."
". Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation of the contribution being made by the European Parliament and its role in raising awareness through the activities it organises or provides space for, for instance here in Strasbourg."
"Respect for human rights in Tibet is a strong concern of the European Union and, as Mrs Lichtenberger said, 'a key item' on the agenda of the EU-China human rights dialogue."
"I fully share the view of Mr Mann that freedom of conscience is first among political freedoms."
"The European Union has on several occasions expressed concerns about individual cases in Tibet."
"The EU Troika raised the situation of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche in Beijing in September in the last round of the EU-China human rights dialogue and also in an ad hoc approach to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday this week, asking for information about his whereabouts and state of health."
"The Union expressed the hope that the death sentence imposed on him will not be upheld and called for a judicial review of the case."
"The European Union is fully committed to following this issue very closely."
"The execution of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche would send a very negative signal, clearly damaging the credit recently gained by the Chinese government through recent gestures such as the visit of special envoys of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, which were warmly welcomed by the international community."
"It would also be a very bad sign for EU-China relations, at a time when we are preparing for our annual summit."
"More generally, as part of its overall policy on Tibet, the European Union has called for many years and will continue to call for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, as the only realistic way to find a lasting solution to the question of Tibet."
"We consider the recent third visit of the Dalai Lama special envoys to China to be an encouraging sign of progress."
"In its dialogue with China, the European Union has already regularly expressed concern about the extensive use of the death penalty, referring to its long-standing position in favour of abolition."
"It has continued to press hard for at least the introduction of a moratorium."
"In the fight against terrorism, it has also stressed that this fight can only be successful if it is firmly rooted in respect for fundamental principles governing international relations, particularly as regards safeguarding human rights."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Human Rights in Eritrea."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Eritrea is escalating by the day."
"Painful as it is to say so, the reports we are receiving are getting increasingly alarming and increasingly tragic."
"No longer is the opposition merely being persecuted; its members are being locked up."
"Young conscientious objectors are being locked up, threatened with death, and – or so it is reported – even shot in large numbers."
"There is no longer such a thing as freedom of the press in Eritrea, where independent newspapers have been closed down. The country is fifth to last in the world press freedom ranking drawn up by Reporters without Borders."
"It is not only international protest which is now needed in Eritrea, but dialogue with civil society within the country itself, as the only way in which a peaceful coexistence can and will be re-established in the country is by sitting all the participants down at one table and endeavouring to reopen the channels of dialogue."
"The situation is tragic in the extreme, and I would ask you all to vote in favour of our motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, Eritrea has not had a fortunate history but I do not recall anything in its recent past which has been as atrocious as the situation is now."
"Looking at the motion, one finds that my country, Malta, and Libya find their place in the resolution."
"It was a great misfortune that some time ago a substantial number of Eritreans were forcibly repatriated to Eritrea."
"It was unfortunate because they did not have enough documentation that would have allowed them to apply for refugee status."
"They did not want to do this as at the time Malta was not part of the European Union and their original intention was to go to Italy."
"Although technically Malta was right, it was certainly not morally right."
"We now know that the fate of those Eritreans, through reports from one or two survivors who have managed to escape their country again, has been terrible."
"Many were incommunicado, many were tortured."
"An eye-witness has even said that a number have died or been murdered."
"I believe that, when faced with such a situation, the European Union has to take a different attitude to such a country."
"There should be no further dialogue because dialogue is not understood."
"Dialogue has broken down."
"We have to assert ourselves in a way whereby the Eritreans come to see the need for the European Union."
"Financial help and all forms of assistance may be withdrawn."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we are to discuss the state of human rights in Eritrea, we must first ask ourselves what kind of standard it can be compared against. We frequently talk of universal human rights, but I am not sure that our European understanding of such rights can always be applied in all countries throughout the world and in all cultural contexts."
"In spite of this, however, it must be said that for a number of years now we have witnessed attempts by some of the most reactionary regimes to use their support to promote the development of hotbeds of obscurantism and militant Islam in certain areas of the world, as well as to bring about a military solution to border disputes, for example in the case of Eritrea and Ethiopia."
"Although attempts were made in the past to establish democratic principles and peaceful cooperation with its neighbours, the situation in Eritrea has now become a great deal more complex, and there is a gradual deterioration in the majority of fields monitored by international organisations."
"Poor infrastructure, low levels of literacy among the population, a slow rate of economic growth and religious obscurantism are culminating in moves to draft more young people into the armed forces, with the response to such moves being attempts to leave the country."
"Whatever standards of human rights we apply, such a state of affairs cannot be passed over in silence."
"We must not stand idly by while members of the Eritrean parliament and foreign journalists are held in prison without any kind of formal charge, while freedoms laid down in Eritrea’s Constitution are violated, and while the fundamental requirements of international human rights conventions are contravened."
"We must take action in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, as already referred to by Commissioner Figel’."
"The motion for a resolution which has been tabled is a first step on the path towards change, as well as an attempt to help find a resolution to what appears to be a dead-end situation in one of the world’s poorest countries."
"I therefore call on you to vote in favour of this resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is focusing on the dramatic situation in Eritrea. One should rather say the dramatic situation which we are also faced with in Eritrea, as we face drastic developments of this kind in many African countries."
"In his speech yesterday to this House, President Mbeki gave a long list of African trouble spots, a list which it would have been impossible to give in full, although I do believe that the omission of Zimbabwe was not – unfortunately – a coincidence."
"Today, then, sees our debate on Côte d’Ivoire being followed by one on Eritrea, a country which has not been independent for all that long and which has already been involved in a bloody border dispute with its larger neighbour, Ethiopia."
"The country’s interior is equally divided, and the 1997 Constitution, under which civil rights, including religious freedom, are guaranteed, is not worth the paper on which it is written."
"Eleven former members of parliament, the ‘Asmara 11’, have been imprisoned since September 2001 without any charges against them."
"The African Human Rights Commission called for their release in March 2004, and it is a positive development to hear such calls coming from Africa itself."
"Journalists have been arrested, and, as has already been said, the country occupies the unenviable position of fifth to last in the world press freedom ranking."
"We are calling for respect for human rights, including those of all prisoners, and in particular those of the juveniles arrested on 4 November, who must also be allowed contact with lawyers and relatives."
"In particular, we are calling on the Council and the Commission to initiate the consultation procedure provided for under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, with the aim of preventing a regime of this kind from profiting from the privileges granted under this Agreement."
"At the same time, we must step up humanitarian aid and also give more support to all non-state actors fighting for no more and no less than the noble text of the 1997 Constitution."
"Mr President, the political dialogue which the European Union is having with the Eritrean authorities locally is being dominated by the worrying situation in terms of religious freedom."
"That was the Dutch Government’s response on 6 May of this year to broadly-based parliamentary questions on religious freedom in Eritrea."
"The draft resolution does not do justice to this important communication by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, and I very much regret that."
"Let us remind ourselves of the key facts."
"Firstly, general freedom of religion is enshrined in the Eritrean constitution."
"Secondly, a government decree of May 2002, however, prescribes the registration of all religious groups."
"Thirdly, this registration does not apply, though, to four of those religious groups, namely the Orthodox Christians, Muslims, Catholics and members of the Evangelical Church of Eritrea."
"Fourthly, many small Protestant churches were for years refused registration, their prayer houses being officially closed."
"Fifthly, according to a recent report of the US Administration, probably more than 200 members of non-registered groups are currently being detained."
"Sixthly, the Eritrean police is forcing members of non-registered churches to sign statements in which they renounce their religious convictions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is no shred of religious freedom in Eritrea."
"That is why I hope that the European Union will continue to pull out all the stops, preferably in tandem with the US Administration, which has given evidence of equal involvement in the case of serious violations of religious freedom in Eritrea."
"Indeed, this is an excellent opportunity to give shape to trans-Atlantic cooperation in a bid to uphold western values, which is desperately needed in the European Union of 2004."
". Mr President, Eritrea is a small country in Eastern Africa with four and a half million people, which only secured its independence in 1993 from Ethiopia after a bitter 30-year struggle."
"It then, foolishly, rapidly went on to fight another conflict, first with Yemen over fishing grounds around the Hanish Islands, and then in 1998, with Ethiopia again over disputed border territory."
"The latter dispute was only resolved in June 2000 after the loss of some 70 000 lives."
"To date, Ethiopia refuses to accept the award of the village of Badme to Eritrea by the International Border Commission, and there is a 4 200-strong UN peace mission at the border, although their work is made difficult by Ethiopia's failure to permit demarcation and Eritrea's restrictions on UN actions."
"Eritrea is a very poor country and alone in Africa – the other exception being the Democratic Republic of Congo – in postponing indefinitely the elections promised by President Afeworki's so-called transitional government under the 1997 Constitution and originally scheduled for December 2001."
"With this has come press censorship and imprisonment of journalists, including recently a Swedish citizen."
"The ruling People's Front for Democracy – a bit of a misnomer, I must say – remains the only legal party."
"However, a new party formed by exiles is the People's Liberation Front Democratic Party and this was established in 2002."
"Amnesty International describes the human rights abuses as appalling and catalogues the regular torture of political prisoners, including the Asmara-11 group of former parliamentarians."
"Recently, prisoners have been allegedly executed at the Adi Abeto military prison and the government of Sudan – itself a government not known for respect for human rights – now accuses Eritrea of aiding the Darfur rebels and their groupings."
"This country is in a tragic mess and my Group, the PPE-DE, calls upon the new Barroso Commission, confirmed in office today, to demonstrate its commitment to democracy and human rights in Africa by invoking the procedures under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and to see what further actions need to be taken to restore the rule of law and freedom to this country."
". Mr President, distinguished Members of Parliament, I appreciate your contributions, which were completely unequivocal."
"The Commission shares your views and is greatly concerned at the Eritrean Government's tightening of its grip in the area of human rights."
"The government is introducing restrictions on freedom of expression and the right to information, association and movement."
"Some of these points have been elaborated by Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Kohlíček."
"The Commission regrets that there are no indications that democratic reforms will be introduced in the foreseeable future."
"The restriction of religious freedom is part of the overall trend of severely restricting civil and political rights in Eritrea."
"The Commission is aware of recent reports from different international partners to the effect that the Eritrean government has violated human and religious rights and is restricting freedom of worship for some religious minorities."
"According to various sources of information, the government has harassed, arrested and detained members of non-approved religious groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, and adherents of the Baha'i faith."
"On 4 November, the Commission witnessed events in Asmara during which Eritrean security forces indiscriminately arrested thousands of youths suspected of evading military conscription."
"These arrests took place in the streets, shops and offices, at roadblocks and in homes."
"Those arrested are being held in army prisons and are thought to be at serious risk of ill treatment."
"Reports say that some have been shot dead and that many more were wounded following a disturbance at one prison."
"Relatives and lawyers have no access to the prisoners."
"So what is being done?"
"The Commission is endeavouring to address the problem through support for NGO projects in Eritrea in the areas of human and civil rights awareness, strengthening of civil society organisations and independent media."
"Eritrea is a focal country under the European initiative for democracy and human rights and is allocated EUR 1.6 million per year from this budget line."
"It has been difficult though to identify civil society and human rights projects because of the weak capacity of local civil society and the fragile political situation."
"Secondly, the Commission considers that we are seeing a pattern of human rights violations and, in coordination with Member States, is closely following developments."
"The Commission is analysing the situation and will soon present proposals on the basis of Cotonou Agreement, as was called for by Mr Kohlíček, Mr Gahler and Mr Tannock."
"However, the Commission must emphasise that it has been very difficult to establish dialogue with the government of Eritrea."
"Now that it has been established, the Commission considers that it should be pursued with a view to seeking improvements in the internal situation and external relations."
"We wish to avoid threats and feel that confidence-building is more likely to contribute to an improvement of the human rights situation."
"The Commission will continue, as part of this dialogue, to address human rights violations, and in particular the case of the so-called Asmara-11 group and the continued detention of independent journalists."
"In conclusion, on regional relations, the European Union is anxious, as a witness to the Algiers agreement on the solution of the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, to maintain open, balanced and measured dialogue with both parties."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The vote will take place next."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions debated this afternoon."
"(1)"
"Mr President, we propose the inclusion in this resolution of item 20 of the excellent report tabled yesterday by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on the lifting of the arms embargo on China."
"If you will allow me, I would like to read out the text of this item; ‘calls on the Council and the Member States to maintain the EU embargo on trade in arms with the People’s Republic of China and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arms sales; considers that this embargo should be maintained until such time as the EU has adopted a legally binding Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and the People’s Republic of China has taken concrete steps towards improving the human rights situation in that country, inter alia by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and by fully respecting the rights of minorities’."
"That is the original wording, which met with general approval, and so we propose that it be included at this point."
"Before voting on Mr Mann’s oral amendment, does anybody object to the presentation of the amendment?"
"(2)"
"(3)"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 18 November 2004."
"Before beginning this afternoon’s sitting, I would like to draw your attention to three important issues affecting us at the moment, two of which appear on our agenda."
"The first is Ukraine, on which we are going to hold a debate and to which Parliament is going to send a delegation this very evening."
"I would like to point out that Mr Taraschuk, Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on European Affairs, is with us today."
"As you know, we were expecting a visit from the President of the Ukrainian Parliament today, but given the events taking place in his country, he cannot be with us, and Mr Taraschuk is therefore here in his place."
"I must inform you that at 5 p.m. there will be an extraordinary meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, at which Mr Taraschuk will appear."
"As you know, committees do not normally hold meetings at the same time as a plenary session, but I believe it can be justified in this case given the exceptional circumstances."
"So at five o'clock Mr Taraschuk will appear before an extraordinary sitting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The second issue is an anniversary which does not appear on the agenda; I believe, however, that Parliament should acknowledge the fact that, a year ago, a group of distinguished Israeli and Palestinian figures met in Geneva to sign a peace agreement on the Middle East based on the peaceful coexistence of two viable States, demonstrating that there are indeed solutions to the difficulties – borders, settlements, security, refugees and the Jerusalem problem – which have always left the negotiations in deadlock."
"This initiative was not the only one from civil society, and nor was it intended to replace the Roadmap or the work of the Quartet."
"The protagonists of that event cannot be with us today, neither can Mr Yossi Beilin or Mr Abed Rabbo, but it is an honour and a pleasure for this Parliament to welcome Naomi Chazan and Ali Rashid, who are listening to our debate from the gallery."
"We welcome them and the people they represent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that there is still a long way to go and there are many obstacles to overcome before the Middle East peace process can be revived."
"The coming elections in Palestine will offer a good opportunity to contribute to the development of freedom and democracy there, and to this end it will be necessary to guarantee the free movement of the electorate and the opportunity for everybody, including the inhabitants of East Jerusalem, to register on the electoral roll."
"I would like to point out, finally, that last week, at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents, the King of Jordan told us that there was a path to peace, but that that path would only remain open for two years."
"I would ask that we do everything possible to achieve peace for the peoples of the Middle East."
"The third issue I would like to mention appears on the agenda, since today is World AIDS Day, and this Parliament is going to hold a debate on it."
"It is an extremely serious issue: 3 million deaths in 2004; 40 million human beings infected in the world."
"We shall remember this in our debate and express the European Union and the international community’s enormous concern."
"The fact that more and more women are suffering from this disease, increasing the vulnerability and inequality they face, means that we are unfortunately talking about the feminisation of the AIDS pandemic."
"By dealing with this dramatic issue today through the European Commission’s statement and our debate and resolution, we wish to express our concern at this extremely serious situation, a concern which I have personally expressed in a press issued before the beginning of the plenary session."
"We shall now proceed to the establishment of the order of business."
"A revised corrigendum to the agenda for today's and tomorrow’s sittings has been distributed and, following the meeting of the Secretaries-General last Monday, I am proposing a series of changes which have been approved by the majority of political groups."
"The first relates to the removal of the Statements on the Summit between the European Union and Russia."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I will allow you to speak as well, but please allow me first to finish describing the changes proposed by the meeting of the Secretaries-General."
"Secondly, it is proposed that, following the statement on AIDS, we add the report by Mr Coelho on standards for security features and biometrics in EU citizens' passports."
"It is also proposed that the report by Mr Mulder on amending budget No 10/2004, and not No 11/2004, of the European Union for 2004, be approved in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure and that it be voted on tomorrow, Thursday."
"At the end of the agenda for today, Wednesday, it is proposed that we add a joint debate on two reports by Mr Gauzès on the agreements providing for measures on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments between the European Community and the Republic of San Marino and the Principality of Monaco respectively."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit wished to speak in relation to these changes to the agenda, but first I would like to point out that Mr Farage has proposed another change, which he will talk about as well."
"Mr President, our group contests the decision to change the agenda concerning a statement and the tabling of a resolution on the EU-Russia summit, a decision that was made by the secretaries-general and not by the Conference of Presidents."
"Firstly, we find it scandalous that, apparently, the results of the summit can be found in the debate on Ukraine."
"The debate on Ukraine is a debate about freedom and democracy in Ukraine and has nothing to do with relations between the EU and Russia."
"Those are two completely separate issues."
"Secondly, Mr President, if the EU-Russia summit did not bear fruit, then that must be debated."
"As a European Union and as a Parliament, we cannot allow Mr Putin to hold us hostage."
"We are independent, and if Russia blackmails the EU over Ukraine, then that blackmail must be condemned."
"We therefore request a roll-call vote here and now – because after all there has been no meeting of the Conference of Presidents and this was a decision taken at secretary general level – to decide whether or not we should hold a debate right now on the serious state of relations between Russia and the EU."
"The reason given why we should not hold such a debate here is that one will be held in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"What we want is a debate in plenary today on the situation between Europe and Russia."
"As events unfold, we will promptly request a roll-call vote so that the debate can get underway."
"I must inform the House that Mr Farage has put a request to the Presidency of Parliament, in accordance with Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, that the agenda for the plenary sitting be amended, replacing an oral question to the Commission on football in the European Union with another oral question relating to the approval of the Commission."
"Mr Farage, you will take the floor, but first of all I would like to make it very clear that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, your request is late, for two reasons at least: because it has not been presented within the time limits laid down and because the request for an oral question to the Commission has not been presented within the time limits laid down either."
"Your recourse to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure is, therefore, correct from a formal point of view but, from a procedural point of view, the time limit has passed."
"Nevertheless, the President is going to apply the corresponding Rule and, accordingly, allow you to propose your change to the agenda."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, you have one minute in which to do so."
"Mr President, the last time I spoke in Strasbourg it seemed to cause a little bit of a stir."
"All I was doing was getting up and telling the truth, but perhaps the time between my telling people about Mr Barrot and the vote was not long enough for people to really think it through."
"So what we have done as a Parliament is approve a Commission without having access to the full information available."
"That simply cannot be right and I am asking under Rule 108 – and yes, I do think that football may be important, but this is rather more important – that Mr Barroso come here this afternoon so he can explain to us the circumstances of Mr Barrot’s appointment and we can discuss why our scrutiny procedures failed so dismally."
"Then perhaps we can seek some assurances from Mr Barroso that next time things are going to be different."
"What could be more important here today in this European Parliament than having this debate?"
"This Commission, like the Commission that went before it and the one before that, starts under the most enormous shadow and I do not think that these European institutions will have any credibility at all unless we have this debate."
"At the last part-session, we were told by Mr Farage that there were good reasons why the French Commissioner should not in fact become a member of the Commission."
"This House ridiculed Mr Farage’s comments and accused him of being misinformed."
"It has now become apparent that his information was correct, and that the vote took place at a time when everyone was sure that this Commissioner was beyond reproach."
"To put it another way, the vote took place when this House was in possession of false information."
"Parliament must reopen the debate on this issue, and I should like to lend my whole-hearted support to Mr Farage’s proposal."
"Mr President, we MEPs do of course have an interest in receiving all the information available, and we must in future continue to ensure that all information is passed on to the Members of this House."
"I would, though, like to emphasise something that Mr Farage had to acknowledge in the Conference of Presidents, namely that we have to take account of the legal position in different countries, and that applies in this case too, in which the punishment has been wiped from the record, so that no penalty has in fact been imposed."
"So it was that an absolute majority of us in the Conference of Presidents were of the opinion – as, I think, we are here today – that reopening this case would do nothing to change our decision in favour of this Commission, and would result only in a pointless debate."
"We have elected this Commission, and we will back it up in order that it can get on with its job."
"That it has started to do, and so we should move on to the important points on the agenda."
"I might add, Mr President, that I wish to move that, in view of the urgency of the debate on Ukraine, we should pass on to it as soon as this item on the agenda has been dealt with."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Ukraine."
". – Mr President, let me start by saying that I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you the situation in Ukraine after the presidential elections and the state of the relations between the EU and Ukraine."
"Five weeks ago I said that Ukraine was at a crossroads, with presidential elections which would determine the direction Ukraine is going during the next four years."
"We have all seen what happened since then."
"And I think that we all agree that the elections of 31 October and 21 November were not free or fair and did not live up to international standards."
"Javier Solana explained that message to your Foreign Affairs Committee last Wednesday."
"I will explain what we have done since then, how we see the current situation and what steps should be taken next."
"The EU has not stood by and watched."
"Before the elections, we called on the Ukrainian authorities, through telephone calls and otherwise, to ensure the elections were free and fair."
"Immediately after the elections the presidency issued a declaration, on the basis of the report by the OSCE/ODIHR, expressing its concern about the election process."
"On the same day, Monday 22 November, the Ukrainian Ambassadors in all EU capitals were summoned to receive this message."
"This was, as you know, in line with the Council Conclusions."
"On 24 November the presidency asked Ambassador Biegman to go as its special envoy to Kiev, where he was joined later by Javier Solana, in order to stimulate a dialogue between all parties."
"That day, we also expressed our regret about the fact that the Central Election Committee made the results of the elections public and declared Mr Yanukovich the winner of the elections, despite the large number of complaints about the election process."
"That regret concerned the procedure and the timing, not the winner or the loser."
"The presidency was pleased that the Supreme Court of Ukraine on Wednesday decided to take the complaints on the election results into consideration and blocked the official confirmation and publication of the election results, thereby stopping the process of installing a new President."
"Over recent days the EU has been in very close contact with the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the US and Russia, since solving the situation in Ukraine requires a concerted effort and sending a similar message to the Ukrainians."
"Prime Minister Balkenende, in his capacity of President of the European Council, has been working behind the scenes constantly."
"In his conversations with President Kuchma, Mr Lytvyn, the Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament, and others, he has underlined the EU’s position, including the EU’s call on all sides to show restraint and to express themselves in a non-violent manner."
"Foreign Minister Bot has talked to, amongst others, his US, Russian and Ukrainian counterparts."
"Furthermore, High Representative Javier Solana and the personal representative of the EU Presidency ambassador, Mr Biegman, are also fully engaged in helping to solve the crisis."
"In fact, as we speak they are both in Kiev for a second time to try to reduce the political tensions caused by the discussion about possible autonomy and hence a possible split in Ukraine."
"Polish President Kwaśniewski, as chair of the Council of Europe, and Lithuanian President Adamkus are also in Kiev to contribute to finding a solution for this crisis."
"We are also worried about signals that the parties would not talk to each other any more."
"Therefore, more recently the presidency has called on all parties to meet again as they did during the round-table talks on 26 November this year and to live up to the agreements made there."
"Respecting the unity of Ukraine is essential to a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"We have made it clear that any use of force is to be condemned and that the European Union is willing to continue to play a supportive role in the resolution of the conflict."
"How do we see the way ahead in this situation of political tension and a potential further rift within the Ukrainian society?"
"The current situation requires a political answer which fits in with Ukrainian legislation and which respects the rule of law."
"Any solution should ensure that the Ukrainian electoral system regains the trust of the Ukrainian people."
"We have to make sure that the people trust that the outcome of the process reflects their will."
"Frankly speaking, I do not see how all the complaints that have been filed on the second round of elections can be solved so that the outcome of this round of elections is ultimately acceptable to all."
"In such a case, a new, second round of elections may be the only way out."
"We then have to ensure that they are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner, with a level playing field for all candidates across Ukraine."
"This requires sufficient international and local observers, media that can freely report on the election campaign and people who can vote truly freely, without outside pressure."
"This applies to the whole election process, from the start – when the candidates present themselves – to the final tallying by the Central Election Committee."
"It requires a situation where the most hotly contested issues, such as absentee balloting and local election observers, are addressed beforehand."
"I do not want to discuss individual persons."
"It is not the EU’s position to support one candidate over the other."
"What the EU’s position about – and we have insisted on this from the very start – is that the process should be transparent, free and fair, so that the Ukrainian people can trust that the outcome of the elections reflects their will."
"Only then can we ensure that the new President is the President of all Ukrainian citizens, and not just of those from the east or from the west."
"That way, territorial integrity will also be maintained."
"The crisis in Ukraine does not require just the EU to act."
"It requires an involvement from all international players, such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the US and Russia."
"Ukraine is not only an important neighbour of the EU, it is also probably the most important neighbour of Russia."
"That is why the presidency has stayed in close contact with the Russian authorities and why it was discussed at the EU-Russia Summit."
"We both support the Ukrainians in their search for a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people, ensures the territorial integrity of Ukraine and contributes in the long run to a stable, free and prosperous Ukraine under a President of all Ukrainian citizens."
"We should not support one candidate over another; we should support the achievement of democratic standards characterised by transparent procedures and legal recourse."
"In addition to an electoral process that cannot be trusted, there is another possible cause that might create a decisive rift in Ukrainian society."
"That is a situation where violence or force takes over from the legal, constitutional process."
"Therefore, together, we have put severe pressure on all involved to refrain from violence or the use of force."
"The coming days will be crucial for Ukraine and for the relationship between the EU and Ukraine."
"With our engagement, we want Ukraine to succeed as a strategic and democratic neighbour."
"We want to cooperate with Ukraine in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, with shared democratic values at its base."
"The presidency understands the European Parliament’s hesitance to discuss the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan for Ukraine in the current situation."
"Like the European Parliament, the Council will reflect on its policy in the light of further developments."
"But I think we all want to engage Ukraine in a closer and more intense relationship."
"The potential is there."
"As a start, Ukraine has to deliver on democratic values."
"Therefore, in closing, I say that we should express our support to all those on both sides who are peacefully and democratically expressing their views and their political aspirations."
"We urge the people of Ukraine to work together with the international community to resolve the current political crisis."
"We have to find a solution that ensures that Ukrainians can trust that their will is reflected; a solution away from violence and the use of force, and one which guarantees that the territorial integrity of Ukraine is maintained; in short, a solution which is acceptable to all Ukrainians."
"Let us hope that together we can help Ukraine to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that I too want to firmly advocate a non-violent solution in Ukraine, and I would like to follow on from what Mr Nicolaï has said today about the situation there."
"I might add that the Commission was constantly involved in all these efforts at mediation, and that it too, of course, has been very concerned from the outset about the evident disregard of fundamental democratic principles in the latest Presidential elections."
"It is clear from the OSCE Electoral Observation Mission’s reports of grave and really systematic irregularities that the results as officially announced do not correspond to what the Ukrainian electorate wanted, and it follows that the EU as a whole, and hence also the Commission, cannot accept the results of the elections."
"Honourable Members will be aware that this is the position adopted by the Ukrainian parliament too, in a resolution passed by an overwhelming majority."
"There was therefore no mistaking the message from the European Union that the democratic decision of the Ukrainian people had to be adhered to."
"At the same time, of course, we have to engage in active crisis management if a peaceful resolution of this crisis is to be achieved – I can endorse what Mr Nicolaï has already said."
"Ambassador Biegman was despatched to Ukraine to take initial soundings as to what might be done."
"He then had these discussions on 25 November – as this is well-known, I will not discuss it at length – and it was on this basis that the first conciliation mission was sent, which involved Poland’s President Kwaśniewksi, Lithuania’s President Adamkus and the High Representative Javier Solana seeking out facts and, of course, engaging in constant dialogue."
"The Secretary-General of the OSCE, Mr Kubiš was also involved, and that, I believe, was very important."
"These conversations, and Ambassador Biegman’s preliminary discussions, produced the first alternatives and first potential solutions, a process in which a re-run of the run-off presented itself more and more as a probable way out."
"The Ukrainian parliament also voted for a re-run of the second round of elections."
"Moreover, as you will be aware, Yushchenko has gone to the Supreme Court to contest the election results."
"As Mr Nicolaï has already said, it is of the essence that there be a political solution to the problem."
"While a political solution is admittedly not yet in sight, the second Round Table has now begun."
"There is no agreement among its participants on whether there should be a completely new second round of the elections or whether new elections should be held in only a few districts."
"Support for Mr Yanukovych, the Prime Minister, is in any case declining, as became evident in the Ukrainian parliament this morning, where members adopted a motion of no confidence in his government, which they did by an overwhelming majority of 228 votes in favour, one against and three abstentions."
"I take the view that two fundamental principles are essential if there is to be a solution."
"The first is that democracy must be safeguarded."
"The people of Ukraine must be free to take decisions on their country’s future."
"This is not, then, about taking the side of one candidate or about intervening in a dispute about the practicalities of an election; what is at stake is, quite simply, the defence of recognised democratic principles."
"The second is that we need stability, both in Ukraine itself and in terms of its territorial integrity."
"Ukraine must remain intact as a viable state."
"Dividing the country would result in a grave crisis, hence the statements that all of us – that is, the various European institutions – have made about territorial integrity."
"Just before this debate, I spoke with Mr Tarasyuk, the former foreign minister, who is present in the visitors’ gallery. He assured me that it would not be from the opposition that the first move towards violence would come."
"What that means is that they want a peaceful solution, and that is what we too are working towards."
"I would like to consider two issues that have arisen over and over again in the past few days and are hanging over us: have we – that is, the European Union – done enough to help Ukraine move to democracy and to a market economy?"
"I believe that we have."
"We have done what we could."
"For a start, the EU is not just the largest donor to Ukraine, having, since 1991, allocated over EUR 1 billion to it under TACIS and other programmes, much of which was – and is continuing to be – used for programmes promoting democratisation, institutional reforms and human rights initiatives; it has also always offered Ukraine a specific and clear perspective."
"Since 1991, and particularly since the entry into force of the partnership and cooperation agreement in 1998, we have stepped up our cooperation in many areas, giving particular support to economic and social reforms."
"A particular feature of that is your House’s dialogue with the Ukrainian parliament."
"Now, as part of the European neighbourhood policy, we want to considerably build up this partnership."
"You will be aware that the object of the European neighbourhood policy is to establish a ring of friends around the enlarged Union."
"The action plans devised for this offer each and every partner a perspective that is ambitious, but above all tailor-made."
"They contain, for example, joint actions on justice, energy and environmental issues and strengthened trading relations, that is to say, an opportunity to play a part in the internal market, and, ultimately, partial integration into it, that is to say participation in what we call the four freedoms."
"Although the issue of Ukraine’s accession to the EU does not at present arise, we have made it clear that we are not shutting any doors."
"I will also say loud and clear what Mr Nicolaï has already said, namely that the quality of our partnership depends, of course, on the quality of democracy in Ukraine."
"It is precisely because the EU has a strong interest in relations with Ukraine that we expect from it an ongoing commitment to European values."
"This morning, the Commission did of course discuss what plans of action we have for Ukraine, and these plans of action are very definitely on the agenda for the next meeting of the Commission."
"We will of course be closely monitoring developments in Ukraine, and will be coming to a decision next week."
"In so doing, we will of course, take full account of Parliament’s position, and so I am very interested in what your views are on this issue."
"The Commission will continue to implement the measures that are already in place in support of democracy and civil society, of which the general public are of course the main beneficiaries."
"I believe we are sending exactly the right message in support of the popular struggle for the establishment of fundamental democratic values."
"I can tell you right now that, as soon as the Ukraine decides to repeat the elections in a way that really does adhere to democratic criteria, we will bring European instruments into play to support them."
"It is of course Ukraine that has responsibility for the elections being properly conducted, but, at the same time, it is crucial that the OSCE’s recommendations be acted on in organising and administering them if renewed irregularities are to be prevented."
"What that means in particular is that both the electoral legislation and the practical conduct of the elections must be substantially improved."
"There is also a need to ensure fair reporting in the media, and we can already see the first small improvements in reporting by the electronic media."
"The Commission is currently examining to what extent our rapid response mechanism and other resources can be used to support this election process, as they were in support of the Georgian electoral authorities in January 2004."
"Images from every corner of Ukraine show us how millions of Ukrainians are living out their fundamental democratic freedoms under adverse and tragic conditions."
"These images remind us all of the non-violent citizens’ movements of 1989, which made it possible for the division of the continent of Europe to be overcome."
"The European Union and all its European citizens are solidly behind Ukraine."
"The European Commission, too, will continue to do everything it can in this historic process of transformation in order to be able to work closely with Ukraine."
"When it comes to promoting and exporting stability and Europe’s fundamental principles, the European neighbourhood policy is an essential instrument."
". Mr President, I welcome the Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s European Affairs Committee."
"Let me draw the House’s attention to the fact that we are witnessing an unprecedented revolution in Ukraine."
"A vibrant, true democracy is being born before our very eyes."
"Almost a quarter of a century ago similar events took place in the Gdansk shipyard where Solidarność was born."
"Then as today they captivated the minds of the whole of Europe."
"We are all watching the emergence of true civil society."
"People are raising their heads and, just as in 1980, they do so against all the odds."
"Then the response of most European democracies was clear."
"The message then was that the people on the other side of the Iron Curtain had a right to freedom."
"Just as then, all the political families in the European Parliament stand united in their unequivocal support for democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine."
"We all stand together in our condemnation of manipulation and electoral fraud."
"Our support is for democracy, and not for a particular candidate or party."
"On democracy there can be no divisions among us."
"Today we are all Ukrainians."
"We all speak the same language, as is shown by the resolution on Ukraine – jointly agreed by all groups."
"This is the language of democracy, human rights and freedom."
"We owe that to Ukrainian society and to its nascent democracy."
"Just a few days ago Ukraine seemed a distant place."
"Today we understand Ukraine better and feel closer to the country, which is one of our most important neighbours."
"Ukrainian society has shown us not only its political maturity, but also its adherence to our common European values."
"Undoubtedly one of the most important missions of the European Union is to promote democracy and the rule of law."
"The Union does so, as the Treaty says, by placing individual rights and freedoms at the heart of its activities."
"We cannot stand idly by when human dignity and democracy is trampled upon."
"We cannot recognise the results of the second round of elections in Ukraine, which were manipulated and falsified."
"We cannot accept the disregard of the wishes of the people of Ukraine."
"We have to reject all allegations that, by expressing its support for the Ukrainian people’s right to exercise democratic rights, the European Union is encouraging violence."
"On the contrary, we appeal for a peaceful solution and dialogue."
"All neighbours carry a great duty of responsibility as regards the situation in Ukraine, including Russia."
"Our duty is to act."
"We are bound to call on the Ukrainian authorities to cancel the second round of the presidential elections and to organise a rerun of the second round, but not new elections that would eliminate current candidates."
"This should be done before the end of the year and under the full scrutiny of international observers."
"The European Union and other international bodies should do everything to guarantee full transparency of the electoral process, which should meet all democratic standards."
"We look with hope to the role played by the Ukrainian Parliament, Supreme Court, international mediators and the free media."
"The EU should use all means to secure the democratic character of the elections."
"We should envisage two scenarios."
"The first negative, meaning violation of democracy and the eventual introduction of sanctions against the undemocratic regime."
"The second positive, meaning generous assistance and a helping hand if democracy wins in Ukraine."
"The European Parliament should also strongly encourage safeguarding of the country’s integrity, carried out in a peaceful manner."
"We share the Council’s and Commission’s assessment of Ukraine as a key neighbour and partner."
"If the rerun of the second round of the presidential elections meets international standards, we should ask the Council and the Commission to speed up implementation of the action plan for Ukraine and, as a priority, to focus on the development of civil society."
"If Ukraine takes a positive step towards democracy, we should do more, act more quickly, and consider giving more relevance and true content to our new neighbourhood policy towards Ukraine and a new impulse to our eastern policy under the CFSP."
"We should move beyond rhetoric."
"Let us multiply the links between the European Union and Ukraine in all possible areas – education, culture, entrepreneurship, trade, investment, to name just a few."
"If realities on the ground allow, we should grant Ukraine the status of a market economy and more access to our markets."
"We should also allow for more flexibility in the visa system."
"These concrete moves will constitute the best recipe for strengthening the emerging democracy on the doorstep of the European Union."
"We should express – and not only verbally – our solidarity with the Ukrainian people."
"We should keep doors open to Ukraine’s European aspirations."
"If democracy prevails in Ukraine, it will be a triumph of values which are enshrined in all our European constitutional charters."
"I end by saying in Ukrainian, perhaps for the first time in this House: Європейсъкий парламентвітає демократію в Україні!’ – the European Parliament greets democracy in Ukraine."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by welcoming Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"Commissioner, we have had a hand in somewhat extending the time you had to prepare yourself for your new office, but that had nothing to do with you."
"By way of a word of welcome, let me tell you that you are for all of us the Commissioner for Foreign Relations of the whole European Union, and we offer you our constructive cooperation in the hope that it will reinforce peace in the world."
"There are fine moments to be had in this House, and I have just enjoyed one of them."
"The applause for Mr Saryusz-Wolski, who has just spoken, shows that we are united."
"Speaking on behalf of our Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I can say that, when peace and democracy are at stake, when it comes to peaceful coexistence and the securing of fundamental citizens’ rights, which the state must guarantee if it is to deserve to be described as a democracy, then we are all on the same side, and that is one of the good things about Europe."
"Over and above the gulfs that separate us in other respects, there are things we all want, and we Social Democrats are quite clear in our own minds what those things are: fundamental citizens’ rights, fundamental citizens’ freedoms, above all else the unrestricted right to vote, the sovereign right to determine who runs the state – all that is traditional European democracy."
"I agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski that, if the Ukrainians are now on the move towards this model of democracy, they will need more than anything else the help of the most successful model of multinational democracy in the world – that being the European Union, in defence of which we in this House should be united!"
"Discussing these things in the European Parliament is, of course, a straightforward matter; things are much more difficult in Kiev and in the countryside, and there are two crucial factors that must define the roles of all who are currently actively involved, both those based in Ukraine and with responsibilities in that country, and those whom we have sent there, where they act on our behalf."
"I have not been there, nor am I going there – a delegation from our group is going there today and will assuredly get a much clearer impression than we will – but, when I see these pictures, it becomes clear to me that what there is on the ground is such a mass movement, with the power of the state on the one side colliding with the popular will on the other, that it will be very difficult to steer and direct it, and there is little distance to be covered between a peaceful solution and a bloodbath."
"This is a responsibility to be assumed by all – by those who bear responsibility in Ukraine, and by those who remind them what their responsibility is."
"What we need is a peaceful solution, one that will make the people sovereign while maintaining the country’s unity."
"I might add that that is not only in the Ukrainians’ interests, but also in our own most essential interest."
"For Europe too, a divided, fragmented or destabilised Ukraine would be fatal."
"For that reason, we take pride in the fact that the European Union is conducting conciliatory dialogues on the ground, and we see this as an opportunity."
"It also shows that it is not the European Union alone that gives itself important tasks, but that it is also sought out as a partner in dialogue and accepted as a mediator."
"I take pride in the fact that our friends Javier Solana and Aleksander Kwaśniewski are playing key roles in negotiating between the parties – the involvement of the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Relations and the President of Poland is a good sign, for President Kwaśniewski, as you so rightly said, represents a country that has successfully been through this process, and Javier Solana was once a minister in a country – and a member of a party – both of which had freed themselves from a dictatorship."
"So we now have two men in the thick of things who can draw on their own experience in making an important contribution towards the Ukraine adopting and realising what we describe as a European model of democracy."
"So we Social Democrats too can address the Ukrainians and say: welcome to the democratic family of peoples!"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, each institution has a moment which becomes enshrined in its history."
"The European Parliament’s donning of the colour orange today will go down in European history."
"This House is facing its defining moment, which will decide the role of the European Parliament in the Europe of the future."
"I should like to express my great satisfaction at the fact that the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament have been united in their positions on an issue as important as Ukraine."
"Parliament was actually the first to understand the significance of the colour orange in Europe."
"In 1981, the Congress of Warsaw Trade Unions, held in Gdansk, home to the Solidarity Trade Union, appealed to working people all over the world, and particularly in the Soviet Union."
"This bore fruit, and today the colour orange reminds us of the solidarity that is at the basis of Europe’s existence."
"There is a connection between the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine."
"The issue at stake here is freedom, and Europe’s future depends on the concept of freedom."
"What is it we want at present?"
"I would like the Polish Parliament’s voice to be heard, as it was the first to give an official welcome to a representative of the Ukrainian opposition, and to protest at the lies."
"I would like the European Parliament to state clearly today that it will not accept lies or deceit, and that it will not recognise the elections."
"I would also like it to make clear its expectation that truth and the principle of the rule of law will be victorious in Ukraine as well, and that no one can override this principle by means of violence."
"In view of this, I would like the European Parliament to express its solidarity with those waiting in the cold on the streets of Kiev for results acceptable to them."
"Let me add that we expect the political negotiations under way in Kiev, with the participation of Europe’s major institutions, such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, will deliver a solution that restores freedom."
"Finally, I should like to say that Ukraine has opened itself up to Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must open itself up to Ukraine."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr Schulz, Mr Geremek, having spent last weekend in Kiev, I would like to start by adding a few words to the discussion on violence."
"Having had many meetings and conversations in Kiev, my impression is that violence is not being threatened by those who have pitched their tents in the city’s streets, or by those who have been demonstrating there for ten days and upwards."
"If there is the threat of violence, it comes from the former powers, and of that problem we must be aware if we are going there."
"Just what does crisis management mean in this situation?"
"Crisis management can in fact only mean an attempt on our part to bring into being what these orange revolutionaries, who are indeed far more than a Yushchenko party, are calling for."
"What that means in plain language is that the run-off election must be repeated, that the re-run must be in December and no later, and that adequate provision must be made for the election to be observed."
"Having failed to cover ourselves with glory when observing the last election, we Europeans really must get much more involved this time."
"I think it important that Mr Saryusz-Wolski said that Ukraine had seemed a long way away."
"That was self-criticism on his part, and I think we Europeans should be self-critical today."
"I am glad that Members from Poland and other countries in the East that already, thank God, belong to the European Union, are being more far-sighted about policy on Ukraine than the rest of the EU."
"For that, Mr Geremek, I am very grateful to you and to others, and I am proud of what you have achieved."
"So much of our discussion of the Ukraine focuses on interests."
"Again and again, I hear people talking about Putin’s interests, about Russia’s interests, about American interests, about Europeans’ interests and about geostrategic interests, but, since coming back from Kiev, what I find lacking is any understanding, at the end of the day, among ourselves, that this mass movement in Ukraine is, at the moment, about the Ukrainians’ interests."
"If we do not put that centre stage in the debate and in our diplomacy, there is a very great risk of failure."
"I am glad that we are setting out this very evening and that this joint delegation of the European Parliament has at last been put together."
"I had hoped it would come to pass last weekend, but better late than never."
"What I brought away with me from last weekend – and I think that will be our common experience – was that, after all our debates about European values and where in the world they are being realised, it does you a power of good to spend a few days in Kiev, for that, if anywhere in Europe, is where you can really feel that Europe shares a soul."
"I hope that the delegation we are sending there will be what you want, what all the Members of this House want, and that we will be able to put flesh on the core demand – to which I referred at the outset – of the wearers of orange, the pressure from whom we too have needed."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the events that have been unfolding in Kiev over the last ten days are good news for democracy."
"Overcoming fatalism and fear, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens are demonstrating their demand for change, with calm determination."
"Their movement has gradually won over large sections of their parliament, the army, the media, and even, so it would appear, the Supreme Court."
"That sea change has taken place because the Kuchma regime has, over the years, given rise to an increasingly broad opposition that now in fact contains differing schools of thought on the country’s future."
"It is worth recalling that the regime’s drift towards authoritarianism got under way when the prime minister’s name was not Yanukovich, but Yushchenko."
"Nevertheless, a number of European leaders, usually western, have long considered the President of Ukraine as an ally to be treated with kid gloves."
"As recently as last year, President Bush, for example, apparently put his trust in the incumbent regime to defend democracy in the Middle East with him, by saluting Mr Kuchma’s decision to send troops to Iraq."
"All of these elements should help us to water down certain democratic declarations of faith and to avoid any simplistic and Manichaean view of the reality of Ukrainian politics."
"It strikes me that the great challenge now is to ensure that what is intrinsically good news for democracy is not in fact transformed into a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, by resulting if not in the partition of the country, then at least in renewed stirrings of nationalism and a resurgence of splits down ethnic lines, which would take us back to the periods of the Russian or Austro-Hungarian empires."
"Accordingly, I find it somewhat archaic, not to mention irresponsible, to interpret the Ukraine crisis as a tug-of-war between the West and Russia and as something of a European take on the struggle between good and evil."
"In light of Ukraine’s history, such an approach may only exacerbate the split between the two main sections of the country."
"It does not in any way address the interests of the Ukrainian people, particularly the population from the western part of the country, which is highly reliant on the rest of the country given that cross-border trade has been in a state of collapse since Ukraine’s neighbours joined the EU."
"Neither does it address the interests of the EU; the more we are committed to fostering an economic dynamic in Ukraine through our mediation, the more we have everything to lose from the destabilisation of such an economically and politically fragile country and, on a broader scale, region."
"We should let Paul Wolfowitz retain his imperial vision of Europe; he said, and I quote, ‘the objective of a complete and free Europe will not be achieved until Ukraine has become a full Member of Europe and joined NATO’."
"From our point of view, we would be best advised to avoid exerting any pressure of that nature."
"Once fresh elections have been held in Ukraine – this, at least, is what we hope will happen – in other words, once the entire country’s legitimate representative has been appointed completely transparently, the time will have come to start calm political dialogue with both the authorities and society itself; dialogue that would not pit new relations with the EU against the particular relations between Russia and Ukraine, but would, instead, be aimed at developing a perspective that all sections of Ukrainian society can identify with."
"This is yet another real-life test of our ability to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name."
". Mr President, the eyes of the whole world are glued to Ukraine."
"The crowds in Kiev who are demonstrating in favour of normality and justice, and who retain their calm and their dignity, rightly deserve our admiration."
"We all pray that, unlike in the past, it will be the Ukrainians alone who decide their future."
"Whilst enthusiasm is a positive thing, however, blindness certainly is not."
"There is a tendency to oversimplify the situation in Ukraine – one side is presented as completely black and the other completely white."
"When we decide to give democracy lessons and speak of standards, we must ensure that that democracy applies across the board."
"We rightly condemn one side for not complying with the basic rules on holding free elections, yet I have Internet pages in my hand, taken from a Ukrainian newspaper, denouncing, a few days ago, an election document distributed in Western Ukraine by some supporters of Yushchenko. Under the heading ‘Ukraine for the Ukrainians’, the article says that ‘the election of Viktor Yushchenko guarantees us the installation of a national dictatorship..."
"Let us chase the Muscovites, the Polacks and the Jews out of our lands... Our power will be terrible for the Muscovites, the Jews and the Poles who refuse to adopt our faith, etc.’."
"If Parliament turns a blind eye to such incitement to hatred, then we will be made to look ridiculous."
"If we preach morality to some, we must also preach it to others. Let us be clear about this, I do not suspect for one moment that the vast majority of Ukrainians think this way, but history teaches us that particularly aggressive minorities can take power and confiscate from whole peoples the fruits of their just uprising."
"The British delegation in Helsinki has also reported a number of racist statements made by Yushchenko supporters."
"I therefore sincerely hope that my Ukrainian brothers, for whom I feel special affection, elect the President of their choice."
"I also hope, however, that that President does not fall into the trap of discriminating against national or religious minorities, and let us hope that no more foreign countries meddle in Ukraine’s internal affairs."
"I am a Member of the Independence and Democracy Group, so I say long live independent and democratic Ukraine!"
". Ladies and gentlemen, the colour orange so many of us are wearing today and so many of us in this House are carrying is the colour of freedom."
"In the same vein, I believe the events I witnessed during my ten-day stay in Ukraine give me the right to say that at present the capital of Europe is not in Brussels or in Strasbourg, but in Kiev, as it is in Kiev that millions of our Ukrainian brothers are fighting for the most basic of European values."
"I am proud and moved today to see so many Members of this House, on both the Left and the Right, uniting to defend basic European values such as freedom and democracy."
"I should like to add that the fact that the colour orange can be seen today on both the Left and the Right does not mean that we support only one candidate, or that we are interfering in Ukraine’s domestic affairs."
"We do not wish to interfere in the electoral process under way in Ukraine."
"We do, however, want to make it quite clear that if we are to be proud of this European Union and of this European Parliament of ours, there can be no question of condoning electoral fraud or of allowing force, violence and lies to deprive the Ukrainian people of their freedom and of the right to elect their own president."
"I am delighted that today’s statements by the Council and the Commission and Parliament’s motion for a resolution, despite being a compromise, will be a clear sign that irrespective of the political differences that divide us, Europeans are sending out the unequivocal message that Europe’s goal is freedom and democracy in Ukraine."
"I should also like to add that statements that have unfortunately been repeated in this House, to the effect that President Yushchenko’s supporters included chauvinists or nationalists, are lies and loathsome provocation, and it is a shame that Members of this House are prepared to be party to such provocation."
"I spent ten days on the streets of Kiev and stood among crowds of people fighting for freedom, and not once did I hear a single person insulting Russians, Poles or Jews."
"I should like to tell the Members of this House who are concerned about anti-Semitism in Ukraine that they should turn their attention to anti-Semitism in Poland, where it is much more widespread."
"I should also like to add that tomorrow’s vote will provide us with an opportunity to send a very clear signal to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters, namely that Europe is opening its doors to them."
"Let us hope that it will not be long before we meet in a united Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of Ukraine’s fight for basic European standards, it must be said that today we are all Ukrainians."
"We need to demonstrate our solidarity with those who are in the cold fighting for democracy."
"We must demonstrate our solidarity today, and also in the days to come, when Ukraine might no longer be so fashionable."
"Democracy is something we take for granted, although many of the nations represented here have only enjoyed it for a short while."
"This is why we wish to show our understanding and solidarity, and I say this as a representative of a country in which the concept of solidarity has a special meaning."
"Lech Wałęsa’s journey to Ukraine on a mission of solidarity was proof of this."
"Is there any way today of reversing what has happened, namely the rigging of elections?"
"Yes, there is."
"This was proven in Serbia four years ago and in Georgia one year ago, when those who allegedly lost the elections were ultimately victorious and came to power."
"Today we stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU’s closest neighbour."
"Yet we should admit our own mistakes, as the European Union is also to blame for what has happened, given that it failed to provide Ukraine with a clear signal this year that we are expecting it and that we trust it will meet the required standards."
"Before the first round of the elections, Europe failed to tell President Kuchma that we were watching his actions closely."
"After the irregularities of the first round Europe thumped the table, but failed to utter even a murmur of protest."
"We should not forget that a number of nations are paying close attention to the EU’s relations with Ukraine, and that in future years these nations will provide us and themselves with an answer to the question of whether they want democracy and civil freedoms."
"Finally, I should like to refer to a Polish saying that suggests: ‘if you don’t know how to behave, be on your best behaviour,’ and commend it to the Commission and Council representatives who have experienced major problems this year in adopting a position on Ukraine."
"Mr President, I should like to say that I am proud to be a Member of the European Parliament, which is redeeming Europe’s honour today through its position on Ukraine."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Presidency of the Council and in particular the Commissioner for the clarity with which they have spoken and with which they have made it clear that fraudulently conducted elections can neither be recognised nor declared to be valid."
"Ever since 1990, we have seen a change in Europe, with the peoples of Europe possessing the right to determine their own destiny, and that right must not again be jeopardised through interference from outside or manipulation from within."
"That is what this is about."
"It is not about one or other candidate; it is about this European Parliament taking the side of democracy and wanting to give the people the chance to say what they want to say."
"I believe we have thorough and careful work to do in this area."
"At the same time, the message to Ukraine must be that a president who rigs elections in order to legitimise his power has no credibility on the international stage."
"That also means that we will have to do some thinking about the neighbourhood programme."
"I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for having suspended the action programme, and, in view of the way things are developing in Ukraine, we will have to consider what is to be done about that country."
"I would also encourage you to be bolder than your predecessor was."
"Over the last two of three years, or so I believe, it was not enough to send Ukraine the message that we took it seriously and regarded it as an important partner in dialogue."
"I think there were those here in Brussels and in the national capitals who failed to state their position clearly, and that is why we are in this situation."
"That is something we should do better now, if we still have the chance to do so."
"It is here, if we have the imagination to do it, that a European Economic Area and much else can be brought into play in order to open up new perspectives."
"If we are to send a delegation to Ukraine, it must be made clear that what we are aiming for is the unity of the country, with no violence being used, and the continuation of the dialogue between the various parties, and that we have to ensure that the electoral legislation is amended, and the second round of the election – but only the second round – repeated."
"Anything else would be yet another manipulation intended to deny the leader of the opposition the chance of an election victory."
"That also means, though, that both sides must summon up the willingness to cooperate with us and with Russia equally; this must not, however, be the product of the desire for revenge, but must be characterised by respect for both sides if it is to help bring reconciliation to the Ukrainian people."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to greet Mr Tarasyuk, who once shared with me the chairmanship of the inter-parliamentary delegation, and whom I know as a champion of reforms in his country."
"The reason for the political crisis in Ukraine is the violation of democracy."
"The elections did not meet democratic standards."
"There was no balanced campaign, the electorate was intimidated and fraud was committed in various ways."
"That is unacceptable."
"It follows that we reject the result of the second round of the presidential elections."
"What is central in this issue is the right of the people of Ukraine to make up their own minds in an open and transparent, democratic process."
"We side with everyone in the Ukraine who stands up for their democratic rights."
"We must, first and foremost, find a way out, a political and peaceful solution to the situation that has arisen."
"The EU must deploy all diplomatic means in order to help bring this about."
"There is, however, a greater challenge yet, for this political crisis does not stand on its own."
"The outcome of the elections will have a great impact on the EU’s relations with Ukraine, either in the positive or negative sense."
"The only satisfactory solution to the crisis is that justice be done to democratic principles and to the will of the Ukrainian people."
"The outcome of the elections was also rejected by the Ukrainian parliament."
"The solution is to re-stage the second round of the elections with the close involvement of international observers, ensuring that this third round takes place under circumstances that are totally different from those under which the first and second rounds were held, a situation in which democratic standards are, of course, respected under the close observation of the international community."
"We call on everyone to cooperate in this."
"The democratic aspirations of the people of Ukraine are unmistakable and receive our unqualified support."
"The people’s involvement is evident from the scale of the demonstrations."
"I would express my great appreciation and admiration for the protesters in the cities of the Ukraine who argue in favour of the recovery of democracy."
"The situation in that country is tense, though, and we would call on both the opposition and the authorities to preserve the non-violent nature of the actions and to prevent the situation from escalating."
"If the authorities were to decide on using violence against the peaceful protesters, this will, in our view, immediately impact on relations with the European Union."
"Similarly, the division of the country, for which some appear to be pressing, will engender a fresh, much more serious crisis and would not in any way contribute to a satisfactory solution."
"Moreover, this ambition gives a false representation of the current state of affairs."
"What lies at the heart of the matter is the violation of democratic standards, and not the fact that there is a geographical division in the support for the candidates."
"Neither is this about Ukraine’s choice between the European Union and Russia."
"On account of its location, economy and history, Ukraine will always need to maintain in-depth relations with both."
"Although today’s debate is not about our relationship with Russia, Russia an important factor in the issue and, unfortunately, adopts a slightly different stance in this respect."
"Last week, Mr Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister and President of the Council, on behalf of the presidency, expressed very clearly the contrasts between Europe and Russia, and on that we congratulate him. It is, nevertheless, of major importance that Russia be involved in the way in which the crisis is solved and that the Kremlin’s support be sought for the staging of another second round of the elections."
"Europe benefits greatly from stable governments in all its neighbouring countries."
"On account of its size and location, Ukraine is a crucial partner."
"The European Union must offer scope for the accelerated strengthening of political and economic cooperation."
"Needless to say, the EU and Ukraine can only cooperate in a more concrete form if a satisfactory and democratic solution has been found for the present crisis."
"In my view, the debate in question should produce a better response to the European aspirations of Ukraine than has been the case to date."
"I think that not so much this Parliament, but certainly the Commission and the Council have avoided the response to that question over the past few years and like Mr Brok, I am not that impressed with the EU’s commitment to Ukraine in recent years."
"We now have a different Commission, though, and that opens up new opportunities."
"Today, we stand united in the reaction to the crisis."
"I trust that once the crisis has been resolved, hopefully in the positive sense, we can start taking concerted action along with Ukraine and with better policy than has been adopted so far."
"Mr President, we who have the privilege of living in stable democracies sometimes forget that human rights, democracy and secret elections are not enjoyed by everyone."
"Many Members of this House have personal experience of what it means to live under authoritarian regimes and of what it is like to have to fight for democratic rights."
"Many of these countries are now members of the European Union, a fact that exemplifies what can happen when people are allowed to choose their own path."
"The whole world has been impressed by the democratic national festivities that we now see on the streets and in the squares of Ukraine, in which hundreds of thousands of people are braving the snow and the cold and, in a cheerful, peaceful and well-organised way, are demonstrating in pursuit of their rights."
"We are firmly behind the supporters of democracy and, as many have said, this is proved by the fact that we are all wearing orange scarves."
"Like the Ukrainian people, we reject this election that has been surrounded by so much cheating, harassment of journalists, lies, buying of votes and other factors that really are out of place in free elections."
"We support the demand for a second round of elections under quite different circumstances."
"It was pleasing to hear from the Commissioner about the degree to which Europe intends to be a helpful presence in the event of a second set of elections, and it is to be hoped that this commitment will also continue in the same way and with the same vigour after the elections, however they may turn out."
"I should like to address the representatives of the Ukrainian Parliament, if they are still here, and let them know that the message from this House to the effect that the Ukrainian people, like all other peoples, are entitled to enjoy freedom and democracy and to shape their own freedom has the support of this House across the political spectrum."
"We support you in your struggle."
"Good luck!"
"Mr President, I also feel like rejoicing over what has been happening for the last ten days in Kiev and almost throughout Ukraine, over this massive, extremely determined and entirely peaceful demonstration in favour of strict transparency as regards the ballot box and the ballot papers, which have been falsified and manipulated by those currently in power."
"I feel that the dynamic at work in Ukraine itself should be brought to the fore. Entire sections of Ukrainian society are collapsing, with journalists, intellectuals, civil society, the authorities and the institutions all claiming their right to free speech."
"Against this backdrop, I feel it is useful to highlight the fact that the mobilisation of civil society has enriched and probably increased the effectiveness and coherence of EU action to address this situation."
"It is also true that we are starting to dream that the EU can take a similarly coherent and effective stance in other EU-neighbouring countries where the will of civil society is stifled by authoritarian and autocratic leaders."
"This is, for that matter, what the EU is doing with the countries in question, on the basis of common values and commitments."
"This should be emphasised, as should the extent to which this approach differs from that of Russia and differs from what is already happening in that country, where calumny prevails in all of the State-monopolised media."
"We are indeed entitled to feel much more concerned about democracy today in Russia than about the future of democracy in Ukraine."
"– Mr President, although I have no orange scarf around my neck, I feel myself no less close to Ukraine than you do, for I spent six continuous years of my life in Kiev."
"The correct result of these elections must be put on the table – on that we agree."
"No matter how this election may have turned out, though, the main thing it shows is that Ukraine is deeply divided – territorially, politically and ethnically."
"This division is to a substantial degree the result of international interference going back long before this election and very much to the detriment of the Ukrainian people."
"Mr Putin gave his favoured candidate massive backing and wasted no time in congratulating him on his victory."
"In his own country, the Russian president is doing away with elections for the heads of the Russian regions, some of which are no smaller than the whole of Ukraine."
"President Bush is concerned and criticises the way the election was conducted, seemingly having forgotten the grave doubts about the propriety of his first election and the numerous complaints about his second."
"Innumerable advisors have given logistical support to the opposition in Ukraine."
"For months, this election has been dressed up as a choice of direction – with Russia or with Europe, as if Russia were not itself part of Europe to a substantial degree."
"Ukraine, however, cannot throw itself into the arms of one single ally."
"If it wants to resolve its serious economic and social problems, the right thing for it must be a good relationship with all its neighbours, both new and old, and this it must be allowed to build up under whichever President, without empty promises, admonitory finger-wagging or unconcealed arm-twisting."
"The people of Ukraine must take their decisions democratically and independently, and they will."
"Mr President, that Kiev is more European than Ankara is proved beyond reasonable doubt by what has happened over the past ten days in Ukraine, a country in which people stand up valiantly for the essential value of their ballot papers, and also one that has taught all European institutions a lesson about the true meaning of a European community of values."
"Shoulder to shoulder with the United States of America, the European Union should aspire to review in the short term the outrageous electoral deception of the in Ukraine."
"All credit to the Dutch Presidency, incidentally, for its efforts to date and also for the stance adopted by our new Commissioner."
"In the long term, the Union must also draw conclusions from the current dramatic situation in Kiev."
"Why should we not give Ukraine the prospect of membership when we would do the same for Turkey, which is – let us face it – a non-European country?"
"That appears to me to be an untenable, and in any event harmful, position."
"The doom scenarios about the collapse of, or even a civil war in, Ukraine have been concocted by the actual losers of the ballot both inside and outside Ukraine."
"Would President Putin actually put Russia’s relationship with the United States and the European Union on the line for a Ukrainian President who has no credibility either inside or outside Ukraine?"
"That appears too irrational to be true."
"Precisely a week ago, a Ukrainian author urged that ‘more urgently than ever, we need the moral and political support of the democracies in the world, because if we gamble away the democratic Ukraine today, you can forget about your self-congratulatory and conflict-free Europe as soon as tomorrow’."
"As close neighbours, we should be quite clear about this."
". The events following the parliamentary elections in Ukraine are a convincing demonstration to the democratic world that the Ukrainian people reject the direction taken by many states of the former Soviet Union, where authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes have imposed themselves."
"The Ukrainian people reject the Belarussian model, which is a source of shame for Europe, and also the variant of democracy that is subservient to the President of Russia."
"Whatever the outcome of the electoral crisis may be, Ukraine will never be the same again."
"The demand by a wide section of society for its rights is mobilising society to take action not only in respect of the stolen election results, but also against corruption and oligarchical capitalism, and is forging a clear understanding of the choice for a democratic future for Ukraine."
"Following an invitation from the Ukrainian Parliament, I was able to follow the course of the Ukrainian presidential elections in person."
"I unequivocally agree with the conclusion reached by the international observers that the elections were fraudulent."
"The ruling politico-economic elite is preventing the Ukrainian people from democratically electing their president."
"The disinformation about the opposition candidate that poured out of the government-controlled mass media chimed exactly with the assessments broadcast by the mass media under the control of the President of Russia."
"In the eastern part of Ukraine, it was precisely the Russian media that played a decisive role in turning society there against the opposition."
"Russia has invested considerable resources into the campaign of the Ukrainian Government’s candidate."
"This included the direct intervention of the President of Russia himself."
"This clearly shows Russia’s fear that its policy in the region is under threat."
"The victory of democracy in Ukraine would threaten the Russian-sponsored stability in Belarus and the amnesia regarding Moldova."
"The victory of democracy in Ukraine would mobilise democratic forces in Russia itself."
"Ukrainian society has come to the defence of its decision."
"Now it is the turn of the democratic world – the European Union first of all. The European Union must make it clearly understood that those who fail to observe democratic principles and fail to abide by the law cannot be partners of the European Union."
"The same restrictions must apply to them as have been introduced against Belarus."
"Ukraine is a European country, and the people on the streets of Ukraine have proved that an absolute majority of them have chosen democracy and the rule of law."
"Those are concepts that unite the Member States of the European Union."
"Ukraine has become a focus of world attention."
"It must become a focus of the European Union’s attention."
"Ukraine must be given the opportunity of joining the European Union."
"Starting to open up such an opportunity would be an enormously stabilising influence on the democratic process in Ukraine."
"– Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Italian Socialist Party."
"The peaceful orange revolution currently under way in Kiev has a great deal in common with the ‘rose revolution’ which brought President Saakashvili to power in Georgia exactly one year ago. He was then democratically elected by a huge majority in January 2004."
"Mr Saakashvili, whom I was able to meet in Tbilisi a few days ago, is leading Georgia towards a path of renewal, growth and development, within a healthy, pluralist context of democracy."
"Back in November 2003, however, the people’s verdict had been overturned through the vote-rigging arranged by ex-President Eduard Shevardnadze, who was then driven out by a popular uprising, which, apart from anything else, took place without bloodshed."
"Today the story is being repeated and, as all the international observers, including those from Europe, have confirmed, the Ukrainian people’s decision has been blatantly altered and misrepresented through obvious, flagrant irregularities."
"Today the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, has passed a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Yanukovich."
"Although this action in itself is not binding from a legal point of view, it does have a great intrinsic symbolic and political value and confirms the success of the popular pressure that has been exerted in recent days."
"We must not allow Europe to remain deaf and dumb to all this."
"Let Europe make its voice heard in that country, which lies so close to our borders, so that the tensions there do not degenerate into civil war or an escalation of violence, and so that all those young people can at last be heard. The young citizens who courageously and proudly wave orange flags or Georgian flags demand and hope for a future of peace, justice, the rule of law, democracy and freedom – a new, different page of history."
"Let us here in Parliament raise a cry of solidarity with the demonstrators in Kiev: today we are all Ukrainians."
"Mr President, this House should be proud that last week its MEPs were amongst the first foreigners to address the assembled crowds in Independence Square in downtown Kiev."
"I was personally deeply moved by the faith of the young Ukrainians in that square in a free, democratic and European-value Ukraine in the future, and their belief that justice, through people power, will ultimately triumph."
"There can be no doubt that they were cheated of their election result and the choice of a president of their own desire, but we in the western world cannot be neutral over a large European country struggling between a future as a potential EU and NATO Member State – a democratic one at that – and a powerful clique of corrupt, post-Soviet, anti-democratic authoritarians willing to steal the election, through fraud if necessary, under the tutelage of Moscow."
"I welcome today’s vote of no confidence by the Parliament of Ukraine, which has distinguished itself as the only body that is generally reflecting the views of the people."
"I call on Prime Minister Yanukovich and his government, who unlawfully used the state’s resources to further their campaign, to resign forthwith and on Mr Yanukovich to fight the election as a private citizen, to ensure free, fair and transparent elections on a level playing field."
"The recent calls by eastern apparatchiks to split Ukraine in half is highly cynical in a country which in 1991 voted overwhelmingly for a unitary state."
"This agenda is designed to produce immunity from criminal prosecution for electoral and other frauds, as well as to ensure that the Donetsk oligarchs, who have accumulated massive wealth which funded Mr Yanukovich’s campaign, are not open to challenge or scrutiny and that they are not subject to confiscation of some of the dodgy privatisations that have occurred in Ukraine in the last couple of years."
"We do not want another Transnistria, 30 times bigger in eastern Europe."
"Let us hope for a united, democratic and free Ukraine in the imminent future."
"Mr President, onFriday, in an interview on Russian television, Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Vladimir Putin's man in charge of relations with the European Union, accused the new Members of the European Parliament and their Member States of interfering in Ukraine, adding that 20 years ago Solidarność was a creation of the West and that now the Poles were doing the same in Kiev."
"Leaving aside this repetition of Soviet rhetoric about Solidarność, he does have an important point, which I would like to make here again today."
"The new Members feel acutely, both negatively and positively, the course of events in Ukraine today."
"Just as the founding Members of the EU recall the experiences that led to the establishment of the Union, so too we recall what was done to us and why for so many decades we could not join the Union."
"We recall the sham elections in the three Baltic countries in 1940, when for instance, like Mr Putin's congratulatory call to Mr Yanukovich even before the announcement of preliminary results, Latvia's sham election results were accidentally published the day before they took place."
"We recall only too well the rigged elections after the war in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia."
"We have seen this before and we know what comes of it."
"But we have seen the other side as well, how tens and hundreds of thousands of people come together peacefully to state their solidarity with democracy."
"We saw this with Solidarność in Gdansk and Warsaw and with Charter 77 in Prague; we saw it in the streets of Berlin and we saw it in the singing revolutions of the Baltic countries."
"In other words we know what is going on, we have seen it before."
"The 75 million people who became EU citizens this March are experiencing 'déja vu'."
"Our understanding of these events, our empirical knowledge, must not be dismissed by those who lack the knowledge or understanding of what this means."
"Mr Yastrzhembsky, but I fear also some in the West, would paint the new Members' direct experience and knowledge as something that gets in the way of relations with Russia or that threatens illusions about what is going on in Ukraine."
"We recall those in the West who said we should be careful with Solidarność, it might upset Brezhnev."
"We recall Western politicians who said the Baltic countries should not seek independence lest it threaten Mikhail Gorbachev."
"I am not here to take sides in a political contest between candidates and parties in Ukraine, but I do take a stand against manipulation of elections."
"We cannot say no to the Ukrainians because we are afraid of losing investments or markets in Russia."
"Democrats always try to find the Aristotelian golden mean, even in politics, but there is no middle ground between the truth and a lie, between democracy and its all too many opponents."
"I should like to thank both the European Commission and the Dutch Presidency for their decisive actions over the past week."
"I shall be honest and admit that this was not what I expected."
"After seeing how rapidly the European Union took immediate action to send Javier Solana, Aleksander Kwaśniewski and President Adamkus to Ukraine three days after the rigged elections, I felt for the first time that accession to the European Union had been worthwhile, and that we are now part of a group able to stand up for a defenceless nation that is struggling to achieve independence and freedom."
"I should like to express my heartfelt thanks for this."
"Up until now, such a rapid reaction could only be expected from the United States, or at least that was the case in our country, Poland."
"I am delighted that this time the European Union was able to act more swiftly and effectively."
"The European Union is now acting as mediator in the conflict in Ukraine."
"As an observer of the presidential elections in Ukraine, I should like to share an observation with this House."
"The crowd of people on Independence Square last Saturday numbered one million."
"This number included many Poles, as the Polish people remember the explosive emergence of the Solidarity movement in 1980, and realise that history is currently repeating in Ukraine."
"There are a great many Georgians and Georgian flags on Independence Square, as Georgians are aware that recent events in their own country are being re-enacted in Ukraine."
"Yet there are also huge numbers of other young people who have travelled to Independence Square, Russian and Belarussian students, for example, The latter are anxious to experience in Kiev, albeit briefly, the freedom denied them in their own countries."
"I am convinced that if the European Union supports the emerging democracy and civil society in Ukraine, it will in so doing ensure that democratic principles prevail in the whole of the East and in the whole of the area to the east of Ukraine and to the east of the European Union."
"This is not about the division of spheres of influence. It is about democratic principles, which, after all, we would all like to be enforced to the same degree throughout geographical Europe."
"In view of the fact that I will travel to Kiev tomorrow as part of a delegation, I should like to call on this House to adopt the amendment I shall now read out, tabled by myself and Mr Geremek."
"This amendment calls on the Ukrainian Government to refrain from exerting any pressure on the media, and in particular on the public media, in order to ensure that the Ukrainian people are provided with objective and impartial information on the candidates and the situation in their country."
"– Mr President, as a Lithuanian as well as a representative of the Lithuanian nation, whose president, together with the Polish President Mr Kwaśniewski and Mr Solana, is today in Kiev, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that events in Ukraine and the success of the peaceful revolution will have important consequences not only for Ukraine, its nation and not only for the further development of the European Union, but also for the nearest of Ukraine’s neighbours – Belarus."
"It is, therefore, very important for everyone now to show solidarity."
"Our support for democracy today in Ukraine also sends out a signal to the dictator of Belarus."
"I am sure that the close attention and hope with which the Belarus nation is observing the development of events in Ukraine is matched by attention and fear in the gaze of Mr Lukashenko."
"Therefore, let Ukraine’s success today also be the prelude to success for democracy tomorrow in Belarus."
"Thank you for you attention."
"It is very difficult to say anything original before this House today."
"Yet this is a very good day for the European Parliament, as we are expressing our opinions on issues of the utmost importance to the European Union."
"We are discussing our largest neighbour, which has a border of 700 km with the European Union."
"The EU’s 25 Member States are experiencing problems relating to social apathy, yet there is a country in Europe in which electoral turnout is almost 80%."
"In that same country, several hundred thousand people have been standing in the cold for ten days in many towns, demanding the right to free and honest elections."
"After ten days, the people of Ukraine are now becoming impatient, and there can be no doubt that they are also exhausted."
"Now it is up to us, the international community, to take the initiative by bringing pressure to bear on those in power and by calling for fair elections."
"We should adopt a clear stance on this issue."
"In my opinion, four key principles must be upheld."
"The first is that those in power should avoid any kind of solution by force."
"The second is that Ukraine’s territorial integrity should be maintained."
"The third is that the second round of elections should be held again, with OSCE monitoring and an electoral law preventing widespread irregularities such as voting away from one’s place of residence."
"Fourthly, the candidates should have equal access to the media."
"We appear to have already forgotten that this was our key principle even before the first round of elections."
"There are also things we must demand of ourselves."
"For example, observers are needed, and in far greater numbers than previously."
"A thousand observers from the 25 EU Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament are needed for the next round of elections."
"I ask for this figure to be agreed on, for the costs to be shared and for an appropriate number of observers to be sent."
"This will prove that we are genuinely opening up to Ukraine."
"– Mr President, I am grateful to the Council for reminding us that the European Union does not have a candidate in the Ukrainian elections, that our responsibility is undoubtedly to contribute to the holding of democratic elections, and that we must press for a peaceful, political solution to the institutional conflict in Ukraine."
"We call for the ballot to be repeated and express our solidarity with all Ukrainians, with the whole Ukrainian people."
"We are not here to support either Mr Yushchenko or Mr Yanukovich, who have both, moreover, been heads of the Ukrainian Government; nor are we here to push for the partitioning of Ukraine between the East and the West, but to guarantee the territorial integrity of the country."
"I find this contrast between the good guys and the bad guys rather nauseating."
"Who are we to say that the democratic good guys are the Kiev students and the bad guys are the miners coming to protest in Kiev?"
"We need to make a non-simplistic interpretation of what is happening in Ukraine."
"Unfortunately, Ukraine is already a geographically divided country, in which the Russian population makes up 33% of the total population."
"In view of these figures – which are similar to those we find in Iraq, where the Sunni population makes up 33% of the total Iraqi population – we need to find a political solution that seeks to hold the two parts together and allows the president who is to be elected – and we want to see him elected in a democratic election – to be president of the whole country."
"The danger now is not just that the country may split, Mr President, but that there may be civil war."
"I have the feeling that the spirit of Yalta is perilously alive in this Parliament and that the only objective is to drag all or part of Ukraine into the western sphere of influence."
"I do not agree with that."
"The strength and the responsibility of the European Union is not to fight for the causes of the West but to fight for the cause of democracy and to play a part in helping the President of Ukraine to be truly the president of the whole Ukrainian people."
"– The joint resolution by the groups is clear and firm."
"The wishes of the Ukrainian nations must be implemented in accordance with the principles of democracy."
"I would also like to highlight the importance of those sections of the resolution that support Ukrainian unity and integrity."
"Ukraine is in many respects divided, but splitting the country up into two states would be harmful and dangerous."
"It would, if anything, cause new problems rather than solve older ones."
"Ukraine should be given the opportunity for genuine independence."
"It must have a right to good relations and cooperation both with the European Union and Russia."
"The best situation would be one where we were able to build a multilateral partnership in which the EU, Russia and Ukraine were on an equal footing."
"I am not happy with section 10 of the resolution."
"In my opinion we should state clearly that Ukraine, as a European country, has the right of accession to the European Union as long as it meets the conditions of membership."
"The new Neighbour Policy for Europe should not be seen as an alternative to membership, but a tool to help our European neighbours along the path to membership of the EU."
"Now that Turkey has in principle been accepted as a member, the door must also be left open for Ukraine, which is a bona fideEuropean country."
"Mr President, I am encouraged by the clear conclusions drawn by both the Council and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"I have been the rapporteur for Ukraine on behalf of the Council of Europe."
"What is happening today is nothing new: the same rigging of elections, curbing of the press, depriving people of their rights took place then."
"It is a pity that continual reports about shortcomings in establishing the rule of law and transparent society have not been taken at their face value in the West."
"For many years hopes were cherished that in due time and with patience all problems would be overcome."
"The opposite has happened: policies of accommodation and attempts to keep post-Communist rulers as good allies at the cost of turning a blind eye to gross violations of democratic rules have brought about a dramatic worsening of the situation."
"The EU also has to share responsibility for not reacting in time and for not clearly taking the side of genuinely democratic forces."
"Instead, the Ukrainian people have given us a lesson."
"Now there is not a minute to lose."
"Some still argue for declarations in support of democracy but say let us be prudent and not offend anybody, let us not aggravate the situation further by taking sides."
"It is right that we should not take the side of a particular candidate – that is the exclusive right of the Ukrainian people."
"However, look around this Chamber and you can see that we have taken sides – look at the orange colours."
"It is our duty."
"It is also our duty to adopt very soon the important resolution we have prepared."
"Mr President, we cannot underestimate the sensitivity of the situation."
"The stakes remain very high at a national and an international level."
"What is the message that we should send to the Ukrainians, whether they support one candidate or the other?"
"We should send the message that we stand for democratic values, territorial integrity, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the impartiality of the courts, the rule of law, peaceful solutions, just solutions."
"But what is the message that we are receiving from the Ukrainians?"
"We are receiving the message that the aspirations of a people may be stalled."
"Obstacles may be placed in the path of democracy but ultimately justice will prevail."
"What is the EU’s message to the international community?"
"I conclude by saying that we are relevant, we can speak with one voice."
"We cannot compromise where democracy is concerned."
"– Mr President, I will be going against the current because I do not believe that it is just a revolution that is happening in Ukraine: what is also taking place is the last stage in the demolition of Russia, because Russia was born in Kiev."
"In Ukraine, just as in Russia, oligarchic cliques have seized power and produced a criminal state with the blessing of the International Monetary Fund."
"What is happening in Moscow is not to anyone’s liking, but hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in the West to pull Georgia, Belarus and Ukraine away from Russian influence."
"That is the truth, and the ideals of freedom and democracy have little to do with it: 49 million Ukrainians are the victims of this situation."
"Victor Yushchenko and Yulia Timoshenko are no more champions of democracy than Victor Yanukovich: both are in fact the children of Leonid Kuchma."
"It is obvious that Vladimir Putin’s Russia wants to reassemble a few pieces of greater Russia, and that is no less legitimate than wanting to pull Ukraine into the West."
"The question is whether it happens with or against the will of the peoples concerned."
"It will be very difficult to keep all Ukrainians in a new Galicia and it may end in bloodshed."
"Mr Yanukovich has proposed a compromise which at least buys some time to prevent a clash."
"Mr Yushchenko has rejected it."
"Clearly, Mr Putin’s strategic design will be in tatters without Ukraine and, clearly, Mr Putin will not give up easily."
"If anyone is perhaps thinking of forcing him to do so, they should think of the consequences, which would be a serious blow to the future of European-Russian relations."
"I do not believe Europe should venture along that path."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from Mr Battilocchio’s evocation of the ‘rose revolution’ in Georgia a year ago, let me say that visitors to Tbilisi will find in the cabinet chamber, on the streets and in the President’s office, the European flag hanging alongside its Georgian counterpart, as if the country were a Member State of the European Union, and, if you stand on Freedom Square in Kiev, you will see there the Georgian flag and the European flag, for all these countries aspire to make their way to Europe."
"Not all of our neighbours, though, can accede to the European Union."
"As early as when we take our decision in December, we will have to consider the European Union’s capacity for accepting new members, and so we need to come to some clearer conclusions about our European neighbourhood policy, and that very soon."
"In her hearing before the committee, the Commissioner was pretty clear about how that was one of her priorities."
"If that is the case, though, if there is the expectation of coming to Europe, and if we are ready for it, then our response over the last few weeks was inadequate."
"That the High Representative was willing to go to Kiev only when this House insisted on it was a mistake on his part."
"He should have been there before the elections, showing that Europe has an interest in fair elections, and if it is indeed the case – as our fellow-Members tell us – that the Commission had to be asked whether it might not send a larger delegation, whether it was not willing to be more involved in these elections, then that too revealed an oversight, and one that is now a source of great pain to us."
"Whilst we understand that massive staffs, lots of money and large numbers of personnel are going into the preparations for the Palestinian elections on 9 January, we could have shown the same commitment to one of our immediate neighbours, with its 50 million inhabitants, which wants to be part of Europe."
"I therefore think that our European neighbourhood policy, with the report that we will be starting to consider in a few weeks’ time, needs to have new life breathed into it. Participation in the internal market, participation in European programmes – we need to be sending out signals now about the many things we can offer."
"This is not about thinking in terms of spheres of influence, nor is it anti-Russian, for a democratic Ukraine too will need to maintain good relations with Russia, and we Europeans need to support it in this."
"– Mr President, it is the self-evident responsibility of every progressive citizen to defend democratic freedoms in Ukraine without foreign interference."
"It is the obligation of the European Union to remain constant on questions of principle and not to take a selective approach, as certain parties have hastened to do."
"The sole objective must be the contribution of the European Union to a peaceful and democratic solution, by repeating the second round of the presidential elections under conditions of complete freedom, so that Ukraine can get out of the political cul-de-sac and so as to avoid any danger of destabilisation, which would have dramatic consequences for security and peace in Europe."
"Our message must also be clear to Russia, concerning the avoidance of any action which would complicate the situation."
"For the European Union, Ukraine cannot be batted back and forth between conflicting interests."
"It would certainly be a strategic error if the European Union were to be trapped in the dilemma between Europe and Russia."
"At this crucial time, the European Union must talk to all the political forces in Ukraine and win the confidence of all the Ukrainian people, not line up behind one side or the other."
"Our collective stand must be linked to a guarantee of the democratic expression of the people and defence of the independence, unity and territorial integrity of the country."
"Ladies and gentlemen, many in this Chamber will have heard more than once the rhetorical question about the extent of the borders of Europe."
"After the recent events in Ukraine it has become evident that Europe is definitely larger than many people had previously believed it to be."
"Despite the harsh eastern winter, the spirit of European democracy is once again decisively on the march."
"The determination of the demonstrators in Kiev is not an attempt to protect the opposition leader, Mr Yushchenko, but to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine and to demonstrate their support for the rule of law and a legal state."
"I also support a united Ukraine, a country that is both our partner and a powerful neighbour."
"It was not simply a question of the voters deciding between the two candidates."
"It was, above all, a vote against one of the candidates."
"They voted against the prime minister, Mr Yanukovich, who, in the eyes of many, represents the oligarchy and a corrupt state."
"It was and still is an uprising of the humiliated and the outraged."
"An uprising in the name of human pride and dignity. It is an uprising in the name of basic human rights and this is why the men and women of Ukraine deserve not just our support and our solidarity, but our help and our action."
"This resistance by people who have nothing to lose represents a last hope for them just as it does for us."
"For us it represents, above all, a responsibility to put our European institutions in order."
"I congratulate the Commissioner, and I would like to make one other point."
"Ukraine has contributed greatly to democracy and peace."
"She has given up her nuclear weapons, which was an enormous contribution."
"Now she deserves to be rewarded."
"Judging by the number of orange scarves in this Chamber, the Orange Revolution has also reached the European Parliament."
"This should come as no surprise, as the virus of freedom and democracy is extremely contagious and fast-spreading."
"My own country, Poland, and other Central European countries provide abundant proof of this."
"They became infected with the disease of democracy and freedom many years ago."
"Today the impossible is becoming possible in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian people are awakening from their lethargy."
"Ukrainians are demanding their rights."
"They no longer wish to be cheated, and they wish to make their own decisions."
"Before our very eyes, the Ukrainian people are facing one of their most difficult tests, a test of their civil responsibility."
"Yet today we too are faced with a test, namely a test of our solidarity."
"What must we do to come through with flying colours?"
"Firstly, we must speak clearly and plainly about values, and about the values that connect us to the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets of Kiev."
"We should speak in the very language used in the motion for a resolution."
"Secondly, we should dispel myths, including those referred to by Mr Fava, among others."
"Ukraine is not divided geographically, although there are many today who wish this were the case. Ukraine is divided into those who have shed the yoke of fear and those who have not yet managed to do so."
"The first should be given political support, and the second should be guaranteed a place in the new Ukraine."
"Thirdly, the European Union must continue to participate in the political dialogue taking place in Ukraine, as without our international involvement, there is a threat that Ukraine will be faced with the worst possible scenario, namely chaos and fratricidal warfare."
"This is the most important challenge facing us today."
"In order to prevent such a disaster, the European Parliament should adopt the motion for a resolution by acclamation and without amendment, and it should be taken to Kiev by the European Parliament’s mission."
"The Council should support the continuing presence of the High Representative in Kiev, and outline its vision of a European future for Ukraine at the summit in December."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud of our Parliament."
"We have woken up to our responsibility."
"This is now a question of law, justice and freedom, because Ukraine and the EU share a common future."
"The spread of democracy is our greatest challenge."
"It is our mission."
"One day mankind’s weapons should all be trained in the same direction."
"It will be a long journey, but it is a morally right and just one."
"At present this is not just about Ukraine: this is also about developments in Russia, which has, quite unexpectedly, got mixed up in the Ukrainian elections."
"Russia’s future is closely connected with ours."
"At present, Moscow is rapidly moving in the wrong direction and away from democracy."
"If we can steer Ukraine’s development in the right direction, that will also help Moscow make the turn in the right direction itself."
"We cannot all have different notions about what democracy is."
"They are universal."
"We cannot allow Europe and Russia to head off in different directions: Russia must make the turn."
"On this point we have to remain adamant."
"The United States of America and the European Union need to work closely together, as there are such huge issues involved here."
"I am proud of the Ukrainian democrats."
"It now remains to be seen whether they will be proud of us for staying adamant about this through to the end."
"This is a watershed in the development of Ukraine, but also for the EU."
"It is a historic moment."
"On one side of the watershed the murky waters of a totalitarian regime flow towards the past, where only the oligarchies and the present administration reap the benefits."
"On the other side, pure waters, the waters of democracy, flow towards tomorrow, one where the Ukrainian nation can draw strength for a better future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasant to hear that in this Chamber today we are reasonably united."
"Not only are various political tendencies united, but so are the Council and Commission."
"However, I should like to draw your attention to certain truths which we should take into account."
"There is a certain paradox, that often enough we see what is happening far away from us better than what is happening next door."
"To be quite frank, I was surprised that even before the first round of the elections in Ukraine we were already receiving very many signals that there were violations and that the opposition candidate was not being given the opportunity to campaign openly."
"We did not react, and it was only when these flagrant injustices manifested themselves in the second round that we all bestirred ourselves."
"That too is good."
"The policy of the European Union has never been and never will be aggressive, but the European Union is not and cannot be a mere talking shop that dispenses advice."
"The European Union is a sufficiently strict and powerful political union and that is why the European Union must, at all levels – Council, Commission and Parliament – demonstrate a strict and determined political will."
"That is why the European Union cannot merely point out the fraud involved in the Ukrainian elections."
"We cannot pretend that we do not see what forces lie behind the falsification of the Ukrainian elections."
"Those forces understand only determined and strong policies and actions."
"Otherwise, we shall have a situation where on one half of the field a game of tennis is being played but on the other a game of rugby."
"I do not mean here simply the European Union and Russia, the West and the East."
"I am very familiar with Russia, and I know that there are a great many democratic and intelligent people there."
"Yet the leading tendency is antidemocratic and thirsting for revenge."
"We must therefore definitely support democracy in Ukraine, analyse the situation that has come about and forecast the future."
"That is why I agree with my colleague Elmar Brok, that the Council and the Commission must also react very speedily and very determinedly."
"Mr President, what we are now seeing in Eastern Europe is a second wave in the fight for democracy."
"The same applies as applied fifteen years ago, and the events will be as decisive for Europe and for the way Europe will look in ten to fifteen years’ time, and subsequently, as were the events of 15 years ago."
"It is crucially important that we see the serious dimension to the crisis that is playing itself out, in which the old dictatorship is trying to rob the people of its new democracy."
"We must be on our guard against a repetition of developments that might lead to a new Balkans."
"The events pose a number of important questions, especially – as Mr Vatanen pointed out – concerning how we go on to view Russia’s own development towards democracy, which is a matter requiring consistency and clarity."
"The events pose questions as to how we ourselves are to have respect for our own common foreign and security policy, and this is a crucial test in terms of how we are able to take action."
"I believe it important for us to act not only on the basis of how serious present events are but also with a view to preventing what, in the worst case, may happen tomorrow and in the months to come and which is something that makes the situation extremely serious and that calls for immediate action."
"An unambiguous message to Russia and the Ukrainian leadership is required."
"Our only concerns should be for the Ukrainian people and for democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and our guests from Ukraine, who must be listening attentively to this debate."
"Without any more fear of contradiction, we can state that the abuses that took place during the Ukrainian elections were such that the results are unacceptable."
"Even Prime Minster Yanukovich himself has asked for the election results to be invalidated, particularly as there was some confusion in the western parts of the country."
"The leader of the opposition, Mr Yushchenko, and international observers, on the other hand, discovered that there was some confusion in eastern parts."
"Both, however, agree that the elections were not fair, something that everyone acknowledges."
"The first countries to approve the rigged election results, which include Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Belarus, should be the first to take a look in the mirror."
"I would like to thank the Ukrainian opposition forces for calmly and patiently managing to make the voice of democracy heard in difficult circumstances."
"The EU should adopt a calm but determined stance on the situation in Ukraine."
"Our task is to promote democracy and human rights."
"This we have done in the case of Ukraine."
"Much will be decided in these elections."
"The elections will decide whether Ukraine is to become a large version of Poland, a western European country with an open attitude towards democracy, or a small version of Russia, which looks to the east and an authoritarian, quasi-democracy."
"I hope that we in the EU agree which would be preferable."
"We will nevertheless respect the Ukrainian people’s right of self-determination."
"As long as the second round of elections is organised democratically and fairly, we have to respect the outcome, whether it accords with our personal opinions or not."
"If what I personally hope for were to happen and Yushchenko won, the losing party, that is, Yanukovich’s supporters, would not just fade into the background."
"We have to be able to work closely with them too."
"The Ukrainian nation is already a very much divided one, and we should not add to or aggravate this division and the policies it relies on."
"We need to secure a peaceful solution to enable all the Ukrainian people to continue building their society as a united Ukraine based on democracy, human rights, and the EU’s common principles of the rule of law."
". May I start by expressing my thanks for the congratulations to the Dutch Presidency and, more importantly, my appreciation for the EU’s major involvement in its important neighbouring country, Ukraine, which was evident from all the speeches that have been made."
"I am delighted that this is also apparent from the fact that your Parliament is sending a delegation to Ukraine this evening."
"I think that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and others have made it abundantly clear what part – in many ways an important one – the European Union has played in the developments in Ukraine."
"Since a few somewhat more critical questions have been raised and comments made, it may be useful to point out that Europe was, of course, in Ukraine before the first round, and had given signals and sent warnings, for example in connection with access to the media during the preparations for the elections."
"As you know, and I am saying this because there may have been some confusion in this matter, it was after the first round that we took steps, issued our statements and developed our activities."
"I share the view of a number of Members of this House – first expressed by Mr Schulz, but later by Mrs Staniszewska – that this is also a moment to be proud of what the European Union is doing, of the way we are trying to get the democratic model to work outside of Europe."
"As Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Schulz, Mr Geremek, Mr Kaminski and many others have already stated, it is true that there is broad agreement in your House about what the position is and should be, and that there is also broad agreement with the Commission and the Council."
"Understandably, reference has also been made to the historical significance of what is going on here."
"Similarities were drawn with, among others, Poland in 1980 and the Commissioner mentioned 1989 in many other former Eastern European countries."
"Rarely have I heard the Council, the Commission and Parliament speak with one voice to such an extent, because we refuse to accept the results which the central election committee has announced."
"We demand a new second round for the elections."
"Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Brok and others did not pull their punches in that respect."
"We have absolute agreement on this."
"We all want free, fair and transparent elections, and a peaceful solution which also guarantees Ukraine’s territorial integrity."
"With regard to the timing of the new second round of elections, to which reference is made in the resolution, both parties will first need to embark on further consultations."
"On the one hand, a bit of time is needed to gain an insight into the correct circumstances, for example in relation to provisions to enable sufficient observers to visit that country."
"On the other hand, I very much understand the concern that the whole process is being dragged out or delaying tactics are being applied."
"We should not accept this, because everyone, the people of Ukraine in particular, is entitled to have a new President elected in a free and fair manner as soon as possible."
"It is understandable that the size of the observation mission should also attract comment."
"Allow me, further to a number of remarks on your part, to say that I too hope that the Commission will take initiatives, so that we will have an extensive European Union delegation in that country, obviously in tandem with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, to ensure that the elections will be truly free, transparent and fair."
"Some of you have, of course, mentioned Russia as the other important partner in these developments, and in that connection I am pleased to inform you that we as presidency will, of course, maintain the very close contacts with Russia and that Mr Balkenende, in his capacity as President of the European Council, phoned Mr Putin again today and that both have concluded on a positive note that there is only one way forward, namely the peaceful solution within the legal framework by means of dialogue."
"Needless to say, and I am addressing Mr Wiersma and others when I say this, many improvements are needed for those forthcoming elections."
"I should like to flag one in the first stage in the run-up to new second elections there, namely access to the media for all parties, as we indicated prior to the first round."
"That should mean that the media should show more examples which herald a bright future under the motto ‘the future is bright, the future is orange’."
"This time round, orange is not the colour of the Dutch Presidency, because as you know orange is the Dutch national colour."
"Neither is orange the colour for a certain candidate, as has been remarked by a number of you, but is, as Mr Geremek and other have stated, a colour symbolising solidarity with all Ukrainians who demand free and fair elections."
"Mr President, at my hearings, I expressed the hope that Europe would increasingly speak with one voice, and I am very glad to find us going in that direction the first time I address this House."
"Rarely can there have been such agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and I hope that is something we can achieve more often."
"My hope is that, if we speak with one voice, this will also really result in positive action of the kind we have just described and that I do not need to repeat now."
"I did of course listen carefully to your observations, some of which were rather critical, and I would like to consider some of them."
"Firstly, many of you said that the European Commission or the European Union itself had shown too much of a hands-off attitude when it came, for example, to the observation of elections."
"To that I would like to say that I was myself President of the OSCE in 2000; we have a major organisation in Europe, which puts a great deal of effort into observing elections."
"On the ground, there is also ODIHR, which is a very important institution, and I believe that the OSCE should work together with ODIHR and the European Union on a basis of complementarity."
"In this case, though, it was the OSCE that made these elections its own particular concern."
"Nevertheless, I will readily respond to your appeals and have already done some preparatory research."
"We are more than willing to get involved; we will see how much we can do, and, as I have said, my rapid reaction mechanism contains a number of things, similar to those we used in Georgia, that I can now tell you about."
"There is a whole range of things that we have been doing for two years already, including projects in support of training, for example the training of local election observers, along with projects for the information of voters and for training the members of local electoral commissions and journalists, and projects relating to the reporting of elections or helping to reform legislation on elections and the media."
"As you can see, we have been far from inactive, but I do believe that the various institutions in which we all work should complement each other in the work they do."
"My second point is that it has been said time and time again that Europe did not go far enough and that we too bore some responsibility for Ukraine’s present situation."
"That is something I really must repudiate."
"In my former capacity as Austria’s foreign minister, I sought out very close contacts with Ukraine, and I can tell you that the European Union’s partnership and cooperation agreement, which was negotiated above all by the Commission, has, unfortunately, been insufficiently implemented."
"Over and over again, I really did go to a lot of trouble about this and told people that they had to do something themselves."
"I believe that the time has now come to put this neighbourhood policy really centre stage in my policy, and that is what I intend to do; it goes without saying that what we do about the action plans in the immediate future depends on how Ukraine itself now reacts."
"My plan is to put these things on the table provided that we can really make speed about tackling them."
"One of you said that Europe shares a single soul and that shared soul is also present in Ukraine."
"Let us all be inspired by that to join together in giving this shared soul wings!"
"I have received six motions for resolutions."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The debate is closed."
"– The policy of the ΕU is blatant, unacceptable, provocative intervention in the internal affairs of Ukraine."
"The critical situation in which the people find themselves is the result of the restoration of capitalism and subsequent intervention by and competition between the imperialist powers and of the policy followed by the elite in the new imperialist order who have been governing the country over recent years."
"The undisguised intervention of the ΕU, with the presence of Mr Solana and the governments of Poland and Latvia, suppresses any concept of national independence and is connected to efforts by the ΕU to safeguard a beneficial playing ground for controlling the region in the tug of war between USA and Russia."
"The EU stand that it does not support either candidate is hypocritical in the extreme, when it has turned into Yushchenko's pre-campaign office."
"The statements by the US administration on the Ukraine regime are also provocative when, exactly one year ago, it was praising it on its positive stand on the war against Iraq."
"The ΕU, the USA and Russia are interested in securing their interests in Ukraine and are exploiting the dissatisfaction being expressed by the people with the policy being applied, which both contenders for power endorse."
"It is in the interest of the Ukrainian people, who alone have the authority to resolve their problems, to overturn the current policy, expressions of it and foreign intervention."
"The next item is the Financial Perspectives, with an oral question to the Council on preparation of the next financial perspective."
". Mr President, as Vice-Chairman of the Temporary Committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013, I am speaking on behalf of the Chairman, Mr Borrell Fontelles, to put his question to the Council, and I welcome Mr Nicolaï being here."
"As the Council knows, Parliament convened this temporary committee and Mr Böge is its rapporteur; so far we have eight working documents and because as yet they are only working documents, we have not taken any formal positions."
"Hopefully the questions that we put before the Council and the responses that we get back will help us reach some conclusions."
"Having said that, to be perfectly honest, I hope that when Parliament does make its decisions there are certain items that it will be resolute about."
"In the previous Parliament, in a report that was voted in my name, we set out certain conditions, certain priorities, one of which was quite simple: there will be no interinstitutional agreement without the agreement of Parliament."
"The Council is well aware of this but it needs to be stressed, as it is in the text of this oral question."
"We have also the issue of the length of the proposed financial perspective and Parliament will, I am pretty sure, bring it down to something like five years rather than seven years."
"More important is the position of a fallback. Mr Böge asks in one of his working documents: what are the options if we cannot come to an agreement with the Council?"
"Do we go for Article 26 of the IIA or do we go for Article 272 of the Treaty?’"
"Having been in this Parliament for the past 15 years and involved with the Committee on Budgets for all that time, I am pretty sure that Parliament will go for Article 272."
"That message needs to be got across to the Council."
"I know that you, Mr Nicolaï, are well aware of that and also of the consequences if we do not reach an agreement."
"Therefore, it is incumbent on both our institutions to make sure that we reach an agreement."
"Moving away from the oral question for one moment, I am now the rapporteur for the discharge, and it is becoming obvious that Parliament’s budget gets a bad press every November when the Court of Auditors report is produced."
"I would hope that the institutions – and if not the institutions then at least I hope Parliament – can make a decision that we will not conclude an interinstitutional agreement until the budgetary authority has agreed a solution to the audit, to the legality and regularity of the European Union budget."
"It is no use concluding a financial perspective that will be seen by the general public as being misspent, misused and irregular throughout the next five, six, seven years or whatever period we agree to."
"I come now to the questions; they are there for everyone to see and are quite simple."
"The first one is: ‘How does the Council intend to cooperate with Parliament?’"
"We are talking about how we are going to work together."
"Hopefully we will not work as two separate organisations and there will be some work in tandem, so that we can share our ideas and make sure that the building-block approach of the Council matches our own approach as set out in Mr Böge’s working documents."
"There is also a question about the calendar of the Presidency, when you hope to conclude, what your present Netherlands Presidency hopes to achieve, and what you think the next Presidency will achieve by the middle of next year."
"We mentioned the issue of trialogues, but it is fair to say that after an informal meeting we had this morning, Mr Nicolaï, you may give us a response to that."
"Parliament’s position right now is that we should be having monthly trialogues, but I am sure your response will enlighten us on your thinking on this."
"I personally go some way towards your sentiments on this."
"An important issue is the question regarding the ‘Prodi package’."
"We really need to know where the Council is coming from."
"What is the basis for your building blocks?"
"What is the basis for your working documents?"
"Is it the Prodi package or are you taking a different approach?"
"Finally, the last question: ‘In the Council’s view, what connection exists between the Commission’s proposals on the new financial perspective and the issue of own resources?’"
"Some of us, being British, are not bothered, but for the majority in this House it is a crucial issue."
"On that, Mr Nicolaï, we would appreciate some answers."
". Mr President, let me start with Mr Wynn’s remark about what will happen if there is no agreement on the financial perspectives."
"That was not the nicest way to begin a debate in the European Parliament, because I believe we will reach agreement with Parliament on the financial perspective on time."
"As Mr Borrell and Mr Wynn pointed out, the next financial perspectives represent one of the weightiest and most significant dossiers currently facing the Union."
"The Council is therefore grateful to have been given the chance of setting out briefly how it is envisaged that this dossier should be dealt with."
"As you will be aware, the timetable for finalising work was laid out in the Multiannual Strategic Programme for 2004-2006, adopted by the European Council in December 2003."
"Thus, with the majority of the Commission’s financial and legislative proposals already on the table, work is currently under way within the Council, aimed at possibly reaching decisions on principles and guidelines this month."
"The intention is to achieve political agreement before the June 2005 European Council so that both the framework itself and the detailed legislation can finally be adopted by the end of 2005."
"Preparatory work on new Community programmes would thereafter be carried out throughout 2006 so that they could be implemented from the beginning of the new financial perspective period."
"As already mentioned, after producing two overall communications – one in February and a follow-up in July – the Commission has also presented a package of detailed proposals setting out the legal framework for key policy areas."
"These include cohesion policy, conservation and management of natural resources, Lisbon-related issues and external relations and will be completed by a small number of additional proposals concerning in particular freedom, security and justice, and research and development."
"The Council wishes to reassure Mr Borrell that the Commission’s proposal constitutes the basis for work in the Council and is in accordance with normal institutional practice."
"However, I think you will agree that, again in accordance with normal institutional practice, it is open to any Member State to agree or disagree to a greater or lesser extent with the financial implications of a Commission proposal and thus endeavour to move the dossier in a direction more agreeable to it."
"This is part of the normal process of negotiations."
"As far as the Union’s own resources are concerned, the Commission has submitted as part of its legislative package a report on the operation of the own-resources system as well as two proposals."
"These proposals make provision for the possibility of new tax-based own resources to be operational as from 2014, as well as for a generalised correction mechanism."
"Preliminary work on these proposals has started and it is generally agreed that the concept of the globality of the financial perspective negotiations implies not only that individual policy areas must be viewed together in the context of overall expenditure, but also that expenditure must be seen in the context of the overall negotiations, including the question of own resources in all its aspects."
"The Council also recalls in this connection that own resources formed an integral part of the 1999 Berlin agreement on which the current financial perspective is based."
"On cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, it should be recalled that, as specified in the joint declaration of July referred to by Mr Wynn and Mr Borrell, the Council is committed to an exchange of information with the European Parliament throughout the process."
"The precise arrangements for putting this into practice will need to be established by common agreement between the parties."
"The Council continues to act in accordance with the terms of the July declaration whereby the financial perspective should be negotiated in a spirit of loyal institutional cooperation, with the institutions willing to take all measures necessary for successful completion of the procedure leading to its adoption."
"The partners accordingly need to reflect on how best to give concrete expression to this spirit of cooperation, which will certainly need to deepen as negotiations within the Council intensify and firmer Council positions take shape."
"The Council could, to this end, draw inspiration from constructive practices followed during the last financial perspective negotiations, which enabled a satisfactory dialogue to take place with the European Parliament, culminating in the adoption of the current interinstitutional agreement in May 1999."
"In this context, to conclude I wish to refer to the idea, also mentioned by Mr Wynn, of holding a monthly trialogue."
"Based on my experience as President-in-Office, I should like to stress that the Council, and therefore the President-in-Office, will not be able to take a position in such a formal setting."
"The negotiations in the Council are ongoing and difficult, as you know."
"In such a context it would be preferable to continue the current practice of informal contacts between the presidency and representatives of the European Parliament."
"I am convinced that these contacts will be fruitful and enable our institutions to play our respective roles."
"Furthermore, you can be sure that the Council will look very carefully at the content of relevant resolutions and use them in its deliberations."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we do indeed want the negotiations on the Financial Perspective and the European Union’s political priorities to produce agreement in good time, but we want an agreement that, at the same time, does justice to the demands that are made on the new and enlarged European Union."
"So let me tell you, as rapporteur for the temporary committee, that the quality of the agreement is also more important than the deadline."
"Taking the discussions with Parliament’s specialist committees as our basis, we in the temporary committee are trying to define the political priorities for the years to come, and to put forward the upper limits for the structure of the European Budget, thereby laying down this House’s negotiating position ready for its discussions with the Council."
"By doing this, we want to guarantee that, on the one hand, of course, traditional policies will be no less important and, on the other, that the European Union will present itself better, both internally and externally, and finally become what the Constitutional Treaty defines it as being – a Union of citizens and states."
"That is why we are discussing among ourselves the political priorities on the basis of what value they add to Europe, and talking about how the European Budget can take greater account than hitherto of the Lisbon objectives, such as growth, employment and sustainability."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I see it as very important, in the light of past experience, that we should make it very clear that we want agreement to be reached in good time, thus preventing us from getting into difficulties – not so much with the Budget as with the legislative process."
"Let me say, though, that we could end up, in the course of the coming year, with a worst case scenario, and then we will all need to have safety nets at the ready, such as those provided for the Budget in the Treaties and the Regulations, namely Article 26 of the Inter-Institutional Agreement or Article 272 of the Treaty."
"At the same time, though, we will have to guarantee that, if the worst comes to the worst, it is made clear that the legal bases for structural funds and for multiannual programmes will also be extended if need be, that is to say, if there is no alternative."
"Perhaps the mere announcement of safety nets and alternatives of this kind and the fact that we are discussing them will help all the parties involved to become aware of their responsibilities and – with next year’s referendums in sight – will help to make it clear that we in the European institutions are willing and able to announce, at the right time, that we have succeeded in reaching agreement on the Financial Perspective."
"I want to echo what was said by Mr Wynn, the first deputy chairman of the temporary committee."
"The issue of the Statement of Assurance is important, as is that of how we handle the financial regulation that has just entered into force, and these must, in this context, be sorted out alongside each other."
"This is not just about the upper limits, commitments and payment appropriations, but also about how the Commission, and also the Member States, manage the Budget as a whole."
"That is why we will also, in this context, have to discuss the Court of Auditors’ Statement of Assurance and the issue of the financial regulation, and also whether, at the end of the day, financial programming should be for seven years or for four."
"We will have to have in-depth discussions of these issues too."
"It is vitally important that there should be guarantees of both a flexible and permanent trialogue whenever one is required, and, at the same time, of the informal and confidential conversations that we need to have if we are not to end up in a state of chaos at the end of the negotiations."
"That is what we would urge the Council to provide."
"Alongside this, we will also be addressing an oral question to the Commission in Strasbourg."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to take the precaution of saying that it is always possible to be frank with friends."
"I agree with previous speakers, but I am not going to expand on that; I would like to focus on other issues."
"The news reaching us from the Council is at times imprecise and partial, often because that institution tends to be rather secretive."
"I believe, therefore, that this oral question is useful to us in terms of clarifying certain issues."
"We all know that certain Member States have asked that payment appropriations for the next financial perspectives be below a certain percentage of the Union’s gross national product."
"We have also heard rumours that other States defend that maximum, but applied to commitment appropriations, although it is not clear whether they are doing so in order to test the waters or whether they are truly convinced that that is sufficient to cover the real needs of the European Union."
"It appears that some people have the fundamental political objective of getting their minimal proposals accepted and then imposing ‘the necessary cuts’ in order to achieve those minimums."
"Could you tell us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether this method consisting of setting limits on resources and then making cuts also corresponds to a method you use in your deliberations?"
"If this is the case, it does not frighten us, because we suffer the same thing every year when we approve the draft annual budget."
"This is what in English is known as the ‘building block’ method, which has prevailed in your work to date, and what has been the result?"
"Furthermore, in the letter signed jointly last December by those six States, we are assured of the following, which I would like to read in English, since it is the original language of the document:"
"The new financial perspective should allow us to exploit the extraordinary potential of the enlarged Union, and the opportunities it offers our citizens."
"EU spending should add real value, and aim more actively at transforming the EU into the most competitive and innovative area worldwideOther key tasks are further developing the common foreign and security policy, protecting our external borders, and managing migration flows."
"We are deeply committed to the principle of European solidarity, and to the maintenance of cohesion in the enlarged Union."
"Does the Presidency agree with these priorities?"
"And if it does, to what extent and at the expense of what expenditure?"
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament is demanding – and previous speakers have done so – a commitment to a genuine and constant dialogue between the Council and Parliament."
"A genuine dialogue."
"Or does the Council think it can come to Parliament with a and present it to Parliament for rubber-stamping?"
"If that is the case, I would like to say that, despite the apocalyptic description of a Community world without financial perspectives given by the Commissioner for budgets over recent days, increasing numbers of Members of Parliament will not accept financial perspectives which do not guarantee, and now I quote Mr Böge, ‘the correct implementation of the policies we have drawn up in the European Union’."
"I would also like to tell the Council that nobody has more interest in the financial perspectives than Parliament, but not at any price."
"The European Parliament has been proposing that the financial perspectives be included in the Treaties since Maastricht, while the Council has only accepted it after the Convention has drawn up new financial provisions."
"We, more than anybody, want to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives for after 2006."
"But not financial perspectives based on accountancy."
"At the end of the day, Mr President, we should never forget that the financial perspectives are an instrument, not an end in themselves."
"Mr President, we do know how difficult it is to bring about agreement between EU Heads of State or Government as to the framework for the EU Budget."
"Everyone looks after his or her own interests, and each Head of State will be measured and assessed on how well allowance has been made for narrow interests in the final result of the negotiation."
"Fortunately, we can, however, say that it is not exclusively this struggle between national interests that will determine the budget framework, or financial perspectives, for the next few years. There is, of course, quite a lot that the European Parliament needs to say."
". Mr President, the President of the Council has a positive attitude."
"He believes in dialogue and is convinced that we will reach agreement."
"The only conclusion I can draw from that is that he has distanced himself from the misbegotten requirement to have the budget at 1% of GDP, because that would, after all, render an agreement impossible."
"Fortunately, he has abandoned this scheme, because it goes without saying that a larger European Union tackling more problems needs more funds."
"Naturally, I do not have complete peace of mind yet, because there are plenty of Finance Ministers who mainly view 2006 as a basis for the budget of 2007 and think that the 2006 budget should certainly not exceed that of 2007."
"My group takes a different approach to these matters."
"We look ahead to 2013 and to what we want to have achieved by that time."
"To the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Commission’s proposal forms a sound basis, but one that needs fleshing out quite a bit."
"That can be done, for example, by means of investments in the area of rural development, the environment, sustainable energy, research and exchange programmes for young people, teachers and artists."
"We also attach importance to flexibility."
"We need a framework which will enable us to meet the EU’s challenges, including those of 2013."
"It is clear to my group that we should not only discuss the EU’s expenditure but also its revenue."
"The President of the Council spoke about a number of minor adjustments a moment ago, such as the limit on net contributions, but we also, of course, require something far more fundamental."
"These days, this whole discussion of net contributions often leads to irritation and to irrational spending, because much compensatory action is needed, and also to a budget that is far too low."
"We should therefore discuss revenue on a more serious level."
"We should discuss a minimum tariff on environmental pollution or company tax which is siphoned off directly to the European Union."
"In that case, that amount is not added to national tax but replaces it."
"That will only benefit a rational discussion about the EU’s expenditure."
". Mr President, Parliament already has a clear idea about what the Commission’s position is regarding the proposal by Mr Prodi’s Commission."
"Mr Barroso’s Commission is not making a new proposal."
"What is not clear for Parliament is whether it will adopt a position in the forthcoming financial perspective just on common expenditure, or budgetary income also, that is to say, own resources."
"Could the country to hold the Presidency predict at this stage whether it will agree to discuss own resources with Parliament?"
"The proposal by Mr Prodi’s Commission calls for the United Kingdom’s special rebate on its membership contributions to be abolished."
"That is only fair."
"Does the Council really need to have the support of Parliament to raise this issue?"
"How strong is the Council’s commitment to a 1% maximum?"
"As a representative of the Netherlands, the country to hold the Presidency, could you say for certain whether this 1% refers to commitments or real payments?"
"Finally, many members of our group have taken a negative view of financing the work of the Union through special Eurotaxes, and in this matter we support the position of some Members of the Council."
"Mr President, as a member of the temporary committee, I abstained from voting on a resolution that I had not been allowed to study first and that I cannot support."
"I wish, in this House, to summarise my position, which is different from that which emerged in the temporary committee."
"I support the idea of there needing to be a ceiling on expenditure during the forthcoming seven-year period up until 2013."
"In my view, it is important to have such a ceiling, which should apply not only to expenses and payments but also to commitments."
"I think it important not simply to dismiss this view, which only six out of twenty-five countries are said to have supported, for the countries concerned are those that make major net contributions."
"It should be emphasised that unity is required on this issue if it is to be possible to adopt a financial framework and that there is a very strong desire not to impose unduly heavy burdens upon national taxpayers."
"It is also regrettable that the Prodi Commission’s old report was taken as the basis for the Commission’s proposal."
"I believe that the basis should have been the one per cent target but that Parliament must, however, have a large influence on the distribution of resources within this framework."
"In other words, this is not a tactic for moving resources to one area or another."
"It is only within such a framework that a true prioritising of resources can be brought about."
"I also support the seven-year plan because it provides regulations for budgeting in each country, an activity funded not by the European Parliament but by the national parliaments."
"We are clearly opposed to the EU’s introducing its own forms of taxation, for that would lead to a loss of overall control of taxation."
"I also wish to emphasise our belief that agriculture should not be exempt from such re-planning as is necessary if it is to be possible to invest in new areas."
"Such re-planning will provide scope for many new initiatives."
"Mr President, what is now being negotiated about the Financial Perspective will, I think, turn out to be the most crucial litmus test in the whole of the European Union’s history."
"It will now become apparent whether the targets that keep on being set, and the declarations of intent, can be turned into real policies."
"A litmus test makes evaluation possible."
"Will it really be possible to top up the funds for research support – which is what they need – and move their focus to small and medium-sized firms, and away from the funding for large companies that major lobbyists favour?"
"Will it be possible to achieve the breakthroughs that are needed in education? Will it be possible to make real savings in administration, without more new concealed channels being found?"
"On that will depend the amount of money that will actually be involved."
"I would opt for a different approach: we should start by talking about what expenditure is actually needed and then decide on the ceiling."
"Mr President, this is the first debate on the financial perspectives and, therefore, I hope that we will have another opportunity when the chairman of our parliamentary committee can participate."
"The question today focuses on certain issues on which there is undoubtedly no fundamental neutrality: firstly, the participation of the European Parliament, as several Members have stressed, such as Mr Böge – and I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement of good intentions – and, secondly, the working timetable."
"For many reasons, Mr President, whether the work ends in an agreement in 2005 or in 2006 is important because, if we are obliged to defer the budget, as the Commissioner responsible for the budget acknowledged yesterday, it will be the cohesion policy that pays the price."
"I would, therefore, like to draw the attention of certain Members to the risk to solidarity in the European Union of having an unjustified showdown between the European Parliament and the other institutions."
"We would like to reach an agreement during the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I would, therefore, like the Dutch Presidency to tell us how work is going on approving the general lines of the reform at the European Council on the 17 December."
"We are delighted that the Presidency has said that the basis for this debate will be the European Commission's proposal, but how do those of you who claim to be Europeanists intend to deal with the cost of enlargement, expand internal and external Community policies and at the same time reduce the European Union's budgetary spending?"
"I do not know whether you have a magic wand or the capacity to perform miracles, or whether perhaps you intend to destroy cohesion for the old Member States, in other words, make the poor regions of the statistically or genuinely rich countries meet the cost of the economic development of the poor regions of the new Member countries."
"You have less than two weeks to answer these questions if you do not want the Dutch Presidency to be tarnished at the end of its term in office."
"You should start thinking about how to justify wanting more Europe while spending less money, because nobody understands that."
"What we do understand very well is that less money means less Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am glad to be able to greet you again so soon and to be dealing with you."
"As many have said, what we are dealing with now is one of the greatest challenges we face, second only to the annual deliberations on the Budget."
"If one is to accept such a great challenge, one already associated with such bellicose language and accompanied – in that figures have already been produced for our consideration – by the opening of many secondary theatres of war, it is a good thing to keep a cool head and work through things in a systematic fashion."
"I can assure you that there are many in this House who will approach this matter with a calm mind, rather than allowing themselves to be distracted."
"Our task is to see to it that this House is sufficiently involved, and we will of course insist on that through the proper channels and press the point if the need to do so arises."
"My colleagues and I are very grateful to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for having refrained from playing games with numbers and for having adopted a ‘building block’ approach, which focuses attention on matters of substance."
"You have said that we have to closely examine the individual policy areas in order to see what we can actually do, and what we want for Europe in the future, and the work you are doing reflects that."
"We will work in parallel with you and make proposals where necessary, hoping that you will take account of them in your calculations during the process rather than only when it is drawing to a close."
"There will inevitably be many questions in our own minds, those being the questions raised by the European policy of the future, and the public demand answers to them."
"We will, in future, have new tasks to take upon ourselves, and we will also have to talk about whether the existing policies as set down to date were shaped in the right way."
"We will not be abandoning principles, and one that we do not believe can be abandoned is that of cohesion in this Europe of ours."
"It is in areas such as this, for example, that there is discussion as to whether we want to make universal provision – as we have done in the past – or whether we want to promote lighthouses and centres of growth."
"This we will have to discuss with you, and a discussion of this kind, dealing with details and substance, calls for courage."
"It will demand courage of the Council, for it is the Council that will have to say when certain things are to be sold to the public as European tasks, one example being the reinforcement of security in the wake of 11 September, and another being cooperation in the foreign policy sphere, for which funding will be needed."
"We, Members of the European Parliament, will also need the courage to repatriate to the national level certain things that are not best performed at European level."
"We will have to have a debate about this."
"I would like to give brief consideration to the issue of duration, which two speakers have already addressed."
"The fact is that the seven years we are talking about – a period running until 2013 – amounts to nine years from today."
"Just bear in mind that it is for a period of nine years that we will be making estimates; nine years ago, Michael Jackson’s was number one in the hit parades, the word ‘euro’ had only just been invented, and it was nine years ago that Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the European Union."
"That was nine years ago!"
"As we now have to talk in terms of that sort of period running into the future, I do think we have to watch out."
"We should in fact be putting this duration back under the microscope."
"Four years or three years would be something else."
"It was four years ago that we adopted the Treaty of Nice."
"That is a manageable period of time, so let us talk about the periods for which the Financial Perspective might run."
"Let us also, though, discuss the issue of flexibility, which we need."
"The European Union’s development is not linear; we need change."
"Over past months, we have had, again and again, to make use of the flexibility instrument."
"You know every bit as well as we do that discussion of that is on the agenda."
"I also want to address the issue of the revenue side, for an MEP cannot be happy to be always given the task of maximising expenditure, that being assumed to be the only thing we are interested in."
"Such is not the case!"
"If we are to talk in terms of net contributors and net burdens, we want to know whether the engines pulling us are capable of having more wagons attached to them until they are incapable of moving, or how we can raise the money."
"So something else we want to discuss with you is the mechanisms that the revenue side requires, and what I would like you to tell us is whether you are willing to have us involved over and above the extent specified in the Treaty, whether you are willing to talk to us and take us seriously where expenditure and revenue are concerned, or whether that is where you want us to be completely detached."
"If you want results, I can do no other than urge you to cooperate with us."
"We will have to fight it out among ourselves at various points along the way, but I do believe that results are achieved when self-confident people deal with one another, each of them knowing what he is capable of and what is expected of him."
"Mr President, Minister, the EU’s forthcoming financial perspective is part of a whole entity that covers the exhaustive reform of Community policy."
"Along with the financial perspective, the system of the EU’s own resources is to be reformed, as are several multi-annual programmes, including regional and structural policy."
"All this will require an immense amount of work and familiarisation with the new arrangements on the part of Parliament, and good levels of cooperation from the different European Union institutions."
"Some tough negotiations are to be expected on the financial perspective."
"It is important that Parliament is not put under any pressure in these talks, although there have already been signs of that."
"If there is no agreement on the financial perspective by the time of the deadline, the EU budget can be drafted reasonably successfully on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty."
"Of course, in that case the measures aimed at improving employment would be delayed."
"The incomplete state of the financial perspective must not be an excuse for stonewalling legislative proposals."
"The Member States have an enormous responsibility here and their disagreements should not be reflected in the day-to-day work of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council that we agree to his timetable."
"We do so even though he has concealed from us the fact that, at the Spanish-German summit a few days ago, another timetable was referred to, with 2006 as the date set for agreement."
"What that means is that they are juggling two timetables, and, speaking as a regional politician, I can only describe that as irresponsible."
"The regions need to be able to plan ahead with confidence."
"If regional planning comes to an end at the end of 2006, there will then be funds committed for only another year."
"What we need instead is for the relevant preparations to be made two years in advance, thus making it possible for structural assistance to be paid out in good time, for if this is not done, there will be a black hole in support funding."
"Nor is annuality any sort of solution for regional politicians, and so we all, in the eyes of the public, share responsibility, but the European Parliament will come to an agreement next year, and so the question that arises in my mind is that of what the Council proposes to do, and what you, in particular, are doing in the last days of your Presidency to stir the Member States into action at last."
"On the assumption that you have got a move on – and I am given to understand today that you have – how do you get the others to do likewise?"
"The only way we can continue with this debate in a responsible way is if you really do take some action, rather than merely engaging in the cautious diplomacy we have seen to date."
"When economic and social cohesion was discussed at the turn of the 1990s, the figures were different."
"They ranged from 1.22 to 1.32 and settled at 1.27."
"Today everything has been rounded down to 1, even though thousandths could potentially show that some resistance has taken place."
"When the latest enlargement brought yet more social inequality and regional imbalance, the number 1 became an unfortunate symbol, a symbol that has begun to develop a resonance with the wider public."
"Whilst we project the unity of the business and military strands and whilst the unity of the Stability and Growth Pact only serves to exacerbate social and regional ‘disunity’, the adoption of 1% in the Financial Perspectives is a way of fostering individuality over solidarity and cohesion."
"In order to reverse this trend, our group tabled some amendments. We were the only ones to do so, and our amendments are the only ones to offer a clear sign of resistance."
"We did this, above all, in opposition to the 1%, a symbol of what we do not want: an individualist, selfish Europe, a Europe that is united around business and the military, with no social solidarity or regional cohesion."
"Naturally I had much more to say, but only had one minute in which to speak."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are opposed to the European Union, as it cannot resolve the problems Europe’s citizens and states are currently facing and will face in the future."
"The opposite is actually the case, as the EU aggravates and precipitates these difficulties, and gives rise to even greater differences, discrepancies and conflicts."
"In economic terms, Europe is confronted with two basic problems."
"The first is economic growth, which as a rule is slower in Europe than in the United States and Asia, with consequences such as high levels of unemployment and a fall in the competitiveness of businesses."
"The second is the growing difference in income levels between the rich old Europe and the poor new Europe."
"There are also two main problems with regard to social issues."
"The first relates to values."
"I have in mind the crisis of the family as a key institution."
"This is linked to the second problem, namely the ageing of societies and Europe’s falling population."
"These demographic problems do not only affect Belgium, Germany and France but also poor countries, such as Ukraine, Romania and Poland."
"If we consider the EU’s actions or proposed actions in this field, it becomes apparent that the EU lacks a vision of how to solve problems relating to economic growth and reducing differences, for example."
"Above all, the EU lacks a strategy for reversing the trend of Europe’s depopulation."
"Have there been any changes to the 2005-2006 draft budget as a result of the fact that ten new countries have joined the EU, and that the number of its citizens has increased from 380 million to 450 million, or by nearly 20%?"
"No, there have been no changes."
"The 2005-2006 budget is based on an increase in expenditure of less than 10%, which, corrected for inflation, is in fact less than 7%, and equivalent to the contributions made by the new Member States."
"2005 and 2006 are therefore lost years in terms of EU integration, and, worse still, differences may even be exacerbated."
"In the context of the budget forecasts for 2007-2013, this is a very bad sign."
"Was the 2007-2013 budget negotiated and agreed with the new Member States?"
"Of course it was not, as it was submitted to Parliament by the outgoing Commissioners."
"What is more, the debate on this draft is taking place within a temporary parliamentary committee, which was appointed to undermine the existing Committee on Budgets and spread the responsibility for whichever solution was adopted."
"This is evidence of the way in which the EU’s procedures lack transparency and clarity."
"It also illustrated the horse-trading that goes on within, the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"The provisions of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective provide no answer to Europe’s basic problems."
"If we adopt the principle that the budget will be set at 1% of GDP, the economic divide will only be widened."
"Worse still, as a result of the Lisbon strategy, expenditure on research and development will increase by 300%, with these funds going mainly to the old EU Member States, whereas expenditure on the Structural and Cohesion Funds will increase by only 30%, which means that backward countries will lag ever further behind highly--developed countries."
"We advocate a free, safe and rapidly developing Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"It is said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"Many of the key documents of the European Union are full of good intentions."
"This goes for the Lisbon strategy and doubly so for the financial perspectives setting out the new financial framework of the enlarged European Union for the period 2007 – 2013."
"Perhaps this is why we are now witnessing a slowing down in the economic growth of the Eurozone in comparison with our main world competitors."
"During the 1990s, when the 15 Member States of the European Union were making a particular effort to flood the markets of the Eastern European countries, the average annual growth in productivity was 2.3%."
"Now it is just 1.2% per annum and productivity in the Eurozone is more than a third lower than in the USA."
"In this respect I welcome the appearance of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Borrell at the meeting of the European Council, where he explicitly pointed out the discrepancies between the Lisbon strategy and reality."
"This is a real threat to any kind of financial perspective if it is not backed up by real implementation."
"Any discussion about the new financial perspective cannot be confined to the financial frameworks and the intentions of the European Union but must consider the effective use of common resources and concrete measures to raise the level of competitiveness of the EU."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, when talking about the financing of the Union from 2007 to 2013, I personally have two concerns: one relating to the amount of financing and the second relating to the timetable for taking decisions."
"As far as the amount of financing is concerned, it is clear that requirements due to the enlargement of the European Union are increasing."
"That is why we need to look first at the priorities of the new enlarged Union and then to start to talk about financing quotas."
"I fear that, in certain cases, exactly the opposite happens."
"However, in all events, enlargement should not operate to the detriment of the current cohesion countries and should not operate to the detriment of the cohesion policies of the European Union."
"Within this framework, I welcome the European Parliament's position that the Union needs satisfactory financing for the future, even though I am keeping a personal reservation for when we start discussing specific numbers."
"My second concern is with the timetable."
"Mr Nicolaï transmitted to us the Council's firm position that the objective is for us to finish in June."
"I hope that is the case."
"However, as you know and as certain honourable Members mentioned, there are rumours to the contrary."
"I do not think this is a good thing for the Union budget overall, especially for multiannual programmes such as those of the Structural Funds."
"Any delay here would have an adverse impact, because we need to know the regulations much earlier; the Member States and the regions need to prepare so that we do not lose time, as happened in the current programming period in 2000."
"Alternative solutions to extend the budget would appear to me to be extremely difficult."
"However, any alternative solutions would have an extremely adverse impact on the operation of the Structural Funds and on cohesion policies from 2007 onwards."
"That is why I should like a clear position by the Council on the timetable and on the alternative solutions which, in my opinion, are out of the question for the Structural Funds."
"– Mr President, the debate on the financial perspectives is of strategic importance to the future of Europe."
"It concerns the European Union's capacity to respond to the needs of its peoples and the challenges of the twenty-first century."
"The proposals submitted by the previous European Commission are, in our view, a good and balanced basis for discussion."
"However, the restrictive, accountant's approach taken by certain governments and the proclamation of 1% as a dogmatic objective are unacceptable at this stage of the negotiations."
"We are truly worried by the Council's apparent inability to respond effectively to the need to safeguard the development and redistributive character of the Community budget; this is something that, unfortunately, we noted once again during the budgetary procedure for 2005."
"The question of reliability arises when we call on the peoples of Europe to ratify the European Constitution, when we talk about speeding up the Lisbon strategy and we are not ready to make corresponding commitments about the financial resources for implementing these objectives."
"This is deceiving the citizens of the European Union."
"The Community budget which met the needs of the European Union of the 15 Member States cannot efficiently meet the needs of the Union of 25 Member States today or of 27 tomorrow."
"We, as the European Parliament, want there to be an agreement in good time, during 2005, on the financial perspectives which will guarantee the necessary and adequate financing for the policies of the European Union."
"We shall be working in this direction and we call on the Council too to stand up to its responsibilities."
"However, we wish to make clear that only a good and efficient agreement will be politically acceptable, an agreement which will efficiently safeguard development, employment, cohesion and solidarity for all citizens and all regions of the Union."
"Mr President, I share the opinion of many in this House that it is important to have an agreement about the financial perspectives for the future."
"That is preferable to falling back on some article or other, be it in the Treaty or elsewhere."
"That is why I believe it is to be welcomed that the Council intends to develop these new financial perspectives in thorough consultation and consensus with Parliament and to meet regularly for that purpose."
"I think that what the financial perspectives of the future could benefit from is more flexibility between the chapters."
"The Council could question, however, whether that is dangerous."
"I do not think so."
"After all, we have, with the current forms of flexibility, always stayed far below the standards which the agreement provide for."
"Another area of concern is cofinancing."
"Not all components of the budget are being ‘cofinanced’."
"Some are, some are not."
"I think that there is scope for flexibility in this respect too, including by different application in the poor and rich Member States of the European Union."
"– Mr President, the European Parliament at the start of hard and difficult negotiations needs to send out three clear messages: first, that we categorically reject the coercive letter for the Six, because this will result in less of a Europe and greater internal inequalities, in a Europe which is unable to support the policies decided by the European Union itself."
"Secondly, that we are seeking a multiannual financial framework which will allow prompt planning of policies and programmes and, of course, that we reject four- or five-year scenarios."
"Thirdly, and finally, the European Parliament should clearly state that it is not prepared to agree willy-nilly, if there are no guarantees that the policies which safeguard economic and social cohesion in the enlarged Europe of the 25 will be financed."
"We need more ambitious, not more wretched plans for the common Europe of the future which we are building."
"The Prodi package is simply a good starting point and we all need to agree that a bigger Europe with less money is out of the question."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in many countries the public are getting the impression that they contribute too much to the EU’s Budget, while getting too little back."
"All too often, though, the public do not know what the money is spent on and in what ways."
"It is by their own strategy, Mr President-in-Office, that many Member States reinforce their negative attitude, transferring more and more responsibilities – rightly, let me say, and thank God they do – to the European Union, but they are willing to pay less and less."
"They convey the impression that they pay too much, while concealing the fact that the European Union has never made full use of the financial framework that they have had a share in deciding."
"I regard this dual strategy as irresponsible; it involves taking refuge in number games and in pointless formalities."
"The Europe of the future needs honest cooperation between the Council, Parliament, the European public and the Commission."
"What Europe’s future also demands, though, is a clear answer to the question of how much money we need in order to successfully realise our political priorities."
"How much money do we need for growth, competitiveness, employment, research, the common foreign and security policy, the neighbourhood policy, social cohesion, sustainability, regional policy, small and medium-sized businesses, enlargement, the common agricultural policy and information and communication, to name only some of the items falling within the remit of the European institutions?"
"We call upon you to talk about the political priorities and to make available the funds that we need in order to carry out our tasks for the public’s benefit in a professional manner."
"– Mr President, four points should in my view take priority in this crucial debate: 1) the financial perspectives should be converted to the Lisbon parameters and objectives: the chapter on representativeness is the most important innovation introduced by the Commission proposal and should be strongly supported by Parliament; 2) the financing of the agricultural policy no longer reflects the new requirements of the European Union, even though the Commission has been unable to depart from the guidelines on this topic laid down by the Council; 3) it is important to provide for a transitional stage so as not to penalise those regions which, because of the so-called statistical effect, can no longer enjoy the support put aside for their development within the European Structural Funds, as will happen to certain regions in southern Italy; 4) we believe that the question of reforming the system of Member States’ contributions to the Union budget should not be put off indefinitely."
"In conclusion, we take a positive view of the Prodi package, particularly because of the new philosophy on which it is based, focusing on the creation of a competitive and growing Union, and, in our view, the own-resource ceiling cannot be brought down to below 1.27% if we want to achieve all our pre-established objectives."
"Mr President, I wanted to draw attention to the aspect of regional policy in connection with the next financial perspective."
"The first matter giving rise to questions is this – why does regional policy have secondary status in the Prodi Commission’s proposal and why is it not a priority, as it has been until now?"
"Possibly in order to obscure the fact that the amount of resources that the Prodi Commission wishes to devote to regional policy as a proportion of the gross domestic product of the European Union is falling every year."
"The proportion allocated to regional policy in the European Union budget for the next financial perspective is at approximately the same level as it was previously."
"In a situation where ten new Member States have already joined the European Union and where Romania and Bulgaria will be joining in 2007 the funds available for regional policy should be increased."
"That is why we would like to hear the European Council of Ministers answer this important question: does the European Council of Ministers consider it possible to renew priority status for regional policy and does it consider that the amount of funds allocated to European regional policy in the Prodi Commission’s proposal is adequate?"
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Council some more specific questions on the financial perspective."
"I too assume that solidarity should be the guiding principle for the distribution of cohesion funds in the enlarged EU."
"I would therefore like to draw the Council’s attention to two aspects of the Commission proposal which I find need further consideration."
"Firstly, does the Council consider as adequate the method proposed by the Commission for calculating the GNI average for the 4% capping for the whole seven-year period of the financial perspective?"
"At the same time, for the other aspect of the cohesion policy, provision is made for a mid-term review to adjust the regions’ eligibility according to their actual development."
"As it stands, on the one hand the Commission proposals are flexible for the phasing-out and phasing-in regions, but on the other hand it leaves the countries and regions for which capping is proposed in a sort of straitjacket for the whole seven-year period."
"I propose that the mid-term review granting some flexibility and adjustment to the actual growth of GNI should be considered for capping-designated countries as well."
"Secondly, does the Council consider feasible the Commission’s legal proposal whereby value-added tax would no longer be eligible for local government projects?"
"Such a proposal would further limit the least-developed municipalities’ opportunities to benefit from the European projects as it weighs heavily on their scant resources."
"I draw your attention to the fact that under the present system they are exempt from VAT."
"– Mr President, I think that we should perhaps look at the problem from a different angle."
"Parliament should point out to the Commission – and to the Council – that, over and above the purely quantitative method for strengthening the Lisbon strategy, there is also the question of European participation in the quality of global economic parameters, because quantitative data only allow us to look at economic growth statically, without any positive or negative coefficients."
"Consequently, we should be looking at the Commission's proposals from the dynamic point of view."
"One example clearly illustrates what I mean: research and technology."
"According to the Commission, spending on this sector in Europe up to 2013 will rise to EUR 23 billion."
"What does this mean in relation to the global environment?"
"At the moment, in the United States, we have 2.7%."
"However, there entrepreneurship has been strengthened so much because there are connections, what we call 'linkages' between businesses, the administration and the economy in the area as a whole."
"2.7% is a higher coefficient than our current 2% in Europe, which we shall, of course, push up to 3%."
"However, Japan, for example, has 3% and, precisely because it does not have these linkages, is now in recession and research and technology has not helped at all in getting it out of recession."
"Consequently, it is research and technology, this important part, which is a necessary but inadequate condition for growth."
"Two further preconditions are needed, the dissemination of technology – the linkages I mentioned – and, at the same time, the major problem in my view is that there must be recovery, because in times of recession, businesses – I am still referring to the 'research and technology' problem – only look at things from the point of view of their cash flow management and they are unable to push ahead with major technological inventions."
"That is why I consider that we should work on another part, which is called 'the demand side'. If the demand side is to work properly, there must be cooperation between what is now the single monetary policy and financial policy."
"In other words, more attention needs to be paid to the broad economic policy guidelines than that which, as States, we pay to our spending policies, by which I mean not every three or four years but every year, so that we can achieve recovery, without which we shall be pouring all this money we are debating into the Danaides' cistern."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have risen to speak as a representative of the largest of the new Member States, Poland, in this debate involving questions to the Council on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"I should like to draw attention to this point, as it has mainly been representatives of the old Member States who have spoken so far in the debate, and this is an important distinction to make, as the views of the old and the new Member States on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective differ greatly."
"In my opinion, one of the most important priorities for this Perspective should be to consolidate economic growth in the ten new Member States, which is currently experiencing an upturn, as this will facilitate cohesion and equality within the EU as a whole."
"Integration has taken place on a legal and institutional level."
"This process must, however, be accompanied by one in which the ten poorest countries together with the two due to join the EU in the near future catch up with the developed part of Europe."
"Without a gradual reduction in the development gap between the rich and the poor, the integration of the EU as a whole will run up against major opposition."
"There is also a danger of a two-speed Europe becoming a permanent arrangement."
"This is why we are in favour of the Prodi Commission’s proposal."
"The latter sets the EU’s budgetary commitments at an average of 1.27% of the EU’s GDP, whilst being opposed to the position of the six largest net payers, who wish to limit the level of these commitments to 1% of GDP."
"Only if the EU’s budget is greater than it has been to date will there be a realistic chance of significantly increasing funding under the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which would in turn make it possible to implement measures that effectively promote development in the new Member States."
"This is all the more necessary in view of the planned generosity towards regions in the old EU Member States which as a result of the ‘statistical effect’ will rise above the threshold of 75% of the EU’s average GDP as of 2007."
"Given the restriction that has existed since the mid-1990s, namely that countries benefiting from the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot receive funding exceeding 4% of their GDP, or in other words more than around EUR 17 billion per year for the ten new Member States overall, we are not calling for anything out of the ordinary."
"I should like to draw these issues to the attention of the Council representatives taking part in this debate, as they are related to the implementation of one of the enlarged EU’s most important priorities, namely reducing the development gap between the old and the new Member States."
"Mr President, it is important that we in this House should, today, seize the opportunity to have this opening debate."
"I am delighted that Mr Nicolaï from the Council has indicated that we will be doing this more frequently in future and that we will, every month, have the opportunity to put our fingers on the pulse."
"Nevertheless, this new Parliament has set very clear priorities with a view to pursuing the cohesion policy, because that proved effective in the past and because it has narrowed the gap between the differences between us in Europe."
"Alongside this, new initiatives, including the Lisbon agenda, have been taken."
"We are still not performing well, though."
"The Kok report has shown quite emphatically that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels, but need to invest."
"We need to do this at European level with renewed dynamism and right across Europe."
"There are also new challenges ahead."
"Today, for example, we were discussing the issue of Ukraine, and the new neighbourhood policy needs fleshing out; it needs investments."
"Those are new challenges and this House wants to meet them head on."
"My message is that we should draw lessons from what has happened in 1999, particularly in terms of regional policy."
"The first year, 1999, was not a productive year because the discussions we held were too tentative and too protracted."
"We must avoid 2007 being another tentative year, especially since the key objectives, if anything, require acceleration."
"We will therefore need to muster perseverance as a group."
"It is precisely the linking of instruments, a more integral approach to matters such as research, that opens up opportunities."
"That is the sort of attitude that the electorate expects of us."
"Fresh policy and new perspectives cannot be achieved with 1%."
"We will need more than that."
"We are preparing the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective at an exceptionally difficult time."
"Parliament and the Commission are both new, and the EU has only been functioning with 25 Member States for seven months."
"There is also the prospect of further enlargements, and of course the Lisbon Strategy to take into account."
"The temporary committee’s timetable and working methods should include an examination of the positions and priorities of the Prodi Commission and the previous Parliament."
"An assessment of the current enlargement should also be carried out, and plans made for future enlargements."
"These are tasks to be tackled by the new European Commission, with the Member States playing a major role."
"The latter’s proposals must be studied thoroughly, and it is for the next Presidency to ensure that this is the case."
"The new Financial Perspective contains plans for several years, and maybe for as long as a decade or more."
"It is possible, and indeed certain, that conditions within the EU and beyond will have changed."
"After all, this is a long time, especially in the twenty-first century."
"It would therefore be a good idea for there to be a review of the new Financial Perspective after it has been in operation for three years, and for it to be adjusted as necessary."
"It should not be forgotten that in 2009 there will be a new Parliament and a new European Commission, and provision should be made now for those key EU institutions to have the right to put forward proposals and make certain amendments."
"The fundamental decisions on the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, however, are a matter for the Member States and the Council."
"Europe cannot be reduced to mere percentages, and in particular not to 1% of GDP."
". I should like to thank all the Members of this House for the remarks and specific questions they have put to me."
"Let me start by responding to the issue of the timing, the timeframe and planning which we in the Council follow and has been questioned by some of you, first of all by Mr Böge, but subsequently also by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Hatzidakis."
"The latter two also spoke about rumours and indications that the timeframe which I gave you a moment ago would have been altered."
"Reference was made to a summit and to other rumours."
"I can put your minds at rest."
"There is only one timeframe and it is the one I presented to you."
"It mainly comes down to the fact that indeed, it is our plan and intention to achieve agreement in the Council by June 2005."
"I can add to this that I agree with what Mr Böge said about the continued non-appearance of the Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"He knows, as you do, that we in the Council share Parliament’s concern about this."
"Some of you, including Mr Galeote Quecedo, have enquired after the precise state of affairs in connection with the timing and the schedule."
"The state of affairs is that the preparations for the Council of 17 December are now underway and that we will then do as agreed."
"That means that we then hope to take a decision about the principles and guidelines for the financial perspectives, as well as the package, the survey of what we have achieved by means of the building-block approach."
"That is what is before the Council and it is hoped that we can take a decision on this on 17 December."
"I will return to this building-block approach in a moment, because a number of questions are linked to it."
"I note that here too, rather like in the discussions in the Council, various priorities as to content are already being mentioned at this stage which should find a home in the new financial perspectives."
"As Mr Böge made explicit, one general point of departure is the discussion about the added value of what is happening at European level."
"I naturally recognise a number of priorities that have been presented, including the Lisbon strategy, that has been mentioned by many, the international role of the European Union, cohesion policy, security and specifically also the item of the 4% cap on structural funds."
"Those are all elements that are still being discussed here, as they are in the Council, and form part of the proposals we are in the process of formulating."
"This brings me to the approach which we in the Presidency have decided to adopt for the steps to be taken during these six months in preparing the new financial perspectives."
"First of all, I should like to distance myself quite categorically from the questions about the 1% approach put by, among others, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mrs Buitenweg, who was delighted that this approach would be abandoned."
"As President of the Council, I have not abandoned anything, and neither have I held on to anything."
"I am not speaking here on behalf of the Netherlands, nor on behalf of the Group of Six, who, as you know, have adopted this position about the 1%."
"I am addressing you as President of the Council."
"As President, I have done precisely those things that a number of you regard as grounds for criticism, Mr Karas, for example, who urged me to talk about priorities, or others who questioned how I could solve this problem from a financial point of view."
"We have opted for the building-block approach, precisely because it allows the political priorities, the priorities as to content, and not the money, to be put first."
"That is the step that we are now trying to achieve by 17 December, so this is exactly along the lines of many remarks which I have made in the past."
"Since I seem to perceive some confusion about this, I should like to reiterate that the Commission proposal is very definitely the point of departure, although we all know that the Member States are entitled to adopt positions other than that proposed by the Commission."
"What the building-block approach tries to do quite simply is to combine, classify and put into a readily understood format the different positions of different Member States in terms of category and subject, thus enabling us in the Council to make more informed decisions politically speaking."
"That will only benefit the discussion as a whole and may even be advantageous to you."
"I am therefore delighted to hear, as Mr Walter made explicit, that Parliament will venture a similar attempt."
"I think that with this, I have responded to most remarks about the building-block approach and the line taken by the presidency."
"I would now like to turn my attention to the other aspect."
"Not expenditure, but revenue and own resources, which one or two of you briefly mentioned."
"We all agree on how important these are."
"Parliament’s right to be consulted is unmistakable and abundantly obvious and there is no doubt as to the fact that you will be making use of it where this section of the financial perspectives is concerned."
"One or two Members of this House also mentioned the generic correction mechanism."
"That is all covered by the Commission’s proposals."
"Mrs Buitenweg specifically mentioned Eurotax."
"The Commission proposed to open this possibility for the next financial perspectives in 2014."
"I can inform you that the Council is currently discussing that and that it will continue to do so. By way of update on the discussion, I can inform you that it is unlikely that the Council will argue in favour of bringing this date forward any earlier than proposed by the Commission."
"Another specific point that has been mentioned by a number of you – Mrs Jensen, I believe was the first one, but Mr Walter and others followed suit – concerns the duration of the financial perspectives and the seven-year term."
"The Commission has proposed to apply the seven-year term once more, and this is also still being discussed in the Council."
"We have not adopted a position on this."
"You know just as I do that the multi-annual budget is a framework within which the annual provisions are made."
"We do not lay down everything in exact detail for seven years, or however many years, but I do not need to tell you that."
"What matters are the ceilings within which there is scope for annual allocations, provided that the margins are sufficient."
"Finally, I am looking forward to working with the European Parliament, for the remaining time that I will be in the role of President."
"I am also saying this on behalf of the Council."
"We will not be accepting foregone conclusions, as some of you fear."
"First of all, at all times, but certainly now during the preparations of these financial perspectives, the Council listens very carefully to the opinions, remarks, signals or resolutions in the European Parliament."
"I cannot speak formally on behalf of the Luxembourg Presidency, but I can say that it seems a good idea to me to continue the informal way in which contacts between Council and the European Parliament have been established during the preparatory stages."
"Which brings me to my last remark."
"I do not entertain the worst-case scenarios one or two in this House have suggested in connection with the question as to what we will do if things do not go to plan."
"We should beware of a self-fulfilling prophecy and should consider how we dealt with confrontation between the European Parliament and the Council about the annual budget."
"As you know, the negotiations were tough and in a tense atmosphere."
"If truth be told, the Council’s and Parliament’s starting positions were very different, but we have struck a sound compromise."
"This compromise is beneficial to the European Parliament, to the Council and, above all, to Europe, and all of this on time despite tense negotiations."
"I think that that should be an example of how we can look toward the multi-annual budget."
"I have received a motion for a resolution (B6-0189/2004) on behalf of the Temporary committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU-Russia summit."
". Mr President, further to your kind words, I would like to preface my speech with the remark that unfortunately, given today’s previous planning in your Parliament, I have a commitment as a result of which I should have left by 7 p.m."
"With your permission therefore, I will leave after I have read out my speech."
"I would like to start by saying that I fully agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that the EU-Russia summit was more than a discussion on Ukraine."
"It was an occasion to further deepen our relations in various fields and therefore I am glad that we are holding this debate on the EU and Russia today."
"I hope that you will forgive me for not staying for the full debate."
"The EU and Russia have come closer in more than one respect."
"With the ratification of the PCA (Partnership and Cooperation Agreement) enlargement protocol and the Russian ratification of Kyoto, Russia has underlined the importance it attaches to its strategic partnership with the European Union."
"This strategic partnership is also important for us."
"Together we can handle not only difficult issues of mutual importance but we can also address important international issues such as the environment and the fight against terrorism."
"The four common spaces form an essential part of our strategic relationship; they show that we want to be more than just close neighbours."
"We want to be good neighbours."
"During the last six months we have made substantial progress; we have been able more or less to complete negotiations on two of the four spaces, namely on economics, research, education and culture."
"We hope that at the next summit in May 2005 in Moscow we will be able to reach agreement on all four spaces."
"In the EU, we see those four spaces as interlinked."
"The EU wants to lift the level of cooperation between the EU and Russia to a higher level, but this has to be across the board."
"There can be no picking and choosing."
"Furthermore, we will do this – and I have not set aside fundamental principles and objectives for the sake of a quick compromise."
"It is important to note that, whilst negotiations on this basis are ongoing, we will try to intensify EU-Russia relations wherever possible whilst respecting our principles."
"There are some very important issues, such as the Kyoto protocol, where we have to move forward and we cannot wait for a final agreement on this basis."
"Both Russia and the EU have agreed that the WTO accession is important for Russia."
"The EU has offered assistance in the WTO negotiations with other partners, but we have insisted that Russia should take WTO rules seriously."
"Russia should thus increase the confidence of foreign investors."
"It also means that Russia should be willing to solve economic disputes."
"In this respect the EU recalled the unresolved issue of Siberian overflight payments at the summit."
"There is still some work to be done in the common space of freedom, security and justice."
"The most important issue is the question of the EU's desire for readmission agreements, which is linked to the Russian desire for visa facilitation as well as the long-term objective of a visa-free regime."
"For the EU a readmission agreement is an essential element of this common space, therefore we are not willing to compromise just to obtain a result."
"We want a good result – and that is in the interests of our people."
"We consider respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be of paramount importance and therefore an importance element of this space."
"We raised the issues of Chechnya and the situation in the Northern Caucasus as well as the position of the media with our Russian partners during the summit."
"Unfortunately we were not able to make substantial progress since opinions continue to differ."
"But I hope we will be able to maintain a frequent dialogue on human rights issues."
"This discussion is a two-way street, therefore we had no objections to Russia raising the issue of Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltic States."
"In my view, we gave the Russians a clear and satisfying answer to these questions."
"The EU asked Russia about its objections to the notion of a common neighbourhood, which we consider to be important for the common space of external security."
"Unfortunately, here we have different views as we have seen with Ukraine, but we will continue to try to convince Russia that working together to create a stable, democratic and free common neighbourhood is not only in the EU's interest, but also in Russia's: it is a win-win situation."
"We should look to see where we can find common ground rather than just criticise each other."
"On the common space of research and education, including cultural aspects, there was agreement in principle to establish a European training centre institute in Moscow."
"This will enable Russian citizens to understand the European Union better."
"Furthermore the EU appreciated Russian support on ITER."
"Regarding the fight against terrorism, during a visit by Gijs de Vries, our counter-terrorism coordinator, President Putin said that Mr de Vries was highly valued by his Russian counterpart. His counterpart will visit Brussels shortly."
"Moscow was very interested in EU policy developments such as document security."
"Russia also wants to exchange data with Europol, Eurojust, etc. The EU is in principle ready for this, but first Moscow has to ratify the Council of Europe's Convention on Data Protection."
"President Putin committed himself to this and I hope that this commitment will bear fruit shortly."
"The discussions on external relations were primarily focused on what the EU considers to be our common neighbourhood, in particular Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova."
"It will not come as a surprise to you when I say that the discussions on Ukraine were long, intense and very frank."
"They took up the whole working lunch."
"We agreed on a number of important issues."
"The current situation should be solved in a peaceful manner without any violence. Secondly, Ukrainian law should be respected."
"Thirdly, we should try to avoid a deepening of the rift between the Ukrainian people."
"Whoever becomes President should be the President of all Ukrainian people and the territorial integrity of Ukraine should be respected."
"I have already referred to the telephone call that Prime Minister Balkenende made to President Putin this afternoon, so I do not think I need dwell too much on this subject."
"In addition to Ukraine we discussed a number of other international issues."
"In view of the limited time and given the fact that the views of the EU and Russia on, for example Iran and the Western Balkans, coincide to a large extent, I will not go into details now."
"The relations between the EU and Russia are of strategic importance."
"Russia needs the EU, just as the EU needs Russia."
"During the Dutch presidency we have been able to intensify our relations and bring the four common spaces a lot closer."
"Furthermore, the EU has managed to speak with one voice during the past month, which has not always been the case with such an important dossier as EU-Russia relations."
"I believe this can be seen as progress."
"The EU and Russia have had and still have differences, but that is only natural."
"Russia has to get used to the fact that in more that one respect we have become closer neighbours, whose interests are not always identical."
"However, we are able to discuss those issues freely and in a very frank manner, and that is essential for a strategic relationship."
"I hope that the next presidency will be able to inform you that we have complete agreement on the four common spaces that form the basis of this relationship."
"Thank you, Mr Nicolaï, both for your statement and for the time you have shared with us."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nicolaï, although much has, of course already been said, I should like to start by stressing once again that the EU’s enlargement has made Russia a much more important partner for us, as it is the European Union’s big neighbour, and we want it to be a strategic partner."
"We must be able to discuss all issues with Russia, both with regard to where we want to make progress, but also with regard to international issues, even if we sometimes have differences of opinion."
"At the summit on 25 November, it became clear that we could talk in a very good, business-like atmosphere, and the discussions were also very detailed."
"Mr Nicolaï has already mentioned that we, of course, want to have the four large areas together as a package."
"This package was the focus of our negotiations."
"In addition, as he also quite rightly noted, we discussed international issues, with Ukraine taking up a large part of the time."
"The Commission saw it as particularly important to maintain the quality and integrity of this package as regards the four common areas."
"We did not want the individual parts to be negotiated separately."
"This was what we had agreed on, and this will remain the framework in future."
"Whilst wishing to express my thanks to the Presidency of the Council, the Commission also played a large role in enabling us to continue with this position."
"I am confident that intensive further negotiations will allow us to reach an overall agreement on this package in May."
"Some of the package’s contents have already been mentioned."
"In the common economic area, the conditions must be created for a strengthening of economic relations."
"This means that trade and investment must be promoted, existing obstacles must be eliminated and, above all, that legal and administrative provisions must increasingly comply or be made compatible."
"We have also decided – and I believe that this is an important point – to initiate a dialogue between the European Union and Russia on energy, and, above all, to utilise successful cooperation in this area as an engine for other areas."
"We also raised such issues as the investment climate in Russia and, in this connection, the situation of YUKOS."
"Above all, we stressed the need for transparency, stability and predictability."
"We have also decided, as Mr Nicolaï mentioned, that the common economic area will particularly deal with environmental issues."
"This will make it possible for us to take a common approach to the challenges of environmental policy, and we have of course welcomed Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
"This will make it possible for us to step up our bilateral cooperation, but above all cooperation in international forums on climate protection."
"In the second area, the area for freedom, security and law, we decided to continue our intensive discussions, during which equal account must be taken of the aspects of security, on the one hand, and freedom and law on the other."
"It is important for us that it should be in this area that we anchor the basic questions of protection for fundamental rights, of the principle of the rule of law and of human rights."
"We agreed that it is in this area that we wish to deal with issues relating to easier travel and issues of asylum and return."
"In addition, this area will continue to deal with issues such as terrorism, organised crime, corruption and trafficking in human beings."
"In addition, we offered to step up our cooperation in the fight against drugs, for example with third countries such as Afghanistan, or also with the United Nations, which plays an important role in this respect."
"Turning to Chechnya, we made an offer to Russia to assist in the reconstruction of the country, as soon as the security situation makes this possible."
"With regard to the area of external security, this should make it possible for us to implement genuine cooperation on all issues relating to conflicts in our common neighbourhood, so that we can promote common care for stability and security in the region."
"It did of course become clear that we still need to convince Russia that cooperation on issues of common security is in both our interests; we also discussed the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fight against terrorism and civil protection as part of closer cooperation."
"We also, finally, want to extend our cooperation in the field of research, education and culture."
"Our goal in this field is again to promote contacts between our societies and, above all, to continue to promote innovation."
"Of course we discussed a number of individual questions, of which I would particularly like to draw attention to three; firstly, on the Commission’s suggestion we decided to set up this new forum in which we wish to discuss all issues relating to regional cooperation."
"In addition, we want to set up a new sub-committee in the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, where we will also be able to discuss issues relating to Kaliningrad."
"In our opinion, it is important to discuss not only issues relating to transit, but also, and above all, issues relating to economic and social development."
"Secondly, we agreed to hold regular consultations on human rights issues, including the issues of minorities and fundamental rights, which Mr Nicolaï has already mentioned."
"Thirdly, we reached an agreement on an Institute for European Studies in Moscow."
"You will all be aware that the situation in Ukraine was a priority at the working lunch, and we referred very clearly to our position, which we set out earlier."
"I can say that we agreed that the situation can be resolved only by peaceful means and within the framework of the Ukrainian constitution."
"We said that the Ukrainian people had a right to decide its own future and the future of the country."
"Despite all the differences of opinion on this issue, we should not forget how much also connects us with Russia, this large country and our partner, and we must therefore do everything in our power to eliminate differences, to make progress and to find joint solutions."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to wish Commissioner Benita Ferrero all the best with her important responsibilities."
"Today is her first appearance at a Brussels plenary session, though I know that this afternoon’s debate is her second one."
"The truth is that you have taken up your responsibilities at a very delicate time on the international scene; you have been at the International Conference on Iraq; you have met on the sidelines with the Quartet to deal with the relaunch of the Roadmap for the Middle East peace process following the death of Yasser Arafat; you have had to attend this European Union-Russia Summit; we have the political crisis in Ukraine."
"You will have plenty of work to do over the coming days, Commissioner."
"With enlargement, the Union has clearly extended its borders with some new neighbours. You have referred to the new neighbours to the north;"
"Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldavia and it is true that we are currently linked to Russia by means of an Association Agreement which is based on principles and values to which the European Union is fundamentally committed; principles and values, Commissioner, which I believe have not on this occasion been compatible with the Russian authorities’ comments on the European Union’s position on Ukraine, since they have said that the European Union’s position could lead to a bloodbath in that country."
"I note that President Putin has put that right, accepting the results following his meeting and talks with the German Federal Chancellor."
"As you are aware, Commissioner, this Parliament is completely and utterly committed to human rights; they are not just for one country, for one region or for one continent; they are of a truly universal worldwide nature."
"In our relations with Russia, we cannot stress the good things and forget about the bad."
"The ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is clearly one of the good things, and the bad things include, as you have mentioned, the human rights cases in Chechnya and the Yukos case, for example."
"I believe, Commissioner, that it is important for the Commission to have a defined policy of friendly relations, but on the basis of our values; to this end, we must also closely monitor the measures taken recently by the Russian authorities, in terms of the always difficult balance between security and freedom, following the attacks in North Osetia, in a decentralised manner."
"It is, therefore, very important, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that we enhance those relations."
"Russia plays an extremely important role in terms of the stability of the new neighbours, and has fundamental influence in the Balkans and also in Central Asia, it has nuclear weapons, it participates with us in the Quartet and we must therefore develop a strategic association and cooperation, not at any price, but based on the values and principles that we as the European Union hold dear."
". Mr President, Commissioner, at the end of your speech you referred to the need to extend and build good neighbourly and cooperative relations with Russia."
"I should like to lend my full support to this and to all the other points you mentioned."
"The fact that we have not yet achieved such relations is perhaps due to the fact that the basis of trust between Russia and the European Union is perhaps not yet quite as it should be."
"In turn, this is due to the fact that Russia feels almost hemmed in by an enlarging European Union, and now, faced with developments in Ukraine and the South Caucasus, is, so to speak, worried for its own existence and field of influence."
"I am not saying this in order to justify Russia’s position, but this position must also be viewed from a psychological viewpoint."
"The European Union – and I am therefore also grateful for what you and the President of the Council said – must explain to Russia that democracy in countries neighbouring Russia, combined with the rule of law, will ultimately result in stable economic conditions in Russia as well."
"It was therefore vital not to say, with regard to Ukraine, that there is a Russian candidate and an EU candidate, but to say that there can only be candidates elected by the Ukrainian people to be their president."
"What is at stake, as you have already mentioned a few times today, is that Ukrainian interests should prevail."
"With regard to the issue of dialogue on energy as well, it is vital that the Russian partners also understand the psychological situation on our side."
"The fact is that we will have a major interest in Russian energy supplies only when we are sure that energy will never be used as a political weapon and that the supply will not be cut off on political grounds, in other words, only when there is an open investment climate in Russia."
"Cooperation with Russia in the field of energy will then be much improved, as I have just stressed."
"With regard to the fight against terrorism, we do indeed have common interests, but – while I will not deny that the armed forces or the police need to be deployed – our methods differ."
"As we have always stressed in connection with Chechnya, however, it is also important to fight the causes of terrorism, and in many cases these are poverty and poor economic development."
"With regard to the issue of human rights, I am fully in favour of dialogue."
"We have nothing to hide."
"We also have nothing to hide with regard to the treatment of Russian-speaking minorities in the European Union and with regard to the situation of such minorities, as we have done a lot for them, and it is to be hoped that we will continue to do so."
"Yet we must find Russia prepared to engage in this dialogue."
"Finally, there is something else of great importance that we must communicate."
"In recent discussions with Russian journalists in Berlin, I was asked why it was necessary for Russia to justify itself to the European Union."
"No, Russia does not need to justify itself to the European Union!"
"Russia must justify itself to its own people, and, in common with the European Union, Russia must also justify itself to the world at large."
"We are all committed to the goals of democracy and the rule of law."
"When Russia feels itself to be just as committed to them as is the European Union, its situation will improve."
"It is therefore important for us to build relations, in the interest of Russia and not only in the interest of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, relations with Russia are extremely important for the EU."
"Russia is our neighbour and, because of its size, history and position, the country can play an extremely important role and be a constructive partner on the continent of Europe."
"We have many shared interests and problems that we must solve together, and our group supports the partnership with Russia and wants it to be strengthened, deepened and developed."
"It has to be said, however, that the Russia strategy has not been any great success so far."
"It feels rather as if we are treading water and not getting anywhere."
"Russia is unwilling to appreciate that cooperation is based upon give and take and that the EU’s policy is based on certain values that cannot be negotiated away and that must be seen as a clear thread running through everything we do."
"There is reason for feeling very uneasy now, following the latest developments in Russia."
"I am thinking of the concentration of power in the Kremlin, of the media situation – in principle, media freedom is a thing of the past – and of the lack of a political solution in Chechnya. I am also thinking of very recent developments, namely Putin’s support for Yanukovich in Ukraine and, earlier, for Lukashenko in Belarus."
"Relations between the EU and Russia are in a critical phase, and we cannot describe the latest meeting as anything other than a failure, even though I genuinely admire and sympathise with your optimism, Commissioner."
"You stated that a decision had been made in favour of deeper and more organised cooperation when it came to human rights and minorities."
"I hope that this will lead to something more practical so that this forum does not just become a talking shop that skates over the surface of issues, but is a place in which difficult issues genuinely can be solved."
"It would be interesting to hear more details from you about this decision."
". Mr President, I too should first of all like to congratulate Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"It is her first debate here and I look forward to good cooperation."
"I have listened carefully to what you said, Commissioner."
"You said that we have offered to help the Russians in the country’s reconstruction as soon as security is guaranteed."
"That, Commissioner, is putting the cart before the horse."
"That is not the right way of going about things."
"After all, we all know there is no peace in Chechnya, that a peace process is being imposed that has no support base and that human rights are being violated on a daily basis."
"We all know that the situation in Russia is extremely serious."
"I have gleaned this from the most recent book by Anna Politkovskaya, an independent journalist who writes in her new book ‘Putin’s Russia’ how in Russia, human rights are being violated on a daily basis, how the grip of central government on the press is being tightened every day and how the power of the KGB/FSB is increasing."
"We can all see that the situation is serious and that in Chechnya, a true peace process must be put in motion."
"That is where the European Union comes in."
"Indeed, we are next-door neighbours and we can play a role in that respect."
"Not by building houses over there, but by organising a true peace conference."
"That is why it surprises me that the Russians do not even want to get involved in talks with ordinary citizens, with representatives of the mothers of soldiers who are worried about the fate of their children, who are worried about peace and about human rights being observed, and who want to go and talk to representatives of the Maskhadov Government and Mr Zakayev."
"I am also surprised by the fact that the Russians are even putting governments, including the Belgian Government, under pressure to deny Mr Zakayev access to this country and to this Parliament."
"That is unacceptable."
"That is something we as MEPs cannot accept and against which we must protest."
"If an important group in this Parliament wants to organise a dialogue between mothers of soldiers and Mr Zakayev, then this should be covered by parliamentary immunity; if not, Belgium is not worthy of retaining the seat of the European Parliament here in Brussels."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing becomes clear when considering the relations being forged between the European Union and neighbouring countries, namely that the EU is suffering from Americophobia and Russophobia."
"In recent days, the second of these has become particularly apparent, that is, the fear of Russia as a major partner and a major country to the East."
"The European Union has an inferiority complex that overshadows its relations with Russia, and today a strange kind of judgment is being passed on Russia for its position on Ukraine."
"It has been said that Russia is interfering in Ukraine’s domestic affairs."
"Yet what action is being taken by the European Union and our representatives?"
"They are travelling to the country as observers, but becoming involved on behalf of one of the candidates."
"This should not be the case."
"Democracy is something quite different."
"If we wish to demand democratic standards of Russia, we should first demand them of ourselves, and do everything in our power to ensure that we observe these standards."
"We are not entitled to pass judgment on Russia in this matter."
"Why is the EU interfering in such a manner in the sovereign decisions of the independent Russian state, when President Putin has warned us against interfering in the Russian sphere of influence?"
"Russia has a right to its own opinions, and it is our strategic trading partner."
"Kaliningrad, which borders directly onto the European Union and Poland, should be of the utmost importance to us, as it is a window onto the world in terms of trade."
"Yet as a result of our panic-stricken reaction to the events in Ukraine, Russia has tightened restrictions on people passing through border crossings, in particular those into Kaliningrad."
"We have much to lose by adopting such a schizophrenic approach in our relations with Russia."
"Relations with this large country should be stepped up, not restricted."
"Finally, I should like to add that the EU has interfered enough in the domestic affairs of independent states, in this case in those of Russia."
"The result of this has been that, against our wishes, the areas in the east of Ukraine are being pushed into Russia’s hands."
"I should like to end my speech with an old Roman maxim: ‘first, do no harm’."
"This is particularly true in the case of relations with Russia."
". Mr President, I should like to make reference to the statement issued by the parties after the 14th EU-Russia Summit, and in particular to the section concerning the implementation of elements on which both sides agree."
"The elements in question relate, of course, to the common spaces."
"It is my opinion that both the Presidency and the Commission have given way on this issue in the face of Russia’s disapproval, expressed on a number of occasions before the summit, of the position taken by this House and by the Members of this House."
"I refer to the view that the PCA should be treated as one package in negotiations with Russia."
"In a certain sense, this has meant that our votes on this issue have been disregarded."
"I should like to say one more thing with reference to discussions on Ukraine."
"The country with which we are negotiating a road map for implementation of the PCA and the country actively interfering in the electoral process in Ukraine are one and the same country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my country children’s programmes are broadcast after 7 p.m."
"It is my belief that the President-in-Office is a fan of bedtime stories and children’s programmes, and that is why he has left us."
"This does, however, show a certain lack of respect for the European Parliament, and I very much hope it will not be repeated in future."
"I am delighted this debate is taking place today."
"It would have been wrong to replace it with the debate on Ukraine, as Ukraine is one country and Russia is another, even if Russia, or part of Russia, still thinks or wants to think in terms of the Soviet Union or the Tsarist Empire."
"I am also delighted for a second reason, namely that Mr Barroso and Mr Putin had major differences of opinion at the recent summit in The Hague, and that these differences of opinion did not merely relate to Ukraine."
"The sight of self-satisfied politicians shaking hands has generally been a bad omen for the average citizen, especially in the East."
"What conclusions can be drawn from relations between Moscow and Brussels, or in other words between Russia and the European Union, over the past few years?"
"The most obvious conclusion is that these were not in fact relations between Brussels and Moscow, but between Russia and the individual EU Member States, in particular the largest Member States."
"They were relations between Russia and France, Russia and Germany, Russia and Great Britain and Russia and Italy."
"Moscow chose its own partners for bilateral relations and played off the EU and, to a large extent, large countries against medium-sized and small countries."
"Our only reaction therefore has to be to act in solidarity within the framework of a united EU."
"Russia is an important and difficult partner, and we should not give it any opportunity to develop imperial and superpower-like tendencies."
"Europe, both Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, cannot afford to allow this to happen."
"It is not in Russia’s long-term strategic interest either."
"Mr President, no one is likely to question the fact that Russia is one of the EU’s most important partners, yet at the same time few people in Europe would question the fact that Russia is a very difficult partner."
"On the one hand, we are linked by extremely close economic ties that benefit both sides, yet on the other hand, tensions are increasingly being felt between the two parties in the political sphere, and very far-reaching differences of opinion are becoming apparent."
"In spite of what is said by some in Europe, and what was said earlier by some of the Members of this House, we should not fear such differences."
"On the contrary, our experience of countries which were in the so-called Soviet sphere of influence for many years has taught us that a genuine partnership and respect from the Russian side will only become possible if we state our views clearly and firmly, even if these views are extremely critical of certain aspects of Russian politics."
"In this context, I should like to congratulate Mr Balkenende and the entire Dutch Presidency for their clear and firm approach during the EU-Russia summit on 25 November."
"In the days after this summit we saw that we were right in our assessment of political events in Ukraine, and this continues to be the case today."
"I should also like to remind Mr Rogalksi that Ukraine is not a part of Russia, and so speaking out in defence of free and democratic elections for the Ukrainian people does not constitute interference in Russia’s domestic affairs."
"Ukraine is a separate state and a separate nation, and I should ask you to bear this in mind."
"Thanks to the position taken by the Dutch Presidency, the EU is gaining face in the eyes of the European nations, after a long period during which too many European leaders pretended not to see, or indeed did not see, the problems which arose with regard to relations with Russia in the past, such as the centralisation of power at the cost of a still-fragile democracy, Russia’s policy on the Caucasus or the reconstruction of the Russian ‘sphere of influence’."
"I should like to thank Mr Balkenende for the position he adopted during the EU-Russia summit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union now has problems both to the east and to the west, both with the United States of America and Russia."
"The administration in the United States has adopted a strongly unilateral approach."
"It is conspicuous in trade disputes and the Iraq war, and has given rise to an estrangement of sorts."
"Our relations now require much effort."
"Immigrants have formed a new group of American citizens that voted for the Republicans in the last elections."
"Defence Minister Donald Rumsfeld has said that we have new Europeans in the same way."
"In fact we have enlarged and in this way brought new blood to our numbers."
"These newcomers, however, have had a different relationship with the United States (not for very much longer, in my opinion, as our work gradually hones that relationship), and Russia, through a grim and difficult history as part of the Soviet Union or as one of its satellites."
"Our first Parliamentary Cooperation Committee met last week, and it was then that the issue was raised for the first time, though certainly not the last."
"Last week’s summit, in my opinion, was largely unsuccessful."
"We did not achieve consensus on four areas of action that we share."
"They are only part of the whole."
"We know the reasons."
"The problems relate to both America and Russia, but relations with Russia are virtually at a standstill."
"There has been some progress: acceptance of enlargement and the partnership pact, the Kyoto Protocol, and so on."
"We have discussed common values with the Russians at many summits."
"But just how much do we share the same values?"
"Are we drifting away from one another as far as our values are concerned?"
"If they are very different for very long it will not be long before we drift into the area of sanctions."
"What does the Commission intend to do to halt this drift and ensure that Russia does not sail off into the void, as it were, perhaps towards the east and Asia?"
"What could the Commission do about this?"
"Mr President, this EU-Russia summit is a very important event because it is the first held since EU was enlarged to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is my sincere belief that the outcome of the summit needs to be debated in the European Parliament, so let me stress a few points that were discussed during the summit."
"Parliament should welcome the 14th EU-Russia Summit in the Hague while regretting, however, that it has been a failure as far as substantial progress on the establishment of the four common spaces is concerned."
"We should strongly support the efforts of the Council and Commission to use the opportunity provided by the summit to underline that Russia, the partner of the European Union, carries a great responsibility in our common neighbourhood, and in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus in particular."
"We should also firmly reject the allegations recently made by the Russian authorities that the European Union and the international community, by expressing their support for the Ukrainian people’s right to exercise their constitutional rights, is encouraging violence in Ukraine."
"In this context we should express our concern about the centralisation of Kremlin powers at the expense of democracy, independent media, the regions, the rule of law and human rights, especially with regard to the situation in Chechnya and the Yukos affair."
"At the same time I believe that ratification of broad agreements between the Russian Federation and certain Member States of the Union is one of the keys to strengthening the EU-Russia partnership and encouraging mutual understanding and trust."
"Finally, the Kaliningrad region, as an important factor for the overall development of the Baltic Sea area, was also discussed in the Hague."
"Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Russian Duma and the leadership of the Russian Federation to start a dialogue on the development of a separate action plan for the economic and social development of the Kaliningrad region."
"Mr President, the new map of Europe has been redrawn in conjunction with this year’s enlargement, and most of the new Member States and those countries that are negotiating for membership right now have, in one way or another, had strong connections with Russia."
"Sometimes, those connections were made willingly and, at other times, unwillingly."
"Russia thus continues to play a large role in terms of stability, especially in the area around the EU’s eastern borders. It must not, however, actively side with the dictatorships there or impede the development of democracy."
"If this happens, the EU must be vigorous in its condemnation."
"The events in connection with the election in Serbia a few years ago, which resulted in Milosevic’s departure, are very reminiscent of what is happening now in Ukraine."
"Then, the crisis was resolved peacefully, and we must ensure that this crisis too is resolved peacefully."
"In that case, Europe needs, on the one hand, to show itself prepared to cooperate with Russia and, on the other hand, to emphasise that Russia should not interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, irrespective of the common history these countries and Russia may previously have had."
"If Russia seriously wants to be a strategic cooperation partner of the EU, it must be clear that the cornerstones of such cooperation have to be freedom, mutual respect and the democratic values shared by the EU countries."
"I have no specific questions for Mrs Ferrero-Waldner but wish to emphasise that neither the EU nor Russia should ever have interests in another country other than an interest in democracy and that this must be both a basis for, and an objective of, cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Ukraine is being born in front of our very eyes and those of Russia."
"Russia and ourselves take different views, and that is why the Summit has communicated so little on the issue."
"Instead, there are Europe’s open evaluations."
"There is extraordinary development in Ukraine."
"A nation of citizens, such as Russian manifestly is not, is being born."
"It is Ukraine’s hour now."
"According to our documents, however, Russia has great responsibility, – in my view, the greatest."
"Ukraine’s chairman of Parliament made a start by announcing that Ukraine has only two alternatives – either the division of the state or bloodshed."
"It looks like the Russian President would be in favour of completely restarting the election process, so that the opposition leader could be eliminated."
"If the resigning president of Ukraine is going to listen to such advice and announce a decree to organise not just the second round but completely new elections, Russia will be responsible for the consequences."
"This would become a provocation for hundreds of thousands of people, who could lose patience leading to a loss of peaceful civil order."
"If they were to occupy the presidential palace, as happened in Georgia, they could be met by the gunshots of a foreign army."
"The European Parliament or the European Commission – I am directing my comments to Mrs Ferrero Valdner here – could officially ask the Russian Government, or at least its representatives, if the reports by the Moscow press about Russian special armed forces being brought into Kiev dressed in Ukrainian uniforms are correct."
"Extreme as the situation appears, it is difficult to understand the sympathy expressed for the Russian president – who got involved so unnecessarily – as if he cannot lose."
"Fourteen years ago, we in Lithuania were similarly aware of the majority in the West feeling sorry for Mikhail Gorbachev."
"That had a bad effect on the Kremlin, and Gorbachev lost a lot more influence."
"A politics designed to restore the Russian empire has now already been defeated in Ukraine, even though President Putin remains a force in the world."
"He has two alternatives – either acknowledge the Ukrainians’ right to have their government and democratic state or spill blood and be left with blood on his hands like Gorbachev."
"President Putin’s friends should speak directly with him, not via Mr Kuchma, and unanimously advise him to choose the first option."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, I should like, briefly, to revisit a number of points."
"Firstly, I should like to re-emphasise that this summit was not, as I see it, in any way a failure; on the contrary, it allowed us to make significant progress."
"As I said before, the EU insisted on quality and on putting together a package that really does enable us to push through our concerns and our values, which are of course very important to us."
"The big question is how difficult questions are to be dealt with."
"This year has already seen us asking ourselves this question, and it was decided that it was important to set clear priorities, to be open, to deal with all problems, and to stick to common positions – and we succeeded in doing all of this, which was an important step and a positive one."
"This was something to which the Commission attached particular value, and I am glad that all the Members of this House helped us to achieve this goal."
"The issue at stake here is the finding of mutual interests, but this presupposes care before links are forged, and must be founded on values rather than on interests."
"One example of a success is that at the WTO negotiations we came to a bilateral agreement on private transport to and from Kaliningrad."
"As already noted, we have set up two sub-committees, which I believe is important, and this has been approved by Russia."
"We have major tasks ahead of us, which include migration, visa issues, returns and cooperation in border regions."
"I should like to reply to Mr Staes, not having done so before as there was of course a lot going on at this summit."
"I can tell him that Mr Barroso made it clear to the Russian delegation that a political solution in Chechnya does of course enjoy support from Europe, the Commission and the entire EU."
"– Thank you, Commissioner. I inform the House that at the end of the debate I have received two motions for resolutions."
"For technical reasons, these motions for resolutions cannot in any case be put to the vote during this round of voting."
"– We come to the time for speeches by those Members who ask to speak."
"As you know, they are limited to one minute each."
"Mr President, I should like to inform you that the salami producer Igloomeat SA Sokołów Polska has asked to be deleted from Appendix 12 to the Treaty of Accession."
"There is documentary evidence that Igloomeat SA met the requirements arising under Council Directive No 77/99/EEC relating to the processing of meat on 13 February 2004."
"It therefore applied to be included in the list of establishments exporting products to the EU Member States, but Igloomeat’s management has not yet received any decision."
"I should therefore like to ask you, Mr President, to call on the European Commission to take action in this particular case, and to highlight the failure of EU institutions to act promptly, thus making it difficult for businesses from the new EU Member States to operate on EU markets."
"Mr President, I would like to raise the situation of one of my constituents, John Packwood from the Isle of Wight, who, as a result of an international arrest warrant taken out against him by the Moroccan authorities, is currently being held in prison in Madrid."
"Mr Packwood, along with three colleagues, delivered a privately-owned boat from the UK to Morocco back in 1997."
"The boat was fully searched on its arrival, given a clean bill of health and the four men went home."
"A full ten weeks later several tons of cocaine were found on board the vessel."
"Interpol interviewed the men and was completely satisfied that they were not implicated in any criminal activity."
"The first the men knew of the international arrest warrant was last month – over seven years later – when John Packwood was arrested as he passed through Malaga airport."
"He is now in prison in Madrid and that is completely unacceptable."
"I would ask the President of Parliament to intervene with the Moroccan authorities to raise these concerns and ask that these arrest warrants be lifted."
"The international NGO, Fair Trials Abroad, has agreed that this appears to be a blatant abuse of the international arrest warrant, since it is quite clear that the men could not have been involved in any smuggling operation."
"Mr President, on 17 November many Members of this House will have seen the appalling abuse of international football players at an international match between Spain and England, held in Spain."
"That appalling abuse was not just an isolated incident; we have seen it at international football matches and in football matches across the European Union."
"This is not just about abuse of people in their workplace, the football stadium; it has a symbolism and a resonance beyond that."
"We believe – and many of my fellow MEPs believe – that UEFA, the body that regulates football, is not sufficiently serious about stamping out racial abuse in football."
"Football is the game of Europe, it is Europe’s most prominent spectator sport."
"In the United States, the major spectator sports are family occasions."
"That is not the case in the European Union."
"We call on UEFA and FIFA to bring in rules to stamp out and kick out racism in football right across Europe, making it the family game that we all want to see."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a decision made in the Council a short time ago on live animal transport."
"I would like the House to join with me in expressing regret that agriculture ministers failed to reach an agreement on limiting journey times."
"They also failed to reach an agreement on rest periods for animals transported for meat and they failed to reach any agreement on stocking densities – the number of animals that can be put in one unit."
"These are all vital issues with respect to ensuring that we end the cruelty to which animals are currently subjected during live transport in Europe."
"It is deeply disappointing that, yet again, the Council of Ministers has failed to take into account and adopt the approach of the Parliament, which has consistently voted for an eight-hour maximum limit for the transport of live animals."
"The Council got it wrong."
"It should have persisted and tackled these important issues in order to end animal cruelty in the European Union."
"Mr President, by a strange coincidence I would like to raise exactly the same point."
"I have had literally hundreds of letters from concerned EU citizens on the Council’s failure to reach an agreement on 24 April on the Commission’s proposal on the transportation of live animals."
"Each year some three million live animals are transported around Europe."
"Many face journeys of 50 hours, some as long as 90 hours."
"The suffering of the animals on these journeys is terrible."
"As Mrs Villiers said, this Parliament has on four or five occasions voted for a maximum journey time of eight or nine hours."
"We have been ignored by the Council and we need to put pressure on it."
"My personal preference is for the transportation of animals on the hook, not on the hoof, but if we cannot have that, the minimum we should have is decent conditions for these animals and an end to extra-long journey times."
"I hope the Council will at long last respond, not just to this Parliament but to the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask Parliament to call on the European Commission to abolish or temporarily suspend customs duties on aluminium imported from Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States into the new Member States of the EU, in particular Poland."
"These customs duties were introduced after the recent enlargement of the EU and set at 6%."
"The result has been a significant fall in the competitiveness of many Central and Eastern European businesses."
"In Poland, for example, these customs duties directly affect businesses employing 5 000 people, as well as many thousands of businesses associated with the aluminium industry."
"A great deal is heard in this House about those who have benefited from the EU enlargement, but it is worth remembering that there are also those who have little reason to rejoice, and through no fault of their own."
"Instead of being selfish, we must help those who are suffering as a result of the fact that the European Union underwent enlargement on 1 May."
"– From the chair I have not recorded any other requests by Members to speak."
"The debate is therefore closed."
"– The next item is the Commission Statement on World Aids Day."
". Mr President, it truly is an honour for me to stand for the first time before plenary, although I would be even happier were I here on a more pleasant subject."
"Unfortunately, I am appearing here for the first time so that we can debate and I can speak to you on a very important and worrying subject, by which I mean the continuing threat to our society from the scourge of HIV/AIDS."
"Today in particular, on 1 December, which has been designated 'World AIDS Day', I think it is important that we exchange views and a few thoughts as to how this scourge can be combated."
"Today has been designated 'World AIDS Day' in order to mark, on the one hand, the progress which has been made in combating this scourge."
"However, more specifically, it gives us the opportunity to focus on the challenges we face and to intensify our collective efforts and consider and ask ourselves if we are doing enough."
"Over recent years, most of our attention has focused on the tragic situation in sub-Saharan Africa and in developing countries in general."
"However, HIV/AIDS is causing very deep and constantly increasing concern here in Europe and our neighbouring countries."
"It is something which affects us all, here and now."
"The subject of this year's global campaign against AIDS was women, girls, HIV and AIDS."
"This was also the subject of the annual AIDS campaign coordinated by UNAIDS."
"This subject is exceptionally topical."
"Recent epidemiological data show that, over the last two years, the number of women affected by the HIV virus increased throughout the world."
"While the largest increase, in the order of 58%, was in the area of eastern Asia, it is worth noting that the second largest increase was in Eastern Europe and central Asia, where it reached 48%."
"Allow me to give you some statistics which were published just last week and which are particularly worrying: approximately 40 million people throughout the world are carriers of the HIV virus and almost half of them are women."
"In the European Union, the number of cases of HIV increased by 75% between 1996 and 2003, with the largest increase in the Baltic States."
"In Europe, the country which has been hardest hit by the epidemic is the Russian Federation, where it is calculated that over 800 000 people are HIV positive, 80% of whom are young people under 30 years of age."
"According to UNAIDS estimates, over 500 000 people in the European Union are carriers of the virus."
"It is clear without any doubt from these statistics that the tragic problem of HIV/AIDS is spreading more and more quickly and now has not only arrived at our door, but has also entered our house."
"The European Commission is addressing the matter both inside and outside the European Union."
"Together with the Member States, we are the biggest donor to the Global Fund which is the main financing mechanism for combating the epidemic throughout the world."
"Similarly, we are intensifying our cooperation with neighbouring countries, in full recognition of the fact that they are in a particularly difficult situation."
"In September, the European Commission issued a paper entitled ‘Co-ordinated and integrated approach to combat HIV/AIDS within the European Union and its neighbourhoods’."
"Τhis paper summarises the current evaluation of the situation and the problem. It also offers a compendium of best practices for combating the recent wave of the epidemic and highlights the Commission's short-term proposals for addressing the situation."
"The Commission's main commitments are to the prevention of new cases of contamination with HIV, the reduction of repercussions from the epidemic, access to antiretroviral treatment at more affordable prices, the inclusion of young people, the development of epidemiological monitoring of HIV/AIDS, more intensive research and the participation of civil society."
"However, I should also like to draw your attention to certain basic aspects of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS."
"Prevention is still the main weapon in the fight against the spread of the virus."
"We badly need an information campaign throughout Europe."
"It is important for us to bear in mind that the information campaigns of the 1980s did not address today's young people and, consequently, there is an acute need today to implement new efforts, so that we can send the message to precisely these people."
"Planning has already started and a conference is due to be held next week with the Member States, the international organisations and representatives of civil society on this subject."
"As the target of a general campaign will be the general public and young people, there is a clear need for other partners to plan and implement specialised campaigns targeted at vulnerable groups, in keeping always with the particular requirements of each group."
"I should like to stress that the impression that the transmission of HIV is limited to these vulnerable groups is totally unfounded."
"On the contrary, HIV/AIDS is a subject which concerns us all: women, men, girls and boys, and it is a subject which concerns us here and now."
"It is calculated that a large percentage of people with the HIV virus living in the European Union do not know they have it."
"As a result, the risk of the virus spreading is increasing and, naturally, these people cannot benefit from the treatment available."
"Generally speaking, access to antiretroviral treatment at affordable prices would appear to be fairly good within the European Union."
"Nonetheless, certain Member States have expressed their concern about the future: if, or rather when, the number of cases of HIV spirals and the cost of treatment remains high."
"This is one of the main issues being addressed by the European Commission and it has raised it – and continues to discuss it with the Member States and the pharmaceutical industry – in the aim of finding effective ways of overcoming these problems."
"However, we must not underestimate the economic consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which are huge."
"The cost of antiretroviral treatment is just one aspect of these economic consequences."
"At macro-economic level, HIV/AIDS results in increased health care and social security costs."
"It causes a drop in manpower numbers and a fall in productivity, which increase labour costs."
"The cumulative result is an adverse impact on investments, production and per capita income."
"In brief, the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a very serious threat to global health, development and security."
"However, over and above the economic aspect, HIV/AIDS is also a problem with respect to human rights."
"The stigma and adverse discrimination are subjects which concern Europe, as much as any other part of the planet, and they cannot be overlooked."
"The psychological aspect of HIV/AIDS and the isolation which it causes must be addressed with the same decisiveness."
"If these aspects are disregarded, the effectiveness of the aforementioned efforts of prevention and medical care will be jeopardised."
"The subject of HIV/AIDS can no longer be a taboo subject."
"It is of the utmost importance that the subject be discussed openly and that the social stigma cease at long last."
"Only thus will it be addressed effectively."
"Open discussion is an integral part of the information campaign which, in turn, will contribute most towards prevention."
"All of us, especially the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission and, above all, the Member States, need to recognise and accept the new worrying increase in the HIV/AIDS problem."
"Let us stop deluding ourselves, believing that it is under control or at least contained; on the contrary, we need to step up our efforts to combat it, to the extent required for them to be effective."
"I am optimistic that, together, we can achieve this."
". Mr President, today Ukraine has dominated our discussions, and in Ukraine people are dying, not as a result of the political crisis, but because of the AIDS crisis."
"Ten years ago, 183 people were registered as having HIV/AIDS there, today, in 2004, it is 68 000."
"That is the scale of this problem within our own continent."
"Across the world nearly 40 million people have HIV and, as the Commissioner said, we must take action to prevent and solve these problems."
"The focus this year has been very much on women and children."
"As the Commissioner said, women account for some 57% of those who are HIV positive in sub-Saharan Africa, and over 60% of those with HIV aged between 15 and 24."
"Finding vaccines appropriate to them before the onset of sexual activity is fundamental."
"The figures are appalling for orphans too."
"There are 15 million orphans in the world, 12.3 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa."
"There are 1.8 million already in Nigeria, and there will be 1.5 million in South Africa by 2010."
"And so it goes on."
"We have to take action along the lines of our resolution; we have to take action on HIV/AIDS and on conditions, disorders and diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, mental illness and depression."
"We have to find more palliative care for those dying of AIDS, in particular in the developing countries."
"We have to protect our health workers from the dangers of AIDS from needlestick injuries – witness the exhibition in this Parliament today."
"I welcome the Commissioner’s statement."
"I also welcome the work done in this field by Pavel Telicka during his time as a Commissioner."
"We urge Commissioner Kyprianou and his colleague Commissioner Michel to put shoulders to the wheel and to close the door on the epidemic faced by Europe and the rest of the world."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commission for its explanation, although I hope that Commissioner Kyprianou will, before long, be able to come here with more news, more hard facts and more specific intentions on the part of the Commission."
"I should, above all, like to thank Human Aids for the fact that during this year’s World AIDS Day, it will be focusing on women and girls and HIV/AIDS."
"There are sound reasons for doing so."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"AIDS is increasingly taking on a feminine face; the number of women infected with HIV/AIDS is rising at a terrifying rate."
"So who are those women?"
"Are they women displaying serious risk behaviour, or are they women who have been sexually active with too many partners?"
"Not at all."
"In most cases, they are ordinary, often young, women who are very vulnerable on account of their sex."
"They are often married, they are very often faithful to their partners and are mothers of children."
"It may be useful to inform the Vatican of the fact that 88% of the Ugandan girls and women who are HIV positive are married and have not had partners other than the man with whom they share their lives. These women are vulnerable on account of the social inequality and the lack of access to education and healthcare, as well as on account of the fact that they do not have their own incomes and are often incapable of negotiating about their own sexuality."
"For those women, the ABC prevention method – Abstinence, Being faithful and Condoms– is anything but sufficient."
"In order to combat AIDS effectively, we need more than simply ABC."
"We need the whole alphabet."
"To begin with, I should like to add the letter M for microbicides and the letter V for vaccines, because these open up promising prospects for women who may finally gain control over their own prevention methods."
"In my view, it is crucial for the European Union to invest more in research and development into those new products."
"I should also like to add the letter E for empowerment, because the fight against AIDS is simply impossible without reinforcing the rights of women and without combating violence against them."
"Commissioner, I am therefore very much looking forward to the global action plan which the Commission will be presenting to us in the spring of 2005, because a global approach is indeed what we need."
"It is, of course, not enough that well-meaning Commissioners such as yourself or Commissioner Michel should be committed to the fight against AIDS."
"This issue must also be dealt with by the Commissioners for Equal Opportunities, External Trade, Justice and also naturally by the Commissioner for the Budget."
"I hope that the European Union will continue to take the lead in order to mobilise more financial resources for the fight against HIV/AIDS, but also to improve cooperation among the Member States on the basis of a coherent multiannual plan."
"I regret that the Dutch Presidency is not present here today, because I would like to pay tribute to the courage with which it has put this matter on the agenda."
"I also think that Europe should do more to increase the financial commitments."
"By 2008, we should be able to treble our financial commitments, in my view."
"Finally, it appears to me essential that women be personally involved in drawing up a global plan of this kind – especially women and girls who live with HIV/AIDS, for they are not only its victims, but also vital partners in working out a sound policy."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will include them in its stakeholders’ platform for the compilation of this global plan."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a time bomb is ticking on Earth, and its name is Aids."
"For several years, the number of new infections has again been increasing at an alarming rate."
"This rise also includes Europe, with particularly Eastern Europe affected, both the new Member States and Russia."
"The majority of new infections involve young people aged between 15 and 25, and in particular women."
"A new carelessness has crept into their dealings with HIV and Aids."
"New medicines and therapies have improved the situation of HIV patients, so that the virus is losing its horror and thoughtlessness has become a way of life for many."
"Such thoughtlessness is lethal!"
"The best protection against HIV is the use of condoms; this is a fact, and it should be supported and promoted by all sections of society."
"Abstinence is of course also a form of protection against Aids, but it should be left to individuals to decide whether they wish to practice abstinence or use condoms."
"Moral appeals are of no use in stopping the spread of the virus."
"Instead, we need encouragement for each person to act responsibly, both for themselves and for others."
"It is the job of politicians to create the conditions that enable as many men and women as possible to make this decision freely for themselves."
"The most important pillars of prevention are sex education without taboos and access to condoms, above all in schools and for young people. I am delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou placed particular emphasis on this."
"In many African and Asian countries, Aids is depopulating entire regions, for example South Africa, where over half of the population is infected with the virus."
"This is no longer merely a disaster in human terms, but also in economic terms."
"I should like to appeal to the EU Member States’ sense of responsibility and the commitments they have already entered into."
"We welcome the fact that some Member States, for example the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands, have provided financial support for the international fund over and above what they committed themselves to."
"Unfortunately, some of the other Member States have either not met their commitments at all, or only in part."
"Aids is one of the twenty-first century’s global challenges."
"Above all, it is the task of the Western societies to put up a fight against this epidemic."
"We need discussions without taboos in Western societies on new methods of prevention, as especially African and Asian societies are dependent on help from outside, or, to put it another way, from us."
"I should like to thank the Commission for its sound statement."
"Millions of people in the South suffer from HIV/AIDS and, weakened by HIV, they often fall victim to other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis."
"Millions of children with no parents wear themselves out cultivating the food they need."
"Many of them have no access to medicines, and almost none of them have medicines adapted for children."
"Exemptions from the TRIPS agreement permit the export of generic medicines, but the EU countries have been slow in implementing such exemptions, a dilatoriness that leads to suffering and that, each day that passes, increases the suffering and the number of deaths."
"Now, the Commission and the Council have the opportunity to show that this wait is to be brought to an end."
"Better access to medicines must, however, be combined with increased knowledge of HIV and increased provision of information about the disease, together with an ambitious aid policy and fair trade so that the countries concerned can afford economic development that increases trade."
". – The scenario that has been illustrated here is not just the result of a natural disaster but represents a tragic synthesis between an aggressive virus and the unbridled drive for profit by single-minded, powerful organisations like the multinational pharmaceutical companies."
"While 95% of HIV-positive people in the world already have no access to treatment today, the situation is bound to get even worse after 1 January 2005, when the derogation from Article 31 of the TRIPS agreement expires."
"India, with a billion inhabitants, and other developing countries will then no longer be able to produce the drugs."
"Even now, those who produce them cannot sell them to other developing countries or to African countries."
"The European Union therefore needs to go beyond all the talking and the statements of principle and make every effort above all to obtain a further derogation from the TRIPS agreement, pending a complete change to it."
"Not only that: the European Union must also oppose the US practice of holding developing countries to ransom in their bilateral agreements, with the aim of preventing them from exercising their right, laid down in the Doha declarations, to use or import generic drugs."
"The Global Fund to Fight AIDS must be supported with an increase in the funds allocated to it."
"I propose that, on the part of the European Union at least, they should reach EUR 1 billion and that everyone, including Italy, should abide by the commitments that have been made."
"According to Fortune, the average salary of the top nine pharmaceutical company directors in the world is USD 42 million a year."
"At the same time, tens of millions of people die without being able to receive treatment."
"In the face of such injustice, any kind of moralistic argument should be thrown out."
"We should remember that a condom is something very useful: a health aid that should be distributed absolutely free of charge."
"It is part of the toolkit needed to defeat the virus."
"Mr Commissioner, today World AIDS Day and your statement on this subject was, in my opinion, very good, but it was still just a statement."
"I hope that it will be followed by practical measures on your part that will help to alleviate the situation."
"Today’s AIDS Day calls on us to be aware of the kind of decisions that we have to take as politicians."
"AIDS is a disease that spreads regardless of borders and therefore today’s decision that health should be a matter for individual states is not a good one."
"AIDS cannot be seen, it cannot be noticed, it cannot be felt."
"It is a disease that crosses borders and pays no attention to customs officials."
"A disease that began amongst risk groups – among homosexuals and then haemophiliacs, then blood donors and drug addicts."
"Now we also see that a large number of women are infected."
"What was not said, however, is that 5 to 5.5 million of the 40 million are children and young people."
"These are alarming figures."
"It has been said today that it is transmitted through sex."
"I am talking about love."
"Perhaps this is why women so often become victims."
"On this occasion I would also like to mention some people who have not been mentioned today."
"These are the health workers, people who are ready and willing to risk their lives."
"They are volunteers."
"Are we aware, however, that these health workers are likely to be the first victims of the health reforms being prepared in the European Union?"
"This is a poor way of thanking them for their work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Commission for its strategic framework of October 2003 and the proposed action plan for next year, which also provides for concrete and targeted measures."
"The EU is the second largest donor to the global Aids fund, provided around 18% of the total funds."
"Yet we are faced with the fact that new infections are rising dramatically, both within the EU and in other countries."
"Commissioner Kyprianou said in a press release that many young people who are currently becoming infected were too young to understand the first Aids campaign. This is undoubtedly correct."
"Yet it is also necessary to remember that many young people are quite simply given false information, with, above all, Aids being depicted today as a treatable disease."
"The pharmaceutical industry is also doing its bit by presenting it as a conquered epidemic."
"The fact is, however, that even the anti-retroviral medicines which are available have major side effects, and that being able to lead a normal life is of course out of the question."
"Furthermore, the high costs of therapy, which range from EUR 7 000 to 12 000 per annum, must also be taken into account, as they are a major burden on a country’s health budget."
"I should therefore like to call for research and development to be carried out into better and, above all, cheaper medication, possibly by means of generic medicines, so that these can be made available to wide sections of the population."
"Something I find particularly worrying is the lack of awareness of the problem among young people, who, when asked in interviews why they have such a lax attitude to the disease, reply, ‘which life should I protect myself for?’"
"I therefore believe that the plan drawn up by the Commission must also include this holistic approach, and, above all, combine education and possibly also giving meaning to life with the whole field."
"Mr President, of the 40 million people suffering from AIDS, 70% live in Africa."
"The Millennium Objectives are a central ambition to focus on basic health carewhere it is needed."
"Europe spends too little of its development cooperation budget on basic health care, which should be linked to good nutrition, access to clean drinking water and basic education."
"Commissioner Michel has stated that he will make a new announcement in which Europe’s priorities in terms of development cooperation will be specified."
"Commissioner, I do hope that the words you spoke a moment ago will also find expression in this new announcement."
"According to the UN, of the 45 million people at risk of infection, 27 million would, if we had a specific campaign, be preventable cases."
"We have a great deal of experience in campaigns of that kind globally."
"It does, however, require an enormous effort and we should therefore focus our minds in that respect."
"It has been stated before that we here in Europe can encourage our Member States to say to the pharmaceutical industry that it can make cheaper products."
"To the developing countries, we could say that we will provide them with a waiver, as a result of which the TRIPS agreements will not prevent them from manufacturing within the cheap market."
"Finally, the Vatican spoke a few days ago through Javier Cardinal Lozano Barragán, President of the Pontifical Council for Health Pastoral Care, about immunity, moral deficit and pathology of the mind as causes of AIDS that have to be combated with correct sexual practices."
"I regard this as a discriminating and stigmatising remark and believe that Commissioner Kyprianou was right to say that we should not stigmatise AIDS patients in that way."
"I am pleased that in principle, the Commissioner has given the Vatican a clear response with this."
"– This year’s UNAIDS report on the trends in the epidemic has been even more distressing than in the past: the projections for sub-Saharan Africa and for its survival in the new century are extremely grave."
"This is one more tragedy to add to other, equally serious human tragedies, such as the exploitation of adult and child prostitution, drug addiction, the lack of minimum standards of hygiene, the break-up of families and the growing numbers of little orphans, as well as infant mortality, which has reached appalling levels: throughout the world, 500 000 children die every year – which means 1 300 children a day – from AIDS."
"That is why today it is important that the European Parliament should stand united, with no distinction on the basis of party or nationality, and send out a strong appeal to all the European Union Member States – starting with my country, Italy – not to throw away all the efforts that have been made so far and to continue to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"Let us avoid adopting a reductionist view of the fight against AIDS and not forget that this virus is not only transmitted by sexual means but that there are many other reasons for its spread: infected syringes, breast-feeding and the lack of adequate medical checks."
"Let us not forget, either, that condoms are merely a means of containment – an effective one, let us be quite clear on this, but containment all the same – and not a means of prevention of the virus."
"If we really want to combat this disease, we have to fight it at its social, economic and ethical roots by raising the standards of living and the levels of prevention and treatment in the worst-affected countries."
"Mr President, I should like to raise two points regarding the tragic situation in certain developing countries."
"Firstly, our attention should not solely be focused on the important question of medicine or some future vaccine. It should also be focused on restoring or setting up proximity-based health services, in other words those located as close as possible to communities."
"Those services have, unfortunately, been badly affected in recent years by structural adjustment plans undertaken in those countries, especially in Africa."
"We must also offer all our support to local initiatives launched by civil society and to networks, on the ground, of local representatives and authorities, associations, carers and mediators from the societies in question, who have been working together to combat AIDS, with some success."
"Secondly, the growing rate of infection among women is not simply down to their fragile nature or to bad luck."
"It is also the result of violence of all kinds – particularly sexual – against women in various regions of the world, and of the blatant discrimination to which they are subjected."
"Such violence has nothing to do with cultural characteristics, which is the erroneous explanation that is sometimes given."
"It must be referred to by name and combated as such."
"These two aspects show, therefore, that AIDS is as much a social problem as it is a medical problem."
"Let us not forget that."
"Mr President, I well remember when the HIV epidemic began to spread in the 1980s."
"Even then, there were prognoses that the spread of the epidemic could be as serious as the situation is today in parts of the world, especially in Africa."
"Such prognoses were, however, dismissed at that time as mere prophesies of doom."
"As a result, the world closed its eyes for a long time – in fact, for too long – to the seriousness of the epidemic and did too little in terms of developing effective programmes of prevention, including contraceptive advice, of developing health care for the sick and of supporting research into more effective medicines and an effective vaccine."
"Now, the world has finally woken up, but efforts at prevention are still insufficient."
"If we do not do more than we are doing at present to prevent the spread of the epidemic, it will, according to experts, not reach its biological culmination until 2060."
"I dare not think of what the consequences would be in terms of human suffering and economic and social crisis."
"Let us consider this resolution as a powerful exhortation to decision-makers the world over, and especially to the European Commission and to the governments of the Member States, to give still greater priority to continuing to combat this epidemic in the future."
"This will require us to set aside considerably more resources, both for our own HIV programme and for the global fund."
"If we do not do so, the consequences will be disastrous from humanitarian, economic and social points of view and also from the perspective of security and stability."
"The Commission has made a superhuman effort in recent years in its strategy to combat HIV but, just like Mr Bowis and Mrs Van Lancker, I think that we need to take far more ambitious steps in the future."
"Mr President, on World AIDS Day, I would like to begin, as other Members have done, by alerting the institutions to the most dramatic aspect of this tragedy: its spread amongst women and girls."
"By doing so, as well as acting in accordance with my personal political commitment to women, I am stressing the enormity of the problem in human terms, in terms of development and in terms of the future of the world."
"Half of the 40 million people infected with the virus are women and girls, and this proportion is increasing in almost every region, reaching 57% in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"With regard to the industrialised world, I will give just one example: Hispanic and African-American women make up a quarter of the women in the United States and account for 80% of AIDS cases."
"The feminisation of AIDS is one further form, the ultimate form, of violence against women, and we have not provided them with the resources to defend themselves against the disease, the fundamental resources, such as sexual education, protection of reproductive health rights or information on measures to prevent infection."
"The social norms which keep young women and girls ignorant about sexuality and do not criminalise sexual violence inside and outside marriage increase the danger of the infection spreading."
"The Socialist Group would like to congratulate the Commission on treating education as a priority in its political framework for combating diseases relating to poverty."
"I would like secondly, Mr President, to express a complaint."
"I would like to say that the Catholic hierarchy is guilty of negligence in the fight against AIDS."
"Today the Vatican is marking World AIDS Day by condemning the disease as a spiritual illness, which it calls ‘moral immunodeficiency syndrome’, which demonstrates the ethical and technical shortcomings of the Catholic Church."
"Via the Secretary of the Spanish Episcopal Conference – Spain being the European country in which the number of infections is increasing most – the Catholic Church intends to politically undermine the world campaign for combating AIDS by warning that contraceptives are unsafe and advocating chastity and fidelity as a method of prevention."
"That statement would not warrant any further comment were it not for the fact that AIDS is killing millions of people, including children; if sexual violence, which leaves no chance of chastity, were not a daily reality in many African and Asian societies; if there were not 15 million orphaned children; if it were not an attack on the sexual and reproductive freedom of men; if it were not, therefore, an attack on human rights and a veritable genocide."
"We are talking about life or death; we do not know whether the Episcopal Conference has understood this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate my colleague Mr Seeber on his maiden speech in this House."
"I believe that today’s debate makes it clear once again that our analyses are right, that the figures are dramatic and that there is support for the declarations of intent, but that the measures taken are insufficient, that there has been no about-turn in opinions, and that the situation is losing none of its drama."
"I can do no other than underline everything that has been said."
"Aids is a disease of our times and a mirror of what has gone wrong in our society."
"Where Aids is concerned, we cannot merely tell people to live differently, to avoid doing certain things, and to be more responsible."
"It is clear that Aids is closely linked to poverty."
"Those affected by Aids are mostly those who live on less than one dollar a day and suffer from hunger."
"Aids today is a disease which affects above all the weak, children, young people and women."
"Aids is also an expression of a lack of prevention, education, sex education, employment and of inequality in the world."
"There is therefore no one solution and no one treatment."
"We must continue the prevention measures already taken, and it is therefore important that we regard Aids as forming part of our health and development policy, our education, family and employment policy and the overall view we take of our responsibilities."
"I call upon this House to not shirk this global responsibility and to ensure that we are number one in the world in the research against Aids."
"Mr President, today, the European Parliament is observing International AIDS Day."
"It is important for us to give those affected our full support and for us to take extremely seriously our share of responsibility for public health."
"For the first time since HIV/AIDS was discovered, more women than men are now infected."
"In certain areas, young women are up to two and a half times more vulnerable to infection than young men of the same age."
"In certain countries, nearly 60% of the people infected are women."
"Many women and girls are especially vulnerable to infection because of other people’s – that is to say, men’s – behaviour in terms of risk and because of the discrimination widely practised in the world between men and women when it comes to views of sexuality and sexual rights."
"The consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are far greater for women and children than for men and boys."
"This year, the UN body, UNAIDS has therefore selected its theme, ‘Women, Girls, HIV and AIDS’."
"When relatives become sick or die, it is mainly women and girls who have to take care of their own families."
"When the health care systems are over-stretched or when they collapse as a result of HIV/AIDS, it is women and girls who have to compensate for the fact by providing increased care and attention in the home."
"Nor are women given the same access as men to health care and to medicines that retard the progress of the disease."
"Old, traditional views, such as the view that men have a right to sex, also mean that many married women cannot protect themselves against infection introduced by their husbands after they have been unfaithful."
"It is therefore outrageous that, in today’s edition of the newspaper , the Vatican calls AIDS a moral disease of the immune system."
"I think that laying the blame on those who are ill is both inhumane and unchristian."
"Gender equality, together with sexual and reproductive health and rights, need to be common objectives for every country in the world and, above all, a responsibility for all men."
"Women must be strengthened in their negotiating position when it comes to condom use and, without exception, given increased rights and better conditions of life."
"We are all losers now, but tests are now beginning in Sweden on a new medicine to combat HIV. If this works, it will create a sensation throughout the world."
"A preventive vaccine is no doubt what we all dream of, so let us hope for a positive result."
"– Mr President, I have listened very closely to the issues raised and the views formulated during the present debate."
"I must say that it truly satisfies and heartens me to hear that the honourable Members not only share my acute concern on the subject of HIV/AIDS, but also my firm conviction that we need to make a full and effective contribution towards relieving the terrible hardship which is causing this epidemic, both in the rest of the world and in the European Union."
"We need in particular to understand the gravity of this problem today."
"Allow me, however, to comment on certain issues raised by the honourable Members."
"First of all, I wish to emphasise and recapitulate that this is an issue which concerns us all."
"As the honourable Members have already mentioned, it is no longer an issue which only concerns vulnerable groups."
"On the contrary, it is something which concerns each and every one of us, witness the way in which it has now spread within families, affecting whole families and underage children, not only in the developing world but also within the European Union itself."
"I wish to assure you that the entire European Commission, all my colleagues and I are aware of this issue."
"We share the same concerns and we have set the same targets and I wish to assure you that there will be full coordination between me and all my colleagues in combating this problem, in drafting and implementing programmes in this direction."
"As far as the question of research is concerned, may I remind you that, for the vaccine in particular, research into an HIV vaccine is a priority under the sixth framework programme for research and development and we expect up to EUR 130 million to be earmarked for research into an HIV vaccine."
"As far as drugs are concerned, may I remind you that I absolutely agree that there must be access to cheap drugs for everyone who has a problem with this disease, especially of course for poor countries and poor sections of the population who cannot meet these high treatment costs."
"May I also remind you that recently – and this is also mentioned in your resolution – the Commission adopted a proposal for the mandatory licensing of drugs for export to countries in need."
"This point is currently at the codecision stage and I trust that, judging from other cases in the past on highly sensitive issues, a study will be expedited rapidly so that this proposal can be completed as quickly as possible, and that this proposal will provide the possibility of access precisely to cheap drugs."
"There is a huge need – and I repeat this – for the social stigma to be lifted."
"One of the serious problems which we face today with regard to the spread of this disease is that, because of this pressure, many people are suffering from or have been affected by the virus and not even they themselves know it."
"They do not undergo the necessary tests in fear of the stigma which there may be and, thus, they pass it on to their families."
"Special emphasis needs to be placed on enlightening people and on the fact that it must be understood that no social stigma should attach to a disease; on the contrary, it should be addressed in the same way as every other serious epidemic disease."
"Finally, I should like to assure you once again that the European Commission is truly dedicated to these efforts to combat this scourge."
"I welcome and I wish to express my thanks to Parliament, on behalf also of the European Commission, for the active interest which we see. We trust that we shall be close and effective allies in this fight, so that this problem really is addressed efficiently."
"There is no room for complacency; we need to continue with the same intense effort, to show the same zeal in preventing and stopping the spread of this illness. At the same time, however, we need to contribute towards the relief of those who are already affected and to their treatment."
"I await and look forward with interest to a future constructive dialogue between the Commission and Parliament so that we can achieve our joint objectives."
"At the end of the debate I have received five motions for resolutions.(1)"
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The fight against Aids should unite all people of good will."
"Unfortunately, the strategy for this fight proposed in the joint motion for a resolution, a strategy based on the promotion of ‘reproductive and sexual rights’, excludes millions of people in Europe and the world."
"The reason for this is that millions of people throughout the world do not believe that any benefit can result from the promotion of abortion and contraception and from the provision of sex education to ever-younger children in violation of the rights of parents and without their knowledge or consent."
"Many people in Europe are morally opposed to such things, and justifiably so."
"Furthermore, there is no proven link between the promotion of such ‘reproductive rights’ and a fall in the number of those infected with Aids."
"Quite the contrary is the case."
"Some African countries, such as Uganda, have significantly reduced the number of infections, not by promoting the use of condoms, but by encouraging a move towards abstinence and more responsible sexual behaviour."
"Such brazen promotion of ‘reproductive rights’ makes it impossible for me to vote in favour of this resolution."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0028/2004) by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in EU citizens’ passports."
". Mr President, first of all I thank you most warmly for according me the opportunity to express my views on the report and on the amendments to this important draft regulation."
"May I also congratulate your rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on his valuable contribution to this debate."
"Before presenting my remarks, I wish to recall the context of the Commission's proposal."
"The primary objective of the Member States was not only to improve the quality of documents, but also to establish a reliable link between the holder and the identity document."
"The aim of this approach was to minimise the dangerous trend of the production of counterfeit documents, which are used to enter the territory of the EU illegally."
"The approach was confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003."
"In September 2003, the Commission presented two proposals introducing biometric identifiers into the uniform format for visas and residence permits for third-country nationals."
"On 18 February 2004, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation on common standards and biometrics in EU citizens’ passports as we were convinced that we cannot only secure documents related to third-country nationals."
"Otherwise mala fide foreigners could abuse less secure European passports."
"In its proposal for biometrics in passports, the Commission provided for one mandatory biometric identifier, the digital image, and left the second biometric identifier, fingerprints, optional."
"When drafting the proposal on passports the Commission was fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue."
"On the one hand the EU has to suggest measures enabling Member States to strengthen security and the protection of their citizens; on the other hand the Commission has to take data protection and privacy concerns into careful consideration."
"At the Council of 25 October 2004, the questions as to whether the second biometric identifier, the fingerprint, should be integrated in a mandatory way, and what the implementation data for the regulation should be, were discussed again."
"Ministers reached a unanimous political agreement that the first biometric identifier, the facial image, should be implemented at the latest within 18 months and the second biometric identifier, should also be mandatory at the latest 36 months after the adoption of the technical specifications."
"This political decision could help Member States to issue identity documents capable of establishing a reliable and direct link with all others."
"In this context it is equally important to underscore that the two biometric identifiers, digital image and fingerprints, should be used to reduce the production of counterfeit documents, not to interfere in the private lives of EU citizens."
"As regards the timing, the European Council in its conclusions on terrorism of 26 March, set the end of 2004 as the date for the adoption of the proposals and the technical specifications."
"We are actively moving things forward."
"Our technical committee has made an early start on its preparatory work on the technical aspects regarding the integration of the biometric identifier into the visa and the residence permit."
"Also, the measurement work for the passport has already been completed."
"The technical specifications have to be adopted by the Commission via the comitology procedure after the Council has adopted the regulation, which constitutes their legal basis."
"Mr President, the 19 amendments tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are primarily concerned with data protection issues."
"They are also concerned with reviewing the comitology procedure, so that Parliament and the authorities responsible for data protection are involved in the decision-making process."
"The Article 29 Working Party for the Directive was consulted on the proposal, and most of the amendments relating to data protection were already taken on board during the Council’s work."
"Nor can the Commission endorse these amendments: either they were incorporated into the version under discussion at the Council, or some of them do not comply with the legal basis, which only covers the security characteristics of passports."
"As regards revising the comitology procedure, the amendments cannot be accepted, because this procedure is the result of an interinstitutional agreement and a Council decision in 1998-1999 laying down the general procedure applicable to committees."
"These instruments also lay down Parliament’s right to participate and I do not see how there can be any derogation from these."
"A further amendment has been tabled today during the plenary session by the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"It concerns the second biometric identifier to be integrated into the passport, namely fingerprints."
"In its proposal, the Commission had left it to the Member States’ discretion whether or not to take their citizens’ fingerprints, insofar as some of them did not want to adopt such a policy at that time for political reasons."
"Nevertheless, the Council unanimously decided, on 25 October 2004, to make fingerprints similarly compulsory at the latest 36 months after the adoption of the technical specifications."
"The Commission considers, in fact, that this unanimous decision clearly symbolises a new political will to harmonise across the Member States the ability to ensure – on the basis of elements such as fingerprints, which are more reliable than simple digital images – that identity document holders are the individuals referred to therein."
"This approach, in other words, has in fact overridden the initial proposal, which made fingerprints optional."
"EU Member States have in fact shown their political will to have two biometric identifiers."
"In other words, they have, politically speaking, chosen between the two options."
"To conclude, I feel that joint effort on the part of all the institutions is crucial to step up security in the Union, whilst ensuring that the legitimate rights of law-abiding citizens are respected."
"I am grateful to Parliament for expressing its opinion so promptly."
"This will make it possible for the regulation to be adopted by the end of the year and for us to keep to the timetable set by the Council in March 2004."
". Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their help, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, among whom I am especially grateful to Mr Cashman."
"We must all work together to find solutions to the dangerous times in which we live."
"There is no point in burying our heads in the sand."
"It is crucial that we strengthen our citizens’ security, and yet we must do this without compromising essential freedoms, including the right to personal data privacy."
"The proposal before us today was submitted to Parliament in February 2004 and is the result of a coherent approach towards biometric identifiers involving harmonised solutions on national documents from third countries, on EU citizens’ passports and on the Visa Information System and the second generation of the Schengen Information System."
"Increased security in travel documents and the integration of biometric identifiers will help in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, and will lead to increased security in the exercise of freedom of movement."
"The best way to prevent the use of false identities is to check whether the person presenting the document is the genuine holder or not."
"New technology offers many benefits when it comes to identifying individuals and preventing counterfeit documents."
"We must combat what is known as ‘visa-shopping’and identity misuse."
"Parliament is entirely justified in the importance that it attaches to data protection."
"A balance must always be struck between the need for security and respect for individual rights and freedoms recognised by national and Community laws."
"This is an essential and condition for adopting the use of biometric identifiers."
"I therefore fully endorsed the proposed amendments tabled in the letter from the Article 29 Working Party and I emphasise the need for measures relating to access; in other words, who is entitled to access and for what purpose."
"The Member States must draw up a list of the competent authorities, of guarantees relating to people who cannot provide certain of the selected biometric data, such as fingerprints, as in the case of burn victims or amputees, and of guarantees to the effect that when border checks are carried out and a false rejection occurs, the citizens concerned will be informed of the reasons for such a rejection and of the means to be employed in order to clarify and rectify the situation as quickly as possible."
"Lastly, new functions must be granted to the supervisory authorities in this area, along with an increase in the resources needed to carry out those new functions."
"To conclude, I should like to mention the four questions that are crucial to the adoption of this report."
"Firstly, there should be one sole objective for the use of data."
"It must be made clear, with no room for doubt, that data may be used solely for the purpose of identification and under no circumstances for the purposes of covert identification or surveillance."
"Secondly, there is the question of the database."
"The report that I am presenting to you categorically rejects the idea of setting up a centralised database."
"Biometric data must be stored solely on the passport."
"It is not necessary to set up a database to ensure a more reliable link between the passport and its holder; the risk of function creep – the use of data for other purposes than originally envisaged – is too great."
"I wish to state categorically that nowhere in the Commission’s legislative proposal or in the current Council text is there a proposal to set up a database."
"There was a reference in the explanatory statement to the notion that this may be considered in the future and, for this reason, we suggest that Parliament’s position be made clear straightaway."
"Thirdly, the technical solution chosen: the technical specifications should be sound, as it is those specifications that determine whether the biometrics will work or not."
"We cannot run the risk of rushing into solutions that are later found to be poorly prepared, technically outdated, or too costly."
"This would damage the citizens’ trust."
"One key question, Mr Frattini, is that the most delicate part in terms of data protection is not a matter of which principle is chosen, but the way in which it will be implemented."
"We therefore propose that the experts viewing the technical specifications from a data protection point of view should have the opportunity to evaluate the technical specifications and raise any issues."
"The fourth and last point concerns amendments to the initial proposal."
"At its meeting of 26 October, the Council decided to proceed with the amendment to make fingerprinting compulsory; it had previously been optional."
"From a political point of view, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had already adopted, by a large majority, the introduction of both biometric identifiers, with the sole difference that it left the adoption of the second to the Member States’ discretion."
"All reservations were raised with the Council and it was the Member States themselves who opted to dispense with that discretion and to choose both straightaway."
"I therefore feel that there should not be any objections to Parliament voting in favour of this report. In so doing, Parliament will be making its position clear on the issue and underpinning the guarantees that we always want to see safeguarded."
". Mr President, as someone who opposed the previous nominee, I should like to say to Commissioner Frattini how pleased I am to see him take up his duties."
"I would like to welcome Mr Coelho’s report – it is an excellent piece of work."
"On behalf of my Group, however, I have to state that we are not happy that there has not been time for Parliament to be reconsulted on the new proposals from the Council."
"We have concerns – although thankfully some of them have been met – with regard to the protection and integrity of data, verification by the passport holder of that data, the insertion of any corrections necessary, and restrictions on the use of the passport and the data."
"The reality is that our citizens want freedom of movement not only within our borders, but outside those borders too."
"We must therefore be realistic in our approach and ensure that biometrics in passports ensure free and virtually unrestricted movement across borders so we can focus on and combat organised crime, traffickers, drug barons and terrorists."
"However, one particular fear that arises from this, and which has frequently been discussed in our debates, is that of the capture of data."
"In this area we must be extremely vigilant."
"Access to data must be carefully regulated by national legislation in accordance with the provisions of Community law, European law and our international agreements."
"Biometrics in passports must reinforce privacy and civil liberties and must not be used as a catalyst to assault fundamental freedoms and rights."
"In conclusion, I welcome the protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms as contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Council document agreed on 23 November 2004."
"I commend Mr Coelho’s report and in particular Amendments 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which reinforce citizens’ rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am delighted that you are still here at this late hour."
"I should firstly like to thank Mr Coelho for his report on the Council’s proposal to include biometric data in identity documents, which from a liberal point of view was on the whole balanced and justifiably critical."
"I believe that Mr Coelho, in his report, made reference, without hesitation and with the necessary clarity, to the issues that remain unclear, whether these issues involved the guarantee of data protection or the remaining uncertainties with regard to the technical procedures for storing the data on the identity documents."
"Further to Mr Coelho’s comments, I wonder why it has not again been clarified as to which costs will be incurred by the inclusion of biometric data in identity documents, before the Council presses forward and takes a decision?"
"The question must also be asked as to whether this is financially responsible."
"I am, however, seriously annoyed, as the lack of clarity over some of the contents leaves me no option but to ask myself how much attention the Council really pays to such a serious issue."
"I am not necessarily talking about technical issues."
"In this connection, I have to ask myself – and this is something that was referred to by Mr Cashman – how the Council defines its relationship with Parliament."
"After the relevant committee issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council presented us with an amended proposal, with amendments which were clearly more than merely editorial or cosmetic changes."
"The original Council proposal provided, as mentioned by Mr Frattini, for the mandatory integration of a biometric feature in EU citizens’ identity documents, with the way in which this was to be implemented being at the Member States’ discretion."
"The new proposal we have before us is quite different."
"This gives rise to two questions, to which I would ask the Council to respond; why have these amendments been made after the relevant committee had discussed the proposal?"
"The Commissioner’s answer implied that the subsidiarity principle was being circumvented here, as a number of Member States had no interest in implementing the proposal."
"The other question – and I know that my time is nearly up, but I have one more question I should like answered – is: what kind of way is this to act?"
"Parliament is being threatened with ..."
"Sorry Mr Alvaro, but please put your question to the Commission in writing."
". Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group is of the opinion that the Commission proposal to introduce two biometric identifiers lacks crucial information on important points such as costs, proportionality, added value and security."
"The Commission has not yet provided Parliament with the requested information on the scope and seriousness of the problem of false documents, the results of previous improvements in document security and the error rate of the various biometric options, in particular the lack of reliability of fingerprints, the intrusive nature of their use and the risk of misuse."
"Yesterday the Chairman of the Article 29 data protection working party sent a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which he pointed out that the working party does not have enough information on which tests have been conducted, what their outcomes were, or on which basis the Council decision had been taken."
"Therefore the working party expressed its reservations as to the use of biometric procedures that have not proved efficient, in particular the compulsory use of biometric features such as fingerprints."
"For the Verts/ALE Group, it is clear that the introduction of two biometric identifiers can represent a threat to security through risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and data protection."
"We are therefore suggesting that only one biometric identifier be integrated, namely a digital photograph in visas, residence permits and passports."
"Mr President, I should like to add to the criticism expressed in this House."
"I consider the report a democratic scandal."
"I turn firstly to its substance."
"What is, of course, at issue is whether it is fair to introduce biometric data, which in this case means fingerprints, into people’s passports."
"Yes, says the Council, and the report submissively concurs, of course, irrespective of the fact that these demands are synonymous with a huge extension of the police surveillance that the EU has been developing in recent years."
"The scandal consists in the fact that neither the report nor the Council’s decision contains any serious discussion of the relationship between ends and means."
"A number of significant encroachments upon people’s rights are to be introduced without the remotest evidence that these encroachments are of any use at all in achieving the objective."
"On the contrary, all the competent and expert bodies have been united in stating that there is simply no point in demanding biometric information in passports."
"The operation was successful, but the patient died, as we say in Denmark."
"In recent days, this scandal has taken on the character of a farce."
"The consultation of Parliament, ostensibly based upon Article 67 of the EC Treaty, is clearly inadequate, and a future Council decision would therefore be invalid."
"I adhere to the minority opinion, issued by myself and a number of fellow MEPs."
"Mr President, on 25 October, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs voted on the report by Mr Coelho."
"It was already apparent that biometric details would soon be included in passports, and Mr Coelho tried to subject this to a number of conditions in order to safeguard the privacy of citizens in any case, for which credit is due to him."
"Even before the Commission had a chance to vote on this, however, the Council tabled its own, much more far-reaching proposal."
"In other words, the Council did not even have the decency to wait for Parliament’s recommendation."
"Judging from the subsequent course of events, it would appear that the Council wants to push its own opinion through at all costs, and is prepared to bring considerable pressure to bear on Parliament in order to achieve its goal."
"That is a very undemocratic attitude, certainly in view of the fact that passports directly affect every EU citizen."
"I do not harbour any illusions, though."
"I am convinced that the governments that are represented in that self-same Council will, in the national debates about this issue, point the finger at Europe once criticism gets underway; that, they will say, is what Europe prescribes."
"I do want to clarify, though, that this is not a European decision."
"It is a decision that the national governments enforce at European level, by capitalising on, or taking advantage of – whichever way you look at it – the democratic loophole that is still there."
"I was very curious to hear the response by the minister responsible, but none was forthcoming."
"Let us hope that his response would have been less cynical than that of Mr Donner, the Dutch Justice Minister, in the Dutch Lower Chamber, to critical questions about this sequence of events."
"It was suggested to him that this was immoral, but, to his mind, it was simply politics."
"Mr President, I join with the previous speakers in extending a warm welcome to Commissioner Frattini and congratulating Mr Coelho, the rapporteur."
"The previous speakers have already drawn attention to the lack of cohesion in the democratic process where this issue is concerned."
"The decision to add a second characteristic was taken behind closed doors, and both the EP and the national parliaments were simply frozen out in the process."
"The Council has subsequently more or less blackmailed the European Parliament to push through a few decisions as soon as possible, even though this issue is a very fundamental one."
"I have to add that I very much regret the fact that there is no one from the Council present today to respond to this."
"Commissioner Frattini has said that this is a security measure and that we demand better passports."
"That is of course all very well and good, but we should not forget to add that we also have to consider the request of the United States that we should include one biometric characteristic."
"It has not asked for two, and it is therefore beyond me why this second characteristic should all of a sudden be added, certainly if the United States has no intention at all of doing the same."
"I would therefore ask you to support our amendment tomorrow to keep the second characteristic optional."
"Finally, looking through the proposals, I wonder whether these would really lead to an improvement in security or whether they represent a show of security, because, as you know, terrorists simply travel using their own passports."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we disagree with the introduction of biometric identifiers and feel that they infringe fundamental rights which we consider to be ."
"They are an insult to human dignity and jeopardise the safeguarding of important human rights, such as privacy and freedom of movement."
"Behind these measures is concealed the adoption of the so-called 'war on terrorism' as a priority in the objectives of the European Union."
"It is important that Europe should not get carried away and should fight for the good of nations and people."
"This should imply resistance to such policies."
"The collection, storage, access to and transmission of personal data harbour huge dangers and are equivalent to acceptance of global policing and excessive controls."
"I should like to take this opportunity to denounce the action of the Council, which adopted these measures before procedures had been completed in Parliament, as well as the arbitrary change to the provision on mandatory biometric identifiers in the passports of European citizens, from a digital photograph only to a photograph and fingerprint."
"The Council wrongly underestimated our role, the voice of the European citizens whom we represent …"
"I am sorry Mr Triantaphyllides, we have run out of time."
"I should like to thank the Commission and all speakers for that debate on what is a very important topic."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is three oral questions to the Commission on football in the EU:"
"– Oral Question (B6-0133/2004) by Ivo Belet and Doris Pack, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on a framework for the balanced development of football in the EU;"
"– Oral Question (B6-0134/2004) by Christa Prets, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the development of football in the EU;"
"– Oral Question (B6-0135/2004) by Hannu Takkula, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on a framework for the balanced development of football in the EU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I realise that this problem pales somewhat before what has been discussed here in this House this afternoon, I do think that developments in the area of football also have major social implications."
"I am delighted that, despite the late hour, it is still possible to have this debate today."
"You will agree with me that the future of football hinges upon our youth training."
"If that deteriorates or falls by the wayside, it undermines the game itself."
"That seems to be a spectre that prophets of doom confront us with, but regrettably, that scenario is far closer than the average football fan could ever imagine."
"Commissioner, the situation is serious."
"It is no longer the case that youth players can play up in higher divisions, because their places are increasingly being filled by often cheaper players from outside the European Union or even from within it."
"This leads to bizarre situations, such the Belgian first division club SK Beveren usually fielding eleven Africans in Belgium’s top football league."
"This situation has a pernicious effect on our football’s social function."
"After all, you will agree with me that football is an excellent instrument for social integration and against social exclusion."
"I particularly regret that it is precisely this function of football that is currently being undermined in different European competitions, not only in the Belgian ones, but also elsewhere in Europe."
"That is particularly regrettable in this day and age."
"This development is also detrimental to the scope for expansion in competitions, but perhaps we will hear more about this during the debate."
"A number of concrete proposals have been tabled to turn the tide and call an end to this development."
"One of the proposals provides for a regulation which prescribes that clubs must play a minimum number of players who have been trained by their own clubs or in the competitions in which their clubs are involved."
"I believe that such a measure would give the clubs an enormous boost in terms of the effect they have on young people."
"Moreover, from a moral point of view, it would be preferable to invest far more in the training side of clubs than in buying players and trading them as pure commodities."
"Hence my specific question to the Commissioner whether he approves of this proposal."
"Commissioner, do you also agree that it is desirable that the government – and I mean both the national and European authorities – should help invest in youth activities and in clubs’ sports facilities?"
"Finally, Commissioner, would you agree that it is necessary to uphold the social fabric of football?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, by means of this question, I should like to emphasise the contribution made by sport to promoting social cohesion within society."
"Particularly in the year that will shortly come to an end – the European Year of Education through Sport – we must thoroughly discuss and learn from the knowledge we have gained and the criticisms that have been made."
"As we know, football is of a very particular importance."
"It is therefore important to face up to the fact that increasing numbers of young people are being excluded from training or shut out of their normal places in their teams."
"UEFA’s initiative to call for possible quotas for young players or native players is therefore entirely understandable."
"I would like to stress the point that these quotas have nothing to do with the racism or xenophobia that we have seen frequently in recent times, but are merely about promoting young sportsmen and sportswomen."
"I believe they would also help to improve the budgets of certain teams. They do not violate the Bosman judgment."
"I know that the argument is often used that there are not enough reliable young players."
"Perhaps this is because they are treated unfairly by comparison with the other players who are paid high wages."
"Young players should and must have the chance to develop and make a name for themselves."
"It should not always be the mathematical or economic aspect which is focused on, as what this is much more about is a responsible way of dealing with young people."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission what its opinion is of possible quotas for native players or of investments in local training institutes and the training of players."
"Mr President, physical exercise, including that king of sports, football, is an increasingly important resource that promotes human wellbeing, health, the cultural dimension, social cohesion and the economy."
"People have become powerfully aware of the importance of sport in the European Union and, consequently, it is to receive a legal basis under the new Constitutional Treaty."
"The moral and ethical basis for the sports culture in Europe is the rule of ‘fair play’."
"The values connected with democracy, equality and solidarity are also of key importance."
"The European Model of Sport, as it is known, has been structured around these values."
"It is especially important, as we are in the European Year of Education through Sport, to examine the Commission’s accomplishments in the area of sports culture."
"The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States, which is due to take place soon, places an obligation on the Commission to set about preparations promptly to clarify the legal basis for sport."
"We have a lot of questions, which await answers."
"Today, as far as our special subject for debate, football, is concerned, we need action, for example, which will ensure that European competitions are conducted cleanly and that young players are properly protected."
"We also need action to weed out the unfortunate by-products of sport, such as drugs, racism and football hooliganism."
"It is important that sports organisations and clubs know their responsibilities."
"In football one would hope this would mean that there will be special measures in the field of work with junior players in clubs."
"When we speak of the possible support that society can give to football, support for the work of training clubs should take precedence."
"Investment from the Union and society is also needed to improve training conditions and build sports facilities for our citizens."
"There are huge differences between football clubs and cultures at European level."
"Some clubs concentrate on training players and selling them to top clubs, and some on achieving maximum success among the world’s best clubs."
"As football is a big industry, it is difficult for nation-states or the Union to supervise the selection of players by football clubs."
"I do not think it is appropriate either."
"In the case of the players, they who are employed by the football teams, the free movement of European players ..."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, there is a danger that the way in which sport is developing in the European Union will result in the weakening of its educational and social character."
"The social function of sport, which is its more general interest, has been damaged for some years now by the appearance of new phenomena, which have caused the application of fair play, overall action and the development of the sporting ideal to be questioned."
"Violence at football grounds, following a period of quiet, has revived over the last two years, with new trials for the most beloved of popular sports, football."
"Hooliganism is now being translated into racism at football grounds where black footballers are playing or in teams to which players from other races are transferred."
"There are signs of xenophobia and racism in that, apart from the chanting, banners and flags with emblems of the terrible past, full of hatred and incitement to terror, are also making their appearance."
"The spread of doping and financial exploitation in relation to television rights and marketing have turned sport, and football in particular, into a field of competition and conflicting interests."
"Footballers' contracts in the post-Bosman era have taken on values of huge dimensions."
"The liberalisation of the market, which initially appeared to benefit clubs, has proven with the passage of time to be an unpleasant surprise, in that the so-called 'national product' has lost out."
"In numerous European countries, especially over the last five years, another phenomenon has emerged which has led very well-known and historic clubs to bankruptcy but not to spending: ambitious plans, vain hopes, unpaid coaches and players, debts reaching as far as FIFA and UEFA."
"The European Union of the 25 now faces a different prospect and the entry of the ten new Member States is creating the need for conditional harmonisation in the free movement of football players for the transitional period."
"UEFA is studying new ways of rescuing and producing new talent."
"That is why it is essential that the European Union cooperate with the competent ministries of the 25 on the completion of the plan for a national character."
"– Commissioner, we must all help so that the function of football, which is the popular sport , operates as a social inclusion factor."
"Football is not simply a game which lasts 90 minutes, nor is it a purely business activity."
"It is, in many cases, the image of the efforts of an entire local society."
"That is why it is not right for the player transfer system to be based purely and simply on a decision by the Court of Justice which completely ignores the social role of sport."
"The free movement of workers also applies to footballers who, as working citizens of the European Union, have – and must have – this right."
"Nonetheless, the Commission could adopt measures designed to strengthen the ties between footballers and football clubs and the local society, as we heard earlier."
"The proposal formulated for a minimum number of players, for example, who must come from the area of their team, is important."
"On the other hand, the concentration of high value players in financially robust teams is weakening the tie between these teams and the societies from which they come and is having an adverse effect on the possible development of the talent of players in the area."
"The picture painted today by numerous big, mainly European teams which, at important football events appear with only one or two players from their country, or even none as we heard a short while ago from Belgium, should be a cause of concern to us."
"Sport is and must remain the basic axis of social integration and I hope that the Commission will move in this direction."
"The social and educational character of sport has been emphasised several times and we must promote it as such."
". Mr President, Mr Frattini, I should like to pick up on two points."
"It strikes me that a much stricter regulation is required on the purchase of young players."
"We have recently read in the press that players of six and seven years old have been bought by two clubs, Real Madrid and Manchester United."
"I feel that, in this case, the purchase of young players has gone way too far, even if this is, of course, sanctioned by the families."
"I believe that transferring players under the age of 16 should be banned and that priority should be attached to training clubs."
"Every country has perfectly good training schools, and we must make sure that they are able to keep their young players up to a certain age."
"Nor can we any longer accept the fact that young African players are brought to the EU on full charters and that only a few are taken on and all of the others completely abandoned."
"My second point is about acknowledging what is happening in our stadia – in Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere – and acknowledging the acts of xenophobia and racism that happen there."
"I feel that we need to address this issue."
"This is a question for the Council, although it also concerns the Commission, in my opinion."
". Mr President, rather than begrudge the success of certain football clubs, we should try to emulate the very best and the most successful football clubs in the world and use that as our model to be followed by other clubs."
"If this requires us to make changes to legislation or to national rules with regard to the support given to football clubs, then so be it."
"It really irritates me when I hear people complain that clubs like Real Madrid or Manchester United are using their financial power and muscle to the detriment of other clubs."
"In fact, as we can see, clubs that have spent less money on players than Manchester United or Real Madrid are now ahead of them in their national leagues and doing better than them in the European Champions league."
"What is really at the heart of this whole argument is what we put in place to ensure that local talent is given the best opportunity to prosper and grow within its own area."
"More important than that – as the Bosman ruling has proved – is to ensure that those who have talent, natural ability and skill are not restricted and can utilise that ability and skill wherever it is most beneficial to them."
"In reality, the careers of football players are getting shorter and shorter, because of the professionalism and speed of the sport."
"Therefore they have to make the maximum use of those resources."
"Commissioner, I would plead with you to look at the best model and follow that."
"Do not go with the lowest common denominator."
"Mr President, sport is an important economic and social factor, and is significant both in terms of its social role and of its value in the development of personality and peoples’ ability to integrate."
"Yet even during this, the European Year of Education through Sport, which has seen many successful major events, there have been problem areas, for example with regard to football."
"In its Helsinki report, the Commission stated its intention of encouraging legal certainty in football and of cooperating more closely with clubs."
"The aim of this is to find alternatives to the development of a European transfer system, in which the training of young players is often treated as a secondary consideration."
"As a member of the European Parliament’s ‘Friends of Football’working group, I have spoken with many players, trainers and club and UEFA employees about how to promote clubs’ autonomy and long-term training for players at local, national and international level."
"In most of Europe’s football leagues it has become the norm to use players who are mediocre, and who were therefore bought cheaply, while blocking promising young ones, who are given far too little time for personal development."
"When wealthy clubs then obtain these talented youngsters for themselves, this leaves the smaller clubs extremely frustrated."
"In the case of the top teams, it is precisely these talents who then sit on the bench if they fail to achieve rapid sporting success."
"This is the way in which valuable young talents are burnt out."
"All of this means that the initiative that Mr Belet and other Members have launched is extremely important, as much too little is invested in the promotion of new talents in the EU."
"Mr Figel’, do we need quotas for football teams so that the first team can include at least three self-trained players?"
"Origin, nationality and EU citizenship should play no role in this respect."
"Or do we need the clubs to voluntarily commit themselves to giving their own young players a chance?"
"I believe that it is not only trainers, clubs and football players that are interested in a solution, but also the millions of fans throughout Europe who identify with creative talents and their carefree style of playing."
"Mr President, as we have heard, sport is important for the physical and psychological health of our communities."
"Football, which is the most popular sport, has a particularly important role in this."
"The top professional clubs have to lead by example."
"I have to say I have been very impressed by the work of the professional clubs in my own region in the north-west of England in working to combat exclusion, providing education and providing community leadership."
"One area of great importance where football clubs have to be active is in combating racism and xenophobia."
"I was delighted to support the ‘Give racism a red card’ campaign in the United Kingdom."
"We have to keep up that fight."
"I regret the scenes we have seen recently in Spain, Italy and elsewhere, which show racism in football on the increase again."
"We must not condone this."
"It is important that the new Commission takes initiatives in this field and it is important that we make it clear to football clubs that they must not condone the activity of their own fans."
"We must not forget, however, that football is a business and it must be allowed to operate in the same way as any other business."
"Nor must we forget that – frankly – the old transfer system was akin to serfdom and did no service at all to professional footballers."
"I hope we would not advocate a return to those days but we have to do everything we can to support plans to bring young people into the game and give them more opportunities than they have at the moment."
"This is why we need to look at the UEFA proposals."
"But I think that talking about the transfer system is missing the point."
"The points of key importance in football at the moment are television rights and how they are distributed among television clubs."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner tell me whether he has any proposals on those rights so the money is more fairly shared between all clubs in football."
"Mr President, : sports and citizenship."
"Sports are an instrument of social cohesion and social inclusion, and also an instrument of community identification."
"For these reasons we have to promote sports practice and a sports social organisation."
"For stateless nations, community identification through sports becomes very difficult."
"In the UK this is solved through the existence of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland national teams."
"In Catalonia we have several national teams that cannot compete in international competitions."
"Last summer the Catalan national roller hockey team was allowed to participate in the ‘B’ World Championship in Macau."
"Catalonia was the winner and was supposed to move up automatically to the ‘A’ World Championship."
"However, the intervention of the Spanish state changed the votes so our national team was not recognised at the meeting in the USA last week."
"That is a bad example of the intervention of a nation-state with a sports federation in a world series."
"Mr President, in recent years increased television coverage of football and increased funding through advertising revenue have changed the nature of the game and its impact on society out of all recognition."
"As a major aspect of entertainment, in which society takes considerable interest, it is appropriate that the EU institutions are aware of developments, even though the football authorities and the clubs take the major responsibility for organising the game."
"The issue raised by this debate is one which the clubs and UEFA have been considering: whether they should encourage young sportsmen to aspire more to a career in the game, whether they have a real prospect of playing for the clubs which train them, or whether – particularly at the top level – it is merely a market for a limited number of world superstars."
"As I understand it, the European Union is not seeking to prescribe employment practices to be followed by professional football clubs but there may be opportunities; observations and recommendations may be made."
"International competitions also form an important aspect of the public’s enjoyment and interest in the sport."
"If home-based youngsters are not encouraged, this aspect of the game may well lose out accordingly."
"My question to Commissioner Figel’ is: what should be the precise relationship between the Commission and Council of Ministers and the football authorities now that the game has such a major impact on society at large?"
"Mr President, Mr Figel’, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the proposal that UEFA put forward in July 2004, which aims to encourage voluntary involvement."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"I also welcome the fact that this question session is being held at the end of the ‘Year of Education through Sport’, as this means that particular emphasis is given to sport’s significance in terms of education, society, health policy and the community, even though we are also aware that it is also a significant economic factor, and more than that besides."
"With regard to the ‘Year of Education through Sport’, I should like to ask the Commission when we can expect a report on the results and conclusions, in order to continue the debate on this year more intensively than merely with regard to one sport."
"Today we have spent a lot of time discussing the issue of coercion, and I am wondering whether coercion and education are not contradictory terms."
"I am therefore rather more in favour of voluntary commitment."
"The European Union cannot take the responsibility away from the teams, the trainers, the paying spectators, the paying members, the members of the public who give their time as referees and linesmen, the sponsors and the state."
"Should sponsors, members and the state not link their funding to certain developments in sport and in the clubs?"
"I wonder why today’s debate, and UEFA’s proposal, are necessary, while we have the Helsinki report and Parliament’s resolution of 2000?"
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission what it has done with the two reports, what has gone wrong and at which measures it is prepared to have another attempt."
"I now call on the Commissioner to reply to these questions, but I would like to remind him that we are in injury time – there are two more debates on the agenda tonight and it is almost 10 p.m. already."
". Mr President, I am glad that there is such interest in sport and football."
"Much of my week has been taken up with discussing it, including yesterday in Parliament’s committee."
"Today I should have been in The Hague with the Council presidency and the ministers for sport."
"I hope to be there tomorrow for the closing event of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004."
"So, sport is currently getting a lot of attention, and much action is being taken that could result in some answers to the questions heard here today."
"This will surely bring more value and political weight to debates about sport in the European Union and also to developments surrounding cooperation."
"Mr Karas said that self-regulation is better."
"That is true, but the rule of law is a founding principle of the Union, and we have to abide by all the rules, including Community law, national law, both and ."
"This includes employment legislation, because in sport and in football there are different dimensions to activities."
"The educational and social value of sport, and football in particular, is reflected in many positions of the Commission and in Parliament."
"You will remember the Helsinki report and the Nice Declaration on Sport in 2000."
"We then came up with the idea of making 2004 the Year of Education through Sport."
"I am sure that we will evaluate experiences, especially as the year draws to a close."
"As I said, the closing ceremony will take place tomorrow."
"I hope to come back soon with some evaluations and proposals."
"For the future, the draft Constitution gives us a much wider legal basis for activities."
"Once it is ratified, we will work on European sport policy."
"Until then we have some time to prepare."
"We want to start open consultations, mostly based on workshops but also via the Internet to ensure we have the widest possible audience."
"Probably the most sensitive question was the idea on quotas …"
"I am sorry to interrupt you, Commissioner, but we have a problem with time because other debates have overrun."
"I wonder whether you could answer the questions in writing?"
"This is unusual, but we are half an hour late and the interpreters want to finish."
"Would you mind bringing your remarks to a close and answering Members’ questions in writing?"
". That is no problem for me, if it is satisfactory for you."
"Sorry colleagues, I must insist."
"We have two more debates to conclude."
"The Commissioner is prepared to answer your questions in writing."
"He could not have answered all the seven or eight questions put to him in the time available."
"I am so sorry, colleagues."
"I have invited the Commissioner to wind up, he may do so, and he will answer your questions in writing."
". I want to remind the House that the conditions for any specific measures must be in line with both Community law and national law, in particular national labour law."
"We do not have flexibility in explanation of Community legislation, that is the Court of Justice’s responsibility."
"There is jurisdiction on judgments that are quite clear for some practices."
"Until now we have had no formal requests."
"The Commission cannot give guarantees on the compatibility of specific practices with the Treaty."
"The Commission does not have the power to authorise any practices that are contrary to the Treaty."
"I look forward to more debates and to cooperating closely with you in future in the area of sport, including football."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"We will provide you with a copy of the transcript of the debate tomorrow morning so that you can answer the questions more quickly."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0033/2004) by Edith Mastenbroek, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community programme on promoting safer use of the Internet and new online technologies."
". Mr President, illegal and harmful content on the Internet is of real concern not only to this Parliament but also to people outside Parliament."
"Child pornography, and also racist and violent material, is a real problem for our society."
"Although parents are not always aware, we have also noticed that many of our children make contact with people in chat rooms and then they like to have contact outside chat rooms."
"Therefore there is real danger."
"That is why we want this safer Internet programme which has played a key role in the Commission's action to protect minors in the field of audiovisual and information services."
"Firstly – and I am going to be very brief, Mr President, because you asked me to – there are the networks of hotlines where users can report illegal content; there are 18 Member States participating."
"Then there is the network for raising awareness of safer use of the Internet, with 21 countries participating in network awareness nodes."
"Then there is content rating and the parental control technologies, where we are setting up an international system for rating Internet content and improving filtering technology."
"The first action plan involved 37 projects bringing together 136 organisations from 70 countries."
"The new programme is of course going to be in continuity, but also enhancing what we have done so far."
"It is very simple, there are new technologies, so there are new forms of usage by those who threaten children."
"Therefore we have to find new answers and that is exactly what we are trying to do, working very closely with the safer Internet forum."
"To make a long story short – and it is story that interests parents and society at large – Parliament and the Commission are working on the same lines."
"All the amendments today are acceptable, which is good news for Parliament, so there will be no clashes here and we can agree on a general line."
"That is the way also that I am going to listen to Parliament’s proposals."
". Mr President, children must be able to make use of the Internet and other new media in safety, without being confronted with illegal and unwanted content."
"Such is the ambitious objective of the Safer Internet PlusProgramme."
"The Commission’s proposal makes it clear that a decision has been made in favour of self-regulation, with much of the responsibility being laid on parents, educators and other end users."
"That is an approach that I wholeheartedly support."
"The programme draws a clear distinction between illegal content and unwanted content."
"There is a crucial difference, in my view."
"In that respect, the emphasis is on providing information to parents and educators."
"That too, I support without reservation."
"The programme’s four action lines have to do primarily with the fight against illegal content, in particular child pornography."
"The network of child pornography hotlines in the European Union is being extended, whilst the initiative for setting up such hotlines should come from the Member States themselves, the Commission can, and indeed should, encourage and accelerate this process."
"After all, it is of major importance that each EU Member State should, as soon as possible, have its own hotline so that we can fight child pornography on the Internet across the EU."
"In addition, the programme offers Internet users the means of protecting themselves against unwanted content, for example by filtering it."
"In close cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, I have opted mainly for focusing on research into this technology and assessment of it."
"There are all kinds of content filters available for parents who wish to make use of them, but there is often a great lack of information about how well this technology performs, and this is where the European Union can make a useful contribution."
"In the framework of theSafer Internet Plus Programme, research can be carried out into the performance level of the technology, and it is possible to examine on the basis of precisely which criteria these filters operate."
"It can also be examined whether filters are sound instruments in any case to help users protect themselves."
"Indeed, there are plenty of examples of filters that filter away far too much."
"For example, there are filters that work on the basis of key words and that inadvertently make information about such subjects as sexual education or breast cancer inaccessible."
"That could never be the intention, of course."
"Other filters do not filter enough, which effectively renders them useless."
"We should, moreover, not overlook the fact that children can often very easily deactivate those irritating filters without their parents knowing, so that they can continue to surf to their hearts’ content."
"This brings me to the third action line, which I myself regard as the most important."
"Many Internet users, particularly parents, are completely oblivious to the risks their children run on the Internet."
"It follows that many parents have no idea what their children are doing or experiencing on the Internet."
"In order to promote a truly safe environment for children, we therefore need to invest heavily in providing information to parents."
"Just as parents try to equip their children to defend themselves in the off-line world and tell them that they should not go off with strangers, parents would also be able to guide their children more effectively on the Internet."
"For this to happen, though, parents need to be aware of the fact that there are risks."
"I believe that another crucial point in the provision of information is technical protection."
"One result of a lack of protection of Internet users’ own computers is a deluge of unwanted content with which they are confronted."
"One example that springs to mind is spyware, which constantly guides your Internet browser to a specific porn or gambling website, or irritating pop-ups that you simply cannot remove."
"A lack of technical protection of the computer can also result in Internet users spreading illegal or unwanted content without them knowing, with all the consequences that this entails."
"Research has shown that most European broadband users have still not protected their computers sufficiently."
"Information campaigns should therefore take this into consideration."
"The fourth action line concerns the setting up of the Safer Internet Forum."
"This is a unique discussion forum for industry, Internet providers and software manufacturers, but also for organisations of users, such as parents, child protection agencies, consumer clubs, civil rights movements, and others."
"This forum offers a space where self-regulation can be developed."
"Codes of conduct need to be drafted in order to examine how the industry itself can contribute to a safer Internet, for example by means of providing information to its own users, but also by means of sound agreements, on the basis of self-regulation, about transparent and careful notice and take-down procedures, something which is desperately needed."
"It is important to realise that the use of the Internet always poses certain risks."
"It will never be possible to completely remove all unwanted content from the Internet, nor is that entirely desirable."
"It is up to parents to guide their children."
"Just as every parent teaches their children not to go off with strangers when they play outside, there are also rules of conduct for the Internet, and that is why the information, for which this programme makes provision, is so crucial."
"Since the programme is set to enter into effect as soon as January of next year, it was necessary to give it our prompt attention."
"Over the past few weeks, together with the shadow rapporteurs, I have worked with both the Council and the Commission in a very constructive dialogue, and the present report is the outcome of our efforts."
"I should thus like to extend warm thanks the shadow rapporteurs and to our partners in the Commission and the Council."
"We have managed to get virtually all of the points we made taken on board."
"We have the Commission’s and the Council’s unqualified support for this text, and the report was also approved unanimously in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I hope for similar support in the plenary, so that the Safer Internet Plus Programme can take off with the necessary dynamism on 1 January 2005."
". Mr President, I will keep my remarks short in order to keep in with the interpreters, whom I much admire."
"The Internet is a force for good when it is responsibly used, but it is a force for evil when it is in the hands of morally suspect persons or criminals."
"This report builds on the work that I did for my own report in the last session, dealing with the issues of child pornography on the Internet."
"This is a very good report and it forms the basis of further work, which we need to do because technology moves on."
"Technologically, the criminal community often moves on rather faster than the law enforcers."
"We need to be aware of the fact that this is a highly technologically-based industry."
"It is also one where we need more codes of conduct, which impinge upon those who make considerable profits as service providers within the business."
"I do not mind people earning a lot of money but I feel that sometimes this brings with it extra responsibilities, particularly in an area where there is an international dimension."
"We in Europe must act."
"We have been dealing with money laundering directives recently."
"It seems to me that the minutiae in regulations in that area, which we require people to abide by, indicate that we are far too flexible and easy-going when it comes to controlling the Internet."
"Let us by all means take the Internet forward, let us find new technology, but let us make sure that the people who wish to use that technology for evil purposes are curtailed in their actions for the good of all of us."
"Mr President, welcome, Commissioner Reding. The report on safer use of the Internet concerns an issue different from many of the others that we politicians are accustomed to deciding about, but the Internet and new technology require political knowledge and decisions."
"Before I was elected to the European Parliament, I took an active interest, as a female Social Democrat, in the debate about violence, violent pornography on the Internet and the exploitation of children and young people."
"I am still involved in the debate, but now as both a Member of the European Parliament and as Chairman of the Depiction of Violence Council/Media Council in Sweden, which is responsible for these issues."
"On the basis of my experience in Sweden, I am especially pleased that the EU is accepting its responsibility for ensuring that the Internet is safer for children and young people and that it will continue to be both entertaining and educational, not only for children and young people but for all who like to surf the Net and use its chat rooms."
"In the committee, I talked in particular about children’s use of the Internet."
"This is a lucrative area for the future, and we as politicians must demand that the industry concerned accept its responsibility and pay for filters and other devices that can remove degenerate material on the Internet and offer protection against it."
"In Sweden, we have been able, by taking part in this EU project on the future of the Internet, to demonstrate the differences between parents’ knowledge of children’s Internet activities and what the children say their parents know."
"Parents clearly need help in keeping up with developments, which is something we have also been able to offer through the EU project in Sweden by, for example, producing a handbook."
"I think we must try to continue with such cooperation and exchange of experience in the EU."
"Cooperation, together with internal reform of the Internet are therefore what are required and, through Mrs Mastenbroek’s report, Parliament is well placed to bring about a safer Internet."
"I would like to preface my remarks with a quote from a statement from the Vatican concerning the role of the Internet."
"The Internet can unite people, but it can also divide them on the basis of ideology, politics, possessions, or religion, if used as an instrument of aggression."
"Concurring with this, I too think that in principle two possible paths lie ahead of the Internet."
"It is the responsibility of us all to prevent it from embarking on the second of these: the Internet must never become an instrument of aggression."
"The safer Internet programme now before us has this as its objective,and I therefore support it."
"Over the past few years, this initiative has already proven its worth."
"First and foremost, by fostering the provision of information, it has helped to ensure that the next generation will be more aware users of the Internet."
"In connection with this aspect of the programme, the provision of information, I would like to add a thought concerning the report."
"In the new Member States of the EU, including my own home country, Hungary, the rate of Internet penetration is typically lower than elsewhere."
"One of the reasons for this is an unwarranted lack of confidence in the Internet."
"I therefore feel it is important to emphasise that providing information on the dangers of the Internet, which I too consider important, as outlined above, should always go hand in hand with raising popular awareness of possible solutions."
"If this does not happen, we are likely to see a slowdown in the rate of Internet penetration in certain Member States."
"In this regard, the hotline services that are given special mention in the report are of fundamental significance, although familiarity with such services is very limited, especially in the new accession states."
"One can certainly say that in this regard there is a need for a true breakthrough, and there is a need for the hotlines operating in the Member States to work together a good deal more effectively."
"There is therefore still considerable work to be done, but the draft before us can contribute to creating a safer and more humane online environment."
"Mr President, there are few reports which respond to a real feeling amongst European citizens for a solution, particularly among parents, than this report."
"Mrs Mastenbroek has completed an excellent report and people who are real experts in this field such as Mrs Segelström and Mr Kirkhope have added their words of support."
"I want to focus on three or four clear points."
"One is to congratulate the Commissioner on her words about the proliferation of racist and other violent material, which is on the increase and which is of concern to all of us here in the European Union."
"I want to raise Mrs Mastenbroek’s very important distinction between illegal material and harmful material."
"As Mr Kirkhope said, we are dealing here with a hugely imaginative product of technology, something which adds to our freedom and is something that we should handle with great care when we deal with how to curtail some of its excesses."
"I want to pick up on something practical."
"On Friday in my constituency I will visit a major charity called Childline."
"Many children’s charities across the European Union are crying out for the kinds of solutions we see in this report: funded solutions, hotlines."
"Mrs Mastenbroek, for example, mentioned the possibility of a children-specific hotline being adapted from the hotline approach that we see in the report."
"We have to deal with safer Internet providers, people who are making a great deal of money out of this technology but who also have a real responsibility."
"It is for us to publicise that need so that there is some peer pressure on Internet providers."
"Finally, for the older people amongst us, 3G technology will open out this kind of technology even more."
"The next generation will deal with it."
"It has to be protected."
"This report goes a long way towards doing that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this programme cannot come too soon."
"ICT-based and other information technologies, and network security are vital to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"We cannot allow criminals, irresponsible crackers and crooks to take over the Internet."
"Extortion has actually already come to the Internet as far as business is concerned."
"I would hope that by the time this programme is in its final stages the Commission will venture to adopt a strict policy and draft rules for restraint in this sector, which will prevent harmful, illegal and unwanted content."
"The harm is growing faster than the rate at which measures are being taken to prevent it."
"For this we could use the services of the European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA."
"We therefore need new rules."
"Europe does not accept robbery on the highway or piracy on the high seas, so why should it accept such crimes on the Internet?"
". Mr President, I should first like to say thank you to Mrs Mastenbroek, who has achieved the feat of having her first report adopted, all being well, at first reading."
"She deserves to succeed because this project – our joint project and not that of some people who oppose some other people, a project that must involve the whole of society – is intended to provide real support to the benefits that new technologies can bring us, without the negative influences about which the Members of this House have spoken so eloquently."
"Naturally we shall do everything in the new programme to improve security for parents, and of course the security that they wish for their children."
"We shall also do everything – and Mr Paasilinna is right in this regard – to bring in a tough policy."
"After all, we cannot pursue such a policy solely with a softly-softly approach, by taking the soft law route."
"We should, instead, be basing new policy on the third pillar, which offers the possibility of policies that are tougher but more difficult to put in place."
"Nonetheless, Mr President, I feel it is crucial that general awareness is raised of a known problem."
"We must also be clear – and Members of this House have expressed this very well – that if we do not grab this problem by the scruff of the neck, that if we are not able to resolve the problem, then what could be and will be an important technology for Lisbon will not be moving harmoniously in the right direction."
"We therefore have a responsibility towards our society and the weaker elements thereof to be proactive."
"In this regard, I thank Parliament and its Members for helping the Commission and the Council to accomplish their task."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner and all colleagues for their cooperation in respecting the time limits."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to wish Ms Mastenbroek all the best for her forthcoming marriage."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"– The Internet is a universe of limitless freedom but, as there are no rules to control its use, it may also be a universe of infinite freedom to abuse, groom and violate."
"For years I have been taking political action in the European Parliament, tabling dozens of motions for resolutions and questions and issuing countless press releases and statements, in order to have democratic rules established, that is to say rules and laws that protect the citizen and punish those who use the Internet for criminal purposes."
"This year I have succeeded in having the objectives of the Daphne programme include the request to ‘study the possibility of creating filters to stop the spread of child pornography on the Internet’."
"Now, at last, the Council and Parliament have decided to set up a new programme to promote safer use of the Internet."
"We also need an awareness campaign, greater funding, and a more incisive attack on the use that criminals make of the Internet."
"In that context I must point out that in Italy I have brought a ground-breaking suit against a site that puts out false information about Members of the European Parliament and about Europe."
"There is no case-law yet on the subject, and so we do not know how to stop a citizen of one Member State from spreading falsehoods about a citizen of another Member State."
"For freedom to be real freedom, it needs rules!"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"– Report (A6-0039/2004) by Jean-Paul Gauzès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of San Marino providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments"
"and"
"– Report (A6-0042/2004) by Jean-Paul Gauzès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Principality of Monaco providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments."
". Mr President, I should firstly like to say that I am delighted that, for my first speech in plenary session in this House, there is an esteemed audience present."
"I also wish to greet Mr Kovács, the new Commissioner-designate for taxation, who is similarly having his baptism of fire today."
"In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall try not to use up the ten minutes that have been allotted to me. I wonder, for that matter, about the significance of holding such a debate, given that three reports of the same nature have already been adopted and it appears that the political group that requested this debate is not even represented this evening."
"In the absence of any coordination of national systems of taxation of savings income, some residents of the Member States were able to avoid any form of taxation in their State of residence on interest which they received in another State."
"Consequently, a directive was drafted to remedy this situation, which is conducive to the development of damaging fiscal competition, as capital tends to flow to countries outside the European Union with abnormally low rates of taxation."
"The lack of information about this income thus hampers the proper functioning of the single market."
"In this context, the Council authorised the Commission, by its decision of 16 October 2001, to negotiate appropriate agreements with Switzerland, the United States of America, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino under which those countries would adopt measures equivalent to those to be applied within the Community, so as to ensure effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments."
"Since then, the Council adopted the directive on taxation of savings income on 3 June 2003, which provides for a system of information exchange."
"Three Member States (Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg) attached conditions to this abolition of banking secrecy."
"They secured a transitional period during which they will be authorised to withhold tax instead of exchanging information."
"In the meantime, agreements have been negotiated with Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Monaco."
"In the case of the United States, the existing framework of bilateral relations with the Member States with regard to taxation makes it possible to conclude that equivalent measures already exist."
"The agreements between the European Community and Switzerland, Andorra and Liechtenstein were very recently submitted to Parliament and were adopted."
"The two last agreements to be submitted to Parliament are the agreements with Monaco and San Marino."
"The content of these two agreements is similar to the content of the agreements that have previously been examined."
"I shall briefly detail them: withholding of tax at source shared with the State of residence, voluntary disclosure of information at the initiative of the income recipient, a review clause and progress on exchanges of information in cases of tax fraud."
"These two agreements, like the previous ones, represent a major step forward from the political point of view."
"The agreements will have the effect of ensuring the adoption by the countries concerned of measures equivalent to those which must be implemented within the European Union to tax effectively savings income in the form of interest payments made in one State and intended for recipients residing in another State."
"This instrument should permit effective taxation, which is necessary to combat damaging tax competition and help improve the functioning of the single market."
"In order to attain this objective, the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities provided for by Directive 2003/48/EC is an appropriate means."
"With these two agreements, the necessary phase of concluding agreements prior to the implementation of the directive for the countries that I mentioned above comes to an end."
"The implementation of this series of agreements was initially scheduled for 1 January 2005."
"It was postponed, however, until 1 July 2005 by a Council decision of 19 July 2004, as the various conditions for their implementation ought to be met by then."
"It is important that this date should be respected in order for the whole package to be implemented properly."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, for his excellent work."
"We have in Mr Gauzès a very skilled and professionally competent addition to this Parliament."
"I myself agree that the EU should aim for income policy agreements and cooperation with its neighbouring states."
"This way we can be sure we are operating according to the same rules as our neighbours."
"It is especially important to make efforts to prevent fraud and money laundering as part of the fight against terrorism also."
"The legal barriers regarding financial services in the EU’s internal market have already been removed in the main, or they are being removed right now."
"The function and strength of the internal market depend precisely on how effectively we can agree and implement acts at European level in those areas where they are needed."
"By this I also mean implementing decisions in Member States and monitoring that implementation, something that is often less than satisfactory."
"There is, however, much to be done, especially still in the area of taxation."
"For example, in January 2003, FEFSI, the European Federation of Investment Funds and Companies, published a study on various tax barriers that investment fund managers have encountered in the internal market."
"The study said that tax barriers are one of the major obstructions to a real single market in investment funds."
"These, of course, are not directly linked to earned interest, but they certainly are linked to impediments in investment and capital markets."
"There is thus a need for standardisation in taxation."
"I do not believe, however, in any beneficial effects of complete harmonisation of taxation."
"Healthy competition, rather, among the EU Member States and with neighbouring states too, is ideal for boosting the effectiveness of our markets and bringing benefits to end users."
"Cooperation and harmonisation must be brought about in tax bases, that is, the things that we tax, and in administrative collaboration."
"Finally, I would like to make a request to Commissioner Kovács."
"In the hearing you referred to the Tobin tax and indicated you were interested in this."
"I would hope, however, that you will take into consideration in your future work the view put forward on numerous occasions by the European Parliament that we do not want any initiatives from the Commission regarding matters to do with transfers of assets."
"Mr President, the UK Independence Party objects to this directive in the strongest possible terms."
"This directive admits the principle that the European Union has the right to interfere in Member States' taxation policies, something that the British Government has always told the British people it will never allow to happen."
"Indeed, it interferes with the taxation policies of non-member STATES too, and this has been achieved by threats, coercion and bullying."
"Taxation policy should be the reserve of independent, sovereign states; any desirable end contained in this directive should be achieved by international agreements freely entered into by sovereign states."
"Tonight we are discussing Monaco and San Marino, but this directive will also affect some British overseas territories, namely the Cayman Islands, some other Caribbean islands and Gibraltar, territories that depend heavily on banking and financial services for their economic existence."
"In the great tradition of European legislation, this directive extends the power of the European Union whilst damaging the economic performance and viability of the victims of that legislation."
"In relation to the European Union, the British Government has acted true to form in its usual cowardly and treacherous manner."
"Just as it betrays its own people, it has betrayed its dependent peoples in order to fulfil its higher loyalty to the European Union."
"Looking on the bright side – who knows? – perhaps this directive may help in time to turn up some of the countless millions that have been embezzled from the European Union."
"Unfortunately, it is far more likely that those millions along with other perfectly legitimate millions will be subject to capital flight and will be reinvested outside the reach of the European Union."
"I would ask any MEP who values national sovereignty to vote against this directive."
". Mr President, I will very briefly explain the position of the Commission."
"I want to take as a point of departure the fact that there is a very clear and strong Community interest in upholding the principle of fair taxation and in the elimination of tax evasion."
"That was the aim of the directive on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, more commonly referred to as the savings tax directive, which received the strong support of the European Parliament."
"In order to ensure the effectiveness of these measures and to preserve the competitiveness of the European financial markets, the Council gave the Commission a mandate in October 2001 to negotiate agreements with key third countries for the application by those jurisdictions of equivalent measures in their own savings tax directives."
"The two agreements in front of us today follow those with Switzerland, Andorra and Liechtenstein, which have already been presented to and supported by Parliament."
"They constitute an essential component of a new framework for cooperation in the field of direct taxation based on our own savings tax directive, but also comprising similar agreements signed at national level with dependent and associated territories of Member States."
"All these legal instruments will have simultaneous application from 1 July 2005."
"Let me thank Parliament for this vital support for these two valuable reports in favour of the proposals for the conclusion of these agreements."
"In closing let me express the hope and expectation that these agreements will now be ratified without problems on both sides and so help alleviate uncertainty for market operators as regards the timing for the necessary preparations, in order for them comfortably to meet the starting date of 1 July 2005."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your magnificent brevity."
"I should also like to thank the services, particularly the interpreters, for working late this evening."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The sitting is open."
"The next item is the debate on the annual report of the Court of Auditors for 2003."
"The first person to speak will be the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Fabra Vallés, whom we welcome to this House."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, on 15 November 2004, I presented the European Court of Auditors' Annual Report for 2003 to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I was able on that occasion to provide a detailed account of the findings and conclusions contained in our report."
"Today I should like to focus my presentation on the Court's findings in three areas: the statement of assurance, budgetary management and the process of reform of the Commission."
"Chapter 1 of the Court's Report contains the Statement of Assurance – the DAS – which is published in the Official Journal together with the Community's consolidated accounts."
"As in the previous financial year, the Statement of Assurance is based on four pillars, which are the result of changes in the methodology employed by the Court in order to make the results of its work more solid."
"The four pillars are the following: firstly, the quality of the EU institutions' and the Member States' control systems; secondly, an examination of a sample of commitments and payments for each area of expenditure; thirdly, the annual declarations of the Directors-General of the Commission; and, fourthly, examining the work of other auditors."
"As a result of this auditing work, the Court believes that the consolidated annual accounts for 2003 presented by the Commission were drawn up in accordance with the Financial Regulation."
"The accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure for the financial year, and the financial situation of the Union, the sole exception being the recording of the transactions relating to the sundry debtors item."
"As in previous years, the Court points out that, in 2003, the Commission's accounting system was unable to guarantee that all of its assets had been correctly recorded."
"The plan which the Commission adopted in 2002 to modernise its accounts is due to take effect in 2005."
"In the Court's view, the full implementation of all of the new rules and accounting plans will require a considerable effort on the part of the bodies whose accounts are to be consolidated."
"As regards the legality and regularity of the transactions and as far as revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure are concerned, the Court believes that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"As regards the other Chapters of the budget, the Court's observations concern general shortcomings in the supervisory systems and controls for the management of EU funds."
"In the Chapter on agriculture, payments were again affected by material errors."
"In the field of structural measures, weaknesses in the Member States' management and control systems have persisted."
"In the Chapters on internal policies, external actions and pre-accession expenditure, errors affecting the legality and regularity of the transactions have also been detected."
"For this reason, and in spite of the considerable efforts made by the European Institutions in recent years, the European Court of Auditors recommends that a greater effort should be made as regards the management and control systems in these areas."
"The Court stresses once again that the areas of shared, indirect or decentralised management are the ones where most errors continue to appear and that it is in these areas that a greater effort needs to be made."
"In this regard, Court Opinion No 2/2004 on the single audit model, to which I shall refer later in greater detail, is a concrete proposal to improve the control systems which could in turn help to improve the management of EU funds in the Member States."
"I shall now refer to the comments on budgetary management."
"The total payments budget in the financial year 2003 was EUR 98 000 million; payments amounting to EUR 90 500 million were made, that is, an increase of approximately 6% when compared with the financial year 2002."
"The budget surplus fell considerably, from EUR 15 000 million in 2001 to EUR 7 000 million in 2002 and EUR 5 500 million in 2003."
"Despite this improvement, the Court believes that the budget surplus is still high and is indicative of systematic problems which must be resolved by improving the budget estimate."
"The main cause of the surplus is still the difference between estimated and actual expenditure."
"The Court points out that it would not be realistic to expect the budget to be implemented in full given that 80% of the EU budget is managed on a joint or decentralised basis and depends on the Member States for implementation."
"Nevertheless, in the financial year 2003 the rate of implementation for payments was 92%, which is a considerable improvement when compared with the figure of 86% for the previous financial year."
"As regards the budgetary management of the European Development Funds, we note that efforts have been made, with the revised form of the report on financial management, to improve the quality of information about the management for the financial year."
"The Commission has made a considerable effort to reduce the volume of outstanding commitments."
"Furthermore, the implementation of payments has been affected by a shortfall in financial resources: EUR 270 million."
"In order to round off its report, the Commission should ensure that it reflects the costs of managing the European Development Funds."
"I shall end my presentation with a few words about the state of the administrative reform launched by the Commission in 2000."
"In February 2004 the Commission published a report on the degree of implementation of the actions proposed in the White Paper on reform."
"The Court of Auditors recognises that the Commission has made progress with the new control framework but believes that the results are still not satisfactory as regards the implementation of the system."
"In the Court's view, in the case of eight of the actions that had theoretically been completed by the end of 2003, including those relating to the minimum standards for internal control or the internal audit capability within each Directorate-General, the degree of implementation is still not satisfactory."
"For this reason, the Court feels that in spite of the progress made the implementation of the Commission's internal control standards still cannot be considered sufficient to provide reasonable assurances as to the legality and regularity of the transactions."
"The Court urges the Commission to complete the task of implementing the new internal control system, especially in the areas of shared management, risk analysis and debt recovery."
"Lastly, it should not be forgotten that the Commission's reform is based on the principle of responsible management, the rendering of accounts and the evaluation of results."
"To this end, in the financial year 2003 the European Commission presented, for the first time, an analysis of the reliability of its supervisory and control systems with regard to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. In this way, the Commission assumed management responsibility for the EU budget, as required by Article 274 of the EC Treaty."
"The Commission reports that it is still unable to make an unconditional declaration in one key area of its management, the Structural Funds, a situation confirmed by the Court of Auditors' observations."
"In other areas of management, the Commission relies on the declarations of the Directors-General, 21 of which contained reservations."
"These reservations limit the guarantees offered by the Directors-General in their declarations."
"The Court also believes that the Commission's efforts and the progress it is making will not be sufficient unless they are also accompanied by an improvement in the audits of EU funds which are carried out by the various authorities responsible for managing the funds at national level."
"The European Court of Auditors addressed this theme in its Opinion No 2/2004, published last April, on the feasibility of introducing a single audit model, to which I referred at the beginning of my speech."
"This Opinion was delivered at the request of the European Parliament."
"The purpose of the single audit model is to develop, within the European Union, an efficient and effective internal control framework guaranteeing the reliability of the findings and enabling them to be used by all parties taking part in control activities."
"This is a field in which the European institutions and the Member States, in cooperation with the national audit institutions, can work together very closely to develop a legal framework for improving the audit of EU funds."
"Before I conclude my speech, I should like to depart from our agenda if I may."
"As you are aware, my term as President of the Court ends in January 2005."
"I will therefore have completed the three-year period which began with the presentation in the COCOBU of the Court’s work programme for 2002."
"During these three years, I have worked to promote and maintain the best possible working relationship with the European Parliament, principally through cooperation with its Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We have promoted more effective communication, exchanges of information and greater cooperation between our institutions."
"I believe that the overall result is positive and that every day the Court provides the Parliament with independent and professional assistance of ever-higher quality."
"This can only be achieved if the independence and roles of our respective institutions are respected."
"In addition, the Court has undertaken an internal reform of its organisation and structure in order to make the institution more effective in the performance of its duties and to make a Court of 25 Members more flexible and efficient."
"The aim of this reform, which is a direct consequence of enlargement and of the Treaty of Nice, has been to ensure that the Court operates effectively within its legal framework."
"At the same time, the Court has worked with the Audit Institutions of the new Member States to prepare them for their important role in providing liaison for the Court's audits in their respective States."
"These and other technical and human-resources measures will help us to continue to improve our work in an enlarged Europe."
"Today I believe that we can celebrate the achievement of these objectives."
"This concludes my presentation. Many thanks, ladies and gentlemen, for your kind attention."
"Before giving the floor to the representative of the Commission, on behalf of which Mr Kallas will speak, I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors on behalf of the European Parliament for the work he has done over recent years."
"We may have the pleasure of seeing him here again, since he may be transferred to other similar duties, but if not, this would be his last appearance and I do not want to miss this opportunity to tell him that it has been a pleasure for this Parliament to work with him and with the institution he presides over, which is of crucial importance to this Parliament when carrying out its control duties."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fabra."
"Mr Kallas has the floor on behalf of the Commission."
"– Mr President, Mr Fabra Vallés, members of the European Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen. Let me first of all thank Mr Fabra Vallés for his speech and say once more that I am very satisfied with the fair and balanced manner in which the Court of Auditors has presented its annual report."
"I would like to assure the Court and this Parliament that the Commission will give its full attention to the findings and recommendations of the Court."
"Now, though, let me address what I believe to be the most essential political aspect of the whole process."
"This essential political question has to do with the negative background to the positive statement of assurance, the so-called DAS."
"This stems from the fact that for the tenth year running, the Court of Auditors has felt unable to issue a fully positive statement of assurance."
"This so-called anniversary was greatly relished by the Euro-sceptic press – and some politicians – who used the negative statement of assurance to present distorted and disproportionate claims about the handling of EU funds in general."
"The situation stayed relatively quiet this year, but only because the Eurosceptic press was too busy dealing with the delay in the investiture of the Barroso Commission."
"However, regardless of how distorted the information may be, and the measures we may take to state our case, year after year this negative perception continues to affect public opinion, referenda, and pan-European cooperation."
"This inevitably provokes the questions: ‘Who is to blame for the fact that the European Court of Auditors’ statements of assurance have been negative for a whole decade?’ and ‘What should we do about it?’"
"If we asked the Commission whose fault it was, their simple answer would be to put the blame on the Member States for poor implementation of the payment system, and on the methodology applied."
"If we were to ask the Council, it would be easy for them to blame the Commission, who, under Article 274 of the Treaty, clearly hold responsibility for the implementation of the EU budget."
"If we asked the Court of Auditors, they would emphasise their limited human resources and the magnitude of the task."
"From time to time, they do acknowledge the progress made by the Commission, but since the Treaty does not give them much room for manoeuvre in their approach, the result is a negative statement of assurance."
"But what, ladies and gentlemen, would the answer of the European Parliament be?"
"On the one hand, Parliament wanted to approve the budget, but on the other hand, the impression has been left that it has taken the negative statement of assurance into account."
"It is difficult to achieve a balance in such a situation."
"I am glad that Mr Fazakas is Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control this year, and that Mr Wynn is the discharge rapporteur, with whom we agree on the seriousness of the situation."
"This means that we can afford to be ambitious."
"We should all aim higher than just the discharge of the budget."
"All four institutions should work together to formulate a joint plan of action for achieving a positive statement of assurance in the near future."
"This question needs to be resolved, and the Commission is prepared do its part."
"Let me briefly comment on the discussions in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I welcome the timing, format and approach chosen by Parliament this year."
"In the committee discussions held since last week, substantial questions have been raised attempting to clarify certain essential unresolved issues."
"In my opinion, this type of approach will enable us to improve the quality of our dialogue."
"I was glad to see that one of the key issues considered by the committee was the question of how we might achieve a positive statement of assurance on the payments side in the future."
"A positive statement of assurance should mean that the discharge authority is sufficiently confident that the supervisory and control authorities are aware of expenditure, and that they minimise the risk of irregularities at a reasonable administrative cost."
"Despite what the Treaty states, the Commission is not in a position to achieve this on its own."
"We need greater coordination of auditing and budgetary control processes by the Commission, the Member States and the Court of Auditors."
"The minimisation of risks requires much more effective supervision and control measures, which in turn means filling in the gaps in the audit, and the elimination of any overlaps."
"For payments by Member States, for instance, this means that the Member States would have to issue credible audit certificates that the Commission, which has overall responsibility, can rely on."
"Needless to say, the Member States have not been particularly keen to take on this extra responsibility."
"And perhaps we have failed to motivate Member States sufficiently to take more than a seasonal interest in budgetary discharge issues."
"When the Court of Auditors presented its report to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council last week, my main message to the council was that the discharge is not simply a bilateral affair between the Commission and Parliament."
"We should try to find more ways and opportunities to remind the Member States of this."
"Hopefully Parliament and the debate today will help to make progress on this issue."
"As for the Commission, we will play our part in this."
"For us, one of the most important challenges is the accounting system."
"In this regard, I would like to stress that the Commission has made good progress in modernising the accounting system and converting to the accrual accounting method."
"When the new system is in place in 2005, the Commission will be far ahead of most public administrations in the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Fabra Vallés, members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I have not used the time allotted to me to list all the measures taken by the Commission that have been welcomed in the Court of Auditors’ report."
"Let me simply note that we are of course pleased with the positive statement of assurance that the Court of Auditors has given on the reliability of the accounts."
"We are pleased that the improvements in this year’s presentation of the accounts have been acknowledged."
"And we certainly appreciate the unconditional positive statement of assurance that the Court of Auditors has given in respect to its own resources, commitment appropriations and administrative expenditure."
"Now I have the opportunity to return the compliment: the fact that the European Union’s financial management has significantly improved on all levels, guaranteeing EU citizens greatly improved cost-effectiveness, is to a large extent due to the Court of Auditors’ reports."
"I would like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés most sincerely for the invaluable contribution of the Court."
"The 2003 budget discharge procedure has begun."
"I want to conclude by repeating that all institutions have both an interest and a responsibility in taking an active part in the process ahead."
"My colleagues and I in the Commission are keen to discuss with you how we can attain the best result, and the best way to assess it."
"I believe this is in all our interests."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, it is unfortunate that a report of this importance has been overshadowed by other events such as the election of the new Commission, when we should all attach great importance to how the European Union is using taxpayers’ money in the implementation of its budget."
"I am pleased that this year’s report points to improvements in the use of the EU budget and there have been steps forward in strengthening financial control."
"However, as the Commissioner mentioned, we feel increasingly frustrated about the negative statement of assurance."
"The report also points to continued shortcomings, particularly in the case of agriculture and structural measures, where EU money is spent jointly or directly by the Member States themselves."
"Coming from a new Member State, I am particularly shocked to learn that a significant amount of money that is allocated to different Member States is regularly left unused."
"This should send a clear message to national public administrations, particularly in the new Member States, that unless they put their house in order they seriously risk being unable to absorb EU funds, which is certainly not good news."
"In the light of the new financial perspectives, the continued mismatch between amounts that are budgeted and amounts that are actually spent should also tell us that we can hardly expect to increase the EU budget and increase funding allocations if we are unable to use the money that we already have."
"The PPE-DEGroup will definitely continue to press for a use of the EU budget that is efficient, effective and respectful of the highest standards of integrity."
"We want taxpayers to feel that their money is being put to good use by the European Union and most importantly that they are getting good value for money."
"To this end, I feel that we are on the right track but we still have a long way to go."
"I call on the new Commissioner, whom I congratulate on his appointment, to lead the way."
". In the name of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to express my gratitude that on 15 November we were able to hold our plenary session in parallel with the hearings of the Barroso Commission."
"The 2003 Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors was presented at this session."
"This is one of the most important functions of the European Parliament, and it marked the beginning of the discharge procedure."
"President Fabra Vallés offered a comprehensive evaluation for the fiscal year 2003."
"I would like to express our appreciation for the Court of Auditors’ fair, professional and balanced report."
"As you know, our committee introduced the reform of the discharge procedure this year."
"The complicated, impersonal written queries have been replaced by oral hearings of the commissioners, thus creating open, vibrant and meaningful floors for discussion."
"A fruitful dialogue has developed between Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"I would like to thank the Commission’s, and especially Mr Sim Kallas’ positive attitude and cooperative approach."
"In conclusion, the integration of the European Court of Auditors in the discharge procedure and the emphasis on the role of the rapporteur was overall well-received, as Mr Terence Wynn will talk about later in detail."
". Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Fabra Vallés for the way in which, over the past three years, he has always been willing to enter into an open dialogue with Parliament."
"In addition, I should like to wish Commissioner Kallas much success in his new role; I hope for his sake that the European Court of Auditors will be issuing a positive Statement of Assurance at the end of this term."
"The elections will be fresh in most of our minds, and as Commissioner Kallas pointed out in his introduction, one of the main criticisms we always heard was that after ten years, the Commission still has not managed to obtain a positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"That is grist to the eurosceptics’ mill."
"We must devote every effort to getting that Statement."
"However, the Court of Auditors should indicate more clearly what exactly the Commission has to do in order for it to be supplied."
"What are the criteria?"
"Every year, I read that things are improving, but I never know by how much."
"What are the concrete measures that should be taken?"
"Parliament has made a few suggestions in the past, including an increase in the financial corrections."
"What exactly was the impact of this?"
"Did the Court of Auditors ever analyse it?"
"Last year, we specified in the resolution that if it were to transpire that money in a certain sector was still being used inappropriately, the Commission would have to suspend payment of advances."
"In the Commission’s response to the Court of Auditors’ remarks, it is stated that this is actually done on a regular basis."
"What was the precise impact of this?"
"Was it useful?"
"And how do things stand as regards cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and the national courts of auditors?"
"Do national courts of auditors apply the same criteria for the Statement of Assurance as does the European Court of Auditors?"
"Is it not possible for a Member State, at the end of each budget year, to sign a statement that all spending is ?"
"If that subsequently does not appear to be the case, can the Commission not penalise that country for having taken us for a ride?"
"Those are all concrete measures that could be taken."
"Could the Court of Auditors analyse this in more detail?"
"I do believe it is important for us to know what we are working towards."
"Yesterday, we held a debate on the new financial perspectives."
"Most countries say that they need more money than the 1% demanded by some Member States."
"How is this justifiable if it appears, year after year, that the money is not spent properly?"
"The arguments in favour of receiving more money do then tend to lose some of their potency, and so I think that the European Court of Auditors has its work cut out."
"I was also surprised to read about item 0.6 of the General Introduction to the Annual Report 2003."
"It states that the increase in outstanding commitments has never been as high."
"By the end of 2003, the commitments amounted to five years’ worth of payments."
"That is incredibly high."
"In other words, we could go on for five years without entering into any new commitments."
"Am I wrong in thinking that this five-year period simply continues to run?"
"I therefore think that a great deal needs to be done."
"It is unacceptable for us not to have a Statement of Assurance over a period of two or three years."
"The Commission must set clear criteria, which the European Court of Auditors must verify, while also indicating to what extent the self-imposed goals have been achieved."
", . Mr President, Commissioner, members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to wish Mr Fabra Vallés well in his further career."
"We have always had a good working relationship and I wanted to say that here."
"I should also like to welcome Commissioner Kallas."
"I gather that this is his first debate in the plenary and I should like to give him a pat on the back straight away by way of encouragement."
"I am delighted that Commissioner Kallas has read the letter by the Committee on Budgetary Control and by individual Members, including Mr Bonde and Mr Van Buitenen, and has, as requested, deferred the dismissal of Martha Andreasen for a while, in order to set aside some time for listening and seeing whether that dismissal is really justified."
"Mr Fabra Vallés, I listened with great interest to your contribution and, like Mr Mulder and many other Members of this House, I have to say that we get the same story every year."
"Errors are being made on a massive scale, as we also noticed following the reading of the OLAF report which was published last week."
"I think that there is, overall, a problem in the follow-up and in that respect, I should like to ask the Court of Auditors specifically to pinpoint legislation and regulations that promote fraud."
"It may be that the Court of Auditors, in conjunction with Parliament, will have to draw up a timeframe for changing legislation of that kind."
"The Commission should then respond to these kinds of questions as a whole."
"Once again, I note that the Council is not present, and in my view, it is a disgrace that, year upon year, one of the two branches of the budgetary authority fails to assess and properly monitor the discharge procedure."
"Similarly, the documents relating to the discharge that we receive from the Council are always embarrassingly insubstantial and do not in fact amount to much."
"I would therefore like to propose that the Council be asked, from now on, when the Court of Auditors has criticisms to make with regard to aspects of policy areas, to have the individual specialist councils respond to them, so that we can ensure that the discharge procedure of giving discharge by mutual agreement runs more adequately."
". Mr President, my comments on the Court of Auditors’ annual report for 2003 regrettably echo my thoughts last year."
"Little has changed: accounts are not signed off and something like 94% of the data are deemed unacceptable, either unsafe or riddled with error."
"More than half the Commission’s directors-general signed their declarations with reservations."
"This is the EU saying ‘I have not got a clue’."
"It all sounds too familiar."
"Well, so it should."
"This has been happening for ten long years."
"In my country any company that submitted one set of unsafe accounts would be dealt with very firmly, but the EU has got away with it – as I have said – for no less than ten years."
"The great tragedy is that this decade-long saga of corruption and mismanagement is funded by the poor old taxpayers."
"There can be no greater testimony to the impotence of this institution than the fact that such a scandal has been allowed to go on for so long."
"Yet Marta Andreasen was sacked for telling the truth and Parliament adopted a resolution requiring the Secretary-General and President of the Committee of the Regions to present their apologies to an internal auditor for the harassment that he had endured, but this was not forthcoming."
"It goes on and on."
"This report attempts to shift the blame for the unholy mess on to the Member States, but we should be under no illusions about where the blame really lies."
"The European Commission is the exclusive custodian of the monies paid into the European Union by the Member States and it alone holds the power to withhold payments if it observes any form of wrongdoing."
"Instead the Commission has simply sat on its hands and looked the other way for ten long years."
"But of course it is not only in this place that people should hold their heads in shame."
"Mr Blair and his colleagues back in Britain should be holding their heads for continuing to pour taxpayers’ money into the European Union at the rate of GBP 1.5 million per hour when they know full well what a mess the whole thing is."
"The British Government has an obligation to spend taxpayers’ money wisely."
"It is singularly failing in this operation."
"Does this situation not bother anybody?"
"It certainly bothers me and it bothers my party."
"We look for some changes in the future."
"Mr President, the Court of Auditors is a charade: the misappropriation of public funds starts with its paymasters, and that is why it is impossible for the Court to be effective."
"The few honest, experienced and professional accountants ever allowed near the heart of the Commission’s treasury function have all spoken out about institutionalised malpractice."
"The accounting system is not secure, changes in the financial records are untraceable, and the new system will be little better."
"The new regulations which are supposed to strengthen controls actually increase the risk of fraud."
"The Court and OLAF focus on problems after public funds leave here, and that takes the heat off the Commission, which is where the real problems lie."
"Why else has the treasury not been subject to an independent audit for more than 14 years?"
"It is a scandal!"
"Mr President, for the tenth year running, as we have heard, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance on the annual accounts of the European Union."
"As Conservatives we believe that this is a deplorable state of affairs and share the views of those who wanted to see the flaws in the financial system fully corrected by now."
"I suspect that in previous years there has been a lack of real priority, even though a Commission was dismissed as a result of some of these problems."
"I welcome Mr Kallas, our new Commissioner, in his first appearance."
"If I remember correctly, he said at his hearing that he will make sure there is zero tolerance in cases of mismanagement and fraud."
"It is not enough simply to pay lip service to that."
"Unlike the previous two speakers, who are here simply to be destructive and critical, we as Conservatives would like to see three priorities over the next five years."
"The first relates to the accounting system."
"We have to recognise that significant failings have occurred, but, as the Commissioner and the President of the Court have said, we have a new system coming in."
"We welcome this important step but we will be monitoring it very carefully to see exactly what it is going to deliver."
"Secondly, on the question of whistleblowers, we have often received information – for example in the case of Eurostat – but the information was not followed up."
"We must have a system that allows people to come forward and say exactly what is going on."
"Last and most important is the question of shared management."
"I and others thank the President of the Court for his excellent work, because he has focused on the real problem that the European Union faces."
"It is not so much a question of fraud and corruption but of being able to know where the monies go: whether it is audit certificates from the Member States or whether it happens to be an internal control system, as the President has suggested."
"We need to be able to ensure that in future we have a positive assessment of the statement of assurance – the DAS."
"We also need to ensure that we bring the Member States into the system and make the national administrations responsible, so that European monies are fully and properly accounted for."
"Mr President, ten years ago I was the rapporteur for the discharge and ten years ago I made the statement that we will never have a positive statement of assurance – DAS."
"I said that because, regardless of the failings within the Commission or whatever was wrong as regards irregularities, we could see quite clearly ten years ago that there were two incompatible systems: the system being used by the Court to do its audit and the system being used by the Commission in the way it functioned."
"Changes have taken place over the last ten years."
"The Court has changed its methodology – it has moved to the four-pillar system – and the Commission has had the Kinnock reforms, but I still remain convinced that, even from 1 January next year with the new financial regulations and the new accounting systems, we will still not see a positive DAS because of the way things are organised."
"I would like to address one comment to Mr Titford."
"In your own country the Department of Social Security has failed to get clearance of its accounts for the last 14 years."
"The American federal budget has failed to get any clearance of its accounts for the last six years."
"This is not a unique organisation and it would have helped, Mr Titford, if you had actually taken part in the hearings we held – all six of them."
"At least Mr Mote turned up on some occasions and put some questions, but then again Mr Mote is an independent UK Independent, not a UK Independent as Mr Titford is."
"But anyway, back to my script."
"What we have is the Commission saying that it uses the clearance of accounts because that is what it says in the financial regulation."
"That is how it controls such things as agricultural expenditure."
"So its attitude is that they can recover the funds – why does the Court of Auditors not include that in the DAS?"
"A point worth making is that when the clearance of accounts is used the money is actually recovered from the Member States."
"It is not recovered from the farmers or receiving organisations, which means that national taxpayers foot the bill for any irregularities or fraud."
"Then the Court says that to recover is good, but we should have a system where you do not need to recover."
"The system should be better."
"Well that is quite understandable."
"So the Commission then says: yes, but to do what the Court actually wants will cost so much money that it simply will not be cost-effective."
"That I can also understand."
"I will be looking at a variety of conclusions from the Committee on Budgetary Control’s six hearings with the Commissioners and the Court."
"It is obvious to anyone that one of the main problems is that of shared management."
"As one of the Members of the Court said in the hearings, it is not a problem of control, it is not a problem of audit, it is a problem of management."
"So I am beginning to think that we need a system which makes the authorising bodies in the Member States responsible for giving assurance on legality and regularity."
"It seems strange that in a shared management system only half of the partnership needs to be responsible."
"That will mean changes to legislation and it will mean the cooperation of the Council and the Member States."
"From the Court’s point of view I have yet to be convinced that two of the four pillars as mentioned by Mr Fabra Vallés are reliable."
"I have real concerns about the amount of transactions inspected and I also question the extent to which other auditors’ work is used."
"We need a regular activity report on the work done with national audits to be sure that the four pillars give a transparent DAS."
"There will also be the perennial request from Parliament that the Court should sectionalise its DAS so that the budgetary authority knows exactly where the problems lie."
"We are in a situation that sees a set of rules from the Court that can never be met by the Commission within reasonable costs no matter what it does, compared with the benefits to be gained."
"I am not trying to bend the rules, I am trying to make them fit."
"I am asking the Court to try to establish a set of rules that can be played by."
"Imagine Barcelona playing Manchester United in the European Cup Final."
"There is a crowd of 70 000 and all eyes are on the pitch and on the players."
"The whole of Europe is looking at this."
"On comes the referee, he walks to the centre spot and he places at the feet of Wayne Rooney not a football, but a rugby ball."
"As the players try to point out the problems that they may have with an oval ball, he says never mind the ball, get on with the game!"
"That, quite frankly, is the attitude that the Court has towards efforts to change the system."
"It is never mind the ball, get on with the game."
"However, let us be clear: this analogy does not mean that the Commission or the Member States should be seen as the elites of public administration."
"I have a final point."
"Thankfully I am on the temporary committee for the new financial perspectives."
"We should not agree a new financial perspective until we have resolved this problem of reliability and accountability from the Member States."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank the Court of Auditors, and, in particular, its President, Mr Fabra Vallés, for its annual report and for presenting it here in this plenary."
"The financial statements show weaknesses in the EU’s administration."
"There are problems in particular with structural measures."
"Last year a total of EUR 8.3 billion remained unspent."
"In the middle of the year, payments were reduced by EUR 5 billion, but all the same the statements still show a figure of EUR 3.1 billion for under-utilisation."
"All in all, the total for unused budgeted payment appropriations for the period 2000-2003 is EUR 34 billion."
"The consequence of this is that outstanding commitments have grown to EUR 69.3 billion, which means that to pay the arrears we will need the equivalent of appropriations for two years in full."
"The administration of structural policy warrants a thorough re-evaluation when the new regulations are drafted."
"Another problem is illicit payments paid out of agricultural expenditure, which between 1971 and last year amounted to EUR 3.1 billion."
"In future we should embark upon a system where unwarranted payments can be directly withheld from aid paid to a Member State the following year and the amount clawed back can remain in that Member State’s account."
"The financial statements and annual auditors’ report that have now been presented are the first to be based on the new Financial Regulation."
"They are therefore very important for the future."
"The statement of assurance contained in the report once again gives cause for concern."
"For the tenth time in succession now the statement is less than wholesome and it does not give any assurance that the Commission’s expenditure with regard to payments is altogether legal and proper."
"This makes it hard to control the situation."
"If the Commission has not gone about its business totally legally and properly, the basic assumption should be that it ought to resign."
"It should have resigned in every one of the last ten years."
"Legality and proper conduct are the basis of all administration."
"Only Mr Santer’s Commission resigned, however, and the reasons for that were more political than legal."
"Any assessment of discharge should be based on what is right, as seen from the human point of view."
"The question arises as to whether the accounts and administration have been attended to in the same way a careful man would attend to his own finances."
"The nature of the errors made is also a decisive factor."
"Is it a question here of a difference of opinion regarding interpretation, carelessness, a clear administrative error or intentional fraud?"
"The statement of assurance gives no clear answer regarding the nature of the errors. Something will have to be done about improving administration and auditing work in the future."
"That is why I agree with the rapporteur for the discharge, Mr Wynn, when he calls for the system to be improved."
"Yesterday Mr Nicolaï, representing the country to hold the Presidency, also agreed with this."
"Mr President, the annual report of the Court of Auditors is a mainly competent and convincing analysis of the European Communities’ accounts."
"As all of us in this House can see, it is however in itself a scandal that this is now the tenth time that the Court of Auditors has not been able to deliver a Statement of Assurance."
"It should be noted that it is not, of course, the Court of Auditors’ job to try to discover fraud and other crimes."
"That is OLAF’s task and, moreover, there are plenty of such scandals throughout the range of EU activities."
"Members of the European Parliament and EU officials talk openly of scandals that have never been made public knowledge or given rise to legal action, despite the fact that many people are well aware of them."
"We find that the Court of Auditors cannot approve transactions concerning agricultural policy, structural policy, aid and pre-accession aid."
"These are far and away the dominant transactions in terms of sums of money, meaning that by far the largest portion of these payments cannot be monitored by citizens."
"This also means that the EU should not go in for paying out money to countries and organisations whose task it then is to spend the money according to the wishes of the EU authorities."
"It will probably never be possible to monitor such an arrangement."
"There really are no reasons for carrying on these activities that cannot be supervised in areas such as agriculture, structural policy and aid."
"There are reasons for helping poor EU countries, but such help should be given by means of non-earmarked transfers."
"Aid to non-EU countries should not be channelled via EU authorities but via UN bodies or else be given directly by the Member States."
"Mr President, anyone who follows this debate without coming to the conclusion that this is the ideal time to consider some fundamental issues must have kept his hands very firmly over his ears."
"As an institution, a Court of Auditors ought always to be one of the public’s closest allies."
"Consider the way the Court of Auditors works these days, and ask yourself whether it can at all be guaranteed that it will be."
"What has been going on over the past few years?"
"Even now, I remember the massive headlines that the Court of Auditors’ report prompted in 1992."
"Today, though, people say it is all ‘just the same old thing again’."
"Does our making appointments to 25 important positions within the Court of Auditors represent progress for it or for the European Union, and, if so, what qualitative improvements are there going to be?"
"What I expect of you, Mr Fabra Vallés, is that you now think about what you are doing in the light of what has been said so far, and then I expect us to get stuck in to this debate on matters of principle."
"Mr President, when I say that the Court of Auditors’ Annual Report is a sound tool for Parliament, that is also a compliment to its outgoing President."
"Before I go into the report in more detail, though, I have two political comments to make."
"Both the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have commented on agricultural policy."
"I will not deny that things may go wrong from time to time where payments are concerned, but it could never be the intention that the industry should suffer when the Commission or a Member State fails to do things properly and according to the rules."
"The way it is implemented can never be a reason for re-opening an attack on European agricultural policy with its high standards on food safety, the environment and animal welfare."
"I should like to home in on one specific point in the report, namely the EU’s animal disease policy."
"The Court of Auditors is right in saying that the abolition of the non-vaccination policy in the early 90s was based on assumptions."
"Those assumptions have changed dramatically."
"The number of slaughterhouses has fallen drastically and the number of cattle transported has grown exponentially."
"As far back as 1998, the FAO warned the Commission of the implications of this and of the possible spread of animal diseases."
"I notice that the Commission has done virtually nothing with these warnings."
"Under pressure from the interim FMD committee, legislation in the field of FMD was changed to some extent, but still not in compliance with the recommendations of the FAO or the OIE – the International Office for infectious animal diseases."
"This is where a far more dynamic approach on the part of the Commission really would do justice to the Court of Auditors’ report."
"There are three things that the Commission should tackle."
"First of all, it needs to ensure that the non-vaccination policy is reviewed and that vaccination becomes the norm, which is also laid down worldwide in line with the OIE’s requirements."
"Secondly, it has to be implemented in a uniform way in each Member State."
"Thirdly, the whole to-do about European regulations, including with regard to the payment of slaughter premiums, should never again stand in the way of this policy’s implementation."
"Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my congratulations to the Court of Auditors on this report."
"Their reports in the past have been more feeble than this one, which I regard as an important and good one, particularly as we are about to negotiate a Financial Perspective."
"The Commission bears a great deal of responsibility in this respect."
"It is simply not on that we should end up getting stick from the finance ministers of those very countries that are not implementing the Structural Funds, when we have been shovelling over EUR 100 billion in that direction in particular."
"This, Commissioner, is where we have to change the objectives for the Financial Perspective."
"The same is the case when we see, yet again, where the major shortcomings and the frauds are to be found."
"Here I am thinking of the whole area of export refunds for agricultural produce."
"The ball is now in the Commission’s court."
"For as long as we have policies like this in the European Union, we will carry on seeing headlines slating European policy."
"The lesson this report can teach us is that these policies need to be abandoned."
"A further point to which I would like to draw attention is the fact that we set up pre-accession aid for the ten new Member States."
"Until these countries acceded, we were seeing 15% of it taken up."
"Today I have heard from the Commissioner with responsibility for SAPARD that funds are flowing out of it at a marvellous rate, even though it is an instrument for use before accession rather than after it."
"There will be more enlargements; indeed, they are already imminent."
"Let us learn a lesson from this one."
"This is the Commission’s responsibility, and this is where things can be speeded up a bit."
"If they are, this report will turn out to be a great success."
"The people at the Court of Auditors are not historians, nor are we in this House."
"We want to draw positive conclusions from the points of criticism made by the Court of Auditors."
"Mr President, as it does every year, the European Court of Auditors emphasises the serious problems, the manifest errors and the instances of fraud where management of the Budget is concerned, particularly in the areas of the common agricultural policy and of the Structural Funds."
"Each year, the European Parliament and the Member States take note of these factors, and nothing changes."
"Nothing changes because Europe has become a huge bureaucratic machine in which no one is really responsible any longer, a conclusion also reached through the analysis in the Independent Experts’ Report that led to the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999."
"What is more, OLAF has neither the means nor the will to monitor proper use of Community funds, and the Member States tend to protect nationals of theirs who are suspected of fraud."
"In short, it is time that the Member States, which are the main contributors to the Community Budget, monitored the funds appropriated to them and checked that they were being properly administered, severely penalising offenders including those guilty of fraud."
"Otherwise, we shall receive the same report from the Court of Auditors every year, denouncing the same evils, but to absolutely no practical effect."
"I address you today as a delegate from a country, which, owing to its historic experience, is unequivocally committed to the project of a joint Europe."
"After the Second World War, Churchill, when talking about Eastern Europe, made the comment on the Eastern European countries – exactly those who have just rejoined Europe – that they had been swallowed by The Soviet Union and after the meal comes the digestion period."
"Let me reconsider this thought of digestion, namely the so-called pre-accession funds, that allow these states to participate in European processes as soon and as efficiently as possible."
"Let me point out that the Court of Auditors’ report is very sincere regarding pre-accession funds."
"Its examination method is clear, and therefore indicative of the future as well, as it can be used to examine the same funds in later years."
"Its observations are correct, and as my colleague, Mr Bösch said, the pre-accession funds provided very little if any help at all to the ten new Member States."
"For example, three years after the establishment of the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development, 14.8% of the funds had been allocated."
"The report also observed that the authorities of the candidate countries overcomplicated conditions for these funds."
"In conclusion, the Court of Auditors are helping political decision-making and the feedback process with its report."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés today for this three years as President of the Court of Auditors, for the consolidated professionalism of the Court, the invigoration of its activities and the credibility of its reports and opinions, which are so useful and fundamental to the work of the European Parliament and of its Members."
"Nevertheless, as a new Member of Parliament, I must express my disappointment and consternation, because this year once again – and listening to the honourable Members who have been here much longer, their disappointment is even greater – the presentation of the annual report is a frustrating exercise; all the efforts and progress made by the various institutions, and ultimately by the Commission at the request of the European Parliament, are still not enough to achieve a positive statement of assurance."
"There have been more reservations than progress, and the citizens are still receiving bad news about irregularities and unsatisfactory situations."
"I also believe that ten years is a long time, enough time, and that at this time when we are beginning the negotiation of new financial perspectives, in an enlarged Europe of 25, which is soon to be 27, it is extremely urgent that we reach a compromise amongst the institutions, so that shared responsibilities can finally be clarified and we can thereby prevent the increasing danger of renationalisation, those sirens’ songs from people who, discouraged by the annual bad news about the accounts, believe the solution is to reduce the Union’s budgets and return to less Community formulae, with less solidarity and less cohesion."
"I find it unacceptable, ladies and gentlemen, to see Eurosceptics and renationalisers exploiting the report of the Court of Auditors and our inability to achieve a positive statement of assurance to attack the very heart of the European Union, its economic and social cohesion and its future policies."
"I would, therefore, appeal to the Commission – to Mr Kallas, who on this first day has shown great will – and to the Court of Auditors – to Mr Fabra Vallés, with his experience – to ensure that we find an innovative route, a firm institutional commitment with the European Parliament – naturally – which leads us to a positive statement which provides the European citizens with the guarantee that their contribution to European integration is properly planned and properly spent and contributes to the added value we all seek."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés and the Court of Auditors."
"As a new MEP, I have to say that the report made very exciting reading."
"Even though the language of the Court of Auditors is polite, the criticism is devastating."
"I am amazed that the inadequacies were so great, and I think that ten years without a positive auditors’ report is unambiguous in its implications."
"For me, the most notable inadequacies probably lie in what is most fundamental, specifically the accounting system."
"We cannot accept anything less than that these problems be tackled without delay."
"I should like right now, however, to focus upon something really quite different."
"In recent days, two important issues have been debated here in plenary: this auditors’ report and the issue of the EU’s financial perspectives."
"I think it is high time that these two issues were linked together."
"The auditors’ report contains important and fundamental criticism of which account must be taken in planning for the future."
"Having read the report, it is obvious that, in many areas, the EU does not have the opportunity to spend allocated money in a sensible way; yet, despite this, most people appear to argue in favour of more money."
"In the same way, the Court of Auditors shows that limited use is made of EU money in many areas; nonetheless, it is in precisely those areas that many wish to invest more money."
"In those areas in which there is a great need for reforms and in which there are many problems, the latter are not solved through our appropriating more money."
"For precisely that reason, I should really like to address not merely the Commission but, specifically, the Members of this House and others, and call upon all those who wish seriously to debate the issue of the financial perspectives, or the EU’s economic future, actually to read this auditors’ report and to take its contents very seriously indeed."
"There is a very great deal that is of fundamental importance in the report and that will pass the EU by if no account is taken of it."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to praise the work carried out by the Court of Auditors over the past few years and to mention, in particular, that its annual report for 2003 states that the services of the Commission, and in particular OLAF, did not follow up various cases of fraud involving the Community’s agriculture budget."
"This is indeed the most worrying aspect of this situation, all the more so given that the most significant case that we debated in this House during the last legislature was that of , which began in October 1999 when OLAF was alerted by the Italian police to fraud, the cost of which to the Community budget was put by the Italian police at EUR 100 million."
"It was with the greatest surprise that I heard this newly installed Commission say in November 2004 that there was no firm allegation of any loss to the Community budget."
"This is utterly incredible and demonstrates the seriousness of this unresolved problem of large-scale fraud in the large-scale food industry in Europe, as I have said countless times in this House."
"It is this problem, more than any minor formal irregularity, to which I should like to draw the attention of this House, of the Commission and, especially, of Mr Kallas, who is attending this debate with us."
"Mr President, yet again we are presented with a Court of Auditors’ report that questions the reliability of the Commission’s accounting practices and the accounts themselves for the tenth year in a row."
"The Court indicates that nearly 95% of the EU budget has serious problems with regard to accountability and effective spending."
"Two years ago Marta Andreasen, the Commission’s chief accountant, raised many problems regarding the EU’s accounts."
"Instead of listening to her and acting on her advice, the Commission briefed against her, suspended her from her job and then, two weeks before the old Commission retired, fired her."
"People in Europe are sceptical about many EU issues but their biggest worry is the fact that the European Union is unable to have properly signed-off, audited accounts."
"This situation cannot continue, because it will bring the European Union into more and more disrepute."
"It is imperative that the new Commission act immediately to restore the confidence of the general public."
"As a member of Parliament’s Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I now wish to focus on the Court’s special report on the 2001 crisis."
"The Court’s report points out the UK Government’s many failures during FMD."
"There were no provisions to handle a serious outbreak of disease and there were no proper financial controls to manage the outbreak."
"The Court also identified many major problems over animal movements."
"The three-day delay by the government in banning animal movements allowed the disease to spread rapidly, resulting in double the number of animals being slaughtered."
"The lack of financial control by the UK Government resulted in the EU Commission disqualifying nearly two thirds of Britain’s claim and some GBP 948 million of emergency EU funds."
"This has led to the UK taxpayer losing some GBP 600 million."
"The Court of Auditors’ special report on foot and mouth has highlighted yet again the need for a full public inquiry to be held in the United Kingdom into the FMD outbreak of 2001."
"– The debate is closed."
"– The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Colombia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that Colombia matters to us, being a country in which a number of the European Union’s interests are involved, ranging from trade and investment to such issues as the production of and trade in drugs, criminal networks, terrorism, migratory flows and the regional dimension of the conflict that is going on there."
"More than anything else, though, values that we share with our Colombian friends are involved, such as respect for human rights, the rule of law and also the alleviation of poverty and sustainable economic development."
"So I thank you for affording me the opportunity to set out my assessment of the situation in Colombia and the policies that we want to adopt with respect to it."
"I will be discussing the strategic objective of our actions and the fundamental principles and instruments that underpin them, which we are applying with this objective in mind."
"The ongoing grave violations of human rights and the fact that the security situation is still very difficult for many Colombians naturally cause us grave disquiet and demand our full solidarity, above all with the Colombian people."
"Our strategic objective is, then, the achievement of lasting peace and support for the Colombians to that end."
"Our strategy as a whole with regard to Colombia has the quest for a peaceful solution as its cornerstone."
"To this conflict there will be no purely military solution, and so it is important that we seek ways of coming to peaceful agreement even with illegally armed groupings, provided that they are willing to enter into real negotiations towards a peace treaty."
"In this light, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, particularly in regard to his dealings with the illegal armed groups in Colombia."
"The current involvement of the Organisation of American States in the ‘Mission of support for the peace process in Colombia’and the Mexican Government’s mediation between the Colombian Government and the both represent very valuable contributions."
"All the illegal armed groups must put an end to hostilities; they have also been required to demonstrate their willingness to at last embark on the peace process by immediately and unconditionally releasing all hostages and all other persons held by them."
"We in the European Union must consider how we can provide funding to support the peace negotiations as soon as a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the armed groups is in place."
"We are convinced that Colombia’s vibrant civil society, too, plays a vital part in these peace negotiations by engaging in ongoing dialogue with the Colombian Government and with the international community."
"Our aim in the shorter term is to secure compliance with the undertakings given at the 2003 London Conference by the international community and the Colombian Government."
"While we must hold to our commitments as regards financial aid, the Colombian Government must also abide by those it has made, particularly those relating to respect for human rights, which it made to the United Nations High Commissioner responsible for these matters."
"The meeting called by the Colombian Government for 3 and 4 February 2005 will present a very good opportunity both to reiterate the international community’s solidarity with the Colombian people and to issue a reminder regarding the undertakings that have been given."
"Our strategy with regard to Colombia is based, then, on three fundamental principles: firstly the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which goes hand in hand with monitoring of the human rights situation."
"The second is that of good governance, which involves our giving support to the Colombian Government, particularly in its efforts to build up the rule of law."
"Thirdly, of course, there is sustainable development, especially the development of social cohesion, which was also discussed at the May summit in Guadalajara."
"The European Union and the Commission are deploying all the foreign policy instruments available to them in order to achieve these objectives."
"One of these is that of active diplomacy, whereby we support the international peace process."
"Another important instrument is the extremely favourable trade arrangements for Colombian exports, by which I mean the proposal we have put forward for the General System of Preferences, which will enable trade preferences for Colombia’s exports to be maintained, and which also of course benefits sustainable economic development."
"The third instrument is development aid."
"Consideration of Community aid as such, whereby the EU Member States provide bilateral aid, reveals that the Commission really has discharged its obligations."
"I believe we can take pride in having in fact done more than we undertook to do."
"At the end of the current programming period, we will be able to go further, and, at the 2001 donors’ conference, we announced EUR 140 million for Colombia for the 2001 – 2006 period, the largest sum that we spend on any one country in Latin America."
"By the end of 2003 we had already committed EUR 136 million, and I am persuaded that we will, between 2004 and 2006, have allocated all these amounts, which are in fact substantially in excess of what had been promised."
"There are a number of priorities that we seek to achieve by means of this Community aid, which is administered by Colombia itself. One is the strengthening of institutions, especially in the justice system and where the rule of law is concerned;this is very important."
"Secondly, we seek to support the peace process through what are termed ‘peace laboratories’, which are comprehensive programmes for integrated local development, intended primarily to complement peace initiatives at the local level. Finally, as I have already said, we seek to defend human rights and provide humanitarian aid, particularly for the victims of expulsions."
"It is thanks to the reforms to the administration of Community aid set in motion by my predecessor Chris Patten that net payments have increased to an enormous degree, reaching almost EUR 30 million as early as 2003."
"I have attempted to set out what underlies a good policy for Colombia."
"I believe that we must continue down this road, and you can rely on the Commission to do so in future too."
". Mr President, it is clear that the human rights situation in Colombia is far from perfect, and it is also clear that the European Parliament must contribute to the cause of peace and to promoting human rights and the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"These recommendations are often addressed not just to the Colombian Government, but also to the armed parties, such as the paramilitaries, the FARC and the ELN; organisations which appear on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations."
"It is in fact the FARC who have been responsible for more than 6 000 kidnaps and more than 300 murders over recent years and also for anti-personnel mines, which regrettably kill an average of two people every day in Colombia, of which 40% are civilians; and of that 40%, half are children."
"President Uribe has implemented a democratic security policy which has promoted a whole series of improvements."
"Over recent years, there has been a 26% reduction in kidnaps, and the murder rate is the lowest for 18 years, but very many mayors are being threatened."
"We must not forget that President Uribe has been one of the few Heads of State to come to this Parliament, to appear in plenary and who, furthermore, has appeared before the committee in order hold a frank dialogue with Members on the human rights situation in his country."
"This dialogue has been continued by the Vice-President, who comes every year to speak with non-governmental organisations and to inform them of the progress being made by the Government in this field."
"Mr President, I would like to say that only through ignorance and bad faith could we fail to recognise the progress made over recent years as a result of the Colombian Government’s policy."
"It is clear that our Parliament must support the cause of human rights, that the Government can and must do more, but it is also clear that the perpetrators of extortion, of murder, of blackmail and those who are producing the victims are the terrorist organisations – the FARC and the ELN – and we must be relentless in our pursuit of these organisations, who are the real perpetrators of wilful violations of human rights in that country."
". Mr President, I am very pleased that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is currently here on behalf of the Commission."
"Parliament had an excellent relationship with Mrs Ferrero-Waldner when she was President-in-Office of the Council, and I am sure that will be maintained over the next five years."
"I am also very impressed with her presentation of the situation in Colombia."
"Colombia is probably one of the most visually stunning countries in the whole world, a beautiful country with fantastic wealth and wonderful people who are friendly and charming."
"Having said that, Colombia does have a problem: institutionalised violence."
"Consequently, even if we put an end to guerrilla activities and drug-trafficking, violence would still re-emerge unless we resolve these problems."
"I believe that the Commissioner has given us a clear, objective, detailed and very constructive approach."
"It is not a case of addressing just one of the problems. Clearly there can be no peace if the violence continues, but equally there can be no peace unless we solve the underlying problems."
"I believe that the Commissioner has indicated the best path to follow, since it addresses all elements: human rights, security, development and, above all, social progress."
"Any government policy would need to include all these elements, and the Commission and European Union as a whole should enable the Colombian authorities and any other influential organisation to help the country move forward."
"Unquestionably, terrorist and guerrilla organisations have committed acts of terrorism, but let us not forget that many left-wing trade union leaders in Colombia have been assassinated by paramilitary organisations. Often we do not know whether these organisations are linked to the government."
"I therefore feel that the Commissioner’s approach is the right one, and we should work to implement that approach so as to assist the Colombian people."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how do we stand in terms of promoting peace in Colombia?"
"The previous legislature had criticised what was known as the ‘Colombia Plan’ and had proposed far-reaching social reforms."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament had declared themselves ready to play the role of facilitators in the negotiations, initiated by President Pastrana, between the government and the guerrillas."
"The obstacles faced by this declaration were, firstly, the abandonment of this policy by the Colombian authorities and, secondly, the FARC’s scandalous practice of taking hostages, illustrated by the case of Ingrid Betancourt."
"The field has therefore been abandoned to the extremists on both sides: on the one hand, the FARC and, on the other hand, President Uribe’s administration which, by proposing to put civilians into uniform and to accord immunity and funding to the paramilitaries, has dangerously jeopardised the constitutional state."
"What, then, is to be done?"
"There is only one solution left to us: to support civil society’s efforts to promote peace, as expressed for example through the Civil Society Permanent Assembly for Peace."
"The Assembly now proposes a broad humanitarian agreement involving, for example, exchanges of prisoners but, above all, respect by the two sides for international humanitarian law."
"From this point of view, I approve the statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"We call upon the Colombian Government to respect the constitutional state and humanitarian law."
"We expect the guerrillas to release the hostages as a sign of their desire to return to the negotiating table."
"We shall fund the peace laboratories and the support for civil society in Colombia. The best way in which Europe can help promote peace in Colombia is to support initiatives of this type and the local authorities in Colombia that follow these up."
". – Mr President, although I partly welcome what the Commissioner has said in this Chamber, I believe the various issues need to be examined more carefully."
"The first issue, as far as Colombia is concerned, is the policy begun by President Uribe."
"Only a few months ago, a respected US weekly, , put a photograph of the Colombian president on its cover and claimed that when President Alvaro Uribe was at the US Defence Department in 1991, before he was president, he had links with the Medellín drug cartel and was a friend of Pablo Escobar."
"As if that were not enough, President Uribe’s policy in recent years has consisted exclusively in encouraging the paramilitary forces, so much so that a few months ago he invited the paramilitary leaders to Parliament, demonstrating that he is only prepared to talk to one side in this war."
"Even the relatives of Ingrid Betancourt have claimed that it is President Uribe who is opposed to any humanitarian exchange."
"In recent years the national security policy has focused on arbitrary mass detentions, the criminalisation of social conflict, massacres of trade unionists and violations of human rights."
"We believe that the European Union should not declare its neutrality in this context but should rather encourage the search for a political solution to the conflict and the cessation of military hostilities, which President Uribe is currently promoting."
"We should make every effort to achieve compliance with the London Declaration of July 2003 and the recommendation made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in March 1994: let us remember that it is in fact the Colombian Government that has failed to keep to the agreements."
"Lastly, with regard to international and European cooperation, it should be noted that peace laboratory funds all too often end up in areas totally controlled by the paramilitaries."
"I believe the Commission and the Council should bear this in mind to a greater extent."
"Mr President, regrettably terrorists from Northern Ireland have helped destabilise Colombia."
"In 2001 a top IRA bomb-maker called Monaghan and two others were captured in Colombia while imparting terrorist expertise to the drug-funded Marxist guerrillas of FARC."
"Their mission on that occasion was to perfect a fuel airbomb with specialist equipment provided by the IRA."
"In two earlier visits organised by Sinn Féin's representative in Cuba, the IRA had already passed on to FARC its skill in making car bombs and mortars."
"Car bombs and mortars identical to those used by the IRA have since been used regularly by FARC."
"In return for its deadly expertise, Sinn Féin-IRA received six million dollars and the people of Colombia received mass murder and destruction."
"Finally, for me the Colombia adventure illustrates just how far Sinn Féin has to travel before it could be considered fit for government in any part of Ireland."
"Mr President, Álvaro Uribe was elected two and a half years ago."
"In that time, nothing has been easy, but the vast majority of Colombians – the vast majority, according to the figures – consider that the situation in the country is now better than it was two years ago."
"So it is no surprise that support for the Uribe administration is now greater than when he was elected, with a programme whose main objectives are to combat terrorism and bring peace to the country."
"Some of the figures are encouraging."
"Public order has improved, although Colombia remains an insecure country."
"The number of terrorist attacks and hostage-takings has fallen, although attacks and hostage-taking still happen in Colombia."
"Drug production and exports have decreased, although Colombia is still a leading player in international drug-trafficking."
"Whatever people say, there has been no serious decline in human rights in Colombia."
"It is the terrorists who take hostages and demand money who are contravening human rights and international humanitarian laws: not those who refuse to give in to the hostage-takers’ blackmail."
"Nothing has been easy and a lot remains to be done."
"At the moment, in the midst of controversy, the Colombian Government is trying to advance negotiations with the AUC paramilitaries."
"In view of the acknowledged difficulties of this process, the European Union should take a much more active role by exerting pressure on the parties involved and ensuring that victims’ rights are respected."
"We work closely with Colombia, but we can do more at this particularly sensitive time, by supporting the Organization of American States with its broad and clear mandate in Colombia."
"This includes financing programmes to monitor the ceasefire, to provide legal assistance for the victims and socio-economic projects for demobilised guerrillas and their victims, facilitating the reintegration of combatants and creating mechanisms to prevent revenge killings."
"Indeed, a great deal remains to be done, and we in the European Union should and can help."
"Commissioner, we cannot stay on the sidelines in this particularly sensitive period for reasons of political correctness."
"– Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her report even though I believe we need to find the courage to establish some figures that tell us what is really happening in Colombia."
"I direct this particularly to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who accuses anyone who does not acknowledge that Colombia has made progress in respect for and quality of human rights in recent years of bad faith."
"I should like to recall something that Amnesty International wrote only a few months ago, when it pointed out that Colombia is the country where trade unionists run a greater risk than anywhere else in the world: 500 have been killed in the last four years."
"The High Commissioner for Refugees reminds us that there are three million displaced persons inside the country and that 300 000 people have been forced to flee abroad."
"In this war of everybody against everybody else – I repeat: everybody against everybody else – everybody is to blame, including the guerrilla groups, of course, but also the armed forces, who in collaboration with the paramilitary groups – I am just saying what the international human rights agencies have told us – are directly involved in the killings, the torture and the intimidation carried out against human rights workers, trade unionists and local community leaders, who are summarily labelled as guerrillas or sympathisers."
"The government’s strategy in this situation seems dangerously short-sighted."
"An agreement has been reached only with the paramilitaries: the agreement – forgive and forget."
"New paramilitary groups have been formed: 150 000 peasant soldiers under direct army and police control."
"We believe a less short-sighted approach is needed in addressing the problem of Colombia and that we should also consider what has happened in recent years to the : USD 500 000 has gone straight into the pockets of a raft of US contractors."
"The , Mr President, has been excellent business for a large number of US companies but much less so for Colombia, which continues to be torn apart by repression and war."
"I shall conclude by asking the Commissioner, Parliament and our institutions to take a very careful and objective approach when giving support to the peace process in Colombia: in this process and in these negotiations the country cannot do without the involvement of all sides in the conflict – all sides, not just the paramilitaries."
"Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, there is no doubt that after forty years of armed conflict, Colombia is still seriously lacking in peace and social justice."
"Nevertheless, the Uribe Government is still advocating an essentially military approach, whilst at the same time refusing to recognise the existence of an armed conflict with political roots."
"The European Union can do much more to promote peace in Colombia."
"First of all, the European Union can demand that the Colombian Government comply with the annual recommendations on human rights issued by the Union’s Office in Bogota, as a precondition for Community aid."
"Secondly, European Union aid should be used to put an end to paramilitarism, which entails going far beyond simple disarmament, and going on to tackle the political and social elements underlying that paramilitarism."
"Thirdly, the European Union must clearly support and facilitate exploratory talks, political negotiations, and peace treaties between all parties, including the ELN and FARC. This, in turn, demands a response from those same stakeholders, such as freeing the thousands of hostages."
"Fourthly, the European Union must also promote humanitarian agreements in the spirit of the Geneva Convention, as proposed by the Permanent Assembly of Civil Society."
"– Mr President, we express our solidarity with the people of Colombia and with everyone fighting against the barbaric Uribe regime, which has financial, political and military support from the United States of America and which, using the army and paramilitary organisations, is murdering trade unionists and sowing violence and terror among the people of Columbia."
"This policy is being used to serve the interests of the oligarchy of Columbia, while the situation of the people is deteriorating constantly."
"Political parties, trade union organisations of workers, farmers, intellectual women, young people and the church and resistance movements are fighting against this regime."
"The conflict in Columbia is therefore political, economic and social, and anyone putting forward arguments about terrorism and all the rest is seeking to conceal the political problem and give this barbaric regime an alibi."
"If there is to be conciliation in Columbia, a political solution needs to be found and it can only be found through negotiations which require:"
"One: the creation of conditions of security, so that all sides can sit around the negotiating table."
"Two: FARC needs to be removed from the list of terrorist organisations."
"Besides, the regime itself recognises that it is a political/military organisation."
"Three: a first step could be to apply international humanitarian law, with the exchange of prisoners and detainees by the regime."
"This position is accepted by everyone except the government."
"Four: no detainees should be extradited to the United States of America."
"Five: social life and action should be decriminalised and anyone charged with political crimes by the army or the police should be punished."
"Six: assistance and support for paramilitary organisations should cease."
"Seven: all interference in the internal affairs of Colombia by the United States of America should stop."
"The 'Colombia' plan, renamed the 'Andean Regional Initiative', which prepares for general intervention in Colombia, should be denounced."
"These positions are accepted by everyone except the barbaric Uribe Government and the United States of America."
"Mr President, sadly the reality in Colombia is that terrorism is fed by hostage-taking and blackmail."
"Probably many people are unaware, or do not want to know, that in addition to the former presidential candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, over 3 000 Colombians are currently being held hostage by guerrillas in shocking, inhuman conditions in the jungle."
"I question whether this is the best way to fight for social justice."
"Not long ago, various MEPs from the previous Parliament welcomed President Uribe by leaving the Chamber in protest at the lack of democracy in Colombia."
"They were probably unaware – or did not want to know – that Mr Uribe had just won outright in the first round of the presidential elections: a feat unprecedented in Colombia’s history."
"Many people may also be unaware, or choose not to know, that the FARC, ELN and AUC are organisations which appear on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations."
"Ignorance can be the only reason why an NGO from an EU Member State has just committed the crime of financing a terrorist organisation by providing USD 8 500 to the FARC."
"The Uribe Government has begun dialogue with those paramilitary forces who are willing to disarm, with the only demand being that they lay down their weapons. The government has been criticised a great deal for doing so."
"The case of the FARC is different, however."
"Whilst they refuse to disarm, negotiations are not an option, and also whilst their ‘cleared area’ is not recognised: an area in which they continue to commit crimes."
"Let us not forget that five years ago President Pastrana sought to negotiate; but there was never any social support for the FARC, in a society weighed down by pain and the blood of loved ones."
"In the mean time, via one of the most well-known NGOs, one part of the international community is committed to criticising the country’s legitimate democratic government. This influences and even sways many of us."
"Lastly, I would like to remind you of Spain’s history."
"We only began to defeat the terrorism operating in Spain when the European Union started to treat it as something that had implications for all Europeans."
"The same applies in the case of Colombia."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to mention the role of Parliament and thank it for the efforts it made to guarantee the Peace II Programme for Northern Ireland, which was negotiated with the Council through conciliation in the last few days."
"The European Union and indeed this Parliament are playing an important role in guaranteeing peace in parts of Europe."
"It has been said that 500 trade unionists have been murdered over the last four years."
"Two hundred and fifty of those have been killed since President Uribe was elected as president, fifty of them in the last nine months."
"If we are going to deal with this situation in a serious way we have to insist that the Colombian Government act as all governments are expected to act: within the law – not just national law, but international law."
"There is clearly a failure on the part of President Uribe and his government to do that."
"I am concerned that the Commission is now talking about no ‘purely military’ solution, having talked previously about no solution without a negotiated settlement."
"I presume that is still the position."
"It worries me that it says ‘no purely military solution’."
"If we are going to accept that the Colombian Government has a right to use military force in certain circumstances, we have to insist that it act within the rule of law, particularly within the rule of international law, that human rights be protected and that trade unionists in particular be able to operate free from the threat of assassination."
"Mr President, I asked for the floor on the basis of Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure on personal comments."
"In my intervention, I said that the FARC guerrillas had taken 6 000 people hostage over the last few years: politicians, civilians, and soldiers, many of whom are sick, are being held hostage in the jungle in sub-human conditions and experiencing great suffering and deprivation."
"I said that the FARC guerrillas were holding a lot of hostages and I am in a good position to know this, because when President Pastrana sat down to negotiate, I met Mr Marulanda together with other MEPs to appeal for the release of certain European Union hostages."
"I am sure everyone is aware of these facts, and my comment was that ignorance and bad faith would be the only reasons for not taking these facts into account."
"Mr President, in my speech, I called on the government to assume its responsibilities, saying it could do more, and better, even though it has already done a great deal."
"This in turn would shift the burden of proof back onto those who are demanding ransoms, taking hostages and blackmailing Colombian society."
"– I should like to thank the speakers and the Commissioner for participating in this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
". Whilst historic and hopeful changes are taking place in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and in various other places in that continent and around the world, the situation in Colombia, by contrast, is becoming increasingly violently reactionary."
"The connection between institutions operating under a cloak of democracy, paramilitary organisations and supergrasses – informers – has created and strengthened a repressive and violent network."
"All manner of ploys are used."
"The pretexts of terrorism and drug trafficking are used to attack the people’s movement and to demolish areas that are suspected of being areas of the resistance, or areas supporting the resistance, to fascist infiltration."
"At the heart of this struggle, in which Colombia is a leading player, are the social question and the country’s location."
"Progressive labour legislation has in recent years been subject to brutal attacks; being at the forefront of the social struggle, the Communists have borne the brunt of those attacks; one military operation has followed another without success; developments in neighbouring countries have meant that the task of policing and making the region a buffer has taken on greater urgency."
"When so much is said by so many people about human rights, we should be paying much closer attention to the issue of Colombia, with condemnation, solidarity and combat, rather than the meddling, the military activity and the intervention with which the USA is always threatening the region, under the moniker of ‘The Colombia Plan’."
"Mr President, in accordance with Rule 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask, on my group’s behalf, for the vote to be postponed and the matter referred back to committee."
"The reason for this lies in Rule 35 of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns verification of the legal basis."
"Article 18.3 of the Treaty specifically exempts passports and residence permits from the EU’s areas of competence."
"The proposed legal basis in Article 62 refers to standards and procedures Member States carry out checks, but not to competence in respect of passports."
"I request a referral back to committee so that the Committee on Legal Affairs is given the opportunity to express its opinion on the legal basis for both this report and the report on residence permits that will be debated during the next part-session."
"We also demand an addition to the legal service’s opinion, since they themselves admit in paragraph 50 that they do not have sufficient competence to judge whether all the measures come within the framework for the legal basis."
"What is more, the American Court of Auditors has written a report that sheds light upon the costs and the problems associated with biometric data, so I also question the effectiveness of the measure as such and wonder whether the Council has sufficiently investigated these matters."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion as rapporteur, and in the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, there is no problem with the legal basis."
"There is, however, a political question, which is simply this: is Parliament in a position to notify the Council of its opinion on this subject?"
"As far as we are concerned, what Parliament should say to the Council today is that, whilst we are in favour of strengthening passport and travel document security, we are also in favour of retaining strict clauses aimed at protecting personal data."
"This is what is in the report adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and this is also what I call on all Members of this House to adopt today."
"– Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should simply like to provide some information."
"I am therefore expressing an opinion neither in favour nor against, although I personally am in agreement with the rapporteur."
"I wanted to point out that, if we were not to vote in favour of this report today, the Council would note Parliament’s lack of competence and would quite simply take the decision itself."
"Believing as I do that this is of relevance to the House, I was keen to point this out."
"Mr President, I should like to comment briefly on two aspects, one relating to stylistic matters and the other to legal matters, and both concerning the first two lines of paragraph 11."
"I should like to read out these first two lines in the original English version, and then explain which changes I am proposing."
"The lines read as follows: ‘Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States in the event of the satisfactory outcome of the present situation to speed up the ratification of the Action Plan for Ukraine’."
"I propose that the word ‘event’ in the first line be replaced by the word ‘anticipation’, and that the word ‘ratification’ in the second line be replaced by the word ‘adoption’."
"After these amendments, the two lines would read as follows:"
"‘calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States, in the event of a satisfactory outcome of the present situation, to speed up the ratification of the action plan for Ukraine,’"
"Mr President, there is some confusion here."
"It is actually the group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that tabled this oral amendment in accordance with Rule 4."
"I shall read it out in English."
"‘Calls on the government to refrain from exerting any pressure on the media, especially public media, so that the Ukrainian people receive objective and impartial information on the candidates and on the current political situation in the country’"
"Mr President, those of our fellow-Members who are currently with the delegation in Kiev simply asked for the deletion of Recital M, which reads:"
"‘Whereas announcements were made on 29 November by President Leonid Kuchma that he would support a new election,’"
"That is the only amendment to be moved orally."
"Everything else is already on the table."
"(1)"
"(2)"
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Mulderbecause I feel that Structural Funds payments to Member States must be made as promptly as possible."
"Given the reality of budgetary execution, the need for the amendment before us is clear and therefore justified."
". The present amending budget, part of the Budgetary Conciliation of 25 November, provides for a EUR 3.7 million increase in payment appropriations for the Structural Funds, of which EUR 500 million covers additional own resources."
"We therefore voted in favour."
"This goes to show that we were right. One year ago, we said that the level of appropriations for the Structural Funds was insufficient and that the Council’s obsession – with Parliament’s approval – with cutting appropriations, due to the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, would lead to an increase in the gap between authorisations and appropriations and would lead to problems in implementing the budget."
"One expects that requests by the Member States in this area will increase in the final years of the current financial framework."
"All of the foundations must therefore be laid for the Structural Funds to be implemented in full, which is incompatible with Parliament’s acceptance of a level of payments for 2005 limited to 1% of Community GNI."
"A further concern is the increased risk of cancelling authorisations on account of the application of the N+2 rule. This concern also led to the request to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Gauzès (A6-0039/2004) on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (San Marino)."
"The agreement that has been concluded will enable the adoption of measures equivalent to those to be applied by the EU to tax effectively savings income in the form of payments made in one State and intended for recipients residing in another State."
"This instrument should permit effective taxation, which is necessary to combat damaging tax competition and help improve the functioning of the single market."
"We appreciate the efforts made by the Republic of San Marino to establish fiscal transparency and genuine judicial cooperation, which enable fraud and money laundering to be combated."
"It should be pointed out, nonetheless, that the Republic of San Marino, which has chosen to base part of its prosperity on the development of financial services, must continue to respect the rules of the game and increase its cooperation in the fight against money laundering."
". We are aware of the pressure to award tax sovereignty – the ability to raise taxes – to the EU and we are firmly opposed to this, because sovereignty in this area is an essential element of a country’s sovereignty."
"We are similarly aware of the dangers of progressive tax harmonisation, the aim of which is gradually to move along the path towards a federal Europe."
"We would never oppose, however, greater tax coordination aimed at taxing the unbridled circulation of capital, at combating tax fraud and tax evasion, at putting an end to tax havens and at stopping money laundering."
"The savings directive, which forms part of what is known as the Monti package, contributes, in spite of dangers and shortcomings, towards setting up a system in which the Member States’ tax administrations exchange information – including lifting banking secrecy – so that they can tax interest accrued in another Member State."
"Accordingly, the Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate agreements with Switzerland, the USA, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino under which those countries would adopt equivalent measures to prevent the flight of capital."
"We welcome these agreements, not, as the rapporteur claims, due to the internal market, but because coordination is required to tax capital and to combat tax havens, particularly when the bulk of the tax burden falls on employees."
"We feel, however, that the terms of the agreement do not ensure such a proposal."

"We feel, however, that the terms of the agreement do not ensure such a proposal."
"Mr President, I welcome the proposals in the Mastenbroek report."
"As cross-border traffic and abuse of content on the Internet grows, Europe needs to step up its efforts to protect children from harmful and offensive content."
"It needs to act on the explosion of Internet paedophilia websites."
"However, more needs to be done by Europe not only as regards reporting and closing down sites but also in assisting law enforcement agencies to track and prosecute offenders and to identify the victims."
"I want to see the EU continuing its support for projects on identification of victims of Internet child abuse."
"Children who are the subject of abusing images carry their feelings of pain, guilt and suffering for the rest of their lives."
"Their images are on the net being traded by paedophiles on a daily basis."
"Out of a suspected 60 000 individuals portrayed in current abuse images, only 250 identifications have been recorded."
"New technologies, such as photo-messaging and digital cameras, make it easier for child abuse images to be produced and shared on the Internet."
"Let us hope that today’s report opens up new channels for action at EU level so that we can tackle and close down the criminal and offensive material and prevent the abuse of children."
". New technologies, such as the new opportunities presented by the Internet and by new online technologies, are developing at a dizzying rate."
"One downside of this, however, is that dangers and abuses in the way in which those technologies are used are emerging. Measures are therefore required to promote their safer use and to protect the end-user from unwanted content."
"I therefore endorse this initiative aimed at adopting a multiannual Community Programme to promote the safer use of the Internet and new online technologies."
"It will intervene in areas such as content that is potentially harmful to children, content that is unwanted by the final user and illegal content such as child pornography."
"It replaces the Safer Internet Action Plan (1998-2004), which successfully fostered a wide variety of initiatives promoting the best ways to benefit, safely, from the potential offered by the new media."
"I also welcome the plan to set up new hotlines in all Member States, which must be quickly and effectively integrated into the current European hotline network, ensuring coverage and exchange of reports of the major types of illegal content of concern."
". We voted in favour of this report, as it focuses on an issue on which there is broad agreement."
"We endorse the objectives of combating improper Internet use, promoting safer Internet use, particularly by children, and combating illegal and unwanted Internet content, and we feel that even greater attention should be paid to this issue."
"We welcome the proposals to set up a programme to finance and coordinate the fight against illegal content, with the focus on raising awareness amongst end-users, rather than policing; to finance and coordinate hotlines in EU countries and coordinate those hotlines with future Member States and third countries; to cut the funding awarded to private companies for developing filter software; and to increase the participation of NGOs in establishing self-regulation for Internet Service Providers, instead of establishing legal control procedures."
"It is true that the Internet has developed in such a way as to enable us to move into new technological areas and to ‘navigate’ web pages, yet it is dominated by business interests and has been transformed into an enormous advertising outlet, which extends to the pornography industry and to illegal content such as child pornography and xenophobic and racist material."
"Measures must therefore be taken, whilst ensuring that fundamental rights and freedoms are not affected."
"Following the ‘Safer Internet Action Plan (1998-2004)’,here we are, faced with a new programme: ‘Safer Internet Plus’."
"The difference consists of a few more restrictions upon freedom of expression and slightly more targeting of what is called racist content. Not only illegal content, but also ‘unwanted’ and ‘harmful’ content are prohibited."
"Filtering software, codes of conduct, self-regulation, the denunciation of others ... Long live censorship!"
"We reject a document along these lines, for we are committed to freedom of expression and condemn documents that crush freedom."
"The law of Jean-Claude Gayssot, a Communist, is the prime example of such a document."
"Moreover, we would point out that the basis of the Internet is electronic mail and, contrary to certain totalitarians, we are committed to freedom of correspondence, even electronic correspondence."
"What must be condemned are barbaric, paedophile or violent forms of behaviour and their perpetrators and not the media they make use of."
"It is society, with its increasingly decayed morals, trivialising all sorts of deviant behaviour, that must be changed."
"It is our governments’ complacency regarding all these wayward tendencies that must be combated, rather than freedom of thought and the freedom to express oneself via the Internet or from other platforms."
"These freedoms are now flouted in France, and this in accordance with the dogma of political correctness."
". I welcome this report, stressing the importance of continued action needed to safeguard children from harmful and unwanted content that is being disseminated via the internet."
"I applaud the report's recognition of the need to implement measures to encourage reporting of illegal content in addition to the assessment of the performance of filter technologies and the benchmarking of these technologies."
"Furthermore, I would like to reaffirm the magnitude of the Commission working in close-cooperation with Member States as it will ensure that the implementation of the Programme is complementary to other relevant Community policies, most notably the Community research and technological development programmes and the Daphne, eContent and Modinis programmes."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Mastenbroek (A6-0033/2004) on safer use of the Internet and new online technologies."
"Internet penetration and use of new technologies such as mobile phones is still growing considerably in the Community."
"Alongside this, dangers, especially for children, and abuse of the technologies continue to exist and new dangers and abuses are emerging."
"In order to encourage the exploitation of the opportunities offered by the Internet and new online technologies, measures are also needed to promote their safer use and protect the end-user from unwanted content."
"The new programme, Safer Internet Plus, contains a number of welcome proposals to drive forward existing programmes and to set up new programmes."
"The focus on the end-user is a more realistic approach and the concentration on raising awareness is the most positive aspect."
"Along with the rapporteur, we feel that the key issues for the programme should be transparency and the representation of all interested parties at all levels. We must also be proactive on all of the proposed action lines: fighting illegal content, tackling unwanted and harmful content, setting up the Safer Internet Forum and raising awareness among the general public."
"Mr President, I should merely like to provide a short explanation with regard to the vote on the Coelho report, namely that in the final vote I wanted to vote against, but voted in favour."
"This does not alter the result in any way."
"Thank you."
". The Socialist group supported the above report when voted in LIBE committee on the 25th October 2004."
"The report, as voted in Committee, included the obligatory insertion of a digital photograph whilst leaving the option of a second biometric (a digital fingerprint) up to the Member States."
"The PES position was carried in committee, a position which afforded necessary data protection and civil liberties protections (see amendments 5,7,8,9,10,11,12)."
"Furthermore, the Socialist group supports the protections in article 2 and article 4 paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Council position of 23rd November."
"At the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting end November 2004, it was decided that two biometrics would be obligatory (digital photo and fingerprint)."
"The Council expressed its desire to take a final decision on this issue during its meeting of 3rd December 2004."
"The Council insists that the report be adopted by the EP during its December I plenary."
"The PES group sees no gain for the European Parliament in challenging the Council to reconsult the Parliament on this report which falls under the consultation procedure."
"The PES group urges the Council to recognise the Parliament's good faith shown in respecting the Council's desired timetable on this report."
"The Moderate delegation in the European Parliament has today voted in favour of the Coelho report because Parliament’s views of the document would considerably have improved the original proposal if Parliament had had the right of codecision."
"We nonetheless wish to emphasise that we are doubtful about the proposal as such."
"There are large risks associated with the collection of people’s biometric characteristics."
"Personal privacy is threatened by the creation of large databases in connection with which data protection may, in the longer term, be difficult to maintain, particularly if there is little real opportunity to correct errors."
"Moreover, it has not been adequately demonstrated that such measures do actually protect society against terrorism."
"The proposal before us from the Commission and the Council is a consequence and an integral part of the EU institutions’ current drift towards securitarianism. We therefore voted against it, and indeed this is a position that Parliament had already adopted in the previous legislature."
"This measure forms part of a supranational dynamic to create vigilance and control tools at EU level, such as an EU-level personal database, and has been widely criticised for being disproportionate and for having a dubious legal basis, all the more so given that there is no legal framework for protecting the general public, nor is there any parliamentary scrutiny, particularly on the part of the national parliaments."
"Furthermore, this measure slavishly seeks to satisfy US demands as regards the entry of EU citizens, although this does not apply reciprocally."
"On the initiative of the ‘G5’ countries (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain), the Council intends to go even further than the ‘demands’ on the use of biometric data – the effectiveness of which is certainly open to question, given the arguments put forward for its introduction, the so-called ‘war on terror’ – by introducing two (photograph and fingerprints) rather than one."
"Hence our vote against."
"Biometric data can help make our identity documents safer by making it more difficult to forge passports."
"Even though there is no human right not to be identified, people’s rights must nonetheless be protected through clear lines of demarcation regarding how information is used, for what purposes and by whom."
"The setting up of a central database at EU level would conflict with the principles both of proportionality and of purpose and would increase the risk of data’s being misused, as well as of its being linked and combined in contexts other than those for which it was collected."
"It is the Council that is, and must be, the sole decision-making body in issues concerning standards and procedures to be followed by the Member States when they carry out checks on people at the EU’s external borders."
"Through this procedure, the Council is, however, obliged to hear the European Parliament’s points of view, which is why we have chosen to express our support for the view that aspects of legal certainty and the protection of private life are better dealt with in terms of the committee’s report than in terms of the Commission’s original proposal."
".– Keep everyone on file."
"We are all potentially dangerous to the established order and potential terrorists.That is the essence of the Council decision, the application of which is the subject of today's debate."
"The planned mandatory collection, storage and transmission of biometric identifiers (digital photograph, fingerprint and 'voluntary' use of the iris) are a significant step in the creation of central personal identification databases, with uncontrolled access, which will form the basis for prosecuting and repressing the grass-roots movement."
"The manner in which the specific measures are being promoted, in violation of the supposed powers of consultation of the European Parliament, demonstrates the hurry the EU is in to come into line with the US internal security doctrine and the theory of zero tolerance."
"The decision by the European Councils to introduce two mandatory and one voluntary biometric identifier, while the European Parliament was still debating the proposal making provision for one mandatory and one voluntary identifier, illustrates the respect which the EU has for the so-called rule of law, which it now wants to export to Ukraine."
"These measures, together with the reactionary Hague programme package, are being used to speed up the application of a global network to put on file and terrorise anyone who opposes the terrorism of European and global monopoly capital."
"However, they will not be able to stop the fight of the workers, and attempts at scare mongering will boomerang back on to the people who thought them up."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho (A6-0028/2004) on EU citizens’ passports."
"The present proposal aims to render passports more secure by introducing legally binding harmonised security features for EU citizens' passports and by introducing biometric identifiers into the passport."
"The introduction of biometric identifiers will make it substantially more difficult to forge passports, because they will ensure that a person presenting a passport is in fact the one to whom it was originally issued."
"The use of biometrics is a tricky question from the point of view of data protection."
"Necessary safeguards must be put in place, in order to ensure full compliance with the data protection directive."
"Personal data must, indeed, be appropriate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the aims for which it is gathered and for which it is subsequently to be used."
"Nevertheless, we feel that the report strikes the right balance between the security that must be guaranteed and the freedom that we must all enjoy."
"In October, the Council decided to make the inclusion of fingerprints in European passports obligatory."
"This decision was not preceded by any public scrutiny, and there was no democratic control by Parliament."
"I would remind the Council that fingerprint technology is unreliable and neither makes travel documents more secure nor makes it easier for Europeans to move about."
"This decision is therefore disproportionate to its objectives."
"I today came out in favour of a document permitting the insertion of the photograph but leaving the insertion of fingerprints optional."
"My vote sends a clear message to the Member States in anticipation of the next Council."
"I would warn the Council against in any way allowing these measures to drift in the direction of creating a centralised databank containing biometric data."
"I would point out that, in an area as sensitive as this and with effects upon the everyday lives of Europeans, transparency and the democratic process must remain the rule."
"Only the participation of the European Parliament at all stages of decision-making enables citizens’ rights to be better protected."
"The Council must respect its commitments by moving as quickly as possible to codecision in this area."
"Mr President, there has been discussion, in connection with this resolution, of the term ‘Euro-Atlantic’."
"I am glad of the European and Atlantic solidarity with Ukraine, as we cannot resolve this crisis and give effective support to the democracy movement without partnership with the United States."
"Let me nonetheless make it quite clear that Ukraine is not a European Atlantic country, but rather a European one, and a European country pure and simple too."
"It is for that reason that I want to make it clear that Ukraine – unlike Turkey, a non-European country that has been mistakenly accorded candidate status – should be given clear prospects of membership in the European Union, being a country that merits our complete solidarity."
"It is a European country, and one that must definitely have a firm prospect of EU membership as soon as it fulfils the criteria, as soon as the European Union is in a position to give closer attention to its Ukraine policy, and as soon as its structures are re-established."
"Mr President, when democracy and freedom are at stake, you are either for or against."
"It is therefore extremely important at this time that we make our position in favour of democracy and freedom clear by calling for electoral freedom in Ukraine."
"We are not motivated by the victory of one or other of the candidates; our imperative is the hopes of the Ukrainian people."
"Let us not forget that, quite apart from the fact that it is a neighbouring country to Europe, there are hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians spread across Europe. Indeed, there is a large Ukrainian community in Portugal."
"Those of us who have followed these elections closely cannot betray the trust that they have placed in a Union that is, above all, democratic and free."
"It is also the appropriate time, however, to say that we welcome Parliament’s excellent contribution to the cause of democracy in Ukraine."
"The stakes clearly justify our commitment."
"The time has also come to acknowledge, as has already been stated in this House, that, broadly speaking, in terms of core values, our priorities are identical to those of our transatlantic allies."
"I shall conclude by saying that the determination shown by the majority of Ukrainian people is an example to all of us, which commits us, more so with every day that passes, to promoting democracy, freedom and the rule of law."
"The alarming situation in Ukraine has been debated in Parliament, but in terms that have not always been the most appropriate. This is, to some extent, reflected in the joint resolution adopted, from which we distance ourselves."
"As far as we are concerned, it is crucial that there is a commitment to stability in Ukraine. We have therefore stated that we are in favour of a peaceful solution to the conflict, without external interference, bearing in mind that there has already been too much interventionism throughout this process."
"We know that the stand-off in Ukraine is the result of an internal conflict between those who fought for the collapse of the USSR, who pressed ahead with the process of restoring capitalism, and who now find themselves under new external pressures, particularly from the USA, to extend NATO’s influence."
"We therefore feel that it is wrong to take sides in a conflict."
"The Ukrainian people must be in control of their own future."
". As the chief observer for the European Union Election Observation Mission to Indonesia this year I have great respect for the work of my colleagues in Ukraine."
"It is therefore clear to me that the integrity of the elections has been compromised and the result therefore cannot be accepted."
"The role of the Election Commission must also be called into question as they were either complicit in a fraud or were too poorly organised to detect one."
"In the circumstances we need new elections and an election that is neither corrupt nor incompetent."
"I will be voting accordingly."
"We support a free and democratic Ukraine and, thus, the main arguments of the resolution."
"Ukraine is a potential member of the EU and must therefore be assured of democratic development."
"We are definitely opposed, however, to the EU’s being given an increasing role within foreign and security policy."
"As the only pan-European security organisation and as a monitor of the Ukrainian election, the OSCE should have the main responsibility for mediating in the conflict between the government and the opposition."
"The EU should therefore operate within the framework of the OSCE."
".– The hypocritical bombast about 'legitimacy', 'compromise' and 'democratic procedures' being bandied about in the European Parliament by the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council cannot hide the undisguised and despicable interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine and the suppression of any concept of national independence."
"Following the pre-electoral abuse from banned advertising and mass marketing, we are now passing to the stage of blatant intervention by the ΕU, the USA and Russia, in a bid to serve the pursuits of their imperialist powers in the huge geopolitical chess game and secure control of the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and the Black Sea."
"The crisis which is raging does not seek to resolve the problems of the Ukrainian people and satisfy their demands for a socially orientated state and fair society."
"Neither of the presumptive contenders for power wishes to safeguard anything of the sort, given that both were collaborators with the Ukrainian oligarchy and protagonists of the anti-grass roots and anti-labour policy exercised over recent years."
"The interests of the ruling orders of the ΕU and the USA have been set against those of the new Russian commanding order and are confronting each other with such violence that they may lead the country and the region into unforeseen developments."
"The Ukrainian people must confront these unfortunate prospects and must not allow themselves to be trapped between Scylla and Charybdis."
". We regret that the four amendments tabled by our group to the Resolution on the Financial Perspectives were rejected."
"Accordingly, the Resolution does not condemn the strategy of the signatory countries to what is referred to as the ‘Letter of the six’, a strategy that the Council appears to support. Their aim is to stifle debate on the Financial Perspectives by proposing that the EU budget be set at a maximum of 1% of the Community GNI, and, in so doing, to shift the focus away from funding social and economic cohesion in an enlarged EU and from other policies in this area."
"The question of the duration of the next Financial Perspectives is also left open, in view of the five-year objectives laid down by the so-called European Constitution; we feel that the seven-year period – 2007 to 2013 – is more appropriate from the point of view of programming the structural policy."
"Lastly, the Resolution makes an inappropriate connection between the debate on own resources, revenue, the Financial Perspectives and spending, which places the correction mechanisms of the main liquid contributors on the negotiating scales."
"Hence our abstention."
"The June List has chosen to vote against the resolution because we do not under any circumstances wish to work in the service of ‘Parliament’s priorities’."
"All the debates, especially the negotiations prior to the 2005 budget, have clearly shown that a prevailing parliamentary majority would like to see a considerable increase in EU expenditure and, thus, also considerably increased membership fees for Sweden."
"Instead, we support the Swedish Government and the other five countries that, in a joint statement, have made it clear that the EU budget, when it comes both to payments and commitments, should not exceed one per cent of the EU’s joint gross domestic income."
"Parliament should also be free to review all expenditure, including agricultural subsidies, so as to be able to prioritise support for the ten new Member States."
"The June List believes that a strict expenditure framework and a flexibility instrument within the framework of a one per cent budget would release a lot of creativity and provide a stimulus for new savings."
"We are fixing the budgetary ceilings for 2007 to 2013 in accordance with the ‘Delors packages’ and the ‘Santer package’."
"There are two problems where expenditure and revenue are concerned."
"On the expenditure side, Parliament obviously wishes to increase this, while the Council wishes to place a ceiling on it of 1% to 1.2% of GDP for, after all, the budgetary austerity imposed upon the Member States should also be imposed in Brussels."
"The dispute between extravagant MEPs and the thrifty Council gives way, however, to complicit silence when it is a question of the annual expenditure of EUR 30 billion that will be entailed by the accession of Turkey, perhaps in 2011, that is to say during the financial planning."
"Nothing has been provided for in this area."
"In other words, budgetary estimates are undervalued by 30% from the very start."
"On the revenue side, it is obviously the issue of own resources that is raised, given the British cheque and the injustices in the distribution of the ‘tax’ burden between those states which make payments, such as France and Germany, and those states which receive funds, such as Greece and Ireland and the ten Eastern countries that have their tax dumping – relocation to the East – paid for by the tax slaves of the West."
"Here too, however, there is silence concerning the European tax that is inexorably on the way."
". As a Member of the European Parliament and especially given that I am from Portugal, I feel that the need to pursue policies promoting greater integration and cohesion in the EU – as called for in this report – must be a permanent element of the EU’s overall financial strategy."
"Solidarity is one of the key principles on which our Community was founded."
"It is also a substantial principle that cannot be turned into an equation that varies according to the fluctuations of the European average, particularly so given the downturn in that average resulting from enlargement."
"Our objective should and must be to aim high and to create a Europe that is characterised by cohesion and solidarity as regards development and wealth."
". – The problem of the future financing of the Community cannot be confined to the interinstitutional problem of relations between the European Parliament and the Council, despite the fact that this too is indicative of the stand of the plutocracy, with the sidelining of any representative bodies."
"The basic issue is the political orientation of the use of EU resources and the extent to which it does or does not serve the working classes."
"It has now been proven that Community resources and funds result in the redistribution of wealth; they are being grabbed from the workers and from the poor and less developed regions and are being given to big business and to the plutocracy and more developed regions of the EU."
"Inequalities are increasing constantly rather than decreasing, the insecurity and uncertainty of the workers about their future is growing and is becoming a means for even greater exploitation of them by the multinationals."
"The EU budgets express the economic policy and imperialist character of the ΕU and its reactionary and anti-grass roots orientations."
"The package of funds proclaimed is proving to be ashes rather than gold for the workers and manna from heaven for big business."
"The current conflict expresses internal oppositions by big business, not the interests of the workers, who are claiming satisfaction of their contemporary needs and fighting for the political orientations to change for the benefit of the majority of the people."
". – The European Union is the world’s largest donor."
"World aid to combat AIDS has tripled in the last three years."
"Even so, the figures contained in the latest WHO report are terrifying, and poverty is increasing."
"A greater financial commitment is useful but not enough."
"What needs to be discussed is above all the quality and effectiveness of the aid given."
"The Commission should clearly set out its priorities for future action, so that the resources allocated to development are not diverted to other, different policies, such as security or conflict resolution."
"What is needed is medicines, prevention and information; support for those groups closely affected by the disease: children with no parents to bring them up, and elderly people with no children to support them; research aimed at the public interest and not just for commercial ends; and action against all kinds of prejudice and against that kind of moralising that hinders prevention."
"AIDS is not a distant reality."
"In 2004 there has been a terrible increase in the number of cases in Russia and Ukraine, our new neighbours."
"The social malaise caused by the reduction in the active population generates poverty, tension and conflict."
"Therefore, the war on AIDS must also be waged in our own interests and for the sake of the stability that our Union represents."
"We welcome the adoption of this resolution, particularly given that most of the proposals that we tabled to improve the joint resolution were adopted. They were as follows:"
"- Calls on the Commission and the Member States to contribute at least EUR 1 billion, on a sustained basis, to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria;"
"- Calls on the European pharmaceutical industry to set aside a significant proportion of its resources for anti-infective medicines and other essential medicines; calls on Sanofi-Aventis, for example, the largest European pharmaceutical group, to start researching this disease, instead of dispersing its team of expert researchers in this field;"
"- Calls on the Commission to draw up a proposal aimed at safeguarding the public interest more effectively when it comes to the orientation, research, development and production of medicines, at cutting prices and medical spending on public health services, and at guaranteeing the right of universal access to medical treatment and essential medicines;"
"- Calls on the Commission to oppose – both within the World Trade Organisation and in its bilateral relations – the insistence by the USA in its bilateral agreements with developing countries that those countries renounce the right to import the generics that they need to protect their citizens’ public health."
"The global fight against HIV/AIDS is a very pressing issue that demands comprehensive international commitment."
"We are nonetheless of the view that the HIV/AIDS issue should not be handled within the framework of EU cooperation."
"We believe that the fight against HIV/AIDS should be conducted by individual EU Member States, as well as within the framework of the World Health Organisation (or WHO)."
"The June List aims at limited EU cooperation."
"We are opposed to the EU’s having influence and competences in connection with issues that are already being dealt with by other international organisations."
". The interminable spread of HIV/AIDS is a cause of major alarm to all of us."
"The efforts that have been made have, for a number of years, been hampered by a shifting situation, which has affected diverse, and constantly changing, sections of the population. This is true both of Europe and, more so, of the rest of the world, especially Africa, where it is a scourge of terrible proportions."
"The situation requires constant efforts to combat any further spread and to invest in research and development in more effective therapeutic and preventative medicines."
"The burden of that effort must be shared by the wealthiest countries in the world – our countries."
". – By the time today's debate on AIDS closes, thousands of people will have died, many of whom might have lived if the huge pharmaceutical companies had not blocked the anti-virus drug production and importation process, so as to prevent the monopoly from being broken and its profits from falling."
"'Copies' of drugs may offer relief, witness the example of Brazil which, by producing them and dropping prices by 79%, has reduced the aids mortality rate by 50%."
"The statistics are disturbing: in Africa, only one in a hundred Africans can meet the cost of drug treatment."
"In Zambia, one in three pregnant women suffers from AIDS."
"Every day 8 200 people die."
"That is capitalism: savage and barbaric."
"It kills not only with weapons, but also by depriving people of basic human rights, such as access to medical care and treatment."
"Rights which remain dead letters, while in practice health and medication have become commodities so that multinationals can make a profit."
"This is the policy being promoted by the EU and the governments of the Member States who defend the interests of the monopolies."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are fighting solely for a free national health and welfare system and a nationalised pharmaceutical industry."
"Only thus will health become a real right for everyone."
"Parliament has come to the end of its agenda."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 2 December 2004."
"With regard to Wednesday’s agenda, in relation to the report by Mr Moscovici on Romania’s progress towards accession (A6-0061/2004), the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has presented a request that we postpone this report until a future sitting."
"– Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to point out that we are strongly in favour of Romania’s accession to the European Union."
"We are, however, opposed to its accession being rushed through without it fully meeting the set criteria."
"That would be bad both for the credibility of the European Union – particularly because other enlargements are also being prepared, as we all know – and for all those people in Romania who are fighting for the rule of law and against corruption, and it would work against the resolution of other serious problems, which have also recently been highlighted by the Commission."
"That, Mr President, is why we have asked for this vote to be postponed and for a dialogue to be set up with the recently elected members of the Romanian Parliament, so that we can give credibility to a process that would have none if it were automatic and thus utterly pointless."
"."
"If I might put it quite briefly, Mrs Frassoni, we are not, this week, voting on Romania’s accession, but on the report, which has a number of favourable things to say, and a number of negative ones too."
"We believe that we have to show Romania – right now, at a time when things are at a critical point – the way it has to go in the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years if it is to be able to accede."
"That is why we are in favour of the debate and, ultimately, the vote on Romania happening this week."
"So, speaking on behalf of my group, I want to express opposition to this contribution being deferred."
"Also in relation to the Wednesday sitting, there is a proposed change to the agenda."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have both presented requests that we postpone the report by Mr Coelho on the establishment of uniform models for visas and residents’ permits for third-country nationals (A6-0029/2004) until a future part-session."
". Mr President, I was actually waiting for Mr Watson, but now I will do it myself."
"I think a mistake has been made here, as the Coelho report that is on the agenda is not meant to be there yet; what should be there is the report dealing with the combating of cross-border vehicle crime."
"I therefore ask that the report currently on the agenda be deferred and replaced on the agenda by Mr Coelho’s report on tackling vehicle crime with cross-border implications."
"Mr President, I have no objection to moving the Dutch initiative on vehicle theft onto the agenda, as I feel that it would be a nice gesture to the Dutch Presidency for Parliament to state its position on what is, after all, a peaceful initiative, and one that does not cause controversy in this House."
"What does not strike me as reasonable is that this should be done at the expense of the initiative on registers."
"This is because the main thrust of the issue of registers is the introduction of biometric data."
"In the last part-session in Brussels, Parliament stated its position on this issue relating to passports."
"What we must now do is close the file on visas."
"This is not a codecision issue."
"The point is that Parliament gives its opinion to the Council and either Parliament submits this opinion in time to ensure that that opinion can influence the Council’s decision or we lose due to ‘non-appearance’, because the Council goes ahead and makes its decision in the absence of a Parliament position."
"Our position was well-founded, having enjoyed the consensus of the Socialists in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I see no reason why we should give up this vote in today’s sitting."
"I therefore believe, Mr President, that we could integrate the report on the Dutch initiative, which would be a nice gesture to the Presidency-in-Office, but without removing the visas report, which was, indeed, adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by an overwhelming majority, including the Socialist vote."
"Also for the Wednesday sitting, there is a proposed change to the agenda."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have both presented requests that we include in the vote at midday the report by Mr Coelho, on the initiative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for adoption of a Council Decision on tackling vehicle crime with cross-border implications, approved in accordance with Rule 43(1) of the Rules of Procedure (A6-0052/2004)."
". Mr President, I did actually think – and framed my request accordingly – that the Coelho report on vehicle crime with cross-border implications was to be dealt with rather than the report listed."
"That was what I requested, and, as I understand it, Mr Coelho has no objection in principle to this report being discussed."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, in order to replace one report with another, we must first vote to remove the first one and then vote to include the second."
"– Mr President, I am putting this request forward on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I do not think the other groups will object."
"My request concerns the extremely serious situation in Cambodia, where a number of children who had been set free and entrusted by the authorities to an NGO have again been kidnapped by prostitution racketeers, while the staff of the NGO in question have received death threats."
"The situation is truly very serious."
"We have already dealt with the pressing business and I think all of the groups are in agreement with keeping Zimbabwe, Congo and Bhopal on the agenda."
"We do not intend to oppose those topics, but we just ask to be able to address the Cambodia issue within the debate on the preparations for the European Council, to be held on Wednesday, so as to increase awareness in the Council and Commission."
"We think that this would be the right thing to do, partly in view of the seriousness of the facts."
"Those children have been forced back into the chain of prostitution, which notoriously serves a European clientele."
"We therefore believe that dealing with this subject during the debate on the European Council would be an act of great sensitivity and I do not think any of the groups will object."
"What you have said does not relate to a change to the agenda."
"The Presidency will not prevent any issue from being raised in the debate with the Council."
"Mr President, although we can do as you have said, might we ask you, after the debate, to perhaps write to the Cambodian Government in order to express this House’s great concern and disquiet at these events?"
"This would certainly be an appropriate way for us to deal with them."
"I am happy to do so, provided that there is consensus and no opposition."
"Otherwise, we would have to hold a debate."
"I shall communicate the European Parliament’s concern, but we are not changing the agenda."
"– Mr President, I too am in full agreement on this point."
"If you decide to send a letter to the Cambodian authorities, however, I should like to ask you to underline this episode in particular but also to refer to the overall situation."
"As we all know, the Cambodian monarch has abdicated in protest at the general political situation and members of the Sam Rainsy party and the opposition have been threatened with death and with being expelled from Parliament."
"I therefore fully agree with your initiative to send a letter, in which I ask you to express our extreme concern not just about this incident but about the overall state of legality and human rights."
"I am very happy to communicate that and other concerns, but I cannot write a letter analysing the specific political situation of a country and go into all the details which would be impossible to analyse without a debate and vote in Parliament."
"There is a very specific issue which could be included in a letter, expressing an concern about that issue, but I do not believe I should go as far as to analyse the overall political situation in Cambodia without a prior debate and resolution by Parliament."
"If there are no objections, therefore, my letter will be restricted to expressing concern about the issue raised by Mrs Napoletano, and I would invite you to debate the political situation in Cambodia in accordance with the appropriate parliamentary procedures, if you so wish."
"I trust that you understand this, Mr Pannella."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches."
"Mr President, the difficulties experienced by European producers of soft fruit and those involved in the processing and preservation of such fruit prompted me to put the following question to the European Commission on 28 October 2004: what steps does the Commission propose to take to protect soft fruit growers, particularly in the new Member States, as well as to ensure a profitable market for both producers and processors?"
"The Commission’s answer of 16 November 2004 included statements to the effect that these problems were the result of a bumper harvest, and that Polish producers should be able to place their products on the market under the most favourable conditions by making use of CMO funds."
"Mr President, I did not ask what Polish producers ought to do, I asked what steps the Commission proposes to take to protect fruit growers and to ensure a profitable market for their fruit."
"As I have not received an answer, I should like to ask you to take action."
"Mr President, I would like to condemn the abolition in Spain of one of the principles of all democracies: the separation of powers."
"The Government has just presented a law aimed at subjecting the judiciary to its decisions and, to this end, has had no hesitation in manipulating the law and parliamentary procedures."
"When this law is implemented, the Spanish legal system will fall victim to great instability, inoperability and manipulation, by creating situations of deadlock in the General Council of the Judiciary which will prevent it from moving forward in its decision-making."
"And those decisions will be subordinated to the wishes of the government."
"This abuse will probably be analysed by the Constitutional Court, but the European Union cannot remain silent in relation to these actions, which remove the independence of the judiciary."
"The Union must ask itself why a Member State is trying to take control of the operation of the government body of the judiciary."
"If the European Union truly wants to become an area of freedom, security and justice, it must intervene in order to guarantee the independence of the judiciary in Spain."
"– Mr President, a month has now passed since I drew Parliament’s attention to the fact that on 16 September we adopted a resolution stating that a fact-finding mission would be sent to Vojvodina to report on acts of violence against national minorities."
"Why does it take four and a half months to send a fact-finding mission?"
"In the meantime the acts of violence continue."
"It shows incompetence and a lack of credibility on our part to wait four and a half months to investigate acts of violence against national minorities and to let four months go by without implementing the resolution that we adopted."
"It is the credibility of the European Parliament that is at stake."
"We need a general re-examination of the procedure by which Parliament monitors violations of human rights."
"Mr President, many of us have protested against the opening of a new gold mine in Rosia Montana, Romania."
"The mining project would destroy the landscape, polluting the rivers and waters of the whole region with cyanide, from Romania through Hungary to the Black Sea."
"The Romanian Government has the responsibility of stopping this awful project; however, the Canadian owners of the mining company should be mentioned as well."
"I cannot believe that a European company would be allowed to demolish a whole city in Canada, with its houses, churches and cemeteries."
"I ask the Canadian Government and the public to show the same respect to us Europeans."
"Environmental pollution should not be exported."
"Sharing the same planet means a common responsibility for us Europeans and for Canadians."
"Mr President, I would like to bring to Parliament's attention – not for the first time, perhaps – the discrimination against many university students from the 10 new accession states who are studying in the 15 old Member States."
"An example – and I have received complaints from these students – is that 19 medical students currently studying at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, Ireland, have been asked to continue to pay non-EU resident fees – many thousands of pounds every year – although Cyprus became a Member State of the European Union on 1 May."
"This is very unfair, Mr President, and I ask you to intervene so that there is no unfair discrimination between university students from the 25 current Member States of the European Union."
"– Mr President, a few days ago, the chairman of our PASOK party, Mr George Papandreou, met Patriarch Bartholomew in Istanbul and had the opportunity to reconfirm our support for the ecumenical character of the Orthodox Patriarchate, for the important spiritual and cultural work which it performs and for the international initiatives by the Patriarch for dialogue with religions and cultures and for environmental protection."
"You too had a similar meeting very recently, Mr President, and I would like to welcome the acute humanitarian awareness which distinguished your statements."
"As everyone knows, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has, for many centuries, been highly active in fostering the cultural and spiritual progress of orthodox nations."
"It is the orthodox pole of Christianity in the world."
"That is why I had to propose, given the special political and institutional influence which you wield, that you take an initiative with all the political groups to adopt a joint statement, both confirming the ecumenical character of the Patriarchate in Istanbul and the need for the Halki seminary to re-open immediately, and noting that defending and promoting the work of the Patriarchate does not jeopardise Turkey's national security."
"Mr President, while working in my electoral district at the weekend, I was told that, following a court ruling in Iran, another woman is expected to be stoned to death in three weeks’ time."
"As this information came too late for a motion for urgent procedure, I would now ask the House to examine this case and, if need be, to take action against Iran."
"I do not believe that this House, let alone the European Union, can tolerate actions of this kind on the part of states."
"I therefore ask you, as a matter of urgency, to determine whether a young woman is indeed expecting to be stoned to death in Iran in three weeks’ time, and to intervene in so far as you are able should this prove to be the case."
"If you communicate very specific information to us, the Presidency will be very happy to set in motion the relevant mechanisms provided for in our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, you will recall that during our last part-session in Strasbourg I raised the plight of the three hostages who were being held in Afghanistan."
"I am sure that everyone is as relieved as I am that they were released and have now left Afghanistan and returned to their homes."
"I thank you and your staff for your help and consideration and for the speedy representation you made to both the Council and the Commission."
"It was good to have taken part, if only in a small way, in the release of the three hostages."
"I believe it proves the necessity of applying maximum pressure at such times."
"In a world of such bad news, it is good to hear such good news from time to time."
"Mr President, this Parliament has often discussed the issue of trade union rights in Colombia, but on behalf of myself and my colleague, Mr De Rossa, I ask you to intervene urgently in the defence of workers from the trade union Sintracarbon."
"They have received death threats and extortion demands from illegal paramilitary forces engaged in negotiations with their employers, ."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament could you please send a letter calling for the protection of these workers to the company, to its European owners Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Glencore International, as well as to the Colombian authorities."
"This Parliament must register its condemnation of the violent intimidation in Colombia or anywhere in the world against trade unionists simply trying to represent their members according to their rights under international law."
"Mr President, at our last part-session in Strasbourg, Mr Farage was warned of the legal consequences when he spoke about Mr Barrot."
"The clear implication was that he could not speak his mind without fear of arrest or prosecution."
"Amongst others, Mr Watson said so, although he himself had previously been rude about Marta Andreasen."
"Many of us objected to this, but we did not object to Mr Watson's right to speak his mind."
"I understood this House to provide immunity from prosecution or from reprisals for words uttered in this Chamber during a plenary session."
"How else can a genuine parliament function, or is this not a genuine parliament?"
"After Mr Farage spoke, the question of French law was invoked."
"We are on French soil but the relevance of French law is questionable, as we are endlessly reminded that EU law takes precedence over national law."
"So my question is this: had Mr Farage the right to speak his mind as he did and, if not, how and on what authority is Members' freedom of speech in this House curtailed?"
"What you have said offers me the opportunity to make a few comments in this regard."
"In fact, at that moment, different views were expressed."
"I would like to make it clear that Parliament is an extra-territorial body."
"When it meets in Strasbourg, therefore, French legislation does not apply if it may affect the freedom of expression of any Member."
"That must be made clear and I believe that we should all accept that a reasonable limit would be to ensure that our words do not question the honour of a fellow Member."
"Under no circumstances can it be said that French legislation is applied in Strasbourg in order to restrict the freedom of expression of any Member."
"I want to make that very clear."
"Mr President, I would like to remind you and the whole of Parliament that in just three months’ time it will have been one year since the worst terrorist attack in Europe of recent decades."
"I am referring to the attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004."
"The work of the Committee of Enquiry on 11-M is coming to an end."
"It has done a fantastic job and some of its conclusions are clear: it reliably and unequivocally confirms that Islamic radicalism was solely and exclusively responsible for that attack; the President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, has today proposed an international pact against radical Islamic terrorism, and to this end it is essential that there be a dialogue between Europe and the moderate Islamic world; it also indicates the importance of preventing international terrorism, and that the Government of Mr Aznar was seriously at fault, both in terms of lack of preparedness and by manipulating public opinion between 11 and 14 March 2004, for purely party-political reasons."
"Mr President, between 25 September and 19 October 1915, 61 000 British troops were killed, captured or wounded at the Battle of Loos."
"At least 8 000 died, their bodies lost in the blood-soaked quagmire of the battlefield, a field which became a mass grave."
"That field is in Auchy-les-Mines in northern France."
"A few weeks ago that field was dug up by bulldozers to create a municipal rubbish dump."
"Since the bulldozers moved in it has become impossible to move around the field without treading on fragments of human bones and remains, shreds of military uniform and military equipment."
"The bodies of these thousands of brave men are being reburied underneath household and building waste."
"I call on you, Mr President, to write to the authorities in Auchy-les-Mines to express our strongest condemnation of the desecration of the graves of these soldiers – men who gave their lives selflessly to preserve our freedom and democracy in this continent."
"It is disgraceful that their resting place has been treated in this way."
"I take note of what you say."
"We will consider what action we can take in that regard."
"Mr President, the economic and social life of the island communities of Scotland is very heavily dependent on the west-coast ferry routes."
"The Scottish Executive, on legal advice and after consulting the previous European Commission, decided that under EU competition law these routes would have to be put out to private tender and private operators should be given the opportunity to take the contracts away from the state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne company."
"Last week, in a highly unusual move – in fact it is only the second time since the Scottish Parliament was created that this has happened – the Scottish Parliament defeated the executive on this very issue and said that the Executive and the Commission should rethink their position on these lifeline services."
"Mr President, given that the islands are now in a state of limbo – the parliament has stopped the executive from acting and the executive believes it has a duty to act under EU law – I would ask that you request the transport and competition Commissioners to examine this matter urgently and determine whether these island routes really have to be put out to tender under EU competition law."
"Mr President, I should like to protest at the way in which Members of the European Parliament are treated like mechanical voting robots."
"The speed at which some votes are conducted is an insult to human dignity and a denial of human nature, given that the latter imposes tight restrictions on the reaction times of the nervous and sensory systems."
"Similarly, programmes of work for the individual committees are made available with so little time to spare before meetings that it is physically impossible to study them or even to familiarise oneself with individual items, particularly because translations appear quite literally at the last minute, especially those from Polish."
"The Polish people experienced at first hand the disastrous attempts to create a Soviet being, and changes to human nature undertaken as part of the creation of a European economic being are also nothing but pathological discrimination."
"This discrimination denies human dignity, rational expediency and common sense, and it results in disrespect for human beings."
"We are therefore opposed to efforts to turn this Parliament into a mere sham, where democracy is only nominally present."
"Mr President, I had hoped in this speech to welcome a political breakthrough in Northern Ireland and to hail an irreversible abandonment by the IRA of its dirty war and its means of war."
"Sadly, however, as so often in the past, while Sinn Fein IRA has talked the talk, it has failed to walk the walk."
"Today, although mouthing commitment to democracy, it clings to the weapons of terror."
"Thus it continues to exclude itself from democratic government in Northern Ireland."
"It prefers the click of the rifle to the click of the camera."
"Camera shy, but terror proud."
"Make no mistake, it is Sinn Fein IRA alone that has once again let the people of Northern Ireland down."
"Democrats choose the camera shot, Sinn Fein chooses the rifle shot."
"The challenge now is to let democrats move on without them."
"Mr President, during our last plenary sitting in Strasbourg we approved a new European Commission."
"Like other major European institutions, it ought to be based on certain values and basic principles, such as equality between and amongst its Member States."
"But if we look, for instance, at the distribution of civil servants' posts between the old and new Member States in the Commission, this is unfortunately not the case."
"So far, less than a handful of the Commission's 265 most senior jobs are occupied by officials from the new Member States."
"The Commission has reserved eight posts at A1 level and 29 posts at A2 level."
"So far, however, only three of the Commission's 34 deputy directors-general and none of its 32 directors-general are from the new Member States."
"This situation cannot continue."
"The European Union is not George Orwell's , where all members are equal but some are more equal."
"Rather, I would say that it should be a Community based on principles of equality and justice."
"Therefore, I ask the Commission to come to Parliament with a regular progress report on this issue and I also urge the President of our Parliament to monitor the situation closely."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 13 December is a sad day, as it is the anniversary of the imposition of martial law in Poland, a measure that was intended to halt the widespread move towards democracy."
"I wanted to take this opportunity to say that this House has already heard on several occasions that Mr Kovács is becoming the hero of Europe’s transformation."
"Such statements have been made in particular by Mr Schulz."
"I enjoy listening to Mr Schulz’s speeches, but only for his use of German, not for their actual content."
"I should therefore like to repeat that it was not Mr Kovács who was the hero, but the Polish workers in Lublin, in Świdnik, and then in Gdansk in 1981."
"I would be extremely grateful if the authentic historical facts were respected."
"Mr President, the presidential election in Ukraine has been, as regards democratic politics, rich in scandals, and now another one has come to light."
"It became a matter of certainty on Saturday that Mr Yushchenko, a candidate for the presidency, had been poisoned."
"After examining him many times over, doctors established beyond doubt that he had been poisoned with dioxin, and the rumour persists that the dioxin with which he was poisoned was administered orally, quite possibly during a meal with the secret services."
"I therefore call on all European institutions and delegations to make an issue of this use of dioxin as a weapon, to take consequent action in Ukraine, and to press for the matter to be investigated without delay, without regard to the possible high rank of the persons involved."
"– Mr President, I visited Tunisia on 10 December on the invitation of two associations, the Tunisian Human Rights League and the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, to join in their celebrations of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"I regret to inform you that Mr Ben Ali’s security staff prevented the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia from holding its annual general meeting, in the process not hesitating to hit, beat up, and throw to the ground several militants from this association."
"In the light of this, I believe that it is important to convey to the Council and the Commission that it is absolutely essential to implement the guidelines for the protection of defenders of human rights, because quite obviously Mr Ben Ali continues to hold all of those who represent civil society in Tunisia in total contempt."
"– Mr President, an important hearing was to be held around this time in a case that relates to events dating back to 1944, concerning the situation of Italian military and also civilian detainees."
"The Federal Republic of Germany, instead of at last taking a positive approach to this legitimate request for moral rather than material reparation, is adopting legal delaying tactics and even taking the Italian Republic to court."
"I am asking for intervention in this situation to bring this page in history to a close, as it is still an open wound left over from the Second World War."
"That concludes the speeches."
"I am sorry I cannot allow any more speakers to take the floor."
"Mr Posselt, do you wish to speak on a point of order?"
"Mr President, I am one of those who worked for decades to make it possible for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to be here in the European Parliament."
"I rejoice that they are."
"I would really like to say, though, that I would also be glad if you ..."
"That is not a point of order."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Eurlings on Turkey’s progress towards accession (A6-0063/2004)."
"Mr Eurlings has the floor."
". Mr President, when I was given the responsibility of acting as rapporteur on EU-Turkey relations, I decided, while focusing on content, to write a fact-based report that would be fair and balanced."
"Apart from the Commission’s study and other reports, I have also based my findings on my frequent visits to Turkey."
"Over the past few months, since the beginning of October in fact, I have spent more than two weeks in that country."
"Let me tell you that I am impressed with the reforms that Turkey has carried out."
"More has happened over the past few years than in the four decades previous to those."
"In my report, I refer to Parliament’s support in this, but the public’s continued support for those changes are also decidedly impressive and worthy of congratulation."
"At the same time, I have also become convinced – and have said so in my report – that more reforms are yet to follow and to be implemented."
"Moreover, the present reforms must be implemented more effectively in order for Turkey to fully meet the political criteria."
"Allow me, based on the positive remarks, to mention a number of areas in which a great deal is yet to be done."
"First of all, human rights."
"In legislation, the government has made much progress in this field."
"Along with the Commission, the Council of Europe and all human rights organisations barring one, I too am of the opinion that there is no systematic torture in Turkey, but discussion as to whether it is systematic or not misses the real issue that is before us, which is that approximately one hundred cases of torture, reported by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other organisations, committed in police cells are far too many – one hundred too many for a country that really wants to grow towards Europe."
"That is why this report devotes much attention to this issue."
"An independent inspectorate, working together with NGOs and able to make random visits to police stations, must be set up ."
"In addition, it must be emphasised that it should become the practice for each reported case of human rights violation in police cells to be brought before the courts immediately."
"Then there is religious freedom, an area in which there are still many problems, and in which not a great deal of progress has been made."
"The Alevites, accounting for more than 30% of the population, are not fully recognised."
"Religious minorities have problems related to property rights, to training for their priests, monks and clergy, but also, quite simply, to do with the recognition that they share in this Turkish identity."
"I think there is a real need here for change, or as Mr Ali Birand, a well-known journalist of CNN Turk, put it last week: ‘Let Turkey become proud, also about those religious minorities, instead of holding them back’."
"The report makes clear statements about the necessary progress in religious freedom."
"A third point concerns women’s rights."
"As with human rights, a great deal has improved in the area of women’s rights, except that practice is in some ways far less promising, with forced marriages and crimes carried out to avenge honour, even including honour killings."
"Turkey must, as a matter of urgency, invest in combating illiteracy among women and educating them more effectively, and NGOs offering those female victims shelter must be given strong back-up."
"The report is quite clear about that too."
"I have another three points to make."
"Turkey has made many constitutional adjustments, but the Constitution itself dates back to a military era."
"That is why, I think, it is important to state in this report that if Turkey really wishes to grow much further, we would advise it to draft a new Constitution."
"I would now like to turn to the sensitive issue of Armenia."
"In this respect, the report proposes setting up a bilateral committee of Armenian and Turkish experts to catalogue all the historical facts."
"Furthermore, the borders with Armenia should be re-opened in order to bring about new relations in an atmosphere in which the wounds of the past can truly heal."
"Last but not least, Cyprus."
"I think that the report is abundantly clear about the recognition of Cyprus, about withdrawal of troops and about a push for fresh negotiations in a bid to achieve lasting peace and the island’s reunification."
"The report that is before you is constructive, but not naive, in my view."
"Although it is realistic, it is also critical where necessary."
"According to the report, the negotiations can be opened without any unnecessary delays subject to three conditions."
"First of all, as the Commission has also mentioned, there is a real need for amendment of a number of laws and the adoption of some new ones."
"I know that Turkey is in the process of doing just that."
"Secondly, monitoring by the Commission must be fully underway."
"Thirdly – and this is crucial to us and also to me as rapporteur – it must be made clear beyond any doubt that when negotiations are opened, the emphasis in the first stage of those negotiations will be on further fulfilling the political criteria in law, but also in practice."
"I have made every effort to arrive at a level of cooperation in Parliament in which this balance is struck in a constructive, yet critical, manner."
"I would ask all groups who have taken part in this to remain faithful to those compromises, even in this last, plenary, discussion."
"Let me say as rapporteur, as I have also done in the report, that it is now up to Turkey to prove whether it can come up with the goods and whether, with further changes in the areas of human rights, religious freedom, women’s rights, it can really achieve the standard that is necessary for EU membership."
"It is now up to Turkey; the ball is in their court."
"Whatever happens, we must anchor down the fact that cooperation between Turkey and the European Union will be very solid in future."
"The report leaves no doubt in that respect."
"In my view, what we should do now is to give a strong message to Turkey to seize that opportunity."
"Turkey is being given this real opportunity, but we in this House must also send a clear message about our own relevance as Parliament, by checking in the years that lie ahead whether Turkey makes real progress and whether it does so to a sufficient extent."
"The European Parliament must encourage Turkey in this."
"I think that that is very important and that is why I hope that this report will, by the end of this week, turn out not only to receive the broad support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but also of this plenary of the European Parliament."
". Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be here today for your debate on Turkey as we approach the critical meeting of the European Council which will decide whether to open accession negotiations with Turkey."
"I have followed Parliament’s work on Turkey very closely and wish to commend Members of this House for their commitment to pursue a rational and analytical debate."
"In particular I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, for the balanced report he has drawn up, as well as the Committee on Foreign Affairs for its valuable work."
"The revised version of the report, which incorporates several compromise amendments, demonstrates the will of this House to obtain a broad consensus on the important issue we are discussing today."
"In so doing, the report, , follows the line of the Commission’s recommendation, and I very much welcome this support."
"Turkey, as Mr Eurlings said, is indeed making progress in bringing into force the outstanding legislation identified by the Commission as needed in order to meet the political criteria."
"We trust that the European Council will endorse our recommendation and decide to open the accession negotiations with Turkey, as long as this conditionality is met."
"The Commission has proposed a negotiation strategy based on three pillars."
"The first pillar supports the reform process in Turkey."
"Legal and political reforms must be broadened and their implementation consolidated to make them truly irreversible."
"Many of the issues mentioned in Mr Eurlings’ report will require further attention."
"I refer in particular to the further consolidation of cultural rights, improving the situation of religious communities, strengthening the fight against torture and ensuring full civilian control of the military."
"Since 6 October, when our recommendation was adopted, there have been further encouraging developments."
"For instance, the new law on associations and the code of criminal procedure have been adopted."
"With the appointment of a civilian Secretary-General, the National Security Council is being transformed into an advisory body and its activities are becoming more transparent."
"I can assure the Members of this House that the Commission remains committed to monitoring Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria."
"These criteria are not subject to any negotiation."
"The second pillar relates to the framework for accession negotiations with Turkey, taking into account the specific characteristics of the country."
"This does not mean discrimination."
"Turkey’s accession would be different from previous enlargements because of the combined impact of Turkey’s population, size, geographical location, economic, security and military potential."
"For example, I would remind you that Turkey’s population is close to that of the ten new Member States which joined the Union this May."
"The prospect of Turkish EU accession raises many legitimate questions, concerns and worries."
"It is our duty as democratic politicians to address these concerns of public opinion."
"Therefore, the third pillar of our approach to Turkey will be geared towards strengthening the political and cultural dialogue between EU and Turkish citizens."
"It is clear that the European Parliament can and should play an important role in pursuing this project."
"I would like to turn briefly to Cyprus, on which I largely share the language in your report."
"In June the European Council welcomed the positive contribution of the Turkish Government to the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem."
"Efforts to find a settlement must be renewed."
"It is clear that accession negotiations would be held in the framework of an intergovernmental conference comprising 25 Member States on the one hand and Turkey on the other."
"We also expect Turkey to sign a protocol extending the Association Agreement to all 25 Member States."
"EU-Turkey relations have a long history."
"The Turkish membership perspective dates back to the Association Agreement in 1963."
"In spite of the ups and downs witnessed in the last 40 years, the Turkish vocation to join the European Union has been reaffirmed many times by the European Council, especially since Helsinki in 1999."
"Turkey is at present going through a process of radical change, including a rapid evolution of mentalities, as described by Mr Eurlings."
"The prospect of accession has proved to be a very important catalyst for Turkey to embark upon far-reaching constitutional and legislative reforms."
"I am convinced that the negotiation process will help to guide further reforms in Turkey."
"By its very nature, this is an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand."
"The ultimate objective of accession negotiations is accession: an alternative to accession is not on our agenda."
"To conclude, the necessary preparations for Turkish accession could last well into the next decade."
"The EU will evolve over this period, and Turkey should change decisively and fundamentally."
"In any event, these accession negotiations need to be managed carefully and prepared thoroughly in order to facilitate such a process and an outcome that enhances the achievements of fifty years of European integration."
"This is our shared goal, and I trust that we will all do our best to succeed in this objective."
". Mr President, today you will debate an important report by Mr Eurlings on the 2004 regular report and the recommendation of the European Commission on Turkey's progress towards accession."
"This debate is timely in view of the decision the European Council will take on Friday with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"When we look back to the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 and try to visualise where Turkey was at that moment in terms of its preparation for the EU, we can conclude that Turkey has made impressive progress."
"It is no exaggeration to state that Turkey is changing with almost revolutionary speed."
"The fall of the Berlin Wall created the conditions for rapid change in the central and eastern European countries that have become new EU Member States since May this year."
"For Turkey there was no such catalyst for change except the long-standing aspiration to join Europe and probably the desire for drastic economic change after the devastating economic crises in 2000 and 2001."
"It is interesting to note in the Commission report of October the increasing interaction between the drive for accession and the tremendous modernisation that the Copenhagen criteria have stimulated in Turkey."
"The Commission quite rightly concludes that this modernisation is in the interests of both Turkey and the European Union and concludes that accession, if well-managed, would offer important opportunities for both."
"At the same time, it is true that the challenges on Turkey's road to Europe are still considerable."
"This has also been recognised in the report by your rapporteur."
"The report notes the earlier commitments vis-à-vis Turkey and welcomes the substantial reforms Turkey has achieved in order to comply with the Copenhagen criteria."
"The report also mentions a number of concerns that still exist with regard to the implementation of the reforms."
"The report considers that accession negotiations should be opened without undue delay and underlines three important provisions."
"Firstly, in the first phase of the negotiations priority should be given to the full implementation of the political criteria."
"Secondly, the six important remaining pieces of legislation should be adopted and brought into force prior to the beginning of the negotiations."
"Thirdly, all mechanisms envisaged by the Commission to ensure close monitoring and intensive political dialogue and the possible suspension of negotiations should be fully effective."
"I also want to mention another important element that has been raised in the report by your rapporteur, as well as by the Commission."
"In the report the need is underlined to inform citizens of both the EU and Turkey, through an intensive political and cultural dialogue, in order to increase awareness of the integration process and foster mutual understanding."
"I fully agree with this."
"Like the Eurlings report, the Council has in its preparation for Friday's decision taken the Commission's report and recommendations as its point of departure."
"They provide a thorough, comprehensive and good basis for the decision on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Today the Council discussed the draft conclusions in preparation for the decision that the European Council will have to take on Friday."
"This decision entails more than a simple 'yes' or 'no' to the question of whether or not to open accession negotiations with Turkey."
"As the Commission has already stated in its recommendations and as I can see in the Eurlings report, the clear advice is that the decision will need to be inextricably bound up with, for example, close monitoring of the reform process to ensure the irreversibility of that process and its full, effective and comprehensive implementation."
"In addition the Commission has, in its recommendations, addressed concerns in Europe relating to Turkey's accession – for example concerns about the budgetary impact, or about the free movement of workers."
"In other words, this decision on Turkey will also have to be sufficiently forward-looking."
"The Netherlands presidency has extensively consulted Member States in order to prepare for a sustainable decision on Friday that does justice to the interests of the European Union and of Turkey."
"Last Tuesday the Prime Minister of the Netherlands visited Greece and Cyprus: two countries that, as close neighbours, have specific interests in this decision."
"Today the Prime Minister went to Berlin and Paris; tomorrow he will be in Austria."
"I was in Turkey last week, where I had the chance to meet Prime Minister Erdogan and the Foreign Minister, Mr Gul."
"As you know, Turkey also has a number of concerns, such as the suggested permanent safeguard clauses and the Commission's paragraph saying that by their very nature negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand."
"Lastly, Turkey is afraid that new criteria other than the political Copenhagen criteria will be imposed."
"I know that you have already had and today will again have an intense debate on Turkey, including on the elements of the decision that I have mentioned."
"I welcome this."
"I am convinced that a comprehensive debate on Turkey's accession to the EU is a prerequisite for a good outcome."
"For the decision to be sustainable we need political and public support."
"The Netherlands presidency is working towards a fair and balanced decision that will be based on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria."
"In this context we welcome the thorough and constructive work undertaken by your rapporteur and the Committee on Foreign Affairs in this regard."
"We look forward to a resolution being adopted by Parliament on 15 December."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Friday, the seventeenth day of December, the Heads of State or Government have a decision to take, and it is one of far-reaching significance."
"Never before in the history of the European Economic Community, of the European Community and of the European Union has there been a decision with such potential for far-reaching consequences as that on Turkey’s membership of the European Union."
"Everyone must be aware that, should Turkey become a Member State of the European Union, that Union will undergo a change in character."
"In our group, as is inevitable, different people take different positions on this."
"Let me point out that other parties, too, include former Heads of Government who speak up in favour of Turkish membership or against it."
"In our group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we affirm that we cannot accept any binding obligations, that nothing is automatic, that nothing can be laid down on the basis of things said to one effect or another by former Heads of Government."
"We affirm that the Turkey issue is a matter of conscience or something very close to one, and so we do of course accept that each and every Member will vote according to his or her conscience."
"I would like to thank our colleague Mr Eurlings most warmly for his report and for giving human rights such a high priority in it."
"What the Commission is recommending is open-ended negotiations, albeit with membership as an end in view, and tomorrow evening will see our group deciding what position to take on this."
"There are those in our group who would rather not have any negotiations and who are saying from the outset that they would prefer another form of partnership, to which we have given the name of ‘privileged partnership’."
"There is another faction that wants negotiations to have membership of the European Union as their objective, and a third seeking negotiations towards the goal of an alternative partnership, which would also be a privileged one."
"What all three positions have in common, though, is that they see Turkey as a large and important country, whose partner we want to be and with which we want to live on amicable terms."
"Those in our group who either do not want negotiations or want them to tend towards a privileged partnership – among whose number I include myself – are gravely concerned that, should Turkey join the European Union, this enlargement might prove fatal and Europeans might lose their identity, that it might be detrimental to the sense of being ‘us’ on which solidarity in the European Union is founded."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party have entrusted Mr Wolfgang Schüssel with the task of coordinating our position, and, Mr President-in-Office, as unanimity will be required at the summit, I would advise – and require – you in the Presidency of the Council to be flexible enough to guide it towards a unanimous conclusion."
"If there are to be negotiations, then it has to be said – frankly and fairly, while acknowledging the progress Turkey has made – that we will be in the very remarkable situation of negotiating with a country in which human rights are violated on a massive scale."
"We have heard it said, in the most absurd utterance of the year, that there is no systematic torture going on, but if torture is not systematic, it is certainly extensive."
"We also know that negotiations are going on with the governments as well, and so the governments with which Turkey is conducting negotiations include that of Cyprus, a country that does not even exist as far as Turkey is concerned."
"There is something illogical about that."
"We ask that the Turkish Prime Minister should not accuse us of exploiting the Turkey issue for our own internal policy purposes."
"On the contrary, we are engaged in discussions with the public, and we have to carry the people with us if we are to unite Europe."
"Nor are we applying more stringent standards to Turkey; it is a country of a size that we have never seen in previous accession processes, and that is why all this has to be discussed very, very carefully."
"What we must aim for is that we should have a future as a democratic and energetic European Union."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am able to start my speech by saying something positive: Mr Eurlings’ report is in every respect more nuanced than Mr Poettering’s speech."
"Let me say on behalf of those of my colleagues who have worked with him in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the rapporteur has taken a great deal of trouble to achieve a broad consensus, and in that he has succeeded."
"I see the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs as having showed that the line he took in this report – with the addition of elements contributed by our group – has resulted in a broad consensus which can also serve as the basis for a similarly broad consensus here in the plenary, and in that there are three significant points on which our group vigorously dissociates itself from what Mr Poettering has said today."
"Firstly, why is it so simple for Mr Poettering to float his theory that the EU would undergo a change in its nature if Turkey were to join it?"
"If Turkey were to join the EU as it is, it would have to make itself subject to the EU’s as a whole."
"If Turkey joins the EU, then, because we all want the Constitution, it would have to make it the basis of its internal policies as soon as it has been ratified."
"The European Charter of Fundamental Rights will then become constitutional law and binding in a Member State, namely Turkey."
"It will then be demonstrated that the values defined in that Charter, which are the fundamental values of our Union, can be accepted by a country of whose population 99% or 98% are Muslims."
"If we succeed in integrating Turkey into the European Union, then it will effectively demolish the Islamic fundamentalists’ theory that Western – that is, our – values and Islam are mutually exclusive, for it would then provide the proof that the fundamental values for which we contend are fundamental values for all people, whether they be Jews, Muslims, Christians or unbelievers."
"It is this advance, Mr Poettering, pure and simple, that compels us to commence these negotiations."
"There is a second point that we should not underestimate, that being the reforms that Turkey has pushed through in recent years, which were set in motion by Erdoğan, and which are – let me say so plainly – markedly more progressive than all the trifling reforms tackled by previous governments, whether conservative or social democrat."
"Nine years ago – it was 15 December 1995 – I was one of the three rapporteurs on customs union with Turkey, at a time when Mrs Çiller was that country’s prime minister, about which I will say no more at this point."
"At that time, she said to us, ‘For heaven’s sake, let us have this customs union, or you will be driving us into the arms of the Islamists.’"
"Nine months later, she formed a coalition with – as we know – Mr Erbakan."
"That is in the past; the credibility gap has been forgotten."
"Erdoğan has indeed set in motion more reforms than his predecessors in government."
"The only thing is that they are not enough, but all those people we have been talking to in Turkey, as Mr Eurlings can confirm – all those campaigners for human rights, for women’s rights, all the democratic organisations, all the pro-democracy associations, both the employers’ organisations and the trade unions – all have been telling us that the prospect of accession to the European Union has changed their country, that the prospect of accession to this Union will make their country a normal parliamentary democracy."
"All this will not be accomplished as soon as tomorrow morning."
"If it happens, accession will come at some point at the end of the next decade, but the opportunity, the prospect, of seeing this great country become a normal Western democracy is a peace dividend that we must not cast aside."
"Let me ask you, Mr Poettering, what will happen if you reject the Turks?"
"What will happen if the reform process is cut short?"
"Is this a risk you can take?"
"That is the question I put to you."
"Tell us what would happen in a privileged partnership if the reform process were to be halted in its tracks?"
"That is what we need to hear from you, but you have nothing to say on the subject!"
"This is what we have to say, and it is our third argument: if we succeed in making Turkey democratic and stable, if Western values succeed in putting down roots in its society, if we give the Turks the chance to become what they want to be, in other words, people in Europe, accepting European values for themselves, then we will be creating a European Union that will be making a reality of its peace process, its potential for peace and for the stabilisation of democracy in a region that more than ever needs democracy, human rights, social security and peace."
"It is these very things that we in the European Union should be exporting to Turkey – if all goes well!"
"That it will is not a given."
"Nobody can say at the outset of this process whether it will really be successful, but it would be negligent not to try, and so, Mr Eurlings, we, as a group, will be voting in favour of your report."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Eurlings report because, apart from a number of compromises to which I shall return later, it essentially calls on the governments to open negotiations without undue delay and makes it clear that the aim of the negotiations is the accession of Turkey as a full Member State of the European Union."
"Many of us would certainly have preferred a clearer and, in some way, less tortuous report."
"We have all too often said – and continually repeated to Turkey – that the negotiations are intrinsically open-ended and that therefore the outcome is not a foregone conclusion."
"Of course, we cannot say that we want permanent safeguards regarding the free movement of people, because that would be a breach of the Treaty, irrespective of the people concerned."
"In legal terms, it would be a breach of the Treaty, whether the Commission likes it or not."
"Even so, we are dealing with a compromise in which I believe we should continue to have faith."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me say that the debate today is not so much about Turkey but rather about Europe."
"It is about finding out whether this Europe is a trustworthy partner in international relations."
"It is about finding out whether we still keep to our word after forty years."
"It is about finding out what our identity is, Mr Poettering."
"I believe that the identity of the European project consists in its being a political project and not a geographical project or a religious one."
"I also believe that our identity does not reside so much in our past and our roots – which some would claim to be completely Christian or Catholic – as in our present and, especially, our future."
"Our past has seen not only glories but also wars and bloodshed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe instead that our identity is represented by the last fifty years, in which we have tried and to some extent succeeded in bringing about the rule of law, the separation of powers and the secularisation of our institutions, as well as the protection of human and political rights as an essential part of human development."
"That is our identity, and that is the project in which the Turkish people and government are asking to take part."
"I believe the stakes are these: either we choose a self-confident Europe that is able to deal with the problems and challenges that it faces – which range from difficult relations with the Islamic world to immigration and lasting differences – a Europe which is starting the negotiations not lightly or ingenuously but fully aware of their political consequences, or we choose a Europe which, perhaps out of respect for its Catholic-Christian identity, curls up into a ball and thinks it can best defend the well-being we have obtained by shutting itself off from the challenges that it faces."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those are the stakes."
"The issue is Europe, and that is what we need to debate."
"That, for me, is the Europe in which it is worth believing; that is the Europe for which it is worth fighting, that is the Europe which will, in some way, inspire respect in our fellow citizens and on the international stage."
"I do not believe that tortuous or ambiguous arguments, whatever they may be, can measure up to our present, to our future or, above all, to what we have achieved so far."
". Mr President, my group also supports this report as it is now before us, following amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"As the rapporteur has already stated, it is a critical, but constructive report."
"That does not mean that we agree with every paragraph – that is also why our group has tabled amendments – but we support the basic ideas in it."
"I should like to respond to two positions in the debate, not only in that conducted in the European public square, but also in this House."
"Let me start with the position of those who are simply opposed to Turkish membership."
"Mr Poettering has put this into words and there is no time to go into all those arguments."
"What I should like to alert you to is the attempt, by means of amendments, to include this position in Mr Eurlings’ report after all, by anticipating, sometimes in a toned down version, the possible failure of the negotiations and to refer back to other forms of relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"Let me be quite clear."
"It is not for this House to labour the obvious or to reward the Christian Democrats for the way they make politics with symbols."
"The report is very clear on this point."
"The negotiations must be opened as soon as possible and without any unnecessary delays."
"Nothing in life is certain; that also applies to these negotiations, but the objective, namely full membership, must be clear-cut."
"That is unambiguous, and it should stay that way."
"I urge you to vote down all attempts to do away with this clarity."
"A second position is adopted in the debate by those critics who feel that too little has happened and that far more should happen, particularly in the area of human rights."
"I do not propose to mince words about that either."
"Together with the President, Mr Borrell and Mr Eurlings, I visited Turkey only last week, and spoke to many people in Istanbul, Ankara and also in Dyabakir."
"We spoke with human rights activists, lawyers and religious minorities."
"They all said that indeed, there is still a great deal amiss in Turkey; some said that we are only halfway there."
"However, at the end of all those talks, they all pleaded with us to open negotiations, those being the best guarantee of success for the reforms that are now taking place."
"Moreover, they are the best encouragement for all those people who, over the past fifteen years, have risked life and limb to dedicate themselves to reforms."
"Both the Commission’s report and that produced by Mr Eurlings contain sufficient guarantees to simply suspend negotiations in the unlikely event of future deteriorations in the area of human rights."
"If you value those human rights, if you really think that torture should be forced back further, if you think that the Kurds should acquire rights not only on paper but also in practice, then I urge you to vote in favour of opening negotiations."
"That does not mean that things will change tomorrow, or that things will be easy."
"I realise this, and so do the Turks, but the opportunity is there, and we should not spoil it."
"I really do hope that, during Wednesday’s vote, Parliament will finally be capable of taking a strategic decision with implications that stretch far beyond Europe, and that the European Council will do likewise two days later."
"As Mr Schulz has already pointed out, Turkey can demonstrate that democracy and Islam very much go hand in hand."
"That is the best antidote against the sceptics who are monopolising the issue in Europe at the moment and who claim that this will never be possible."
"Turkey can demonstrate that it is possible, and Europe can demonstrate that it can contribute to preventing a clash of civilisations between the West and the Islamic world, a clash for which many fundamentalists in the East and West are hoping."
"Europe can show that, based on shared values, there is room for more than one culture and that in the Europe of the twenty-first century, there is room for more than one religion."
". Mr President, in order, right at the start, to comply with Mr Schulz’s demand for a nuanced approach, let me make it clear that my group will, on the one hand, vote by a large majority for the commencement of negotiations with Turkey and will expressly endorse what is set out in the report, namely that these negotiations should have Turkish membership of the EU as their objective, but that we do, on the other hand, have serious problems with the report itself."
"This is no fault of Mr Eurlings, who has struck me as being very competent and committed in this matter."
"I have to say, though, and with regret, that I am both disappointed and surprised that – of all people – the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens, on all the practical issues in which the negotiation process could have measured further progress in terms of time and impact, have rejected amendments to that effect."
"The report we have before us is balanced in its criticisms, but those criticisms are metaphilosophical and so generalised that we can hardly get to grips with them."
"Whilst we acknowledge that Turkey has seen considerable positive changes in both the political and legal spheres over the past two years, it must actually be possible to expand on the fact that the reality is often rather different."
"In a report that twice, and rightly, addresses the problem of the Greek Orthodox seminary at Halki, it must also be possible to address the issue of the four million Kurds who are refugees in a country in which over four thousand villages have been destroyed."
"In contrast to other issues, these things have not been specifically mentioned in this report, and I suspect that this has been done in order to avoid providing opponents of Turkish accession with ammunition."
"Yet Mrs Bonino has drawn attention to the problem that these thorny issues touch upon the substance, the presuppositions, and the potential value of the principles on the basis of which the European Union exists, and I believe this, tactically speaking, to be quite the wrong road to take."
"My group will have no part in this sort of relativism."
"We will take the negotiating process as an opportunity to further set out those things that – as I have learned from other Members – are the necessary practical details of what Socialists and Greens have long demanded."
"With fellow Members of this House, I visited the small Kurdish town of Kiziltepe, where, on 21 November, a lorry driver and his twelve-year old son were shot dead."
"The governor announced that two armed terrorists had been killed."
"In any EU Member State, a governor would have had to step down for that."
"That is the standard we will continue to apply."
"I want to conclude by saying something else."
"We will not allow Turkey to gain, rather than a privileged partnership, the discriminatory membership that the Commission envisages."
". Mr President, in the major controversies surrounding the opening of negotiations about Turkey’s accession to the European Union, frankness is called for."
"It is precisely that praiseworthy attitude that our rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, exemplifies."
"Last Saturday, he told the Dutch press in plain terms about his concern at the complaints lodged by Prime Minister Erdogan about Brussels."
"The Turkish Prime Minister and the President of the Turkish Parliament very much create the impression that their country already complies with the political criteria for accession."
"To sum up, Brussels is apparently asking too much of Ankara on this crucial subject."
"Nothing is further from the truth, though."
"That bodes well for the Council and Commission if the unexpected decision is taken this week to open negotiations with lamenting Prime Minister Erdogan."
"According to the rapporteur’s findings, Paragraph 4 of the report can in any event be duly deleted."
"After all, that paragraph alludes in jubilant terms to the persistently strong motivation and political willingness of the Turkish Government and the Turkish Parliament to grow towards the European Union."
"I on my part have also been very frank to the rapporteur about the fundamental lack of religious freedom in Turkey."
"Words fail me, in fact, for the frankly small-minded attitude of the Turkish authorities towards various minuscule Christian minorities on their territory."
"Suffice to look at the of the past few weeks, but also Friday’s ."
"Although in this light, I very much value the critical stance adopted by Mr Eurlings in this basic violation of human rights, I believe that he is still concerning himself too much with fighting the symptoms."
"That is why I would once again urge him to back my amendment in which the Council and the Commission are asked to demand from the Turkish authorities, in line with the political criteria of Copenhagen, legal personality for the Christian churches with immediate effect and the immediate abolition of the Presidium for Religious Affairs."
"This latter request does, in fact, do away with another intractable political myth, namely that of the secular Turkish State, with the discrimination against non-Sunnites that this entails."
"Under the category of non-Sunnites, there is also the considerable minority of Alevites."
"Along with the large Kurdish community, they do not wish to be considered minorities but as an integral part of the Turkish Republic, and, indeed, as its co-founders."
"Europe does well to keep well away from explosive Turkish political issues such as those, on pain of its own implosion."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many advantages could certainly be gained from Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"Such advantages would include an extension of the common market, which would be of great economic benefit, and undoubtedly also a strengthening of transatlantic links."
"Yet on closer analysis, it emerges that both these goals can be achieved with relative ease without Turkey joining the European Union."
"The European Economic Area is an excellent example of a platform for good economic cooperation between the EU and non-EU Member States."
"It could also be useful to propose to Turkey an appropriate reform of security policy, as the country is one of Europe’s major strategic partners in the field of security."
"A privileged partnership of this kind with Turkey would have another major advantage for us, as it would provide us with the chance of avoiding a full-scale crisis of agricultural policy and cohesion policy."
"Reform of both these policies is self-evident and necessary, in particular in the case of agricultural policy, but it would be an extremely negative development if such a reform were to be carried out merely because there was a chance of Turkey joining the European Union."
"Privileged membership of this kind would also provide us with an opportunity to forestall further social problems relating to migration."
"The latter are becoming ever more prevalent in today’s Europe, and ever more difficult to resolve."
"If we wish to avoid migration-related conflicts, we should not turn a Muslim country into the European Union’s largest Member State, which is what Turkey would become in 2020, for example."
"This could give rise to civil unrest, something we should be endeavouring to prevent in Europe."
"The stepping up of relations with Turkey should also be kept more in proportion to Europe’s policy of openness towards Ukraine."
"Relations with Ukraine have not been neglected through Ukraine’s wishes or Ukraine’s fault."
"It was also not Ukraine’s fault that it was a Soviet republic in 1963."
"These are all good reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report."
"We also feel the report was over-sentimentalised in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and we consider it to be imprudent."
"If we speak so lightly of Turkey’s membership in the European Union, we will build up stores of resentment in Turkey, a country that should be our friend."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, which declares its support for the Eurlings report and hence for the opening of negotiations with Turkey."
"Turkey’s accession would confirm the nature of the European Union as an open, tolerant society that draws strength from its diversity and is bound together by shared values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Furthermore, since it offers an alternative model to the closed, sectarian society proposed by Islamic fundamentalists, Europe could play an invaluable role in future relations between the West and the Islamic world."
"In more general terms, there is no doubt that, at a time when Europe is committed to taking on greater responsibilities in world politics, Turkey’s accession would considerably strengthen the Union’s ability to become a major actor on the international political stage, especially in hotspots such as the Middle East, the Black Sea basin, the southern Caucasus and central Asia."
"In addition, as confirmed by the OECD, Turkey’s accession could give added value to Europe’s economic weight in the world, because of its huge geographical area, its considerable natural resources and its young, highly qualified workforce."
"The opening of accession negotiations will be both a point of arrival and a point of departure."
"It will be a point of arrival because Turkey’s first request to join the then European Economic Community dates right back to 1959."
"Over the intervening years the country has modernised and achieved some important results as a result of incisive reforms and innovations that have taken place especially in the last two years."
"The opening of negotiations will, however, also be a point of departure, since the duration and outcome of the negotiations, which can start as soon as Turkey meets the Copenhagen political criteria, will depend on the progress made, particularly with regard to the economy and the Community ."
"The European Union and Turkey thus appear to be united by a major challenge: to lay the foundations for tomorrow’s Europe together."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Eurlings on his excellent work on an issue which, as this debate has demonstrated, is controversial and difficult."
"It has genuinely given rise to decisive support for beginning negotiations."
"On the other hand, some Members have expressed their fundamental opposition."
"I believe that this debate should be carried out calmly and on the basis of objective considerations."
"The Helsinki European Council made the decision that Turkey should become a candidate country."
"The Prodi Commission has issued a positive opinion on the beginning of negotiations, which, as Mr Rehn has told us, has been accepted by the Barroso Commission."
"Turkey is linked to the European Union by means of an association agreement and is part of the Customs Union."
"At the same time – and this should be pointed out because it is of significance in this debate – Turkey is a loyal partner of the West within the Atlantic Alliance and, in my opinion, the question we have to ask at this point, given Turkey’s strategic position, which is absolutely essential in terms of the transit of oil from the Caspian Sea and the decisive role it plays in terms of the stability of the Middle East and Central Asia, is whether we want Turkey to be linked to the European Union’s Western system of values or whether we want Turkey to move towards Islamic fundamentalism or become part of Russia’s sphere."
"The response to Mr Eurlings’s report is critical but constructive and I believe there are other issues on the table, which are also legitimate, such as whether European public opinion is yet prepared to accept Turkey as a member of the Union."
"But time and the citizens of the European Union will provide the answer to that question in good time."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I should like to start by saluting Mr Eurlings and thanking him for the high quality of his report and the spirit of openness that he showed throughout the process of compiling it."
"The report has been substantially modified by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but as it now stands here in the plenary, it recommends opening accession negotiations with Turkey without undue delay, and recalls that the objective of these negotiations can only be accession and nothing else."
"These two points are in line with what the majority of my group wants."
"That is why a large number of us in the Socialist Group will be voting in favour of it, unless one of these points is called into question by an amendment adopted in the sitting."
"In any case, it would send a very strong message to Turkey if this report were to be adopted by a substantial majority."
"I should like, Mr President and Mr Eurlings, speaking in a personal capacity, to express two regrets about the nature of the debates that we have just held."
"The first concerns the tone of our spoken and written comments."
"The twentieth century was a very violent one for Turkey."
"The evidence of this is plain to see: in Cyprus, in its relations with the Armenian and Kurdish peoples and also in the prominent role played by the army and the police in the internal socio-political organisation of the country, where they remain all-powerful."
"We are all aware of this."
"In the same way, many nations that are now members of the Union have also experienced totalitarian, fascist or communist governments or governments guilty of collaborating with an occupying power."
"Building the Union is a process of reconciliation with all of this."
"The prime reason for opening accession negotiations with any country is to set such a process in motion, and this will only succeed if there is a minimum of confidence in the effectiveness of this process both within the Union and in the candidate country itself."
"In fact, these insistent, sometimes aggressive and often repeated reminders of some of the blackest events in recent Turkish history are inspired more by suspicion and hostility than a desire to start a process of democratic consolidation and reconciliation between all peoples on the basis of an established historical reality."
"That is enough: we have gone too far."
"When France and Germany began their process of reconciliation by building the Community, they were very careful not to highlight quite so harshly all of the grounds that they might still have had for conflict with each other."
"In the same way, Spain, Portugal and Greece also joined us after black periods of fascism."
"I do not remember our requirements for tidying up penal codes and changing the attitudes of the police being quite as harshly worded as they are today."
"I only hope that Turkey does not see this as a cause for tension and think that any offence is intended, as this is not the case."
"But we are taking a risk."
"My second regret relates to the subjects that we have debated."
"Basically, we have only discussed our own internal or bilateral affairs and the clear, tricky and obvious difficulties, the undeniable difficulties presented by this accession. We have hardly mentioned the future and the largely positive possibilities opened up by the prospect of this accession."
"As a result, these aspects are not adequately reflected in the report."
"The enlargement of our market to encompass a market of 70 million consumers, in a country where the economy has been growing very rapidly for the last six years, will strengthen the Union considerably, and let us not forget that growth in Turkey will help to alleviate substantially the concerns that some of our nations have about migratory movements."
"But above all, by opening up to a country that is secular but where the majority religion is Islam, the Union would make a major contribution to peace and mutual understanding between peoples in these times of increasing tension, aggravated mistrust and conflict between Muslim and Christian countries."
"This contribution, over and above its symbolic significance, is of major strategic importance."
"That is the reason for our support."
"It would have merited greater emphasis."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one day the European Union will simply have to decide where its borders are."
"The Union cannot be a kind of vague area that all of its neighbours can enter to do a bit of trade on the sole condition that they abide by a few rules that are interpreted fairly generally."
"If, whenever a country bordering the European Union is or is seeking to become even slightly democratic, we have to agree to its accession, then the Union will continue to spread like an oil stain."
"It will not be truly consistent; it will have no structure and it will have no objective."
"We will have built a regional UN and abandoned the political union, this genuine project that we have nurtured for fifty years."
"We will have created the Europe of the diplomats, but not the Europe of our peoples."
"And that is what the peoples of Europe want."
"Obviously the essential question, as Emma Bonino rightly said just now, is what we want for Europe and what Europe means to us."
"It is clear, I believe, that this is a political, federal Europe that will allow the peoples of Europe to choose their destiny together."
"If we wish to achieve this, however, welcoming a country with such a large population which, geographically speaking, lies outside Europe does not seem to me to be the right way to go about it."
"Secondly, this accession will – as many of those here present have said in the debates that we have held – prompt a long list of new requests for accession."
"The proposed accession of the Maghreb, the proposed accession of Lebanon, the proposed accession of Palestine or Israel: once again we are building a new, revised and updated UN and not the political project of the founding fathers of Europe."
"Finally, Mr President, I would add that in my opinion it is inconceivable to start negotiations with Turkey while it remains silent on the subject of the Armenian genocide – sorry, Mr Rocard, I hope that this request does not shock the leaders of Turkey."
"It is not possible to start these negotiations while the Cyprus issue has not been clarified."
"Finally, it is not possible to start negotiations with Mr Erdogan, who wrote recently in major European newspapers that Turkish troops would never leave Cyprus."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur."
"A lot of people have already said that, but it still needs to be repeated, for the task of bringing together the contradictory amendments really was not a straightforward one."
"I would like to start by addressing both the Eurlings report’s detractors and those who have been opposed to accession negotiations from the outset."
"There are two arguments that they frequently adduce."
"One of them has to do with culture, and if you follow it to its conclusion, you end up attributing differing status to religions and cultures in the European Union, and that bears no relation whatever to the European Union that most of us want."
"A European Union in which one religion is worth more than another, one in which there are superior and subordinate cultures, has nothing to do with the Treaties of Rome."
"The second argument has to do with our over-stretching ourselves, and it is, admittedly, a very important one, one that has to be taken seriously – and also by those of us who are defenders of the Eurlings report and of the enlargement of the European Union."
"It just so happens, though, that we cannot allow ourselves some time out and take a break from world history in order to work on ourselves."
"The world will not wait for us, nor will the challenges of fundamentalism and international terrorism wait until the European Union has become deep enough."
"We have to tackle, at one and the same time, the enlargement of the European Union and the deepening of European integration."
"Let me address those of us who are in favour. By being so, we are committing ourselves to joining with civil society in Turkey in ensuring that Turkey becomes a country free of every kind of torture."
"We are thereby committing ourselves to ensuring that, in Turkey, Kurds, Circassians, Lazs and others can use their mother tongues as well as the official language of the country."
"We are making a commitment that every woman in Turkey will be free to go to school, free to choose her partner and to live in a partnership free of any sort of violence."
"Finally, we are committing ourselves to joining with our friends in Turkey in ensuring that, in Turkey, the Christian churches and all the various faith communities, from Alevis to Sunnis can, together, flourish as they once did during the history of the Ottoman Empire, and that involves the aspiration that the number of Christians should no longer decline, but begin a renewed increase."
"That too would strengthen a multi-cultural and multi-faith Turkey."
"Turkey, too, is entering into an obligation; it is committing itself, through ongoing reforms, to helping us win over the hearts and minds of the European public."
"– Mr President, if it is the wish of the political forces and of the people of Turkey that the country accede to the European Union, because they consider that this will help to develop and democratise it, it is their right to move in that direction."
"We are ready to support this endeavour, as long as Turkey complies with the criteria, the codes of conduct and the preconditions laid down for all the Member States of the Union."
"The main issue which derives from the Copenhagen criteria is respect for the Member States of the European Union with which Turkey is seeking to enter into partnership. One of the Member States is also the Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey has to respect and recognise in the same way as the other 24 members."
"There is no sense in Turkey's seeking to become a member of the European Union and not recognising a member of the Union, just as there is no sense in Turkey's occupying 37% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, in other words territory of a Member State of the European Union and, at the same time, acceding to that Union."
"If Turkey complies with the criteria and the codes of conduct of the European Union, it will be doing itself and the region a favour, by allowing the easing of tension in the region and the development of good neighbourly relations, which will primarily benefit the peoples and countries in the area."
"Τhe Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left never had as their objective the economic isolation and distress of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots."
"Besides, our group supported the financing regulation for the Turkish Cypriots, with the proviso that the Republic of Cyprus would be respected and that no advantages of a political nature would be offered to the occupying regime."
"The underlying cause of the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots is not the so-called 'embargo' on the Greek Cypriot side; it is the Turkish occupation and breakaway action by the occupying regime and the complete interconnection of the economy of the occupied areas with the national economy."
"Following the Turkish invasion and occupation in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus declared its occupied ports and airports closed, because it was unable to exert any control over them."
"This was also an act of self-defence, so that we would not be led into recognising the pseudo-state."
"In reply to the question of reversing the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, the government of the Republic of Cyprus proposed returning the closed section of Ammohostos to its legal residents and opening the port of Ammohostos, together with the Turkish Cypriots, with the objective of its being operated for the benefit of both sides, a proposal which, unfortunately, has not been accepted."
"We hope that Turkey will help open a new chapter in the history of our region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Polish people have special reasons for wishing Turkey great success in the political and economic reforms it has embarked upon."
"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Poland was partitioned and disappeared from maps of Europe and the world for over 100 years, Turkey was the only country not to recognise that state of affairs."
"Both Turkey and the stable development of this country are important today not only for Poland, but also for Europe and for the rest of the world."
"Turkey should become a privileged partner of the European Union, but not a Member State."
"There are a number of facts that speak against opening accession negotiations with Turkey, such as the fact that Turkey is not a European country in terms of geography, religion or culture."
"The political reforms carried out recently were incomplete and far from perfect, and continue to be at odds with everyday practices."
"Turkey has not settled its relations with ethnic and religious minorities living on its territory, or with the neighbouring country of Armenia."
"Turkey does not recognise one of the European Union’s Member States, the Republic of Cyprus, and occupies part of its territory."
"I should like to stress that European countries wishing to join the European Union should be given precedence regarding integration, especially Ukraine."
"In conclusion, given the sceptical views held by the Independence and Democracy Group on strengthening of the European superstate, the Group will vote against the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"In fact, the Group should really be voting in favour, as it is obvious that Turkey’s accession will accelerate the disintegration of the European Union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is it a good idea to start negotiations with Turkey?"
"The answer to that question is neither simple nor a foregone conclusion."
"On the one hand there is Turkey’s legitimate aspiration to join the European Union."
"In fact, we certainly cannot ignore or underestimate either the efforts Turkey has made to achieve concrete legislative and institutional convergence with European criteria or its political perseverance and steadfast conviction that it will come to play an active part in the enlargement of Europe."
"As Europeans, however, we have a duty not to make concessions, because democracy cannot afford them, just as it cannot afford to sell values, human rights or civil freedoms cheaply."
"There is still a great deal to do in these areas in Turkey, especially as regards respect for women and children, the protection of minorities and the abolition of torture and capital punishment."
"In the end there are two problems to solve, two conditions that Turkey cannot avoid: it must restore normal relations both with Armenia, by reopening its border, and with Cyprus."
"In the latter case, the withdrawal of its troops is a precondition for accession, as is its recognition of the Cypriot state."
"Indeed, it is unacceptable that, at the same time as it is applying to join the European Union, not only does Turkey not recognise a Member State like Cyprus but it even keeps thousands of troops on Cypriot soil."
"Thus Turkey will still have to face a long process, which necessarily excludes accession ."
"Realistically, however, we cannot close the door on a Muslim country with secular institutions that is seeking to take a European path of modernisation and development."
"Narrowing the gap with Turkey in fact means sending out an important message to the moderate Muslim world, one that can overcome the extremes of fundamentalism and can initiate a dialogue or a meeting of religions and cultures."
"Mr President, Mr Poettering’s phrase about his concern that this enlargement might prove fatal penetrates today’s debate with the clarity of a laser beam."
"There are indeed eventful times in store for Europe, and yet we in this House must ask whether the EU is even ready to embark on the enterprise that we are planning."
"Are our institutions ready?"
"Do we have a constitution worthy of the name?"
"As things stand, Nice is the ."
"What is the financial position?"
"Where is the financial perspective?"
"What has become of the British rebate?"
"Where is the willingness for real solidarity?"
"To look at it in economic terms, day by day, we see tax dumping, wage dumping and environmental dumping everywhere we look."
"The reality is that the EU has gone stiff."
"If we ask who, at this stage, would benefit from Turkey’s accession, or from negotiations towards that end, the answer is that it would be the ones who do not want what many of us in this House were actually originally working towards, and who seek to weaken the EU."
"What we will end up with is the ‘United Nations of Europe’."
"That is what we already have at global level, and it no longer has much at all to do with the EU."
"The USA and its satellites would benefit, the military-industrial complex would benefit, the big investors would benefit, and this at a time when we are dealing with the greatest peacetime redistribution of wealth in human history."
"To those who say that there is no more to be done and that it is too late, I say, ‘better a terrible end than unending terror.’"
"So, for Europe’s sake, say ‘no’ to these negotiations, or else Europe will be heading for the abyss!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, seeking these negotiations involves the abandonment of two principles."
"For a start, such negotiations would begin before the political criteria were fully complied with."
"Secondly, I am amazed at the Left adopting this approach when there are issues of torture and human rights;"
"I am particularly amazed by their capacity for distinguishing between systematic and non-systematic torture, and I find it quite astonishing that such a distinction should be drawn."
"Quite apart from that, I am not persuaded by the argument that this would reach out to the Islamic world."
"Professor Winkler, perhaps Germany’s most important historian, and a member of the Social Democrat Party, said yesterday that, for historical and other reasons, no such effect could be expected from Turkey, which is, after all, the successor of the Ottoman Empire."
"The Commission’s report is full of doubts."
"Today it tells us that there could be no negotiations on matters affecting finances before 2004, because the EU was not ready."
"There is a permanent question mark against the free movement of labour."
"Even now, in the Commission’s report and, evidently, in the Council Presidency’s preparations, consideration is being given to the possibility of failure, and that is an indication of how mendaciously this matter is being approached."
"Many of those who take a favourable view of it do not ultimately believe that it will work, and that too I regard as unfair to Turkey, which is indeed of such strategic importance to us and which must be helped to become more democratic."
"This ‘all or nothing’ strategy, involving negotiations lasting some ten or fifteen years and even then perhaps without a positive outcome, strikes me as misguided, and that is why we have to find a second option facilitating a European economic area with a privileged partnership or whatever else one wants to call it."
"The fact is that what is at stake here is whether the European Union will survive with its political unity intact and retain its political capacity to act."
"I have to contradict Commissioner Verheugen and say that there is one thing that must be clear at the present time: how can it be said that Turkey absolutely must accede and that Ukraine cannot under any circumstances?"
"Nobody has been able to explain that to me."
"That being so, it follows that both must be accepted as Members, and there is doubt in my mind as to whether the European Union can manage that as things stand at present."
"So let us seek out new ways of giving all these countries the prospect of membership in the EU, while at the same time allowing the European Union to grow politically."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my fellow countryman, Mr Eurlings, who had the onerous task of acting as rapporteur on this very complex issue, and I think he has done an excellent job of it so far."
"Needless to say, we in our group have also closely followed the debate on Turkey and on the question of whether negotiations should be opened."
"In fact, we as a group have recently paid a visit to Turkey to find out for ourselves about the discussions that are going on there, and it has borne out our position."
"In our view, it should, in principle, be possible for Turkey to become a Member State of the European Union, which is, of course, the first question you must answer."
"Turkey’s integration in Europe will be a crucial step, and a symbolic one."
"In this respect, the EU should not, in principle, behave like a closed club, but should open itself up to a country that is guided by European standards."
"We expect Turkish membership to have a positive effect in the future, not least on the developments in what we might call the extended Middle East."
"Progress within Turkey plays an important role too, of course."
"The democratic changes mainly benefit the Turkish people, but Europe also represents the values which Turkey wishes to adopt."
"Turkey is changing fast."
"Over the past few years, Turkey has demonstrated an enormous capacity to reform in many areas, and it is that process that we are keen to support in future."
"In the past, our group has emphasised four aspects."
"First of all, the negotiations are about EU membership."
"We reject any other formula that has a different goal in mind."
"Secondly – and everyone should realise this – the negotiations will be protracted."
"Thirdly, given that the negotiations will take such a long time and so much needs to be done, the opening of the negotiations does not, of course, guarantee a successful outcome from the outset."
"Actual accession will eventually depend on the progress of the reforms and the developments in Turkey itself."
"As far as human rights are concerned, we are positive about the way things are moving at present, provided, of course, that it continues."
"In the event of any regression, there is the express possibility of suspending the negotiations."
"That has happened in the past in the case of Slovakia."
"When we were dissatisfied with the political situation in that country, the negotiations were suspended for a number of years."
"In that respect, there is no discrimination."
"Since all these items can also be found in Mr Eurlings’ report, he can count on our support this week."
"Mr President, it is essential for the sake of our stability as well as morality that we keep faith with Turkey."
"If we agree to start accession negotiations we should see them through."
"I believe that the so-called privileged partnership is a false prospectus designed to drive Turkey away from integration with Europe."
"Turkey has enjoyed a privileged partnership through the Customs Union and also NATO for several years."
"This has brought us to the point of pre-accession."
"Whatever the outcome of the accession negotiations, it is only through the process of the accession negotiations that the European-Turkey relationship will develop."
"Mr Toubon and his friends propose that Turkey be brought into a privileged partnership enjoying some aspects of membership, but without political representation and without the duty to respect European law and the principle of loyal cooperation."
"This is madness: it is bad for Turkey, subversive of the European Union and it displays a vast and astonishing absence of self-confidence inside this Parliament for European projects."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Commission and the presidency to flesh out the proposal for a mechanism to suspend the negotiations should there be a crisis."
"I trust that the European Council will follow the spirit of the Constitution, which requires a third of Member States to trigger such a mechanism and not simply a single truculent member."
"– Mr President, it is my belief that since the beginning of this debate the facts about democracy and the human rights situation have risked being twisted to suit the final objective sought, that is either the accession or non-accession of Turkey."
"One of the merits of Mr Eurlings’s report is precisely that it avoids doing this."
"The report contains a huge amount of very interesting and very precise information about the human rights situation and Mr Eurlings really cannot be accused of toning down certain points in order to strengthen the case for accession."
"This is a great achievement because the challenge was a considerable one."
"It seems to me that some Members nevertheless find themselves in an extremely paradoxical situation, because no one can deny that the prospect of Turkey’s accession is a powerful lever to encourage democratisation."
"Perhaps we have not made sufficient mention in our speeches of the packages of legislative reforms that have been adopted."
"It is right to say that things are not moving quickly enough on the ground."
"But to refuse accession today because the Copenhagen political criteria have not been met would be tantamount to interrupting a process of democratisation supposedly on the grounds of democratic values, which is completely illogical and paradoxical."
"I wish therefore to draw attention to the fact that this position is to some extent a hypocritical one."
"There is also an intermediate strategy which is to accumulate a large number of restrictions and go for accession while simultaneously backing away from it."
"Conditions are imposed and laid down and alternatives are sought."
"I think that Mr Brok is right, but I do not draw the same conclusions as he does: to set out a half-hearted accession strategy is to prepare for failure."
"What we need is an open, full and complete accession, which is also absolutely rigorous."
"If we work towards these two objectives we will, I believe, make a success of the multicultural Europe that we want to see created with Turkey’s accession."
"– Mr President, the large majority of my political group supports in principle the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"However, we believe that the Eurlings report requires amendments which will strengthen our demand for real compliance by the Turkish leadership with European standards; amendments which will counterbalance the unacceptable pressure of the United States administration on the Dutch Presidency for the ' – in other words more or less unconditional – accession of Turkey to the European Union."
"Turkey's long, arduous and uncertain journey towards accession needs changes in deed, not just in word."
"I call on the European Commission to process immediately a roadmap with a specific and verifiable timetable for the application of the Copenhagen political criteria, with particular emphasis on the recognition of Cyprus by Turkey and the withdrawal of the Turkish occupying forces from the northern part of the island, visible progress in resolving the problems of the Kurdish people, the safeguarding of human rights and the drafting of a new constitution."
"In Greece, my homeland, we hope that this difficult journey towards Europe, which is due to start for Turkey in a few days' time, will make it a better, democratic and peace-loving neighbour, a demand which is also motivating the civil society in our neighbouring country."
"– Mr President, representatives of the nations of Europe, ladies and gentlemen, obviously we French sovereignists will be voting against this report, but we would like to underline the fact that this debate is not really a debate at all."
"Essentially, as we well know, the decision was made some time ago: not in 1999 in Helsinki, not even in Europe, but in Washington, several years earlier, and it was moreover announced by President Clinton when he visited Istanbul in 1997."
"This explains Mr Erdogan’s unbelievable arrogance, because he knows perfectly well that his accession is in the bag. I repeat that he is supported by the United States and the fact that he is surprised that some countries are hesitating is the epitome of arrogance."
"That is the case of my own country, France."
"He should be reminded – and the President of the French Republic is obliged to take account of this – that France is still a democracy and that it has the right to hesitate."
"His arrogance is also shown by his refusal to address two issues that I will mention only by name because they have already been touched on here."
"Why refuse so obstinately to recognise the dreadful Armenian genocide?"
"I have tabled a written statement on this subject, which recalls in particular that twice, in 1987 and 1990, this Parliament refused to open negotiations of any kind for as long as this genocide was not recognised."
"It is astonishing that this Parliament should be adopting such an illogical position and that it should be so untrue to itself."
"I will also mention the Cyprus issue."
"It is quite staggering that a country should wish to join a club of states, an assembly of states, a federation of states – whatever it is, we do not know – without recognising one of its members."
"It is true that this European Union is no stranger to illogical positions of this sort."
"The reality is that I do not know quite what we are in the process of building here; a hotchpotch maybe, but it clearly has nothing to do with Europe."
"Mr President, reading this report, it is obvious that the rapporteur and the majority that supports the report are quite clear about the profound differences between Turkey and the EU."
"It is not merely a question of having to make a few economic adjustments, but of Turkey and the EU being two widely different civilisations whose values are incompatible."
"In the light of this report, no responsible politician can come to any conclusion other than that Turkey does not belong in the EU and that there is no basis for embarking upon accession negotiations."
"That is not, however, the way in which the majority of the European Parliament thinks."
"The operative belief in this House is that we should all like to become Germans: not the bad old Germans who finally suffered defeat in 1945, but the good new Germans with their unimpeachable opinions who obediently agreed to give up the Deutschmark and accept the euro, who are destroying the German economy and throwing tens of thousands of people into unemployment; the good Germans who, without so much as a murmur, are allowing millions of foreigners to move in and destroy German culture from within."
"In this way, the EU is trying to change us all, and the majority in this House believes that the Turks can be changed in the same way."
"Turkey is not Europe, however."
"The Turks do not want to be Germans, a fact that we can, of course, see clearly in Germany."
"There is a reason for Turkey’s countless problems, and that reason is a civilisation that has damaging effects upon the development of society."
"What the EU is saying is, in actual fact, that Turkey should give up its Muslim culture."
"Mr Schulz said it clearly in this House today: Turkey must adopt all our laws and values."
"A country’s culture cannot be taken away from it; or, rather, any attempt to do so takes centuries."
"That is why the demands will hardly be fulfilled; but, in ten years’ time, this Parliament will adopt a splendid report to the effect that the demands have been fulfilled, irrespective of the fact that everyone knows that that is not the case."
"The peoples of Europe are opposed to Turkish accession to the EU."
"The strongest opponents are the Greek Cypriots, who are the European people that has most recently been at war with Turkey and the northern part of whose country is still occupied by Turkey."
"The people do not, however, count in the EU, which is ruled by a self-styled elite which, even if it has only 45% of the voters behind it, has no compunction about exerting its will over the people."
"Cyprus is directly threatened with exclusion …"
"Mr President, is this the European Union or do some have expansionist ambitions beyond the boundaries of Europe?"
"That is a key and defining question which arises from Turkey's application for EU membership."
"Turkey is not part of Europe, it is part of Asia: only a finger of land flanking Istanbul lies in Europe."
"That does not make it a European nation."
"You might as well say that Spain is African because it has some outposts on the North African coast."
"It is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey."
"Witness its genocide of the Armenian people. Witness also, despite the massive inducements of pre-accession aid from Brussels, its intolerant suppression of religious freedom, in particular with regard to Christians."
"No – Turkey is one country and culture that we can well do without."
"Mr President, many of us on this side of the House are very supportive of Turkey's EU membership."
"Over the past 80 years enormous changes have taken place in Turkey; the process of reform has accelerated dramatically since the formal recognition in 1999 of Turkey as a candidate for the European Union."
"Many of us also recall that Turkey has been a staunch ally in NATO for some 50 years and that during much of that time the country was subject to terrorist attacks by organisations sponsored by the Soviet Union."
"Those of us who are supportive of Turkey are under no illusions about the challenges ahead and the work still to be done."
"That is why we recognise that negotiations are likely to take 10 or 15 years."
"The alarmists talk as if Turkey is going to join in a month's time."
"Turkey has many very successful industrial sectors and a vibrant economy in many respects, but it is still a poor country."
"The economic challenges are formidable but the potential rewards are great."
"Much still needs to be done to improve human rights, but let us not forget that some extremist groups misuse the label of human rights in order to promote sympathy for their own cause."
"It would be naive of those of us on the centre right in European politics to give any comfort to political groups that are closely linked to terrorists."
"We could talk at length about Cyprus."
"It is not Turkey that should be in the dock."
"Turkish Cypriots, fully backed by Ankara, supported the United Nations plan which, among other features, would have phased out the non-Cypriot forces from the island, both Turkish and Greek."
"Many say that Turkish accession would fundamentally change the nature of the EU."
"If this means an end to the inexorable drive towards political integration and the end of the idea of some European state, then I welcome this."
"I share concerns about free movement of people, but this is a problem wider than Turkish accession."
"At this time, four days before the European Council meets, we need to send a strong positive signal to Turkey that it is welcome as a member of the European Union."
"This signal will have wider positive reverberations."
"Let us give the green light now to the opening of negotiations with Turkey, not grudgingly, but with enthusiasm."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Parliament will send a clear message to the European Council of 17 December, a message to open negotiations with Turkey with a view to its accession."
"That is the right response in keeping with the considerable progress that has been achieved in that country, as emerges from the Commission’s thorough, in-depth report."
"The opening of negotiations will, of course, involve a long time-frame as well as further profound changes both for Turkey and for the European Union itself."
"In the current situation, that seems to be the only path that can be proposed."
"I have heard mention of special partnerships to replace the prospect of accession if Turkey proves unable to take the Community on board."
"Opening negotiations does not mean automatically guaranteeing accession to the Union, but mentioning other prospects at this point in time can only make our counterparts rightly suspicious about what the Twenty-Five genuinely want."
"Let us try, therefore, to be clear and transparent and to give that country a real chance."
"It will then be the political will of our current and future leaders, and especially of the Turkish people, that will decide the future of our relationship."
"Let us not give any excuse to the opponents of democracy and secularity in that country, or we may bitterly regret it."
"I would say to Mr Camre that my country has had the crime of honour and the annulment of the crime of rape through marriage as part of its legal system, but I would never dream of saying that it was due to our Catholic culture."
"I therefore ask him to rethink that point."
"Mr President, this is an extremely important report that comes at a time when the leaders of the Member States have still not put the finishing touches to the conclusions from the weekend summit."
"It is not easy to interpret what will happen if the President-in-Office of the Council is listened to."
"That is why it is important for ourselves in the European Parliament to send out a strong and clear signal, and I hope that Mr Eurlings’ report will be adopted with a broad majority."
"Turkey is a long-standing issue on the European agenda."
"Its membership is controversial in many countries."
"This disquiet is something that we must, of course, take seriously."
"We in this House, together with all the European leaders, have a major task in trying to explain the advantages of Turkish membership."
"I personally am convinced that a democratically and economically stable Turkey would be a great asset to the EU."
"Turkey could become a bridge between Europe and the Muslim world and provide us with significant opportunities to solve common problems and fight fanaticism and terrorism."
"Our common Europe is not a Christian project."
"It is a union of values, and Turkey is now working hard and single-mindedly to adopt these values."
"Progress in Turkey is impressive and must be encouraged."
"That is why, this weekend, Turkey must be given a date."
"Those who are opponents of Turkey argue as if Turkey was to become a member tomorrow."
"That is not, of course, the case."
"The process will be a long one, taking perhaps 15 years."
"In fifteen years’ time, both the EU and Turkey, as well as the world in general, will look different."
"By then, the EU, and Turkey too, must change."
"Mr Eurlings’ report contains a long list of measures that Turkey must implement before its membership can become a reality."
"These are non-negotiable."
"They concern Cyprus, human rights and, especially, the situation of the Kurds."
"The large Kurdish minority must be recognised and be given full linguistic, cultural and political rights."
"A majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has approved this report, and I believe and hope that it will be adopted by a large majority in the vote on Wednesday."
"Any decision at the summit other than that of embarking upon negotiations – negotiations aimed, moreover, at full membership – would be a major failure."
"Mr President, today’s debate on Turkish accession, on which we have to decide, shows how weakened, unsure of itself and divided this House is."
"The lines of division cut across every camp and every group, and ultimately reflect the insecurity of the public in the EU."
"What is the source of this weakness and this insecurity?"
"Is it because we are late – too late – in thinking about, and becoming aware of, the fact that we are, by this decision, defining Europe, setting down its borders and giving European integration its final form, and that we are doing this without giving voice to it, without having talked to each other about it, without having consulted Europe’s parliaments, and without having conducted the necessary public debate?"
"Is it because we were unable to persuade most of the public to accept Turkey as a member?"
"Is it because the entitlement of Heads of State or Government to define Europe behind closed doors, out of sight of parliament and public, is more than precarious, and all the more so if you read the European treaties?"
"Defining what Europe is is a matter for parliaments, not for the Heads of State or Government."
"For they did it, in 1999, behind closed doors, without consulting parliaments, without advice from the Commission."
"That is no basis for such a dramatic step."
"Are there really so few grounds for suspecting that some of its advocates want to use Turkish accession to finally smother the founding fathers’ conception of a European federal state?"
"And if we are to talk in terms of ‘levers for democracy’ and ‘peace dividends’, why are we not giving absolute priority to the accession of the Balkan states, which would transform a region constantly ravaged by crisis and war into an oasis of peace?"
"As for the last ‘lever for democracy’ argument, well, yes, if we can transform countries and states into democracies ..."
"What exactly is Turkey today?"
"It is both first world and third world in one single state."
"It may be possible to describe Turkey today in the same way as Count Mirabeau described Prussia, namely not so much a state with an army but an army with a state."
"What could Turkey be or what should it be?"
"It could and should be a normal European state with wide-ranging guarantees of civil rights and guaranteed stable relations with neighbouring countries, whereby all of Turkey’s neighbours must be given an internationally binding guarantee."
"It must also, of course, be a state in which social rights are respected and in which trade unions can be freely established by those who wish to do so."
"Furthermore, it must be a stable economic project, which will entail investment in the east of the country, and be able to banish the centuries of backwardness."
"This means that Turkey must become European and not that Europe must become Turkish, which would result in the degeneration of the European project into a free trade area."
"When Mr Schröder recently called Mr Erdogan his friend, he meant that ..."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the ghosts of Adenauer, de Gaulle and Spaak were in the House, they would shiver merely at the idea of what we are debating here."
"Not that we are deciding to allow Turkey to join the European Union."
"It is true that, if the United States did not want Turkey to join Europe, no such question would be on the agenda today."
"The question which arises therefore is institutional: are we an independent political entity or are we a trailer hitched to the American truck?"
"What is Turkey?"
"Since when has Turkey been in Europe?"
"Ask your own children."
"Ask your children who study geography if it is in Europe or in Asia."
"Ask the priest who married you if Turkey is in Europe."
"Which brings me to the Eurlings report: the original differs from the report we are debating today just as the Holy Bible differs from the Koran."
"And while we are on the subject of the Holy Bible, may I remind you of the multitude of races housed many centuries ago in the Tower of Babel."
"It fell. If you too wish Europe to fall, bring 80 million Turks with a different culture and different religion into Europe."
"When de Gaulle built Europe with the other Europeans, he said that Europe was determined by her geography, her Greco-Roman culture and the Christian religion."
"So now we are going to bring the Turks into Europe."
"That will be a crime for Europe."
"Do not commit it."
"Mr President, this week is undoubtedly an historically important one for the broader development of the European Union."
"The European Parliament will vote on whether it supports the opening of accession talks between Turkey and the EU."
"Leaders of the 25 governments of the European Union meeting in Brussels later this week will formally give the go-ahead – or not – to accession negotiations between the European Union and the Turkish Government."
"Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this decision."
"There is no acceptable middle ground when it comes to the issue of membership of the European Union."
"A country is either a member of the European Union or it is not."
"This is the crux of the matter."
"I believe that a country seeking to join the European Union must clearly comply with all aspects of the Copenhagen criteria."
"One must recall that the European Commission carried out an evaluation report on the progress that Turkey has made in its efforts to join the European Union."
"In this report last October the Commission stated that the Turkish Government had brought forward a significant package of proposals this year which included the following: the abolition of State Security Courts, which would ensure that civil-military relations are brought into line with EU standards, the strengthening of the freedom of the press, the introduction of a constitutional clause on gender equality, and removal of all references to the death penalty."
"In the last election my own party had a slogan which stated: 'A lot done, more to do'."
"I believe that this is the case here."
"More needs to be done, but a lot has been done and we must recognise that."
"I support the terms of the today's report which states that the European Council should vote for accession negotiations with Turkey to begin without delay and the objective of these negotiations is Turkey's EU membership."
"But there is also a realisation that further substantial political reforms are going to have to take place in Turkey before final accession negotiations can conclude."
"It was intimated earlier in this debate that one of the reasons why Turkey should be kept out of the European Union is because Turkish people are not Christian."
"Surely that flies in the face of the very thing that Christianity stands for."
"Christianity is about being open and welcoming to people."
"I believe that we should be open and welcoming and let these negotiations begin."
"Mr President, for the French members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the question is not about Turkey."
"The question is: ‘What kind of Europe do we want?’"
"We have always wanted a political Europe in tune with world affairs, a Europe of integration and not of differentiation, a Europe of common policy and not of variable geometry."
"Turkey is a great country, a great people and a major civilisation. It would be unrealistic, patronising and even degrading to seek to absorb, realign and weaken the historical greatness of that world."
"To accept Turkey’s accession to the EU is to accept the risk of Europe becoming a society of nations, a preacher unable to practise what he preaches; of Europe dissolving into a strategic alliance that used to be against Communism, and will in the future be against terrorism; of Europe being transformed into a kind of worldwide Euro-Asian trade organisation. In other words, there is a risk that Europe will become wide open and bereft of power."
"The Europe that we want is not diversity at the expense of unity; it is unity in diversity, in the words of the draft Constitution maxim."
"This about the European Union’s Project; jumping the gun is not a project!"
"The EU is no longer accepted by its citizens."
"Europe must be built by working with the peoples, not by ignoring them."
"It is this concept of common interest between Europe and Turkey that led us to submit essential amendments to this House, in collaboration with our German friends."
"I shall not detail them here, but I shall merely say that it is only by means of a privileged partnership that we can create strong ties between the futures of Turkey and Europe, without compromising either the European Project or Turkey’s historical role between Europe and Asia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must be resolute: let us dare to fight together through the fog of diplomatic conformism, to stare reality in the face and to propose to Turkey a fraternal relationship of equals with the political Union of Europe."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Eurlings on the quality of his report and in particular on his ability to listen."
"I feel that the compromises that we have reached, as my group has said time and time again, are perfectly acceptable."
"Having listened to these debates, however, I do wonder – indeed, Mr Toubon – what we want for Europe."
"Today I have heard the best and the worst and I should like to say this to you now."
"We have managed to influence a democratic transformation in Turkey, with the will of the Turkish people, but without tanks, without rifles and without arms."
"As we have said, it has been a democratic revolution."
"We have managed to propagate the European democratic model by peaceful means."
"In my opinion, the challenge that we have almost – not completely, but almost – overcome was a major challenge and let me say that I am proud of that Europe, the Europe that feels no fear in its belly, the Europe that does not say ‘I reject that culture’."
"We are aware that much remains to be done."
"We are aware of the Cyprus question."
"We are aware that human rights must continue to improve."
"We are aware that the question of the Kurds remains."
"We are aware that there are women’s issues."
"We are aware – and on this issue I appeal to my Turkish friends – of the problem of the Armenian genocide."
"Acknowledging these problems will make you greater, not smaller."
"I should also like to say, however, that those of us who want open and transparent negotiations also want a complete partnership for Turkey with no restrictive clauses."
"Turkey is, certainly, Mr Toubon, a great country, a great culture, and we should be honoured to bring it into the EU, provided that it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria, but only the Copenhagen criteria."
"Mr President, the real question before us is simply ‘What Europe do we want?’"
"Do we want a simple free-trade zone or do we actually want to build a political Europe destined to play a leading role in the world?"
"It is that question and that question only that the Heads of State or Government must answer on 17 December."
"From Council to Council, from summit to summit, crucial decisions for our future have been taken without our Heads of State or Government ever spending a day, or even a few hours, debating the core issues relating to those decisions."
"This is not an example of our institutions functioning responsibly."
"We cannot continue to make decisions on the future of our Union on the quiet, almost mechanically, without involving the peoples of Europe in the debates."
"We are told today that we have gone too far to turn back, yet at the same time we are told that there will always be time to address this question in ten or fifteen years."
"This is entirely inconsistent."
"I am a committed European and I feel that we must build a political and democratic Europe in which the citizens will finally take part. The more Europe continues to embark on unlimited enlargement, the greater the risk that it will be permanently weakened."
"One thing that I do know is that the world needs Europe."
"The balance of the world depends on Europe’s existence; democracy and peace depend on Europe’s existence."
"Let us not throw away that chance."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, as has been mentioned, the majority of human rights activists in Turkey – Leyla Zana among them – are of the opinion that a positive decision on the Turkish application to join the EU will contribute to an improvement in Turkish policy on ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities."
"They have good reasons for saying this."
"Human rights activists in Latvia were of the same opinion when discussions on Latvia's candidacy for membership of the EU were held."
"Unfortunately, Latvian human rights activists are now highly disillusioned."
"It is true that under pressure from the European institutions some changes were made in legislation concerning problems essential for minorities."
"However, these changes were cosmetic."
"For example, improvements to the law on languages were intended to benefit only one particular linguistic minority: English-speaking businessmen."
"We see the same urgent cosmetic steps taking place in Turkey."
"For example, the Turkish Government has allowed private language centres to open, offering courses in Kurdish, Romanian and other tongues."
"A private language centre is something essentially different from what we would recognise as a school – a term used in Mr Eurlings' report."
"My country, Latvia, became a Member State of the EU, in spite of the fact that the Latvian authorities did not recognise the rights of linguistic minorities."
"It was a mistake for EU institutions not to use Latvia's accession process to promote the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria."
"This history must not be repeated in the case of Turkish accession."
"We hope that in 15 years Turkey will fulfil the political criteria completely."
"We call on the Commission to use every opportunity to urge the Turkish Government to recognise the Kurdish minority in the country and to create the conditions necessary for this minority to be respected and protected."
"– Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece opposes the European Union and its enlargement and, in this sense, we do not agree with the accession of Turkey, not for ethnic, chauvinist or cultural reasons, but on the same political grounds on which we also disagreed with Greece's accession to and its remaining in the European Union."
"Nonetheless, we wish to raise certain very serious issues about both the policy of the European Union and about the Eurlings report."
"The Council texts to date, like the aforementioned report, fail to mention or hush up both the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the occupation of part of an independent Member State of the UN, which is now also a Member State of the European Union."
"The Turkish Government also provokingly refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and to withdraw its recognition of the pseudo-state."
"We ask you, if this were happening in France, Britain, Italy or Germany, would you open negotiations with such a state?"
"Whatever happened to equality between the Member States of the European Union?"
"Secondly, Turkish governments have raised new issues of border differences with Greece which have been clearly resolved under international treaties, and the only problem which remains to be resolved is the demarcation of the continental shelf in the Aegean."
"The European Union legalised these claims during the course of discussions, with the decision taken at Helsinki."
"Turkey's aggressiveness in the Aegean is becoming bolder by the day, with dozens of airspace violations."
"Thirdly, the report refers to very important progress with democratisation;"
"Mr Eurlings was obviously misled when he went to Turkey and is no longer listening to us."
"Perhaps Mr Eurlings visited some other country rather than Turkey?"
"There have been limited rather than material changes ..."
"Mr President, the June List does not view Turkey’s geographical position or its Muslim religion as obstacles to membership of the EU."
"Turkey is important for Europe."
"We welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU and working to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"We must not, however, close our eyes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible."
"Turkey must draw a line under its past and acknowledge the Armenian genocide."
"It must give its minorities full human rights."
"It must achieve a level of economic development such that full membership does not release tensions that may threaten the internal market."
"The EU must also change."
"The common agricultural policy must be abolished, and structural policy must be revised before Turkey, large and poor as it is, can be absorbed."
"Decisions that have already been made mean that it is all but impossible to bring about a comprehensive reform of agricultural policy until after 2013."
"To ensure grass-roots support, membership negotiations should, moreover, only be embarked upon once the issue has been debated in the Member States’ election campaigns over the next few years."
"Finally, the issue of the EU’s constitution must be solved before we begin to negotiate concerning Turkish membership."
"Full Turkish membership is a very long-term issue, requiring major and sweeping political and economic changes in both Turkey and the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the question has been phrased incorrectly."
"It is not a matter of whether Turkey does or does not already meet the EU’s requirements."
"It is a matter of whether we want a Muslim Turkey in a Europe that was built on Christian values."
"There has been talk in this House of the progress made by Turkey."
"As a psychologist, I believe the fate of every single person is important, but I know that not everything that is important for people can be measured."
"The emotions and feelings of Europe’s citizens are also important, and most of the latter are opposed to Turkey joining the EU."
"I have been observing Muslims in Brussels for 20 years, and I would not want such a large country to have any influence on the fate of my country, Poland, within the framework of the European Union."
"In 50 years our worlds may be ready to meet, but no earlier."
"We should provide assistance to Muslims in their own countries, and help bring about the rapid creation of a state of Palestine, as that nation has suffered greatly at the hands of Israel."
"This is something I am in favour of, and something that urgently needs to be implemented."
"We have no commitments towards Turkey."
"We should not act in a hypocritical manner, and we should not be afraid to say ‘no’ to Turkey..."
"Mr President, Mr Toubon has asked what sort of Europe we want."
"Those who want an integrated Europe, the Europe envisaged in the Constitutional Treaty, cannot accept Turkey as a full member."
"Turkey is an important partner, and we want it to remain one in future, but in a privileged partnership and not as a full member of the EU."
"Turkey claims that it has been promised full membership for the past forty-one years."
"That is not the case."
"The 1963 Ankara Agreement had a customs union as its objective; one was promised, and it has been in place for nine years."
"Even before accession negotiations have been set in motion, Turkey is now demanding of us full membership without any ifs or buts."
"That is extortion."
"That may be how you do politics in Turkey, but it is not how it is done in the EU."
"The Copenhagen criteria apply to all candidates for accession."
"The major problems Turkey has with democracy, freedom of opinion, human rights, the rights of minorities, with its neighbours in Armenia and Cyprus, and with the Kurds, have caused it to be decided that Turkey must fulfil the political criteria before negotiations can start."
"There is no doubt that, even today, these conditions have not yet been met."
"The Commission says so too."
"Why it is that negotiations are to be opened despite that is a secret known only to the Council and to the Commission."
"We do not want full membership, but a privileged partnership with a special status that both parties – the EU and Turkey – can cope with."
"If accession negotiations are opened even though they go against our better judgment, they must be open-ended and capable of resulting in an alternative outcome in line with what we want."
"To offer such a thing to Turkey is honest, sensible, politically far-sighted and forward-looking."
"Turkey is not a European country and will not become one; that is why the demands of Europe’s and Turkey’s future together are best met by a privileged partnership."
"– Mr President, in December 1999, the European Council in Helsinki sent a clear message to Turkey in its decision on Turkey's actual rather than notional candidacy and by creating a clear framework of terms, preconditions and criteria which Turkey had to implement."
"This unanimous EU policy has made a decisive contribution over the last five years to important reforms in Turkey."
"It would be a mistake for us to disparage the progress achieved, just as it would be a mistake for us to create an idyllic picture because, although it is commonly accepted that there has been an improvement in the human rights and minority rights situation, that an important amount of legislation has been passed, that the situation is not the same as in the past, as Leila Zanna also confirmed to us in the European Parliament, there is still a serious deficit in the implementation of European principles and the ."
"However, as in 1999, the present motion which the European Parliament is being called on to adopt and the decision which the European Council will take must also contain a clear message: a message concerning the opening of accession negotiations in accordance with the decisions taken by the European Council in 2005, with the final objective of accession to the ΕU if Turkey completes the negotiations successfully."
"However, this message should not be seen as ."
"On the contrary, it must include a clear European agenda and a roadmap with a specific timetable for the implementation of Turkey's obligations."
"We must not, under any circumstances, give the impression that Turkey can negotiate '' and have its own agenda."
"Within this framework, what is of decisive importance is Turkey's obligation to respect minority rights, the rights of the Greek minorities in Istanbul, Imvros and Tenedos, to respect the ecumenical character of the Patriarchate, to re-open the Halki seminary immediately, to respect international law, to help resolve operational problems on the basis of a specific timetable, with referral to the International Court of Justice in the Hague and, finally, to proceed with the international recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and the gradual withdrawal of the occupying army."
"In particular, as far as the question of the diplomatic recognition of Cyprus is concerned, I should like to hear the opinion of the Dutch Presidency and of Mr Nicolaï as to what the position of the Dutch Presidency is in the run-up to the European Council."
"Our decisions need to make clear that it is the European Union which lays down the framework, not the candidate, not Turkey."
"Turkey needs to overcome its fears and reconcile itself with its historic past, even with the negative aspects, which it needs to have the courage to acknowledge."
"In return, however, certain political forces in Europe should not cultivate fears for internal reasons or fabricate catastrophic scenarios."
"To close ..."
"Thank you, Mr Vice-President."
"For many years Turkey has been our neighbour, ally and partner."
"For many years it has also been a candidate with a successful market economy waiting for the date to begin negotiations."
"In that respect it is very different from Ukraine."
"Turkey is like a long, heavy train that moves with difficulty but since its move to democracy many years ago, the train has begun to move more quickly and more safely."
"We are allowing the Turkish European train to enter a tunnel."
"Not even the Orient Express has room to manoeuvre in there."
"Trains do not slalom."
"They cannot turn round in tunnels."
"Turkey must move forward to democracy and into Europe and there is no other possibility."
"I support the enlargement of the European Union and the europeanisation of Turkey."
"No other mechanism of the European Union will bring more stability, more vision and more development to the East than the announcement of the date for Turkey."
"Turkey would readily recognise Cyprus if the whole of Cyprus was in the European Union."
"When the whole of Cyprus is in the European Union, there will no longer be any Turkish troops there."
"This is the way to achieve strategic changes and strategic goals."
"This is why I support Europe and why I give my support to Turkey."
"Thank you very much."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur for a balanced report."
"Turkey’s cultural roots are more diverse than most of us realise."
"They are also to be found in the cultures of Europe, the Caucasus and the Mediterranean."
"Turkey’s accession would enrich our culture."
"We now have to fulfil the promise Turkey was given during the Finnish Presidency."
"This would be a logical extension to the founding and enlargement of the European Union to strengthen peace."
"The counter-arguments are illogical."
"If Islam were a barrier, we would be declaring that the 15 million Muslims, three times the population of Finland, who now live in EU countries are second class citizens."
"Those who recall the military campaigns by the Ottomans might well want to remember Sweden’s military campaigns, for example, in centuries gone by."
"It is important, however, that Turkey’s membership only comes about if the country meets the criteria that relate to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and a respect for the rights of minorities."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Council will set an exact date for the start of negotiations, in the knowledge that that date will mark the beginning of a long journey, the outcome of which will largely depend on the additional transformations that take place in Turkey during that time."
"We must reject all forms of racism from those who are trying to make religion a basis for discrimination."
"The coexistence of religions and cultures is the only future for a democratic and multiethnic Europe."
"A solution to the Cyprus issue, full respect for human rights and political acknowledgement of the ongoing conflict in Kurdistan, as well as a commitment to finding a peaceful solution and an immediate, and obviously bilateral, cessation of hostilities should all be at the core of the negotiations with Turkey."
"We have actually been asked to start the negotiations by the Kurdish democratic organisations and the human rights associations in Turkey – which are still suffering on a daily basis and are witnessing terrible injustices – so that they can involve the whole of Europe in their battle for democracy and respect for human rights."
"In fact, while we acknowledge the changes that have been made so far to the constitution and the criminal code, there can be no doubt that they are not enough."
"There is still a great deal to do, such as cutting back the power of the army, which must be brought under the control of the executive and legislative powers, amending electoral law and allowing the Kurdish language to be spoken in official proceedings."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall only utter a few words to say that Turkey should not join the European Union because Turkey is not in Europe!"
"Mr President, the possibility of Turkey’s eventual accession to the European Union brings us face to face with a historical responsibility."
"It is a fact – and let me repeat this – that neither geographically, politically, culturally nor economically speaking is Turkey a European country."
"Moreover, it is an Islamic country where, as in all Islamic countries, other religions are barely tolerated, if at all."
"It is a country that fails to meet any of the accession conditions."
"The historical responsibility that we bear is in respect of those European citizens who – quite rightly – do not want this Turkish accession, and who should not be forced to swallow an undemocratic decision."
"Furthermore, our society is already paying a high toll for the fact that on our Continent, millions of people of non-European origin sometimes find it very difficult to coexist with the indigenous population."
"Turkey’s accession, with free movement for 70 and, soon 100, million Islamic, non-Europeans, will only exacerbate these problems exponentially and can lead to much worse."
"We therefore demand a referendum in which the European citizens can speak out in favour, or rather against, this potential Turkish accession."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, on his excellent work and on the spirit of cooperation which he has demonstrated throughout the procedure."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we say yes to Turkey's European prospects."
"At the same time, however, we would remind you that these prospects are connected with compliance with the political and financial criteria analysed in the texts of the conclusions of the European Councils from Copenhagen to Helsinki and in Brussels in a few days' time."
"Examining the report, I should like to comment in particular on certain paragraphs, such as:"
"- paragraph 37, which creates the framework for the defence of and respect for the rights of minorities among which, of course, the Greeks in Istanbul, Imvros and Tenedos are the most important;"
"- paragraph 38, which lists the preconditions and, more importantly, what Turkey has to do in relation to Cyprus: mainly, to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and to withdraw Turkish forces from the northern part of Cyprus;"
"- paragraph 40, which presents a multi-dimensional methodological approach to the resolution of any outstanding disputes with neighbouring states and, of course, which mentions the obligation to abstain from threats and provocation."
"This paragraph also covers relations between Greece and Turkey."
"Finally, I recommend that the House vote in favour of the Eurlings report."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to add my congratulations to Mr Eurlings on his report."
"It is no easy task."
"I used to be the rapporteur on Turkey too, but of course that role has now become even more difficult."
"The European Union would be making a grave error if, after many years of promises to Turkey, it were now to turn round suddenly and say no at a time when Turkey is taking its mission seriously."
"We have helped Turkey a great deal in the past few months and years, and we shall have to continue that assistance."
"Nevertheless, let me say that the crucial question, in my view, is this: will Turkish membership make Europe stronger or weaker?"
"We should say quite openly and in all honesty that what is at stake here is the Europe we as Members of Parliament must fight to achieve."
"If, as Mr Schulz said today, Turkey reforms itself, if it changes its position on human rights, on Cyprus, on the border issue, on regional cooperation – if that Turkey becomes a member of the European Union, it will make Europe stronger."
"It is quite interesting, by the way, to observe how the initial American euphoria which greeted the recommendation that Turkey should indeed become part of the Union has waned somewhat, because the United States of America is now no longer certain whether it really wants to see the European Union strengthened in this way by the addition of an independent Turkey that thinks and acts for itself; be that as it may, if Turkey does accede to the European Union, it will have to shed some of its nationalism."
"I am very much in favour of backing the report and also of launching the negotiations."
"We must, however, tell Turkey that it will be a long and difficult path."
"Turkey has made enormous strides over the past two to three years."
"I am certainly in a position to judge that, and I congratulate Turkey on it, but it will take many years before Europe can rest assured that a new Turkey, a different Turkey, is joining the European Union."
"I support opening accession negotiations with Turkey and if Turkey fulfils the accession criteria, I support Turkey’s accession."
"I know that Turkey is far from this goal, but I sincerely hope that it will be able to meet the criteria, as it is in everyone’s best interest."
"I support Turkey’s accession on meeting the criteria even though I know that it would have significant consequences for Europe’s future."
"We are accustomed to a Europe consisting of a community of values based on a common cultural heritage, a common past and common traditions."
"The Europe that includes Turkey will be a different Europe."
"That Europe will be a community of political goals based on common interest."
"But I believe that we need this."
"Turkey’s accession is of paramount importance if Europe really wants to act on the stage of world politics and if it wants to rid itself of the role of a spectator."
"Turkey’s membership is also indispensable if we want to influence Middle Eastern, central Asian or Caucasian processes."
"And if we do not exert influence on these regions, then these regions will exert a very negative and dangerous influence on us."
"Turkey has an important value for all of us: its accession is of great interest and therefore I support opening the accession negotiations."
"Mr President, the debate about Turkey has always been awash with duplicity."
"That duplicity was already being practised in Helsinki back in 1999, when Turkey was given applicant status, and so many had no wish whatsoever to see it in the Union; the same situation has obtained ever since."
"The present progress report from the Commission bears detailed testimony to the fact that Turkey is not fulfilling a single one of the Copenhagen pre-accession criteria."
"So what conclusion does the Commission draw?"
"It recommends the start of accession talks."
"That is absolutely schizophrenic and irresponsible."
"Now this European Parliament is poised to do precisely the same thing, to make exactly the same mistake."
"Why?"
"Is it driven by national interest or party-political considerations – in other words, by self-interest – or is one of its motives quite simply fear?"
"Do we really want to negotiate with a country in which fundamental human rights are not respected, in which women are second-class citizens, in which virginity tests, forced marriages and honour killings are normal occurrences and bigamy is tolerated?"
"These things expose women to lifelong torture, and it is irresponsible to negotiate with such a country."
"In that country, in that Turkey, the prevailing mentality surely has to change first; something has to happen in people’s minds."
"This cannot be done by compulsion."
"People have to be persuaded; they have to be won over by a convincing political case."
"This is the way to achieve a permanent change of mentality."
"It cannot be quickly engineered within ten years."
"It takes at least two to three generations, so why can we not give this country the time it needs?"
"Besides, we all know that we simply cannot afford Turkish membership with its impact on the integration, the finances and the security of the Union."
"The political European Union would not be able to digest the addition of that country, and therein lies the duplicity of the whole discussion to date, and particularly of the Commission’s proposal to make Turkey a second-class Member State."
"With a second-class Member State, with different grades of membership, our political union would eventually cease to function."
"We would be digging our own grave."
"The only honest offer we can make to Turkey is a privileged partnership, a special neighbourly relationship, and I urge the House to support that approach."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999 and 2002 the Heads of State or Government entered into an international commitment to Turkey, which they must honour on 17 December."
"The negotiations must begin, not only to sustain the reform process in Turkey but also for the sake of the international credibility of the European Union."
"It will not, however, be a day of great rejoicing."
"For the first time in the history of the European Union, there is widespread public opposition to the accession of a state."
"People are not convinced that Turkey can become a truly European country."
"In the parliamentary debate too, whenever I hear anyone cite one of the benefits of Turkish membership, it is saddled with far more ifs and buts than are normally raised in connection with such a momentous decision."
"Moreover, no convincing argument has been advanced to demonstrate that Turkey would strengthen rather than weaken the cohesion of Europe."
"Some see Turkish accession as part of a global strategy to combat terrorism."
"The intention is to turn the collision of two cultures to advantage, but this bold strategic design underestimates not only Europe’s own powers but those of Turkey too."
"There is certainly one role that Turkey could never perform as a Member State of the EU: it could never be a bridge to the Middle East."
"It must be a pillar of the West in the Middle East; as a member of the EU, it would be a party to negotiations, not a mediator."
"One thing must be quite clear: if Turkish membership were to erode the European Union, that would be too high a price to pay – and not only for the Union, by the way, but for Turkey too."
"That price must not be paid."
"On 17 December, the European Council should lay down with unmistakable clarity that the decisive criteria will be not only Turkey’s readiness for membership but also the capacity of the Union to accommodate Turkey and preservation of the momentum of the European integration process."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, for his efforts."
"A great deal has already been said about the Copenhagen political criteria."
"Let there be no misunderstanding. I am not, in principle, opposed to Turkey’s accession, but I refuse to endorse the view that opening negotiations with Turkey is necessary in order to further improve, for example, the protection of human rights and of minorities."
"To do so is, as far as I am concerned, to put the cart before the horse."
"The enlargement process is generally characterised by conditions and criteria which are forgotten on the ."
"Although, as one of the Members of this House remarked, I do not want to turn human rights as such into an instrument, I would like to adhere to the agreements made."
"The question that is before us is whether Turkey meets the political criteria of Copenhagen, and the answer is no."
"I consider opening negotiations nonetheless as a starting shot for a journey as we have with Romania, namely that of a train that is hurtling along and culminates in accession, where the negotiation chapters are closed artificially and the criteria no longer have a bearing."
"This is bound to weaken the Union sooner or later."
"It therefore matters a great deal to me that this House should stick to the agreements made, and finally put an end to the arbitrariness, or double standards, that characterise the enlargement process."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, for the very difficult job which he has completed so efficiently."
"We shall know the results of the procedures for Turkey to accede to the European Union when the European Council takes its decision on 17 December 2004."
"The two alternatives, either the exclusion or the full accession of Turkey, do not suffice."
"There also needs to be a third alternative: the option of a special relationship with Turkey."
"If the Council decision inclines towards yes, internal problems will arise in the European Union."
"If the decision inclines towards no, it may provoke a crisis in relations between Turkey and the European Union, something which needs to be avoided."
"Our special relationship should be the golden option which helps both Turkey and the European Union."
"However, Turkey should not accede to the European Union while Cyprus is partitioned and occupied, without recognising the Republic of Cyprus."
"If its relations with the Republic of Cyprus are to be normalised, the colonists and the forty thousand occupying Turkish soldiers need to withdraw from the island and be replaced – why not – with a small European force based on the Bosnia model."
"Of course, the best guarantee for the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots is the application of the laws and principles of the European Union."
"That is why the solution to the Cyprus problem must be purely European and must be based on full respect for and the application of the and the principles in general on which the European Union is founded."
"With such a development, you can be sure that the Greek Cypriot Christians, who account for 82% of the population of Cyprus, and the Turkish Cypriot Muslims, who account for 18%, will be a perhaps unique example of peaceful coexistence, cooperation and progress and Cyprus will become a real bridge of peace and cooperation between the European Union and the Arab nations and Israel, with which Cyprus has always maintained excellent relations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin, as other Members of this House before me have done, by thanking Mr Eurlings for the balanced report that he has presented to us today."
"It is a report that, moreover, gives continuity to what was previously proposed by Mr Verheugen."
"Like most of you, I have been witnessing for some time now a semantic debate between accession and privileged partnership."
"I am somewhat surprised by this debate, but it merely typifies the irrational and subjective nature of our relationship with Turkey."
"To my mind, the only questions that need to be asked are: ‘What have we done in the past?’ and ‘What must we do in the future?’"
"For more than 40 years now, European politicians from all sides and from all countries have been saying that Turkey belongs in Europe and that such continuity is a source of pride for both them and us."
"There are those who feel, however, that, at the end of this long engagement, marriage is no longer on the agenda."
"The planned process is long, difficult and demanding, however, and requires responsibility and prudence; as such, Turkey has an obligation to provide us with the guarantees needed for accession to take place."
"The natural consequence, however, of the demands that we are making is accession."
"A privileged partnership will not encourage Turkey to accept such demands."
"We must firstly, therefore, be consistent with ourselves and with our previous commitments, so that everyone is treated equally."
"As a non-religious person, I have no intention of upsetting any religion or creed."
"When the world speaks of the ‘clash of civilisations’, when the Bush Administration pits the forces of evil against the forces of good, when Muslim fundamentalists use any excuse to give sermons carrying a message of violence and exclusion, it would be dangerous for Europe to be swept along that route and to endorse such thinking."
"Furthermore, I should like to reiterate all of the demands on women’s rights, union rights, human rights and the recognition of minorities, to which I would add the Armenian question and the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus."
"Nevertheless, raising those questions, crucially important though they may be to a Europe of values, cannot be a prerequisite for opening negotiations."
"As a committed and progressive citizen, I do not see a world frozen in time, in which the situation as it is today would, as a matter of course, be the same in ten or fifteen years’ time."
"Such a view of politics does a disservice to the way in which human beings and societies evolve and to people’s intelligence and ability to live together."
"As regards the positive developments in Turkey in recent years, which have been driven by the will of the people, it would be a serious mistake to reject the opening of these negotiations."
"As a federalist, I sometimes hope, I sometimes dream, of a politically-integrated Europe."
"The notion of a privileged partnership would be no more than a commercial super-partnership, which would be a triumph for ‘living alongside’ over ‘living together’ – the business-based concept of an unjust world."
"I personally hope ..."
"Mr President, I will not repeat what has been said already but will limit myself to one general point which I feel has not been adequately covered so far, and that is the accession costs."
"The exact cost of Turkey's accession to the EU is unknown."
"Some, including the Commission, estimate it to be about EUR 20 billion per year."
"Others put the cost much higher."
"A very rough realistic approximation would be about EUR 400-500 billion, i.e. approximately EUR 1 000 per European citizen at today's prices."
"This includes every child born in the European Union during the next 15 to 20 years."
"Such a child will owe EUR 1 000 as VAT towards the cost of Turkey's accession."
"What happens if – as is quite possible – at the end of the day, Turkey does not achieve accession?"
"All this money, which could be used to build hundreds of hospitals and schools, would have been totally wasted."
"In my opinion we must consult our citizens first and have a referendum: let them know the real facts and then take a decision."
"Mr President, firstly, I wish to express my support for Mr Eurlings’ report and acknowledge the large amount of work that has gone into it."
"A lot of speaking time and energy has been deployed on emphasising all the obstacles to Turkish membership of our European Community."
"I always prefer to focus on the positive agenda."
"Throughout the Cold War, Turkey was a steadfast ally on the side of the West."
"Communism was kept at bay, partly thanks to Turkish loyalty towards the NATO Pact."
"That is something we must remember in this House today."
"There are substantial benefits to be had in terms of security policy from speeding up Turkey’s integration into Europe."
"In my view, Turkey is the country that can build a bridge to the Arab world."
"I would therefore call upon us to act in the forthcoming process on the basis of Turkey’s being ‘a friend of Europe’."
"Turkey is an asset to Europe and not a burden upon it."
"Some people have expressed reservations about accepting such a large Muslim country into the EU."
"I do not share those reservations."
"The EU is not a religious club; the common denominator is democracy, not religion."
"Many people, including some in this House today, argue in favour of Turkey’s having a specially privileged partnership as an alternative to actual membership."
"In actual fact, Turkey has already obtained every possible agreement prior to actual membership."
"If such a proposal were supported, it would therefore side-track Turkey, and the EU countries would thus be abandoning all the promises we have previously given Turkey."
"We must ask ourselves: ‘Can we bring ourselves to do such a thing?’."
"There is no way forward other than that of full Turkish membership."
"What can be said to an applicant country?"
"That it must fulfil the whole of the but that it cannot have a Commissioner, voting rights in the Council and seats in the common Parliament?"
"That does not make any sense."
"We must open negotiations with Turkey, as we have promised to do, and give Turkey a fair chance."
"Whether or not Turkey ultimately becomes a Member depends upon whether the Turks themselves are prepared to implement the far-reaching changes to their society that are required if Turkey is really to become a Member."
"There is plenty here to set to work on, especially when it comes to human rights."
"Let us be open and unprejudiced in our encounter with the population of Turkey, and let us join together in combating intolerance where this may be found."
"As I say, I support Mr Eurlings’ report, even though there are points on which I do not fully agree."
"Mr President, I should like to start by complimenting the Commission on a wise, far-sighted and balanced report, and I should also like to say to the Dutch Presidency that, in my view, they have made a good job of tackling an extremely difficult matter."
"As Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should also like to start by expressing my support for Mr Eurlings’ report, which I think is a balanced document, as well as a responsible one in a way that is absolutely crucial."
"It is not every day that Parliament adopts a position on such an important matter as Turkey."
"There is no doubt that Turkey has made a very great deal of progress such as it would scarcely have made if there had been no prospect – a prospect made use of many times in the Turkish Parliament – of Turkey’s being accorded candidate status."
"Is Turkey to become a Member or not? I do not think it would be right of us today or tomorrow to take decisions as to whether it will be."
"I believe that what is crucial is to begin negotiations with Turkey and to have a perspective, but not to have any automatic arrangement or any guarantee."
"That leads to the issue to which I wish to devote the rest of my speaking time."
"Turkey is faced with having to deliver a long list of results."
"That is not without its problems."
"I must remind the Commission and Mr Rehn that, among the problems that exist, is the practical matter, to which I have very recently drawn attention, of union recognition in Turkey."
"That is very serious, because the present situation is not in accordance with freedom of expression and organisation, and I hope that Mr Rehn will take the matter seriously and inform Turkey that it must come into line."
"If it does so, that will be regarded as essential progress along the way."
"As I say, I support Mr Eurlings’ report. Let us now negotiate seriously and with a sense of our historic responsibility."
"Mr President, I too am of the view that we must open negotiations with a clear goal in mind, namely that of full membership, and do so without delay."
"Indeed, there are plenty of problems left that have been discussed at great length in this House, but I would urge you to keep the debate pure, and not to base it on fear, prejudice and hypocrisy."
"Much has been said about European values, and many people doubt whether Turkey will ever be able to embrace them."
"I should like to draw their attention to the fact that, with criminal regimes and dictatorships, all twenty-five of the current Member States have ridden roughshod over those European values at some stage in the course of the twentieth century."
"In the Second World War, human rights were trampled on in the most atrocious manner and despite this, we are all Members of the European Union and fully-fledged democracies."
"It is arrogant to think that some ethnic groups are predestined to live in oppression, misery and backwardness."
"The European Union was set up specifically to guarantee peace, freedom and prosperity in the wake of all the atrocities of the Second World War."
"If a modern, democratic and free Turkey joins, the European Union will have accomplished its mission."
"Mr President, Mr Eurlings is to be congratulated on his report, which is a product of careful, hard and objective work."
"For many, for Turkey to open negotiations for membership means opportunities – opportunities for further democratisation of the country; opportunities for abolishing torture and other violations of human rights; for respecting the rights of religious and ethnic minorities within Turkey and for full respect of the identity rights of sectors of Turkish society, the Kurds and the Alawites."
"It would mean an opportunity for regional stability by changing attitudes and abandoning aggressive behaviour, so that problems like Cyprus and the Aegean can be resolved according to the European spirit of settlement of disputes and respect for international law, Security Council resolutions, the Law of the Sea, etc."
"As a Cypriot Member of this Parliament, and in spite of the invasion and continuous occupation of the northern part of my country by Turkey, I am prepared to go along with this opportunity and not oppose the opening of negotiations with Turkey."
"At the same time, I expect none of Turkey's obligations, and none of the problems, to be minimised, overlooked or swept under the carpet."
"There are enormous problems for Turkey to overcome and important obligations to fulfil."
"The EU must demand that Turkey acknowledge the Armenian genocide if historians are to be able to close this chapter of shame in the history of mankind."
"Nobody can turn a blind eye to the continuous military occupation of part of the territory of Cyprus."
"Turkey's obligation in the search for a settlement in Cyprus does not end with the referendum of last April."
"It has an obligation to ensure the gradual withdrawal of its troops and bring an immediate end to the creation of new in relation to private properties."
"It also has an obligation to recognise all 25 Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus, when negotiating with them."
"We are on the verge of an extremely important decision, not only in terms of its impact on all of Europe but also, in this age of globalisation, in its effects on the political map of the world."
"Shall we have the intellectual and moral strength to take the decision on the opening of negotiations calmly, boldly and in accordance with the dictates of political logic?"
"Opponents of the report have once again been trying to restart the discussion on new terms, some of which are based on falsehoods, raising many of the hurdles that have already been cleared and adding many more."
"Let me emphasise that I must respect the views of those among us who do not wish to support the opening of negotiations on Turkish accession, but I cannot accept any arguments that are completely divorced from reality or any allegations of the type that have been made over the past weekend by various German Conservatives."
"The assertion that Turkey would import terrorism and gangsterism is libellous and an insult to our NATO ally."
"The debate must not be dragged down to that level."
"Since 1963, the Community and Brussels have acknowledged that Turkey is part of Europe, and in December 2002 the European Union pledged itself to begin negotiations with Turkey once the latter had fulfilled the stipulated criteria."
"The credibility of the European Union is at stake."
"Political honesty means abiding by agreements and keeping promises."
"The scope and impact of the reforms that are currently being enacted in Turkey are unprecedented in recent centuries."
"Democracy there is more stable than it has ever been."
"The country is registering high economic growth rates."
"Turkey will always stand guarantor for the security of the whole of Europe."
"A European Turkey will serve as a shining example for the entire Islamic world and hence for numerous crisis-torn regions too."
"Turkey ..."
"Mr President, I agree that we must do everything to stabilise regions neighbouring on ourselves, but I do not agree with the way in which Turkish membership is intended to be turned into a reality."
"We no doubt agree that one of the conditions of a democracy is that everyone must be able to participate in the decision-making."
"That also applies to the present Member States which have, for example, linguistic minorities that together constitute 10% of the EU’s population."
"If the Member States’ seats in the European Parliament are reduced in number without guarantees being given that Europe’s genuine diversity will be reflected in Parliament’s composition, the minorities will be excluded from Parliament as a result of Turkey’s becoming a member."
"Europe is a cultural and linguistic mosaic that has also given rise to tensions and bloodshed."
"It would therefore be unwise to go in for a solution that did not reflect Europe’s genuine diversity."
"All EU citizens need to feel welcome in an EU whose power is increasing every day."
"It would be unfortunate if, for example, the Balkan states, as future Members, were only to be represented by the largest ethnic group."
"The representation of minorities at EU level is of great importance for reducing tensions."
"Because the report takes no account of this aspect, I cannot vote in favour of it."
"I want a Europe for all EU citizens and not just for a portion of them, no matter how great the historic decisions we face."
"Mr President, this debate is about nothing more or less than the destiny and the future of the European Union, which is why it is disturbing to see the extent to which confusion reigns in these deliberations."
"First of all there are constant references to a promise of accession allegedly given to Turkey in 1963."
"Even you, Commissioner, spoke of this promise, but the prospect held out by the EEC in 1963 – by the EEC, mind you – has long since been realised through the customs union."
"We had that decision on the customs union adopted in the face of opposition from the political group of Mr Schulz, who praised the customs union today, because we are friends of a strong and viable Turkey."
"Today, however, we are dealing with quite a different matter, namely full Turkish membership of a European political union in which many of what were once foreign affairs are becoming internal matters."
"And anyone who seeks such a closely integrated Europe cannot favour full Turkish membership, which would degrade this European Union into a free-trade area."
"Commissioner, you are not bound by an imaginary promise of accession; you are bound by the Parliament which elected you and which represents the people of Europe, who are overwhelmingly opposed to Turkey’s full membership of the Union."
"Secondly, it is a matter of the identity of Europe, and this is another respect in which two different yardsticks are being applied."
"This is a legitimate concern."
"Without Europeans, Europe means nothing."
"Europe is not an association of all types of countries in the world that meet its accession criteria, but a union of all the European states that meet the criteria and want to accede."
"Of course Europe has an identity and borders."
"That identity, Mr Özdemir, cannot be reduced to Christianity or Islam."
"The Muslim Bosnians are unquestionably Europeans, whereas the Christian Ethiopians clearly are not."
"Let me answer your point by quoting your party colleague Mr Voggenhuber, who said that Turkey is not part of greater Europe but of Asia Minor."
"There are limits to everything, including the scope for European integration, and it is realistic that we should take that into account."
"There are countries which are partly European, such as Turkey and Russia, and their partial integration – by which we mean conferring special status or establishing a privileged partnership – with the integrated European Union is a sound strategy that will ultimately benefit both parties."
"I hear repeated calls for consistency."
"It may be a mistake, say many Heads of State or Government, to let Turkey accede or to launch accession negotiations at the present time, but consistency is essential once a promise has been made."
"Let me say in reply that there is nothing more consistent than lemmings."
"I have no desire to be led by lemmings, nor do the people of Europe."
"Even that controversial decision adopted in Helsinki stipulates that the Copenhagen criteria must be satisfied before negotiations can begin."
"I cannot imagine that Turkey will manage to fulfil the criteria within the next few days or weeks."
"Turkey is plainly not satisfying the criteria, as the Eurlings report and the Commission report also demonstrate, but we must face up to that truth and draw the appropriate conclusions."
"Turkey must continue to receive support in its quest to establish democracy and the rule of law and to integrate itself into the Western world."
"That is true, but full membership would be more than either Turkey or the European Union could handle, and rejection is therefore in the interests of both parties."
"The Heads of State or Government will have to examine two issues in Brussels next Saturday: firstly, is it in Turkey’s best interests to pursue this approach, and, secondly, can the EU even cope with such enlargement?"
"Mr President, I am pleased for Mr Eurlings that his report, after so many amendments, finally appears to be taking shape."
"I am also pleased that, together with German Chancellor Schröder, Prime Minister Balkenende confirmed today that negotiations with Turkey will be about full membership and about nothing else."
"I am therefore somewhat disenchanted that some Members of this Parliament have tabled amendments suggesting something other than full membership."
"These are exciting times for Turkey and for Europe, and many exciting years will follow – years in which Turkey will need to improve a great deal in the areas of human rights, women’s rights, freedom for trade unions and freedom of religion."
"Above all, Turkey must learn to deal with NGOs such as the Red Crescent, and learn to see them as being useful for the European integration process instead of a nuisance."
"Moreover, those self-same NGOs are urging the EU to open negotiations with Turkey, which many of them believe will benefit the human rights situation there."
"Soon, many will celebrate Christmas in Europe, but many, including Turks, also celebrate the Feast of Sacrifice."
"I hope that the Council’s statement on 17 December will give everyone cause to celebrate, because both Turkey and the European Union can benefit from a fair and open process of negotiations."
"The Eurlings report is a first step in the right direction, towards full Turkish membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, many people believe that Turkey deserves to be invited to join the EU."
"It is the only secular country and the only notable democracy in the Islamic world probably the only one where we can speak of women’s rights in a European sense."
"Turkey has also officially renounced its Islamic inheritance."
"At the same time, Turkey is aware of Europe’s promise of an invitation to begin negotiations, since 2009 will mark the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes’s respective request."
"Representing a small nation, I believe that there are, however, a number of issues that ought to be resolved before the EU begins negotiations with Turkey."
"First, Turkey must recognise the legitimate Greek Cypriot Government."
"In fact, there is no alternative, since candidate countries must commence negotiations with all EU Member States separately, and that includes Cyprus."
"Also, it is just as natural that Turkey should withdraw its armed forces from all positions within EU territory."
"Second, I believe that Turkey must acknowledge the 1915 Armenian mass murder as genocide, which was not planned by religiously fanatical Osmans, but by secular young Turks, many of whom later became Ataturk’s supporters."
"And third, why does Turkey completely disregard the fate of the world’s largest stateless nation, the Kurds?"
"Thank you, Mr President, first of all, I would like to note that our colleague Mr Eurlings has carried out an enormous task and deserves our acknowledgement and gratitude."
"Having analysed Mr Eurlings' report, it is obvious that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria today, that is, it is not capable of passing the tests which had to be overcome by those European Union Member States which became members of the club after 1993, that is, after the Copenhagen criteria had been laid down."
"While listening to the speeches which propose that Turkey be recognised as ready to start European Union membership negotiations, in spite of the violation of minority rights, basic human rights and freedoms in Turkey, one is reminded of George Orwell's ‘Animal Farm’; an order where everybody is equal, but some are more equal."
"In other words, we are showing double standards as regards further European Union expansion."
"This is largely due to the fact that the state which is seeking full European Union membership, but failing to meet the requirements, has a powerful advocate."
"Maybe we are ready to review, to revise the Copenhagen criteria, to lower the level of requirements?"
"Turkey today maybe another Eurasian state tomorrow, for example Russia?"
"The economic aspect of Turkey’s European Union membership is also important."
"The former European Commissioner for the Internal Market warned that the European Union will explode if it does not reform agricultural and regional policies."
"The European Union's ability to absorb new members and overcome the economic challenges of European Union expansion are not infinite."
"Extensive European Union expansion undoubtedly has limits and it would be wiser to consolidate the consequences of the most recent European Union expansion, to evaluate the economic results of Romania and Bulgaria joining the European Union, as well as forecast the economic consequences of Ukraine and Moldova’s European aspirations, that is, matters which should be our priority."
"Therefore, I believe that it would be in the European Union's interests to have a privileged partnership with Turkey."
"Mr President, the prospect of EU accession has been the motive for democratic reform in Eastern Europe, and this week the EU will decide if it will be so for Turkey too."
"As Mr Verheugen said, there is no more that the Turkish Government could have done."
"It is time, 41 years after the promise was first made, for the EU to honour its side of the promise and for the talks to start."
"It is agreed that Turkey should be treated the same as every other applicant country, yet some in this debate seek to suggest that referenda be held in existing Member States, that a new type of status be invented, that permanent 'safeguards' be introduced against EU freedoms, or that big countries should be treated differently from small ones."
"No other accession country has been treated in this way and Parliament should reject these amendments."
"Indeed, I ask Commissioner Rehn this: if the Council decides to start talks 'without delay', would he indicate in his reply how he would interpret this?"
"No-one denies that there are important issues of concern relating to Turkey and these are well dealt with by compromises in the text in the Eurlings report."
"But if Leyla Zana, ten years a political prisoner, came as she did two months ago to this Parliament saying that the promotion of human rights requires us to open the talks, who in this Chamber can with any credibility use human rights objections to support the rejection of Turkey?"
"The plain truth is that too many people use these arguments."
"They talk about European identity and the fundamental character of the Union to hide their true belief that a country with a majority Muslim population should never be allowed to join."
"They seek to talk up the clash of civilisations, yet for three million Turkish people in today's European Union, and for one million Muslims in my own country, the United Kingdom, the only civilised Europe is one based on the freedom of all religions and of none, of ethnic diversity and of combating racism."
"No new preconditions, no further delays."
"Vote yes for a better Turkey, but vote yes, too, for a stronger, more prosperous, more influential, more tolerant and more secure Europe for us all."
"Mr President, this is not a debate for or against Turkey: that would be a huge debate and I do not wish to be part of that game."
"This is a debate about our own future as part of a political project and about the legitimate right of Turks to benefit from the kind of growth and stability that can only be brought from Europe."
"It is our duty to find new kinds of relationships with our neighbours and allies, so that both goals can be made equally compatible without endangering the success of our own projects and dreams and making them collapse, which is what could happen if things are not done properly."
"Membership of the European Union cannot be the only option we give to our neighbours and friends."
"That needs to be said clearly."
"Other very clear options have to be kept in mind."
"Finally, the European leadership has ignored public opinion and the citizens of Europe too often."
"This time that neglect on the part of our political elite – treating our citizens as babies – could have catastrophic effects."
"Mr President, I shall begin by congratulating Mr Eurlings on his report, which offers us an accurate portrayal of the current situation in Turkey."
"The report reminds us that, despite the significant reforms underway in Turkey, there remain some worrying areas, such as the fact that torture still takes place, the fact that human rights are not routinely respected and the fact that the genocide of the Armenian people has not been acknowledged."
"The obvious question, therefore, is whether the conditions are right to begin negotiations with a view to accession."
"As regards Cyprus, is it possible, or in any way acceptable, for a European Union of 25 Member States to set up negotiations with a country that only recognises in full 24 of those Member States?"
"This strikes me as surprising, to say the least."
"Lastly, is the EU capable, in any case, of completely integrating Turkey, with all that that implies in financial and structural terms and as regards European cohesion?"
"A further question: will our external security be strengthened if we acquire borders with problematic countries such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Azerbaijan and Georgia?"
"I have yet to even come to the question that ought to be asked first: where will the EU’s borders end up?"
"I am not speaking merely about geographical borders, but rather of the conceptual borders to which Mr Toubon rightly referred in his speech a short time ago."
"Given all of these constraints, Parliament must at least leave the door open to an alternative to full accession, an alternative that takes account of the privileged relations with this great country, but an alternative, none the less."
"If this does not happen, Parliament will be making the same mistake as others in the past, namely that of giving the wrong signal, albeit perhaps for the right reasons, to the great Turkish nation, or else tying Europe to commitments that it might later not be able to meet, or might not actually want to meet."
"The European Council is making a very important decision this week – on opening accession talks with Turkey."
"Opponents of accession, and we have heard the arguments here today, say that Turkey is not a European country, that it has different cultural, historical and religious roots from those of Europe, that it is situated in the unstable Middle Eastern region, that human, civil and political rights are not adequately observed in Turkey and that Turkey is not ready either politically, economically or in terms of its socio-economic development."
"It is, of course, possible to go along with many of these arguments."
"The decision to be made by the European Council, which we are now discussing, however, is not about Turkey’s accession, but about the opening of accession negotiations."
"There is no doubt that Turkey, in its present situation, is not yet ready to join the European Union, but nor is the European Union ready for Turkey’s accession."
"I believe, however, that the decision on whether or not to start such talks with Turkey is a quite separate issue."
"As has already been stated, these accession negotiations will run for many years and, during this time, the individual measures, procedures and progress in the different areas will be monitored in detail, whether it be in the field of human and civil rights, political reforms, socio-economic development or whatever. Of course, if Turkey’s obligations are not met, negotiations may be broken off at any time, and this has been made clear."
"I am of the opinion that the European Union should has obligations of its own."
"Since Turkey has been awarded the status of candidate country and, according to a report published by the European Commission, has made clear progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, it should be given a chance: the chance to continue with far-reaching political and economic reforms and the chance to fulfil the legacy of the founder of the modern Turkish state Kemal Ataturk and come closer to the West."
"It is an ambitious project and it is my view that, if it succeeds, both Turkey and the European Union will benefit."
"If it does not succeed ..."
"Mr President, to balance the focus on problems and challenges of Turkish membership, can I just welcome the prospect of Turkey's vibrant and generous culture enriching the European Union, as it already does in North London where I live, not least through the presence of Turkish and Kurdish people as well as the excellent food."
"I also regard Turkey's Muslim identity – a secular Muslim identity – as a positive contribution to a harmonious development of the EU as a multicultural society."
"But I would just like to stress the paragraph of Mr Eurling's report that invites the Turkish Government to take more active steps to bring about reconciliation with those Kurdish forces who have chosen to abandon the use of arms."
"I hope that as part of the accession process Turkey will be persuaded to seek a political solution to the desire of the Kurdish people to express their identity, perhaps through some kind of political devolution."
"The PKK's 1999 ceasefire is under strain, and only political negotiations can ensure permanent peace."
"Mr President, the Eurlings report is a rare phenomenon in this House, in that it catalogues the violations of human rights, minority rights and ethnic rights that have taken place within a particular country."
"The main issues are torture, religious freedom, women’s rights, the constitution and the occupation of part of the European Union or, to be more precise, part of a Member State of the European Union, as well as the question of the Armenians and freedom of expression."
"The conclusion that has been drawn – mistakenly, in my opinion – from this catalogue of violations is that negotiations should be launched, as many of my honourable colleagues have pointed out."
"A few years ago, negotiations with Slovakia were suspended for far, far less, and now compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is being presented as an optional extra for the future with no hard and fast statement of the Union’s position."
"Turkey’s democratisation efforts must be supported, but surely their success does not depend on membership of the European Union but rather on a policy of good neighbourly relations and fruitful partnership."
"Two thirds of the European population are opposed to the opening of accession negotiations and to Turkish membership of the European Union."
"In some countries, such as Austria, France and Germany, this opposition exceeds 70%."
"This raises the question why the Commission, many parliamentarians, the Council and numerous Member States are pursuing policies that go against the clearly declared interests, opinions and wishes of the people."
"Such action is politically incomprehensible and utterly short-sighted, because it creates enormous difficulties with regard to public opinion as well as jeopardising the future prospects of the European Union."
"I am in favour of a privileged partnership, not Turkish membership of the Union."
"Mr President, today’s report on Turkey is of crucial importance, since the decision taken by the European Council on 17 December has an historic significance which goes further than the political aspects indicated in Mr Eurlings’s report."
"We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy also have an interest in highlighting and applauding the progress Turkey has made in the economic field in terms of the criteria established by the Union and, in particular, we wish to emphasise its compliance with the Community in fields such as energy policy, industrial policy, research and development and telecommunications."
"Nevertheless, although the direction taken as a whole is correct, the progress made in each of these fields has been unequal and, therefore, progress must be made in the future on at least four aspects which I am going to mention briefly."
"Firstly, it must improve its administrative capacity to complete and enhance the application of the Community acquis."
"Secondly, there needs to be more independence in the monitoring of State aid."
"Thirdly, it must increase the budget dedicated to research and development as a proportion of its GDP."
"And fourthly, the legal framework in the telecommunications sector should be reviewed."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is essentially the content of the amendment that we in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are proposing to Mr Eurlings’s report."
"Mr President, next Friday the Council will make a decision that will affect the future of the European Union – on opening accession negotiations with Turkey."
"It must be said that every time accession negotiations have been opened they have ended in accession."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to ensure that the amendment that we have tabled, calling for a privileged partnership with Turkey, is taken on board."
"The fact is, as I said in this House in November 2002, that there are no grounds for Turkey joining the EU."
"Firstly, the Treaties say that the EU is open to European countries; 95% of Turkey’s territory, of which the capital is Ankara, is located in Asia."
"Secondly, the more we enlarge the Union, the more we will dilute it, the further we will move away from political Europe and the less able we will be to pursue common policies."
"Thirdly, if Turkey were to join the EU in 2015, it would be the most populous country with 80 million inhabitants, which would give it the highest number of Members of this Parliament and significant weight in the Council."
"Lastly, if we accept Turkey into the Union, what argument would we be able to put forward against other applicant countries knocking on our door at some future date, such as Ukraine, Morocco and Algeria?"
"For all of these reasons – and not to mention the fact that the Copenhagen criteria have not been complied with, the Armenian genocide has not been recognised and, indeed, an EU Member State is not recognised – a decision must be taken on Friday that goes beyond the accession or exclusion debate."
"The solution, I repeat, is privileged partnership."
"Let me state clearly that this is not an anti-Turkish position; it is a pro-European position."
"– Mr President, Mr Eurlings had a very difficult job to accomplish."
"He tried to square the circle."
"The evidence which he has set out vindicates the view that Turkey is not ready to be given a date for opening accession negotiations."
"On the other hand, however, he has substantiated the yes position whereby, at this moment, judging strategically and studying the situation, Turkey should open negotiations with the European Union."
"From everything set out in the report and from everything we know, it appears clear that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Paragraph 7(a)(3) of these criteria is clear: Turkey has deficits both in the area of democracy and in the area of human rights and in the area of respect for minority rights, as well as in numerous other areas."
"At the same time, as far as the Helsinki conclusions are concerned, Turkey is violating the spirit and the letter of paragraph 4 by being in a state of constant friction with Greece, given that it continually violates airspace on a daily basis and, most importantly, it continues to occupy part of European territory, part of the Republic of Cyprus, and continues to say that it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus."
"It is ultimately a matter of self-respect for the European Union to say that it will enter into partnership with a state which does not recognise one of its members."
"It is something which Europe needs to address decisively and dynamically."
"We Cypriots are not against the Europeanisation of Turkey."
"We want a neighbour which identifies with European values and we hope – and believe – that, through this current procedure, Turkey will end up moving towards Europe and adopting European values."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Eurlings for a skilfully produced report."
"Leyla Zana, winner of the Sakharov Prize in 1995, told us in October to include Turkey in the negotiations or else the Kurds would not survive."
"This is a serious argument for talks, but it only means that Turkey will now be included within the observation category."
"The start date for negotiations must still be left open, with no deadline."
"Turkey needs to fulfil all the requirements of European democracy, including the rights of women."
"It is important that the negotiations can be broken off at any time if there is insufficient progress."
"For Turkey there are therefore three potential exits: the beginning, the end and right in the middle of everything."
"We will not be ready for enlargement for a long time, but we can begin negotiations now."
"Turkey is not Europe, but democracy and human rights are, and that is why these concepts should be spread, at least within our neighbouring countries."
"Mr President, Turkey is a large country straddling the border between Europe and Asia in an area of particular geopolitical sensitivity."
"It is in the interests of the Union to integrate Turkey firmly into European structures, and it is evidently in the interests of Turkey to bind itself into those structures."
"That is why Turkey applied for membership many years ago."
"There are clear criteria for accession to the Union."
"These were laid down at the Copenhagen summit more than ten years ago, in 1993."
"A candidate for membership must fulfil a set of defined political and economic criteria and must accept the established body of European law."
"The Union is likewise bound to do its homework. It must be ready for enlargement and must not put its previous progress in jeopardy."
"A few weeks ago, the Commission presented another progress report on Turkey, recording some remarkable achievements, particularly as regards the applicant country’s fulfilment of political accession criteria."
"Progress has been made towards the establishment of democracy; in particular, the political power of the armed forces has been curbed in favour of the civil authority."
"There have also been encouraging developments towards enshrinement of the rule of law."
"Corruption, on the other hand, remains a major problem, and people are still being tortured in Turkish prisons."
"In the realm of fundamental rights, the report once again made scathing criticisms, stating, for example, that things were in a bad way with regard to religious freedom in Turkey, not to mention the numerous minority issues that remain unresolved."
"The Commission went on, however, to conclude from this very mixed progress report that the time had come to launch formal accession talks while conceding that derogations, possibly of a long-term nature, would have to be made from the rules of the common market in respect of crucial membership obligations."
"This is a case of applying double standards and speaking with a forked tongue."
"Either Turkey has done its homework and meets the political criteria or it does not; and if we have no intention of granting Turkey all the rights arising from membership, we should make that clear without delay and start to consider a privileged partnership instead of obsessively pursuing this notion of accession."
"At the weekend the Council is required to take a very important decision on this matter."
"I hope it will abide by the rules that the selfsame institution, the European Council, set in Copenhagen ten years ago for this eventuality."
"Mr President, the Hungarian Socialist contingent congratulates Mr Eurlings on a very good report."
"For us, the situation of national minorities is a matter of principle."
"Without increased territorial autonomy for the Kurds, Hungary and the Hungarian Socialists will never vote for Turkey’s accession."
"For us, it is a matter of principle."
"As chairman of the intergroup for traditional national minorities, I feel that special importance must be attached to the situation for non-Muslim minorities."
"Ethnic minorities, religious minorities and, especially, women, must be respected."
"This may be the start of negotiations, but we do not yet know the outcome."
"These negotiations are an opportunity for both Turkey and the EU, but they do not constitute a guarantee."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the topic that we are discussing today in this Chamber, and which we have been discussing for years in the European Parliament both in official sittings and in private talks, is a difficult and complex problem."
"We Members have assessed the pros and cons and are united in the firmly-held conclusion that it is both advantageous and essential to give the green light to accession negotiations."
"To reject them would mean thwarting the efforts that Turkey is making to modernise itself and to develop a democratic system; it would mean consigning that country to the confusion and despotism of unstable regions such as the Middle East and the Caucasus; and it would mean sending out a negative signal to the whole moderate Islamic world, reinforcing the intransigence of the fundamentalists and lending support to those who predict a clash of civilisations."
"Today we have an opportunity to narrow the gap between Islam and the West, thanks to a country that has roots in both the history of Christianity and that of Islam."
"By opening the doors of the European Union to Turkey, we can send out a strong signal to those Muslim countries that have, amidst great difficulty, set off along the road towards democracy and freedom, assuring them that they are on the right road, and showing that the European Union does not consider Islam and democracy to be incompatible."
"I would remind the sceptics and those who are against Turkey that starting negotiations with that country will greatly increase our security with regard to terrorism, which is a threat that we shall still have to face for many years."
"That is why we shall be voting for the report by Mr Eurlings, to whom we offer our most sincere and heartfelt congratulations on the enormous amount of work he has done under particularly difficult conditions and on his ability to find workable compromises among the highly diverse views that enliven this Parliament."
"Mr President, I will be voting in support of the report as I have for other related decisions of the European Union in recent times."
"I understand it to be, first and foremost, a message to Turkey that we are happy with the recent democratic reforms there."
"At the same time it is, of course, abundantly clear that these reforms do not go far enough and that with regard to the continuation of the process of accepting Turkey into the European Union they should be more meticulous."
"Like all the other candidate countries, Turkey is required to fulfil all the conditions."
"This is the basic point of my short speech."
"I would like to stress that the European Union itself must fulfil the conditions for further enlargement, particularly in the case of a sensitive country like Turkey."
"It is bound by the Copenhagen criteria, and I quote, must be ‘capable of accepting new members’."
"In other words it should fulfil its political, economic and social goals."
"In order to become more united and more effective, it must first consolidate itself and strengthen itself from within and I consider the ratification of the European Constitutional Agreement to be a vital precondition, if any further enlargement of the European Union is to be contemplated."
"Mr President, the opening of negotiations with Turkey will be a historic event for both Turkey and the European Union."
"In the modern world, where Islam is being turned into an instrument of conquest and hatred, and has become a lethal weapon in the hands of fanatics, a meeting of the European Union with Ankara provides a unique opportunity to reverse the course of events and turn confrontation into coexistence."
"To those who are currently concerned that as a result of Turkey’s accession to the European Union we will have common borders with Iraq and other Middle Eastern trouble spots, my message would be that we already have such borders today in the very heart of Europe."
"These borders exist between civilisations and cultures, and bear no relation to geographical boundaries."
"This is also true in the case of Islam, which is present in Europe in the form of many millions of believers."
"I refer to Muslims who were invited to join the European workforce in the 1960s."
"They became a major group of our continent’s inhabitants, yet they were not offered a model of integration and coexistence that would have allowed them to identify with their new homeland."
"This is therefore a problem that we are already experiencing in the very heart of Europe."
"During negotiations, Turkey will need to demonstrate its honesty with regard to the Copenhagen criteria, as well as the approach it intends to take to issues relating to religious freedoms, the status of women, acknowledging the Armenian genocide and opening the border with Armenia."
"This will also provide an answer to those who suspect that Turkey’s accession to the EU would reduce the army’s influence on public life, when the army has always been a guarantee of the state’s secularity."
"The opening of negotiations with Turkey ought to make it apparent to the European Union that Ukraine is an equally important and strategic partner for the EU."
"Ukraine should also receive a clear, rapid and credible prospect of cooperation with and accession to the European Union, and it should receive this as soon as possible."
"The Ukrainian people have demonstrated a remarkable degree of determination in their commitment to democratic values."
"They must and should now receive from us an answer commensurate with that determination."
"– Mr President, Mr Eurlings has received a great many congratulations this evening and rightly so, because his report is complete and absolutely balanced."
"I believe that this report should be supported."
"However, it should be made clear that Turkey, just like any country seeking membership, needs to realise that it has not only rights, but also obligations."
"The citizens of Europe demand of Turkey respect for international law and convergence with the constitutional, economic, political and cultural ."
"I would mention the need for full respect by Turkey of human, minority and religious rights and full implementation of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Furthermore, I do not understand the paradox of the Turkish stand, which calls for the vote of a Member State which it does not recognise."
"Finally, Turkey needs to realise that its European prospects depend, first and foremost, on Turkey itself and on the stand which it will maintain on a large number of issues."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mr Eurlings for having successfully completed an extremely difficult task."
"It is late in the debate. Most things have been said, and many wise points of view have been put forward."
"It is difficult to cover the whole issue in two minutes."
"There is no point in even trying, so I am selecting two points in the human rights sphere that are close to my heart, especially because I sit on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Firstly, rapes are committed at police stations, according to Lawyers Without Frontiers."
"Women dare not report the rapes because of the risk of worse treatment in the form of reprisals."
"The day that Turkey becomes an EU Member, it is imperative that such things no longer occur."
"The other area in which I should have liked to have seen stronger wordings is that of education."
"In spite of the fact that hundreds of new schools have been started, there are large areas in which, because of male resistance, more than half of all girls aged between seven and thirteen are prevented from going to school and learning how to read and write."
"When Turkey becomes a Member, hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of pretty and young illiterate women will become citizens of an EU in which good education is crucial to a normal standard of living."
"Their ability to provide for themselves will be extremely limited."
"Women must be allowed to go to school now if, in the future, they are to be EU citizens."
"There are many good reasons for Turkish membership, but it is up to us – the present Members – to keep up the pressure for reform throughout the whole negotiating process."
"Under those circumstances, Turkey will be very welcome."
"Mr President, what is the purpose of the vote on 15 December on this report concerning Turkey?"
"It is not a matter of rewarding the rapporteur, although he merits my highest esteem."
"Nor is it a contest between two teams: the unwavering supporters of Turkish accession and those who say that there must be an alternative to full accession and already have one in mind and want to put a name to it."
"In such a contest, both teams are always liable to score an own goal."
"Nor is it a matter of simply echoing the shouts of the crowd in the stands, since these are largely fuelled by emotion."
"It is quite simply the last opportunity of the European Parliament to convey a final message to the Heads of Government in the Council before they take their decision on the start of negotiations with Turkey and to make their decision as difficult as possible."
"The point is that the unquestioned desire of the Erdogan Government to enact reforms contrasts with the reality of social conditions in Turkey, resulting in part from political conflicts, whether in connection with the Armenian or the Kurdish problem, and these conditions are incompatible with our objectives and criteria."
"It is no coincidence that Kurdish representatives in Paris have chosen this precise moment to demand autonomy for the Kurdish areas in south-eastern Anatolia."
"The very prospect of negotiations being launched and of possible Turkish accession to the EU, in other words, could actually fuel the conflict between Turks and Kurds instead of defusing it."
"By shifting its frontiers to Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Caucasus, the EU would forfeit the that has always separated it from some of the world’s most dangerous trouble spots."
"This is something else the Council must consider."
"The Turkish leaders’ accusation that the EU is imposing special conditions on Turkey for the negotiation process must give us pause for thought too, because it is not the EU that is applying to accede to the Republic of Turkey – quite the reverse."
"The atmosphere on the eve of the decision on accession talks could not be worse."
"A process culminating automatically in accession without any other options would be damaging to both the EU and Turkey itself."
"We parliamentarians should take the opportunity to put this message across clearly before 17 December because, should full accession prove unattainable, there must be other means of integrating Turkey into European structures."
"Mr President, the Chamber is already almost empty, and the arguments have nearly been exhausted."
"I do not wish to return to the issues raised by all the earlier speakers, or to all the previous arguments."
"One can see both sides to all of the latter."
"The situation is somewhat reminiscent of the nature of philosophical doctrines, when if all the arguments are analysed, and an attempt made to find the original source of the philosophical system, it ultimately becomes clear that we all differ in terms of personality."
"What happens is that at some point a certain detail of personality or character determines whether one marvellous philosophical treatise comes about or another, equally marvellous one."
"In the case at hand, it appears to me that there is a clear division of those sitting in this Chamber."
"Some view the possible accession of Turkey to the EU with hope, whereas others regard it with fear, and this is only natural."
"Those who regard it with fear use the geographical argument, stating that Turkey is in Asia, for example."
"Those who regard it with hope use the rules of the tennis court."
"In tennis, if a ball hits the line, it is just as much ‘in’ as if it had been in the centre of the court."
"This is indeed one way of looking at things."
"For me, the decisive factor regarding this issue has been the opinion of those working for human rights movements both in Turkey and outside."
"I have in mind Mrs Zana first and foremost, but also many others who stress the negative aspects of the situation in Turkey in their reports, but who also state that membership of the European Union offers a chance for things to change."
"This is an absolutely crucial issue, and people inside the country must be asked for their opinion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not all opposed to Turkey’s accession to the European Union, and not all countries are opposed to such an accession."
"In a survey recently carried out in Poland, 72% of its citizens were in favour of a further enlargement of the European Union."
"We are dealing with a fundamental difference."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank my colleague, Mr Eurlings, for his excellent report, which takes account of different points of view."
"Although I myself am more critical of Turkey’s accelerated accession, I nevertheless lend my strong support to adopting Mr Eurlings’s report."
"What amazes me most about Turkey’s membership is the great haste in which it is being pursued."
"Many experts predict that the political strength to say no to Turkey will not be found anywhere in ten years’ time, even if she did not meet the conditions of membership."
"This haste could prove to be a big mistake."
"In Turkey’s case, we cannot turn a blind eye to the matter of human rights."
"The conditions relating to human rights and those of minorities must be fully met before membership can be approved."
"I myself am also worried by how much Turkey’s membership will cost, and the fact that nobody seems to know this."
"External estimates suggest quite enormous sums of money."
"The contributions by the current net contributors would grow substantially."
"This in turn could increase public dissatisfaction with the EU."
"After Turkey has joined, the Union will no longer be the same EU as it is now."
"For that reason, our citizens should have the right to express their own opinions about the issue."
"We should encourage the Member States to organise referenda on it."
"I fear that Turkey’s accelerated accession is too big a mouthful to swallow, and that the EU is likely to choke on it."
". Mr President, thank you for the many remarks I have heard."
"The Members of this House have expressed a huge range of opinions."
"What virtually everyone in this House believes, if I have listened carefully, is that the decision to be taken by the Council on Friday is a very important one and a very important resolution."
"The decision to open negotiations with Turkey is, naturally, important for the European Union, but is just as important for Turkey."
"A number of you, including Mr Rocard and Mrs Seeberg, have emphasised that throughout this discussion, we should also sufficiently highlight the benefits that will eventually accrue if Turkey joins us."
"These are benefits for the public both economically and in terms of security."
"Many have expressed their concerns as well."
"I can say that some of the concerns I have heard here are also concerns that are important in the European Council and are discussed there at great length, as the General Affairs Council, in fact, did this morning ."
"A much-heard concern, and one that is also discussed in the Council, is the situation relating to human rights, torture, religious freedom and the position of minorities."
"Those are concerns that have been expressed from many quarters, including Mr Poettering and Mr Brok, and – if I can put it that way – also from the other side, by Mr Schulz and Mr Lagendijk."
"It is those concerns, among others, that form the underlying consideration for our hope to be able to reach an agreement on Friday about a new negotiating framework on the basis of the proposals tabled by the Commission for a new way of negotiating which will offer better guarantees for the negotiating process running smoothly."
"One of the important new elements in this is the option of suspension, which has also been suggested by some of you, and which can be very relevant precisely in the case of violations of human rights and the other aspects I mentioned."
"Mr Duff specifically asked for the procedure to be explained."
"He asked whether a single Member State might request suspension or whether this has to be done by one-third of the Member States."
"I can inform Mr Duff that the presidency suggests – again based on the Commission proposals – that one-third of the Member States be required to submit the request for suspension, that is to say to request the Commission to submit a proposal to that effect."
"The Commission should therefore table a proposal which will be decided upon by qualified majority."
"I therefore share some of your concerns and would emphasise that the majority of the Commission’s sound proposals will for that reason be adopted in the proposals which we will now be submitting to the Council and on which decisions will be taken on Friday."
"Finally, I would like to repeat what Mr Lagendijk and Mr Jałowiecki said in this connection."
"Many human rights organisations and other civil society organisations in Turkey emphasise that there are indeed many other areas of concern and that a great deal is yet to be done, but that, at the same time, it is of the utmost importance for the positive step to be made now and for negotiations to be opened."
"I should also like to mention a concern which I do not share and which, fortunately, has been mentioned by few, namely religion."
"I am in total agreement with some of you, including Mr Schulz and Mrs Bonino, who emphasised that the European Union is about values and not about religion."
"A European integration project is not a religious, but a political project."
"Another concern that I share has to do with the discussion about Cyprus and its recognition by Turkey."
"A number of you have mentioned this aspect, including Mr Beglitis, who explicitly asked what the presidency’s thoughts were on this."
"On Friday, the presidency would like to achieve formal recognition by Turkey of the fact that Cyprus is a Member State of the European Union and that it is one of the Twenty-Five countries forming part of the EU."
"That can be done by signing the protocol to the association agreement."
"Yet another concern that was raised by various Members, including Mr Hänsch and Mr Pahor, relates to the EU’s absorption capacity."
"Not only Turkey must be ready, also the European Union must be capable of receiving an acceding country well."
"Since I share this view, the presidency will try to include the EU’s absorption capacity in the conclusions."
"A sensitive, yet important, point that was mentioned by many is the open-ended nature of the negotiations."
"That is an important point, and precisely because of its sensitive nature, it will also be discussed at great length in the European Council, where the final decision will be taken."
"Needless to say, I cannot make any predictions, but I can say two things about it"
"On the one hand, it must be absolutely clear, as the presidency has constantly emphasised, that we are discussing accession negotiations."
"The negotiations have no objective other than discussing accession negotiations."
"That is an essential element, and should also be reflected in the Council’s words and conclusions on Friday."
"On the other hand, it is, indeed, an open-ended process."
"Nobody can guarantee what will be the outcome after all that time, and we must realise that we could be faced with a situation where it transpires that no result has been achieved."
"In this respect too, we are mainly guided by the suggestions already made by the Commission."
"I should like to conclude with a general observation."
"I am positive about the possibility of taking this decision, as it is now taking shape, on Friday, and I think that it will be a positive decision."
"It will be a positive one because we will then agree to open negotiations with Turkey."
"That is positive for the European Union, but also – and I should like to add this – positive for Turkey."
"The decision, however, will need to contain sufficient guarantees to accommodate the concerns that have been brought here."
"Finally, it is also positive because if we as European Council can take Friday’s decision in this way, we do justice to public involvement."
"Mr Poettering, Mrs De Sarnez and many others have underlined the importance of involving the citizen in this far-reaching decision."
"I think that by taking the decision in this manner, we can explain to the citizen that an open and extensive debate has taken place in this Parliament and on many other platforms."
"We will be able to demonstrate to the public that the step we are now taking is very important for their economic position and their security, but at the same time, that we have taken their many concerns very much seriously."
". Mr President, I thank you and the honourable Members for a very rich, analytical and multi-dimensional debate, which has covered virtually the whole spectrum of European public opinion ranging from future peace dividends to past crusades and, more seriously, from women's rights to religious communities and their rights in Turkey."
"I will touch on a limited number of questions that Members addressed directly to the Commission."
"First, there have been numerous requests for rigorous monitoring of legal reforms and human rights in general."
"I fully agree with this."
"The rigorous monitoring mechanism and the annexed suspension clause are indeed at the core of our negotiation strategy with regard to Turkey in the coming years."
"It is also very much in the interests of Turkey because it maintains the strong incentive to implement and consolidate the necessary legal and political reforms."
"We will be preparing a monitoring report during 2005 concerning the fulfilment of criteria in the field of human rights in general."
"These criteria include the issue of trade union rights, which Mr Rasmussen raised."
"He referred to an ongoing court case of which the Commission is aware. We are monitoring this case very closely."
"In our report we consider this to be a serious test case with regard to the depth of legal reform in Turkey, which touches upon trade union rights, language rights and the rights of minorities in Turkey."
"This also involves the question of non-Muslim religious minorities, which has been addressed in depth by Mr Eurlings in his report and referred to by several Members here this evening."
"I would like to underline that although freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Turkish constitution, non-Muslim religious communities nevertheless face a series of structural difficulties, such as the lack of a legal personality and the lack of full economic rights."
"The Turkish authorities are committed to adopting a law addressing these structural problems."
"A draft law on foundations is currently being discussed and the Commission has been officially invited to submit its comments to the Turkish authorities on this critical piece of legislation."
"We will continue to have dialogue and put pressure on the Turkish Government on this particular subject."
"Concerning the enforcement mechanism of the suspension clause, to which Mr Duff referred, the origin of the suspension clause lies in the development of the ."
"The Union now has clauses in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and in the draft Constitutional Treaty that provide for a procedure to deal with cases where a Member State seriously and persistently breaches the basic principles of the Union."
"It is only logical and normal that similar rules should also apply to candidate countries."
"In fact, it has always been the case even in the past that such serious situations would lead to a suspension of negotiations."
"Thus the inclusion of an explicit suspension procedure is based on a new and the Commission will base its proposal on these principles of the Treaty."
"Thus I am fully in agreement with Mr Nicolaï and with Mr Duff."
"On the question of the privileged partnership, the instrument of a special partnership is provided for under the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"It is intended to give special treatment to neighbours or other partners representing a strategic interest for the European Union."
"The idea of the special partnership underlines in particular the New Neighbourhood policy, which the EU seeks to extend to its eastern and southern neighbours."
"This initiative does not apply to Turkey, which has been a candidate country since the Helsinki summit in 1999."
"It is hard to figure out how any more could be offered to Turkey than it already has under the privileged partnership."
"First of all, Turkey and the EU are bound by a customs union which constitutes a far-reaching instrument of bilateral cooperation in the area of trade and economic cooperation, implying a great degree of economic integration."
"Second, Turkey already participates in numerous Community programmes in a wide range of areas such as culture, drugs, justice and home affairs, education, research and development."
"Third, in the key area of security and defence, Turkey participates as a NATO member – via both NATO and the European Security and Defence Policy – in the development of EU security operations."
"For instance, there are Turkish troops in many countries in the Balkans, and even in the 'European army', as one British newspaper recently dubbed the 'Althea' operation in Bosnia."
"With regard to the privileged partnership, and as Mr Nicolaï also said, in my view the clear objective of the accession negotiations will and should be accession if Turkey meets all the criteria for membership by the end of the negotiations."
"It would not be wise to set any final target date because we have recently learned that schedule should not override substance."
"We should set realistic targets, not deadlines that we cannot meet."
"Finally, Mr Howitt asked about the start-date from the point of view of the Commission."
"Our mandate is to evaluate whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria."
"This is what we did."
"Concerning the start-date of the negotiations, we trust the wisdom of the European Council, of the Prime Ministers and Presidents to make the political judgement with regard to when in 2005 they deem it appropriate to start the accession negotiations."
"From the point of view of the Commission, I can say that we are ready to start work – in the words of Parliament's resolution – 'without undue delay'."
"I only hope that somebody will explain to me the difference between 'undue' and 'due' delay."
"Nevertheless, we are ready to work without delay once the negotiations have been made and the process can be started."
"Mr Swoboda, Mr Szent-Iványi and several others made the very important point that if we succeed in this long process of negotiations, it should and will make the EU strategically stronger."
"This is the fundamental issue at stake here and the strategic, geopolitical and geocultural crux of the matter."
"We can learn some lessons from history – we do not have to apply them blindly, but we can indeed learn something."
"During the Cold War, Europe contained Communism and the Soviet Union and cooperated in terms of enhancing security and human rights with impressive results."
"We can see this from the significant number of colleagues from free eastern and central Europe who are here among us today as Members of this Parliament."
"Now and in the future, the challenge is very much the relationship between Europe and Islam."
"Europe must, on the one hand, contain Islamic fundamentalism using all the means available and, on the other hand, it must build bridges and dialogue with those representing moderate Islam."
"If, after long and difficult negotiations, we achieve a situation where the rule of law genuinely prevails in Turkey, and where European democracy meets a predominantly Muslim population, then that would certainly be an asset for Europe and a very important crossroads of civilisations."
"–The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"The key question in this report is that of support for officially starting negotiations with Turkey."
"Such support is based on a series of conditions and contradictions, which, in some cases, are impositions that go beyond the defence of human rights, whereas with regard to the occupation of Cyprus there is unacceptable indulgence, given that this is an EU Member State with part of its territory under Turkish military occupation."
"At this stage, which is not yet that of accession, but merely the opening of negotiations over possible accession within ten years, the important thing to ascertain is whether or not the conditions that we always lay down – in terms of how the situation in Turkey is developing, the interests and concerns of its people and the implications for Portugal – are being met."
"If we examine the question of fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees, it is true that progress has been made, yet this is more the fruit of the struggle waged by the progressive forces than of pressure from the EU, so much so that even the positive amendments to certain legislation have in most cases yet to become a reality."
"It is true that Leyla Zana and her companions have been released, but, according to information from Turkish and Kurdish progressive forces, around 5 000 people are still detained..."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0056/2004), by Mrs Novak, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single Community framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences, the Europass system. I shall straightaway give the floor to our rapporteur, Mrs Novak."
". Mr President, Commissioner Figel, ladies and gentlemen."
"The intention behind the introduction of Europass is the formation of a single framework of European Union documents to achieve greater transparency of qualifications and competences of citizens."
"It would also be a contribution to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and at the same time it would help to improve the quality of education in Europe."
"The Europass documents are: the Europass curriculum vitae, the Europass mobility pass, which records periods of education abroad, the Europass diploma supplement, which contains information about the holder's achievements at a university level, the Europass language pass, which shows language knowledge, and the Europass certificate supplement, which shows the qualifications and competence defined by a vocational training certificate."
"Citizens are free to use individual Europass documents or the entire dossier of documents."
"In future years it will be possible to add new documents, particularly in the field of information technology."
"The European Parliament gave its opinion on the legislative proposal at first reading under the codecision procedure on 21 April 2004 and 14 amendments were tabled, almost all of which were taken up."
"The European Council reached a political agreement on the draft at its meeting on 27 and 28 May."
"After the draft document had been discussed in the Committee on Culture and Education it was unanimously decided (with one abstention) to accept Europass with immediate effect at the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"As the rapporteur, I support the Europass proposal and I am in favour of its rapid entry into force. Assuring that the advantages and benefits of the use of this document is in the interests of the citizens of the European Union, as well as the Commission and the Netherlands Presidency."
"The proposed date of entry into force is 1 January 2005."
"The early introduction of the proposed Europass will also enable the early establishment of all the procedures for its realisation."
"According to the proposal, each Member State is responsible for implementation at a national level."
"To that end each Member State will establish a national Europass Centre, responsible for coordinating activities in this area."
"A European network of national Europass Centres will also be established."
"Their activities will be coordinated by the Commission."
"It will be the task of national Europass Centres to coordinate, in cooperation with the appropriate state bodies, activities related to the availability and issue of Europass documents, to establish and manage a national information system, to encourage the use of Europass, to ensure, in cooperation with the appropriate state bodies, that relevant guidelines and information about Europass are available to every citizen, to provide information about possibilities for study in Europe and about the structure of educational and training systems, to manage all activities connected to this at a national level with the financial support of the Community, and to participate in the European network of National Centres."
"The National Centre functions as an executive body at the national level."
"The Commission and the Member States will ensure that both at Community level and at a national level appropriate actions are taken to introduce Europass and to keep citizens, education and training providers, social partners and enterprises informed about it."
"The Commission will also report regularly to Parliament and the Council as to the implementation of such actions."
"The first report and evaluation will be three years after the document comes into effect."
"The report period thereafter will be every four years."
"Given that education is the basis of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, Europass documents will greatly improve the mobility of European citizens in the field of education and employment and will allow closer cooperation between the peoples of Europe."
"Mr President, one year ago the European Commission adopted a proposal on the rationalisation of European instruments for the recognition of transparency of qualifications and competences."
"Europass is this initiative."
"It is a step towards a European learning area, as my predecessor said during the first reading. Europass will help people make their qualifications and competences clearly and easily understood throughout Europe."
"It will thus make it easier for citizens to find a job or move more easily from one country to another for studies or work."
"The proposal brings together, in a coordinated portfolio called Europass, five existing transparency documents. These are the Europass-Curriculum Vitae, which will highlight personal competences; the Europass-Language Portfolio, which provides an accurate description of linguistic skills;"
"Europass-Mobility, which records all mobility experiences for learning purposes and replaces existing Europass training while giving it wider scope; the Europass-Diploma Supplement; and lastly the Europass-Certificate Supplement. These last documents clarify respectively competences behind a higher education diploma and a vocational training certificate."
"Europass is an open framework which in future could include other instruments, for instance to target specific competences such as computer-related skills."
"I am pleased to know that this essential feature was endorsed and enriched by Parliament, which stressed its importance, as well as by the Council, which defined a clear procedure to put it into practice."
"This illustrates how the proposal, without having been substantially changed, has been improved through the exchange of views between institutions, based on the widespread consensus on both its purpose and content."
"I wish to stress the remarkable work achieved first by Mrs Zissener and now by Mrs Novak, in close contact with the Commission and the Council."
"This work has allowed us to reach this final stage."
"The common position adopted by the Council responds to the concerns expressed by both legislative bodies, integrating the amendments proposed by Parliament with only two minor changes that leave their substance unchanged."
"As you know, the Commission accepts this common position. I am therefore pleased that Mrs Novak's report proposes accepting this common position, which would allow its entry into force on 1 January 2005."
"I intend to go further, proposing to Member States and social partners an appropriate instrument to facilitate the transparency of qualifications."
"We hope the European Parliament will support the Commission in its efforts."
"Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Culture and Education, for its efforts to speed up the process especially at this second reading phase."
"I also express my gratitude to both the Irish and Netherlands presidencies of the Council for all their work."
"Europass is a direct service to citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, may I express my thanks to Mrs Novak and her predecessor, Mrs Zissener."
"The Europass is a European record of achievement with which, I am glad to say, we have been able to take a small but important step forward after all the fine words about taking government to the people."
"First of all, it creates transparency throughout Europe for all periods of education and training, for skills acquired in all walks of life."
"Secondly, it creates credibility through the certification and recognition of occupational and extra-vocational experience, including voluntary work in the realms of social welfare, culture and sport as well as the acquisition of various linguistic skills."
"Thirdly, it creates efficiency, because it fosters understanding and recognition of qualifications and skills for an ever-increasing number of young and not-so-young people."
"More than ever before, we need to take government closer to the people, and we need fewer eulogies to a technocratic and bureaucratic virtual Europe."
"We need tangible instruments, of which the Europass is a prime example."
"It is a resource for people’s everyday lives."
"It lets people experience Europe at first hand on a daily basis, wherever they are."
"All measures in the field of education policy, such as Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig, e-learning, the mutual recognition of diplomas and now the Europass, add value to Europe by lending it a human dimension."
"This injection of soul into Europe, which puts individuals at the heart of the debate and makes them the focus of decisions affecting their everyday lives, is important."
"The Europass is a key element, not only in terms of the comparability and recognition of professional achievements but more especially because it includes voluntary social and civic involvement in the catalogue of acquired skills."
"I should like to congratulate the Commission and all of us here for having created this really good mechanism in such a short time – less than a year – and I very much hope that, along with the other improvements envisaged by Commissioner Figeľ, we shall have a good platform from which to launch the Europass next year."
"I wish him, and hence our young people too, every success."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with the Europass we have created a supplementary instrument that can help us in the pursuit of many aims, including the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, which we have been discussing extensively."
"We know that this aim has slipped down the list of priorities and that we should present it in a far more progressive manner than is currently the case."
"As for this Europass, although it is a ‘soft’ form of evidence of qualifications and competence with no binding force, it is still very important and helps young and mobile people on training courses who spend training periods abroad to obtain a transparent and comprehensible summarised record of their achievements, qualifications and acquired skills with more or less full comparability throughout the EU."
"This, at last, is a sign of the transparency we are always invoking."
"At the same time, the Europass is intended to give future employers within the European Union an overview of a young person’s experience and qualifications."
"The extended collection of documents, which, as you know, comprises a curriculum vitae, a mobility pass and other papers, is a standardised supplementary instrument."
"This new framework, which guarantees that new documents in the field of information technology, for example, can be incorporated into the Europass portfolio in future, is very important, because education is always full of innovations, and the Europass will have to accommodate them."
"I am very grateful for this flexibility."
"I should also like to refer to the value of periods spent in other countries, and I believe that the documents should not only record dates and technical details but should also include explicit and retraceable references to intercultural learning experiences and social integration."
"The EU stands for openness and mobility."
"It encourages and demands mobility."
"For this reason, I proposed that people be issued with an introductory guide to mobility."
"This proposal, unfortunately, has been watered down by the addition of the phrase ‘where appropriate’."
"May I ask that issuing such a guide be deemed appropriate in very many cases, because that, to me, would be a real sign of government being taken to the people."
"Moreover, I believe that the national Europass agencies should be integrated into existing agencies and that these should be developed with a view to pooling the experience, activities and networks of existing institutions."
"We should also launch an information campaign."
"The first of January will soon be here, and there is still a widespread lack of awareness."
"There is therefore an urgent need to mobilise in the cause of mobility."
"Mr President, Mr Figeľ, we often hear in this House about achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We also often hear about delays in meeting targets."
"We are halfway through the period by the end of which we are aiming to be the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs."
"If Europe’s position in the knowledge-based economy is to be cemented, the appropriate conditions must be created."
"European systems of education and specialist training must meet the requirements of the new economy and must be able to interconnect."
"Opportunities for education and specialist training must be offered in the different Member States and at different stages in the lives of young people, whether unemployed or employed, who are threatened by the fact that rapid technological changes might render their qualifications worthless."
"Today, this single Framework for the Transparency of Qualifications and Competences make it easier for citizens to inform Europe of their qualifications and competences."
"This framework will make the existing system of using documents better coordinated, more streamlined and more effective for the transparency of qualifications and competences accepted at European level."
"Many employers and head teachers are aware of the current problems with the assessment of levels of knowledge and skill achieved within an uncoordinated framework of different qualifications, certificates and diplomas."
"The introduction of the Europass will make it easier for workers, students, employers and educational institutions to operate in the European labour and education market."
"Mr President, the common position for adopting the Parliament and Council decision on the Europass seems eminently sensible, and one wonders why it took so long to achieve it following the completion of the single market 12 years ago."
"The difficulty is not in adopting this proposal but in implementing it."
"Mrs Novak's explanatory statement helpfully highlights the role envisaged for the national Europass centres to coordinate all the activities laid down by this decision."
"But this is not some detailed administrative role."
"If the proposal is to have the maximum benefit, implementation entails direct and continuous contact by the national Europass centres both with universities and colleges and also with employers' organisations."
"I wonder whether, in his reply to the debate, the Commissioner might dwell on this point and indicate how he sees the national Europass centres successfully undertaking this work?"
"The other – related – point I wish to raise is the question of monitoring the system."
"The initial evaluation period will now take place after three years – originally it was proposed after four years – and thereafter at intervening four-year timescales."
"I would have thought it unlikely that after the initial evaluation period radical changes would be made; so what that really means is that it is not until the system has been up and running for seven years that the Commission is going to be able to take a view on it."
"That seems rather a long way off."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner might dwell on that point as well?"
"Mr President, may I add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Novak for her excellent, rapid and, above all, pragmatic work."
"My thanks are also due to the Commission for its initiative."
"This is an area of our activity to which the people of Europe, especially our young people, can relate and from which they can derive many benefits."
"With such initiatives we can show young people that the Community makes tangible improvements which affect their daily lives."
"It is certainly a good example of the people-centred policy we need to pursue."
"The document on the table is the fruit of a lengthy development process, and I should stress that it is not the final word, for the Commission has also stated clearly that the scope and potential for development must be preserved, and indeed the document itself provides for an open-ended process."
"Specific initiatives in the field of education, of course, were already being launched back in the sixties and seventies."
"The aim was always to enhance the quality and mobility of students and trainees without seeking to harmonise European education policies."
"It goes without saying that we must accompany such measures with instruments and incentives to make cross-border education a feasible option."
"Particularly for residents of territorially smaller countries with many borders, these initiatives are an important point of entry to the single European market."
"The aim must therefore be to introduce further improvements, which means clearing away a significant amount of red tape and, most importantly, involving business and labour organisations and making the system easier and cheaper to manage, especially as regards documentation."
"More exchanges of young trainees must be encouraged at every level, with primary importance attaching to financial support."
"This is the only way for us to achieve the Lisbon objective and, in particular, to increase public satisfaction with the Community."
"In conclusion, let me simply add that more than 200 000 young people have already taken part in these mobility programmes in recent years, and this is the direction in which we should seek to progress."
". Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I would like to respond to several points."
"Of course I should begin by expressing my thanks for the support given to the concept and to the process itself."
"EUROPASS is a good initiative and I am convinced that it will bear fruit."
"Our actual approach has a deadline of next year but as early as tomorrow morning I am travelling to Maastricht, which is hosting a large conference of ministers of education and vocational training."
"This will be followed by a conference with our economic and social partners, the aim of which is to promote still further the Copenhagen process, which is a constituent part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In January, under the Luxembourg Presidency, we want to launch a campaign to apply EUROPASS in the individual Member States."
"The current network of so-called experts and consultants for EUROPASS correspondents will be changed to a network of national centres for EUROPASS."
"Our agencies in the various countries will be required to prepare for the transition to national EUROPASS centres."
"I believe that the resources which the Commission has earmarked for the years 2005 and 2006, although modest, have been directed precisely towards support for the concept of EUROPASS."
"The sum of EUR 2 million per annum will not only help us to visualise this possibility but will increase its effect in that it will start to be used as a credible document for the transparency of qualifications within the European Union."
"As Mr Beazley said, the single market does indeed demand much greater opportunities for the movement of labour and also for the movement of students, those people who are in the process of gaining qualifications."
"I am sure that this further step taken towards the recognition of qualifications other than the regulated ones should not take as long as some of the processes did in the past in building up compatibility in the single market area."
"I would also like to add to what Mrs Prets said, namely that support for intercultural dialogue will increase and that anyone who can find their feet in a broader cultural environment and who masters the language and culture of a particular country will have the same comparative advantage."
"The enlarged European Union needs all of this to become a reality."
"I think I have said enough."
"I would like to thank you once more for allowing me the opportunity to participate in this discussion and I would like to wish you and all of us every success."
"Thank you very much, ."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the Commission’s strategic political orientations."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the four weeks that have passed since my team was given your support, we have rolled up our sleeves and set to work."
"Our main objective has been to draw up proposals for a common vision to govern the activities of Parliament, the Council and the Commission over the coming years."
"This vision will flesh out the partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security, which I announced here last July."
"It will identify the main economic, social and environmental challenges upon which our success will depend, and it will put forward priorities and solutions."
"It cannot be a unilateral exercise, however."
"This is why this debate is important."
"This is why I am here today to listen to you."
"I want to hear Parliament’s proposals, as they will be an essential contribution to our joint thinking."
"I want to hear the concerns and, through you, to get to know the opinions of the millions of Europeans that you represent."
"Why is that so important?"
"Because I am sure that the success of this Commission, of this Parliament and of the European project that we share depends on our showing that the European Union can make a difference, both within our borders and without."
"Just as we are now preparing to ratify the European Constitution, we must not forget Europe’s remarkable achievements: half a century of peace and of social and economic development, as well as the recent enlargement representing the reunification of our continent."
"We must not, however, underestimate the challenges that we face and that require a Europe-wide response: the increasing age of our populations, the damage done to the environment and the effects of climate change, the need to adapt our economy to the competitive context of globalisation, and the threats to our peace and security."
"Today I do not intend to present a detailed account of our work in progress before listening to you; I would, however, like to outline the main elements of our approach."
"To connect the European Union with its citizens we must earn the confidence of Europeans every day by providing answers to their concerns."
"Their main worries concern the economic and employment situation."
"There is no freedom, no future, if you are not able to earn a decent living and to secure the future of your children."
"We need a strong, stable and dynamic economy to generate more jobs and more opportunity."
"The main question is: how?"
"We do not need another library of comprehensive studies to answer that question."
"The work has already been done."
"The Lisbon strategy is both a diagnostic and a list of tasks to perform."
"As I said in this House in July and in November, I intend to make it a top priority of the action of the Commission."
"A knowledge-based economy will be at the core of such a strategy."
"For the time being it may look too much like a catalogue of worthy aims, but the Commission wants to reshape it and transform it into a road map for prosperity, identifying clear objectives and a demanding calendar."
"This must be done with the Member States, who share the responsibility for implementation, and in a constructive dialogue with the social partners."
"Economic growth is not an end in itself."
"Europeans are concerned about the sustainability of our social model – our solidarity mechanisms, health and pension systems."
"They care about the quality of life and their environment."
"The only way to secure these goods is to generate the necessary resources to that end, and therefore to secure economic growth."
"Otherwise this will remain an affordable luxury for only some of our citizens."
"Europeans are also concerned about their personal security."
"Crime is not limited to the boundaries of our Member States."
"Terrorism is the ugly face of globalisation."
"We need safer streets and a safer continent."
"The Commission will actively promote initiatives to provide our citizens with a better level of personal security and therefore of personal freedom."
"What are our means?"
"We must back our ambition with the necessary financial resources at European and national level."
"We will not be a true Union without a vigorous cohesion policy."
"We must complete the internal market on the basis of clear and simple regulations."
"We need better regulation and have to be ready to roll back unnecessary red tape."
"We can also do this by supporting our strategic objectives with a new way of working inspired by the Constitution."
"All this must amount to a positive agenda for reform."
"But all this will not be achieved in a vacuum."
"The Union is not an isolated entity."
"It is not a fortress."
"A number of states want to join our Union."
"We should prepare ourselves to welcome them in the same way as they make efforts to meet our demanding standards."
"We also have neighbours and we need to better structure our relationship with them, to tackle common problems and promote stability."
"We have partners in the entire world with whom we are united by strong cultural and economic ties."
"Europe cannot be selfish."
"We have a duty of solidarity with the poorest regions of the world, particularly Africa."
"Our values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights imposes on us the responsibility of promoting them worldwide."
"Only by strengthening our values will we be able to defend our interests in the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is present here today to listen to you."
"The Commission’s considerations will draw upon today’s debate, which will undoubtedly be of great assistance to us in proposing strategic priorities for the entire Union and in concluding the preparation of our work programme for the first year of this Commission."
"I shall present these proposals to you at the second plenary session of January."
"They will then have to be discussed by Parliament and by the Council so that agreement can be reached on the objectives and priorities for the Union during the first half of 2005."
"I should like to say another word or two about my initiative to develop joint strategic objectives."
"One the one hand, the concept of multiannual planning is now enshrined in the Constitution."
"It has indeed already been put into practice with the Council and the last Parliament."
"For the time being, however, we are solely committed to coordinating the planning for the three institutions, without going as far as coordinating our strategic visions for the medium- and long-term future."
"On the other hand, although it is true that the previous Commissions presented their vision, this did not always represent the expression of a real partnership with Parliament or the Council."
"The practical result was that Europe was being driven without a sufficiently clear roadmap, the consequence being that we were sometimes diverted from our route by external international events and that our priorities changed too much as a result of the political agendas of the different presidencies."
"At the very least, therefore, we are duty-bound to do our best to set the medium- and long-term priorities for the entire Union, by which I mean not just the priorities for our institution, but also the efforts that we must make to set priorities for the whole of Europe."
"Our joint strategic objectives must act as a global navigation system for Europe for the next five years."
"It is clear that we must demonstrate flexibility and show ourselves to be capable of adapting to change."
"Nonetheless, our joint objectives will certainly help us to define priorities to be used later to assess the work of our institutions: the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"I am very much looking forward to hearing your contributions and working with you to establish an ambitious agenda for the future of Europe."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling our sleeves up."
"The difficult and sometimes dramatic weeks involved in confirming the Commission are behind us."
"It eventually got a resounding vote of confidence, and our Group voted for it with a large degree of unanimity."
"Now is the time to get down to work."
"Today’s debate is a quite new experience, and what makes it so is the fact that the Commission first listens to Parliament."
"Mr President of the Commission, I am very glad to hear you say that you wanted to hear what Parliament thinks about the work the Commission will be doing over the next five years."
"I am also glad to hear you say that you will be presenting your programme on 26 January and, in so doing, want to take into consideration as much as possible of what Parliament has to say."
"Even as I speak, we are endeavouring to put together this House’s common position."
"Our Group has tabled a motion for a resolution, which is currently being discussed with the other Groups."
"I hope that the House will be able to express an opinion, thus enabling the Commission and – it is to be hoped – the Council, to agree on a five-year programme."
"Our group believes that there are five main priorities: if we were able to implement them alone, we would do so, but we cannot, and that is why we always need to be willing to compromise."
"The first is economic reforms in the European Union to make for greater competitiveness and more prosperity for the public; the second is to improve security by combating terrorism and crime, securing the European Union’s external borders, preventing abuse of the asylum systems and fighting illegal immigration."
"I might add that this is something that matters also to people who enter the EU illegally, for what is going on in the Mediterranean, with thousands of people dying because the situation there remains unresolved, is a fundamental violation of human rights."
"We must join together in attempting to find solutions so that people no longer end up losing their lives in the Mediterranean."
"The third priority is a stronger Europe in a safer world, creating greater stability and fostering democracy and human rights."
"Fourthly, there is a need to shape a policy that makes a clean environment possible and offers people a better quality of life."
"The fifth and final priority is to make the European Union more open, more receptive to new ideas and more democratic, to enable it to work better and with less red tape."
"What I ask of you, Mr President of the Commission, is that, whenever putting forward a proposal, you should ask yourself whether it makes for more bureaucracy, whether it contravenes the principle of subsidiarity, and how much it costs."
"What I ask, in other words, is that all these things should be taken into account in the Commission’s administrative practice as early as the stage at which proposals are presented."
"There are three aspects on which I would like to focus rather more closely."
"It is Europe’s competitiveness that determines whether people in the European Union have work and the wherewithal to live."
"Our main concern must be to maintain and create jobs, and we can do that only if we make Europe more competitive."
"I would urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to be cautious in the language you use, for the language used in the Lisbon Declaration, according to which the European Union was to become the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev, who, in the 1950s and 1960s, wanted to overtake the USA, and we know what became of that!"
"So let us be modest in what we say, but ambitious in what we do."
"If you do that, you will be on the right track."
"By far the greater part of our Group takes the view that we must not jeopardise the stability criteria that underpin the Stability and Growth Pact, for new debts will have to be repaid tomorrow by those who are the young generation of today, something that would neither make economic sense nor be in line with the policy’s moral foundations."
"Something else that is important is the neighbourhood policy."
"I would like to encourage you to have us, during your presidency, taking initiatives in the Middle East, seeing as we do that the Americans cannot manage on their own."
"The Middle East is a region that is one of the European Union’s neighbours, and it is worthy of every effort on our part to establish stability and peace in it for both Israel and Palestine."
"We know how important all this is to peace and for the sake of good relations with the Arab and Muslim world."
"Our priority must be the adoption of the Constitution, on which the European Union’s peaceful and democratic action in the twenty-first century depends."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to see Mr Barroso again this morning."
"Mr Barroso, I have not had the opportunity of speaking to you for a month, have positively longed to see you, and it is good that you are here to listen for ideas to take away with you."
"I am also glad to see Mrs Kroes sitting behind you;"
"I will readily admit that it gave me pleasure to see that the first thing she has done, after all that has happened here, is to submit one of the decisions taken by Portugal’s Government under Mr Barroso to critical scrutiny – a good indication of her independence."
"Mr Poettering’s references to Nikita Khrushchev are getting more frequent."
"The reason for this, which I can divulge to the House, is that Mr Poettering’s doctorate was on Konrad Adenauer’s security policy."
"Like much else in his politics, Adenauer’s security policy was guided by the motto of ‘no experiments’."
"I can tell Mr Poettering that ‘no experiments’ will not get the European Union very far."
"So let me encourage you, Mr Barroso, to be cautious only in the words you use, but bold in what your Commission proposes and in the initiatives it takes."
"I want now to seize the opportunity to give you, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, three essential messages to take away with you; in previous debates, I have described them as the three key elements in our policy in this House."
"Before I repeat them, let me give you – for you are here to listen – some more good advice, which is that whatever initiatives you take will need broad majority support in this House."
"I therefore take it as read that you will take what the Socialist Group says on board and that it will also be reflected in the initiatives you put forward."
"You will of course understand that any programme from the Commission that is flawlessly constructed and draws on neo-liberalism or conservative thinking while devoid of any social democratic elements will not get any support from us."
"Let that be quite clear."
"If we want economic policy in the European Union to be guided – as Mr Poettering put it – by economic reforms, then, just so we can make it clear where the faultlines are that divide consensus from conflict, I can tell you – Mr Poettering, Mr Barroso – that such economic reforms, always and above all, add up to one thing."
"They must, indeed, help to make the European Union more competitive, but they must also, and above all, help to promote social cohesion in Europe."
"The two are different sides of the same coin."
"Those who believe that competitiveness demands that Europe’s workers should have fewer rights will have energetic resistance from our Group to contend with."
"To take an example, the Services Directive will give you an early opportunity to show us whether this Commission is willing to bring the two together."
"Competitiveness must be emphasised as much as possible, but social cohesion is absolutely indispensable as the basis for everything we do."
"Mr Poettering’s second point, in which he mentioned anti-terrorism in the same breath as asylum and immigration, struck me as combining two quite different phenomena in a dangerous way."
"Combating terrorism is one of the European Union’s core tasks, but please do not lump it together with illegal immigration and asylum policy."
"I am sure you do not in fact intend to do so, but please make the distinction!"
"Counter-terrorism has little to do with asylum and immigration, but asylum and immigration form one single task, one of European policy’s pressing concerns."
"For that reason, Mr Barroso, I believe that the good proposals that have already been made – years ago, by Commissioner Vitorino as part of the Tampere process – should again feature in your programme."
"The Europe we expect – and this is what our group is striving for – is both humane and concerned to guard its citizens’ security, one whose external borders are secured as consistently as possible, but which also treats humanely those who need our protection."
"We talk about a clean environment and need a sustainable policy for it, but we also have to set out in plain terms what has again become apparent in Buenos Aires over the past week, that the failure of a sustainable worldwide policy for the environment is not the European Union’s doing."
"One of the Commission’s core tasks must be to spell out the fact that, for as long as the United States of America fails to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, for as long as it does nothing to help reduce the production of CO2, we Europeans must be tireless in demanding that it should do so."
"That is one of your core tasks as President of the Commission."
"My third point, Mr Barroso, is another message for you as you prepare your programme; it has to do with Europe’s putting down roots and establishing its place in the world."
"A model of democracy founded upon multinationality and multi-ethnic structures, which is what the European Union is, can be a winner when it comes to exporting peace to the world, because balance and acceptance are at the heart of the European Union – the balance between large and small and the acceptance of minorities in particular."
"If you base Europe’s international policy on this message that we seek internal balance – as we are at the moment helping to do in Ukraine – and that we seek political rather than military solutions to ethnic conflicts, then you will always have the Socialist Group on your side."
"Mr President, the ALDE Group supports the Lisbon process as the best way of achieving a competitive European economy and it maintains that sustainable economic development has to be a guiding principle in all future regulatory initiatives."
"Cohesion and social development are necessary, but do not take place in Europe today."
"A knowledge-based society is necessary, but is not a reality in Europe today."
"We have to increase funding for research and development and we also have to do a lot more work on lifelong learning."
"Technical development with regard to environmental concerns is necessary, and this does not take place in Europe today – at least not in the way it could and should."
"Fundamental human rights, the rule of law and gender equality are what the European citizen want to achieve: that is the sound basis of economic growth."
"I therefore urge you, Commissioner, not to mix up the fight against terrorism with human rights and the concerns for human rights."
"Furthermore, active participation in the labour market makes a substantial contribution to a decent standard of living, regional development and social cohesion, although investment in education and research, as well as government action in cases of serious market failure, also have a key role to play."
"Each minister of finance in Europe today is taken up to the mountain top with all the temptations of undermining the Growth and Stability Pact."
"Sometimes the reaction is the same as that of the famous Swedish actress who once said: 'I do not have to be drawn into temptation, I can walk by myself'."
"The ALDE Group firmly believes that a robust and dynamic economic environment in the European Union can only come about if the new Commission commits itself to reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact so that it provides a strong bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility, while maintaining the necessary flexibility to ensure that Europe maximises its growth potential without endangering price stability."
"The ALDE Group is fully prepared to cooperate with the Commission along this very stony path that we have to walk together, but this must be based on sustainable development."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that during today’s debate many fellow Members of various political groups, some of them quite unexpectedly, have spoken at length about sustainability."
"I believe that such interest is important, since I am sure that this issue will become a genuine priority for the Commission too."
"At a time when many citizens have a growing distrust of the European project, the main strategic objective of the new Commission and all the other Community institutions ought to be to return to being visibly effective in improving the quality of life for citizens, to become a positive instrument for democratic growth both within and outside the European Union and to transform the Union into an area of technological innovation focusing on ecological and social sustainability."
"We believe that three commitments are necessary to achieve these goals."
"The first relates to consistency in terms of the objectives established and the capacity to ensure they are achieved."
"Therefore, we strongly urge the Commission to be more determined in taking into account the EU’s key commitments, such as sustainability, social cohesion and gender equality, in all its policy proposals, and to make a real commitment to restoring a balance among the three Lisbon Agenda pillars – economic, social and environmental – in order to avoid promoting inflexible economic objectives at the expense of the quality of our citizens’ individual lives."
"We call on the Commission to put forward bold proposals for a coordinated effort to give fresh impetus to investment in environmental technologies and measures to promote employment."
"As far as competitiveness is concerned, we would like to see the relevant indicators extended to include qualitative, social and environmental indicators too, such as income distribution, poverty and energy efficiency."
"We think that consistency is also measured in terms of the capacity to ensure that the commitments undertaken are complied with."
"We know that a very large number of Member States are not complying with the Kyoto Protocol targets and we therefore believe that the ways in which the Commission will help these countries to comply with the protocol are an important ingredient in achieving consistency."
"On this point, we would like to relaunch our old proposal for a climate stability pact, which would lay down a joint management system for the Kyoto commitments that would be not merely repressive but also positive."
"The second commitment which we certainly must re-evaluate relates to having the courage to reject an easy conformism that ignores the European Union’s responsibilities in the world; we must, instead, make Europe a point of reference and a model for those in the rest of the world who are fighting to defend human rights and freedom."
"This point is extremely important to us."
"We cannot refrain from expressing our thoughts on human rights in China and Russia or on the war in Chechnya for commercial and economic reasons."
"We will soon be speaking again about the Dayton accords, now reaching their tenth anniversary."
"We need to take action on this point as well, and we hope that the Commission will be able to put forward some positive initiatives."
"The third and final commitment relates to the ability to truly represent the interests of the European Union as a union, by managing not to be overly influenced by the power relations between individual countries and with the Council in general, and by finding true alliances between those in the European Parliament, the voluntary sector and business who share the idea that the European Union is much more than the sum of the EU governments."
"To this end, we call upon the Barroso Commission to reconsider, and perhaps to withdraw, the Bolkestein directive, to defend the REACH directive tooth and nail, to put forward a new directive on services of general interest, to abandon or at least to review the former Commission’s policy on GMOs and to take a practical and courageous approach to opening legal immigration channels."
"Mr President, in conclusion I would like to mention at least four fundamental points in the interinstitutional agreement which we would like to enter into with you."
"The first, of course, relates to the code of conduct for Commissioners and a serious approach to the issue of conflicts of interest."
"The second concerns the issue of impact assessment."
"New laws should not be assessed arbitrarily but in a way that is based on uniformly applied criteria."
"The European Parliament is moving slowly on this front."
"We know that companies and the economic world in general are much more active in this field."
"We must encourage the Commission and Parliament to assess new laws on the criteria of sustainability and social impact as well."
"The third point relates to the reopening of the issue of access to documents."
"We are extremely dissatisfied with the current situation and sincerely hope that in the coming years we will succeed in obtaining a positive outcome."
"The fourth and final point concerns a very complex issue, of which we will no doubt have occasion to speak again, which is the Commission’s attitude to contraventions of Community law by the Member States."
"We are extremely concerned about the delays that have built up and the fact that the Commission now seems to have practically abandoned this priority, particularly in the environmental field."
"We very much hope that in the future the Commission will reconsider this priority, since the credibility of the European Union also depends on its ability to ensure that its laws are obeyed."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, given the dominant political profile of the new Commission, it would be foolhardy of my group to ask it to implement a set of strategic orientations corresponding to our vision for Europe."
"Nonetheless, in view of the unexpected strength of the headwinds at the time of his investiture, I should like to recommend that Mr Barroso give his less fortunate fellow citizens a few clear signals to show that he has also heard what they have to say."
"The first signal could relate to the draft directive on the liberalisation of services, commonly known as the Bolkestein Directive, to which Mr Schulz and Mrs Frassoni have referred."
"This text confirms all of the reservations towards the European liberal model held by the social movements, including the European Trade Union Confederation – and with good reason."
"At the very heart of the draft lies the infamous country of origin principle, which is intended to allow service providers to apply the social legislation in force in their home countries in all Member States."
"This would constitute a social dumping machine, a sort of flag of convenience covering all services."
"My belief is that such a measure will not be accepted by our fellow citizens."
"My request is therefore simple, Mr Barroso: withdraw the Bolkestein Directive and initiate a broad debate on the subject."
"A second signal could concern the plan to set up holding centres for refugees and migrants on the southern shore of the Mediterranean or in other countries outside the Union."
"This is an appalling plan."
"The last Commission legitimised this move, however, by initiating and financing pilot projects."
"Here again, my request is simple: put a complete end to these plans."
"The third signal should, in our view, involve the interminable and dramatic conflict in the Middle East."
"The Union was jointly responsible for the roadmap providing for the creation of a Palestinian State in 2005."
"We are now at the end of 2004 and our undertaking is nowhere near even starting to be implemented."
"The main obstacle is Sharon."
"No other leader, except, no doubt, George Bush, could violate UN resolutions, scorn the Hague Court and snub the Union as he does without reprisals."
"The Commission has just proposed that he should form part of what one Commissioner has called a ‘ring of friends’ and benefit from the advantages of its new neighbourhood policy."
"It should be realised that this measure risks being grossly misunderstood by people who no longer support the policy of double standards."
"My request in this case, Mr Barroso, would be that you should remove all ambiguity in this area by answering a twofold question: what are you going to require of Mr Sharon and what measures do you recommend if he persists in ignoring you?"
"Your responses to these three points will certainly be followed very closely."
". Mr President, Mr Barroso, how nice it is for us to be able to continue our conversation that was so rudely interrupted just a month ago."
"You talked this morning about leading in Europe, and there is much talk of five-year plans, of the great visions that you have; but it seems to me that you have one or two problems."
"There is the problem of legitimacy, and the Commission has the problem of credibility."
"On whose authority are you people the government of Europe?"
"I certainly have never been asked whether that is what I want."
"The total failure of the hearings of the Commissioners that went through this Parliament has cast a very dark shadow over your Commission."
"You know as well as I do that the gap between what you want and what the ordinary voters want is getting wider."
"That is why the turnout in the European elections in June was down to a record low."
"People know that the Lisbon agenda is nothing more than a joke and that the economic model in the European Union is simply not working."
"Perhaps the Constitution and the referendums that we are going to have offer us both a chance for a solution; but they must be free and fair referendums."
"I would like your assurance that any information that goes out to Member States in which there are going to be referendums presents both sides of the argument, so that we can have a free and fair result."
"Not to do so is to risk long-term public contempt."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment briefly on several points in the order in which they were mentioned by Mr Barroso."
"I will start with economic issues."
"The Lisbon strategy is a splendid idea, but it has to be remembered that if Europe is to compete with the rest of the world, its economy must be soundly based on freedom."
"Much has been said in this House about the need for a knowledge-based economy and for an economy based on social values, and rightly so."
"Nonetheless, unless Europe’s economy is based on freedom, it will be unable to compete successfully with the rest of the world."
"Mr Poettering seemed to be of the same mind, and I endorse the views he expressed."
"Mr Farage took the words out of my mouth, and there was sound common sense in what he said too."
"We must say yes to economic freedom, and it must have priority over everything else."
"You referred to the environment, Mr Barroso."
"It certainly is crucially important to protect the environment."
"We must say yes to environmental protection, but no to ideological ."
"It is not acceptable to be hemmed in by screens when driving through some beautiful German countryside, yet this is what happens to me twice a week."
"The screens have not been installed for the benefit of human inhabitants, but to prevent any possible disturbance to animals."
"As a result, I am prevented from admiring the landscape, and that is not acceptable."
"The wind generators one cannot fail to notice when travelling through the beautiful countryside in the Black Forest area are a similar case."
"These useless loss-making monsters are actually subsidised by the German Government and the European Union."
