"We need a firm line on this because the unemployment rate is a catastrophe for human beings and the economy."
"With regard to policy areas, we talk about SMEs and we produce very nice documents on them and on the importance of cutting red tape."
"Now, risk capital is essential to the work of SMEs."
"At the same time that we talk about the SMEs, unemployment etc., in the aftermath of the Lamfalussy report there are now 240 sub-groups working on new legislation for the financial markets."
"That is exactly the opposite of cutting red tape and getting enough risk capital for the SMEs."
"The second policy area is energy."
"We know that we have environmental problems, unemployment problems and regional development problems and that we need the production of biomass, district heating and trigeneration."
"Yet there is no cooperation between agricultural policy, energy policy and industrial policy."
"This cooperation is necessary; it is extremely important."
"Parliament and – I believe – the Commission are determined, but the Council is not being tough enough."
"You have to be tougher, Mr Juncker."
"– Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance does not want a Europe that plays fast and loose with our social and environmental benefits, which are part of our European identity."
"Nor do its citizens want it to."
"We therefore welcome the clear language of the Luxembourg EU Council Presidency and its commitment to the triad of economic, environmental and social issues."
"The conclusions of the spring summit are good European conclusions, have clearly put the Barroso Commission in its place, and shown it the error of its neoliberal tendencies."
"These celebratory declarations must now, though, be backed up by visible action, especially in two sectors: in environmental protection, we need European efforts for climate protection at long last, and this needs to be reflected both in the financial perspectives and at the European Investment Bank."
"Investments in public transport, investments in decontaminating buildings and investments in distant heating networks reduce climate damage and our dependence on oil."
"Little was said at the summit about the problem of oil and how it curbs European growth."
"In social policy, this means that we need a directive to protect public services at long last."
"One of the priorities of the remaining months of the Luxembourg Presidency should be to set this directive on public services in motion, because otherwise the spirit of Bolkestein will continue to hang over Europe."
"– Mr President, if a house’s foundations are rotten, you cannot help it withstand the winter by improving the roof."
"The Stability Pact does not deserve to be reformed, it deserves to be abolished."
"In particular, the new provision for taking account of so-called structural reforms clearly shows what it has always been about: it has not been about price stability or about solid government finances; it has been an instrument to justify rushing through neoliberal liberalisation and privatisation plans, plans whose implementation had already pushed the profits of European conglomerates up by 78% in 2004."
"However, those who reap the profits are clearly far from satisfied."
"The proposal for a services directive is a new attempt to finally lay the European social modelto rest."
"Instead of harmonising standards upwards, we will see an unrestrained dumping race to the lowest common denominator; instead of welfare as and where required, all sectors of human life will be commercialised."
"That is obviously the vision for Europe which the think tanks of the major groups, the business lobby, have in mind."
"Seventy thousand people demonstrated in Brussels in March against the brutality of the neoliberal project."
"They will be watching to see if the Council's criticism only had the imminent Constitution referendum in France in its sights or if serious deeds follow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at its latest meeting the European Council recognised that there is very little to show for the Lisbon Strategy at the half-way stage."
"It has actually been a total failure."
"I would remind the House that the Union has not achieved the target of 3% economic growth it set itself, and the gap between per capita GDP in the EU and in the US has actually grown, when it was supposed to disappear."
"There has only been a slight increase in expenditure in the key area of research and development, and employment growth in the areas singled out by the Lisbon Strategy has fallen far short of expectations."
"There are still significant obstacles to the free movement of goods and services within the Union."
"A condition for that sustainable and balanced growth that is now simply wishful thinking would be liberalisation of the services market."
"I use the words ‘would be’ advisedly, as freedom of economic activity remains theoretical, despite long-standing provisions in the Treaty to that effect."
"The liberalisation process has been met with strong opposition on the part of officials and trade associations in the countries of the old Union."
"Its opponents argue that the quality of the services provided by enterprises in the new countries is lower, and that the latter are engaging in social dumping."
"At the same time, the opponents of liberalisation are discriminating against their own fellow citizens by forcing them to pay unduly high prices for the services they require."
"I firmly believe that another key catalyst for economic growth would be to turn cohesion policy into something more than simply a propaganda slogan."
"If the Lisbon Strategy is to be saved, the Council, the Commission and above all, EU officials must remember the true meaning of the principle of solidarity and how a free market actually operates."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is surprising how impending elections can sometimes make politicians change tack and even get them to deny their own principles."
"For example, I take some malicious delight in the truly sad soap opera that is being played out in Europe in response to the Bolkestein directive."
"After all, before 1 May 2004, we did not hear anybody complain about the liberalisation of services, because the Dutch commissioner’s plans simply fitted in with the European logic that service providers too should be able to work freely in the EU."
"In order to accommodate President Chirac, though, and to ensure that he does not suffer a humiliating defeat in the referendum on 29 May, it is now reported that the directive – having, of course, been approved by the socialists Mr Lamy and Mr Busquin – will be amended again, if not rewritten."
"Now it turns out that the directive is being put on ice for the time being so as not to give the French ‘no’ camp any more trump cards."
"The European Left have discovered that social dumping puts the jobs of their own people at risk."
"It has also rediscovered the importance of upholding national and sovereign interests."
"The French Left, again faithful to the traditions of the pre-war , has rediscovered the ‘own people first’ principle, which it formerly abominated, and rejects the directive’s country of origin principle."
"It remains to be seen, of course, whether this hypocrisy will be enough to prevent the ‘no’ camp from enjoying a landslide victory on 29 May."
"Contrary to what the luminaries in the Commission may think, the electorate is not stupid."
"A similar scenario is unfolding in Germany; today’s reports that the Social Democrat Chancellor, anxious as he is about the elections taking place next month in North Rhine-Westphalia, wants to impose stringent measures in order to avoid cheap labour from Eastern Europe taking jobs from the Germans."
"Who would ever have thought this former internationalist Marxist capable of such a thing?"
"We can do no other than congratulate him."
"Each generation has its own challenges to face."
"In the 80s, we were told how to improve our competitive position, and the 90s were about reorganising government funding."
"Now that we are being confronted with increasingly aggressive worldwide competition, along with an ever-changing world and an ageing population, we have to rise to the additional challenge of safeguarding our social model, which presupposes economic growth in the first place."
"Meanwhile, everyone now realises that it is not enough to respond to those challenges with declarations and unfulfilled promises."
"People are disillusioned; they want to see action and results."
"Following the European Summit, we can say that there is interinstitutional agreement and some sort of commitment to Lisbon’s revival, and that is why the summit’s conclusions are a hopeful new beginning and the presidency deserves credit."
"Let us interpret it that way to the people, and, as the President of the Council suggested, in their own language."
"Needless to say, we hope that the new regulations on the Stability Pact will provide convincing proof of the message that the President of the Council brought us, and that we can rely on clear criteria and sufficient enforceability."
"We are also pleased that the conclusions have highlighted the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, and we hope that this will be more than merely lip-service."
"With regard to the services directive, we have to conclude that, although a major communication battle has been lost, we have not lost the war."
"As co-legislator, we will do everything in our power to make the free movement of services possible and we will ensure that this is done in a way that is consistent with the task of our generation, namely securing our social model with its three dimensions."
"Mr President, Parliament’s steering committee for the Lisbon strategy agreed yesterday to work flat out, and, for our part, I can assure the Council presidency, the Commission, together with my fellow Members of this House and the members of the national parliaments, that we will continue to be firmly committed to achieving the objectives, and our cooperation with that end in mind can be relied on."
"Mr President, I see that Mr Watson is not present in the House, and that is something I regret."
"I must clearly dissociate myself from Mr Watson’s criticism of Mr Juncker, President of the European Union."
"It is not of course Mr Juncker’s fault that France now has a government so unpopular that it is in no position to convince the French population to vote in favour of the Treaty."
"The truth is, of course, that Mr Juncker himself, via the European Council held in March of this year, has ensured that the rest of us are in a position to explain to the French population that we now have a sensibly designed Stability and Growth Pact, that the balances in the Lisbon process have been retained and that we are now in a position to tackle the next step, as pointed out by Mr Almunia, Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner, who said that, by using the two instruments, together with macroeconomic initiatives, we are in actual fact in a position to create more, and new, jobs in Europe."
"I should like to say to Mr Watson, to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and to others, irrespective of whether or not they are present in the House, that what is at issue here is a responsibility shared by them and ourselves, as well as by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, by the whole of the Commission and by Mr Juncker and the Council."
"We must show the French population that this European Union has one main task right now, and that is to help create more, new and better jobs."
"France cannot create more, new and better jobs alone."
"France and the French people need a new Constitutional Treaty, and this new European structure, together with the political approach now set out by the March European Council and, hopefully, continued by the June European Council, provide us with some sound arguments for making further progress with our work on Europe."
"Europe is not a matter of daily spectacle and major revolutions."
"It is a matter of hard, sensible and purposeful work, and that is something on which I should like to compliment Mr Juncker today."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on the Stability Pact has its positive aspects, but some major concerns remain."
"First of all, it is essential that the Commission should have a stronger and not a weaker role in managing the Pact, as regards both the accounts side and the investments side, that is to say as regards both stability and growth."
"Secondly, it must be clearly understood that the new Pact is for growth, and for growth in the economy, not growth in deficits: the two things must not be linked together, as some national governments, such as the current Italian Government, seem to do."
"We therefore call on the European institutions to work to prevent dangerous renationalisations and to take decisive steps to boost the Community spirit."
"Otherwise, the very future of the Union will be in jeopardy if we do not maintain a Community approach in implementing both the Pact and the other main policies, primarily the vital Lisbon Strategy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 19 March there was an enormous demonstration in Brussels by trade unions and the peace movement against the Bolkestein directive, against free trade and war, and for a social Europe."
"Faced with the paradoxical situation in which we find ourselves, characterised by a strong currency, a weak economy and a society in crisis, faced with the crisis of the Maastricht framework and the Lisbon Strategy, in our view this demonstration – which brought together tens of thousands of workers from the whole of Europe, and I stress the whole of it, including the new countries in the east – put out a clear call for a much-needed change of direction."
"They did so despite the idea that some have of a two-tier Europe, that is to say one of internal dumping, the Europe of the Bolkestein directive."
"The demonstration showed instead that there is a need for a harmonisation of rights, levelled upwards, of course."
"What is needed, then, is a Europe that rejects the Bolkestein directive – that ominous directive on working hours – and, from the left, is able to break down the cage of monetarist free trade and to revitalise – not reduce – quality investments, rights, development, work and environment: in other words, one that is able to turn itself into a social Europe, the only possible kind."
"We want to try to put these aspirations into practice in this House through our proposals and help to bring into Parliament the strength of feeling that enlivened the streets of Brussels, to which this Parliament cannot fail to respond."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I really must say that we have become extremely modest when evaluating the results of meetings of Heads of State or Government."
"We would enjoy much greater confidence and more credibility among the citizens if the actions by the governments of the Member States were more consistently in line with the decisions taken."
"At the moment, we spend our time at summits correcting decisions instead of complying and pushing ahead with what has been agreed."
"The President-in-Office is probably the only person who even brings about joint resolutions at this stage."
"We are delighted about any type of agreement, because otherwise failure threatens."
"Please, take a brief look back with me. For me the problem before us lies in the contradiction between the European Treaties and political action."
"Take the Stability and Growth Pact: we beg for compliance, we deny any weakening, but infringements and margins for interpretation are increasing."
"Blocking measures are organised and the Commission is hampered in its ability to intervene and impose sanctions."
"Croatia: we decide that negotiations with Croatia will begin on 17 March but we postpone the negotiation process, even though the conditions are being complied with."
"Financial perspectives: we want agreement with the Luxembourg Presidency, but we receive no signals that anything has changed in the 1% stand towards the Commission proposal."
"Bulgaria and Romania: a Commission progress report is available, clearly showing which points of the conditions have not yet been met, but there is a date for signing the Treaties."
"Parliament is being asked to give its assent, but at the same time Parliament's rights were ignored on Monday."
"Lisbon: we want the internal market and hence also an internal market in services, but some of us are misleading the citizens, by reducing the services directive to the country of origin principle."
"I appeal to all of us, but above all to the Member States: we must become more accountable again, we must win confidence in decisions and we must abide by the rules which we set ourselves."
"We need fewer corrections to what already exists; instead, we need more serious compliance with decisions by Heads of State or Government, the Treaties and directives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at its latest meeting the European Council took a number of important decisions amending the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I would like to express my support for those changes."
"True, these decisions do weaken some of the provisions of the Pact and reduce their restrictive nature, but this need not imply relaxing budgetary discipline in Member States."
"We are all aware that the Pact’s rules have been systematically infringed for quite some time."
"There is currently an excessive budget deficit in one third of Member States."
"This is a very depressing situation, and confidence in the whole Union is being undermined."
"Amendment of the Pact and in particular greater flexibility of the preventive elements will actually strengthen its disciplinary powers."
"It is far better to have less restrictive rules that are actually kept by all without exception than more restrictive rules that are disregarded and infringed."
"I also welcome the Council decisions on reinvigorating the Lisbon Strategy, and am pleased that these decisions take account of the findings of the High Level Group led by Wim Kok."
"It is essential to implement the reforms contained in the Lisbon Agenda at the earliest opportunity, if greater sustainable economic growth and more jobs are to be created and the European social model preserved."
"It should be remembered, however, that the main responsibility for implementation of the essential structural reforms now lies with the Member States."
"It is up to governments and parliaments in the individual countries to demonstrate political courage and vision."
"They must be able to convince the citizens that swift and effective implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is in their long-term interest."
"The European institutions can and must support the governments of Member States in this difficult process."
"The Commission needs to strengthen its role as an effective enforcer of Council decisions, and it must monitor the progress of reforms in individual countries in a transparent manner."
"There should be ongoing cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments of Member States."
"Mr President, I propose setting up a standing forum where representatives of the European Parliament and the national parliaments could hold regular and well-focused meetings to discuss the challenges involved in implementing the Lisbon Strategy."
"This will foster an increased sense of responsibility for the implementation of the Strategy at parliamentary level and strengthen awareness of its importance for European societies."
"I do not think we have any reason whatever to take satisfaction in this summit, which was a shameful spectacle characterised by political horse-trading, and those self-same politicians are now shedding crocodile tears about the public’s cynicism."
"I see it as dealing another blow to the EU’s credibility."
"This summit should have prepared the European economy for the 21st century and should have brought in greater budgetary discipline and a free market in services, but instead we are stuck with the old formula of debts and protectionism."
"To call this social policy is a disgrace."
"Some say that the Stability Pact has been rescued, but to my mind, there has been nothing but demagogy in the vague formulations, get-out clauses and accounting tricks, not to mention the way in which the political leaders treat the services directive."
"The new Member States do not suffer our complacency, but are far more dynamic and carry out reforms, and I would like to take them as an example to follow."
"Finally, Mr President, I hope that following the various referendums and elections, long-term vision, courage, a sense of responsibility and political leadership can finally prevail once again."
"Mr President, the European economy is in a very delicate situation."
"The recent European Summit coincides with a downwards review of the European Commission's economic growth forecasts and, therefore, with a review not just of growth, but also of job creation."
"What we are being told is that, in the Europe of 2005, the unemployment rate is going to rise and there is going to be economic stagnation."
"And that is negative and is what we must respond to by sending clear messages, messages of confidence for consumers and messages of confidence for investors."
"The European economy's problem is a lack of confidence, which stems from economic policies which are not able to inspire that confidence."
"The Lisbon agenda, the Stability Pact and the liberalisation of services are key elements in terms of increasing this confidence."
"And we have missed an opportunity in March."
"We have missed the opportunity to promote healthy public finances and there are examples of this within Europe."
"The countries which have made an effort to rationalise their budgets are the countries which are growing and creating employment in Europe."
"The countries that have made the structural reforms contained in the Lisbon agenda are actually the countries which are growing and which are creating employment within the European Union."
"We cannot talk about the European social model without looking at those countries and we cannot express self-satisfaction when what has been carried out is a review of the Stability Pact based on the political interests of large countries which are not growing and which are not creating employment, and when doubts are being raised about the very nature of the Stability Pact and when there is a lack of confidence in the economic reforms that the European Union requires."
"This is the opportunity facing you, Mr Barroso, if your project to provide Europe with the growth and employment we all want to see is to be viable."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this an issue that we have not yet raised, but I believe that the conditions in which you have had to negotiate within the Eurogroup and then within Ecofin demonstrate that there may be a problem with the coordination of the powers of the two bodies."
"You have also mentioned the 3% and the 60%, indicating that they had not been changed."
"You are right."
"You would have had difficulty changing them, since these two figures are laid down in a protocol annexed to the Treaties which is taken up in a protocol annexed to the Constitution."
"I would like to return to the essential elements of this reform."
"The first points, which I believe we have not discussed sufficiently, are the points that allow us to move ahead in terms of harmonising the bases on which each Member State will draw up its budget in the future, identifying the macroeconomic perspectives to be taken into account and improving the statistical instruments for assessing the results of a particular Member State."
"The idea of involving national parliaments more seems to be fashionable at the moment."
"Nevertheless, I believe that, with regard to the competences that essentially remain with the Member States, this is the best approach, and it in this spirit that, on 25 April, we will hold a debate in the European Parliament, with the national parliaments, on the challenges of economic policy in Europe and in the Member States."
"When I look at the reality of this reform, there are disappointments."
"Each Member State has come with its demands, and we have seen, as we often do, a kind of trading in which everybody has taken the credit, without at the end of the day achieving European added value or the real prospect of a tool for growth and employment."
"We have more work to do in this regard."
"I know that you share this concern, that is to say that, in the future, genuine coordination of economic policies should allow us finally to gain all the possible advantages from the introduction of the euro."
"Finally – if you will allow me, Mr President – with regard to structural reforms, and hence pensions, they are, unfortunately, fundamentally the great winners from this reform, since, whether in the preventive stage or in the evaluation of deficits, they will have to be taken into account."
"I remember what you said to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. You did not seem necessarily to share the view that a reform of pensions should be guided by accounting principles."
"Mr President, stability and growth depend on a healthy economy."
"The EU’s economy is suffering daily, sometimes to the tune of millions of euro, due to the embargo imposed by Turkey on EU shipping."
"This embargo was intended in theory to be against Cyprus, but in practice it is against the whole of the EU."
"I shall explain why with the following example."
"A German-owned ship with a French flag carrying British goods for a Spanish company will be prevented from entering a Turkish port if it is discovered that a member of the board of the goods handling company previously had a business connection with a Cypriot company."
"This is illegal and absurd and there is no excuse for the Council and the Commission to tolerate such aggressive behaviour by a candidate country for one day longer."
"I would like briefly to raise another issue."
"Two days ago, , a daily newspaper with a large circulation and the mouthpiece of the Turkish Government, reported that the Council and the Commission had been working together on what sounds like a conspiracy to essentially isolate and destabilise the Cypriot Government in order to force it to accept an unpopular solution to the Cyprus issue."
"I know that this report is nonsense, but it has been misused for the purposes of Turkish propaganda and has caused my constituents concern."
"I urge you to state here today that it is utterly false and farcical."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Stability and Growth Pact has been much praised."
"However, I am convinced that it was a very difficult birth and that the outcome is anything but satisfactory."
"I do not mean to detract from the achievement of Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso in reconciling national egotisms, but what has emerged is a medium-term nail in the coffin of the stability of the euro."
"We do not notice this now, because at the moment the USA and Japan are much deeper in debt."
"However, as soon as their debts are reduced, the stability and exchange rate of the euro will be called into question."
"Of course the 3% and 60% criteria have been maintained."
"However, there is no longer even any discussion of the fact that the resolutions of the Stability and Growth Pact state that efforts should be made to balance the budget."
"The very first test, when it came to the two large states of France and Germany, went wrong."
"If you fail to keep to a pact in difficult times, what justification is there for doing so in good times?"
"I do not see this as a realistic concept."
"The difference between 0% and 3% alone makes EUR 250 billion in the eurozone."
"That is money which could have been used for short-term economic cycles, for natural disasters or for international obligations."
"By the time things had gone that far, it had all gone."
"That is why I believe that even the reference to the European Central Bank is insufficient, because, although the European Central Bank is independent, it is a subsidiary of the national banks."
"The European Central Bank has a governing council, but two-thirds of it is dominated by the governors of the national central banks."
"As long as the European Central Bank is not in a position to orientate its own refinancing business on whether government bonds in the eurozone have a good or a bad rating, it will be unable to help the euro achieve the necessary stability in the long term."
"Mr President, I welcome the outcome of the spring European Council."
"Allow me to point out four things."
"Firstly, the Lisbon process is balanced, which also means that the pillars are interdependent."
"Secondly, a lot of emphasis is placed on the European social model, which means not only more jobs but also high-quality jobs, social security systems that are secure and that need to be modernised and the reconciliation of working life and family life."
"Thirdly, I welcome what is said about the Services Directive."
"I believe that there is a growing consensus on it between the Council and, as I believe, the majority of this Parliament."
"We need a Services Directive, but it must not look like the existing proposal."
"We need to be able to retain the European social model. We need to be able to have high environmental requirements and robust consumer rights."
"I believe it is possible to devise such a proposal."
"Fourthly, sustainable development is a mainstreaming issue."
"Ecologically sustainable development is at issue, but so too – and to just as great a degree – is economically and socially sustainable development."
"Allow me finally to say that not everything is, of course, just negative."
"It is too easy to be pessimistic."
"We have not fully complied with the Lisbon process, but there are nonetheless a number of countries that have fulfilled many of its requirements."
"I shall not name those countries that have successfully met the requirements, but a glance at those countries reveals that they have combined growth, high employment, strong social systems and stringent environmental requirements."
"We have every reason to be optimistic about the future."
"Mr President, unfortunately, I have to say that the European Council was a unique display of bad leadership."
"At a time when the European economy is in real need of reform, when unemployment is increasing – including in Sweden, Mr Andersson – and Euroscepticism is becoming more widespread, what does the Council do?"
"Instead of standing up for Europe and publicly taking the lead, the EU’s leaders completely shy away from one of the most important issues in the Lisbon process, namely the Services Directive."
"Out of fear of various referendums, they give oxygen to the lies and myths cultivated by strong forces on the left in connection with this directive."
"There will, it is maintained, be no end to all the misery that will be suffered by European consumers and employees if the Services Directive goes through."
"Nonetheless, the Council and the Commission know that this directive, which has nothing to do with the new Constitution, is incredibly important for European growth, jobs and consumers."
"Naturally, no one wants the Services Directive to lead to social dumping but, instead of standing up for the directive, which they themselves have ordered, they help foment a host of false perceptions, the result being increasing distrust."
"How are people to believe in Europe when not even we who work with Europe every day dare to do so?"
"Mr President, the March summit was supposed to be about relaunching the Lisbon Agenda."
"Sadly, I regret that it may well go down in history as somewhat a fudged affair."
"An apparent assault on liberal economics by the French President and others was not an edifying sight."
"Being quoted calling the liberalisation of Europe’s economies the new communism of our age, if true, was somewhat extraordinary."
"Any attempt to undermine our services directive is sadly a clear sign that the anti-reform forces in Europe remain active."
"President Barroso said recently that some people think the European Commission is there to protect the old ‘15’ against the new ‘10’."
"It is not."
"He is absolutely right; the services directive is a fundamental building block of a successful, dynamic economy."
"Those who seek to undermine the progress of the internal market do no service to the millions of unemployed in their countries."
"On the contrary, as the new Member States have demonstrated so clearly, it is the liberalising economies that are the successful job-creating economies."
"The so-called European social model has assumed such significance among some nations that it seems almost impossible to undertake proper reform."
"I am afraid that this new model, whatever merits it may have had in former times, is now something of an Achilles heel to our economy."
"It has perpetuated high unemployment – 19 million at the last count; it fostered anti-enterprise cultures; and every day that we remain unreformed the competitiveness of China, the United States and India increases, to our disadvantage."
"As I have mentioned to Mr Barroso, I believe that he is very sincere in his drive to get the required reforms, but he has been badly let down by others; by heads of government, including our British Prime Minister, whose short-termism has made it much more difficult for Mr Barroso to make progress."
"There are some good Council conclusions, such as on the Kyoto Protocol and sustainable development, but I am afraid that the heavy-handed tactics of some leaders, trying to put a brake on our economic reform and playing games with an increasingly discredited Stability and Growth Pact, serve as a timely reminder to us all that we could have our interests sacrificed to short-term political interests if we are not vigilant."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debates are often repetitive, and so I should like to start with a news item that I read yesterday which I found quite striking."
"A few days ago, in Huang-Kan-Tun in southern China, there was a popular uprising, which unfortunately also led to two deaths because of brutal repression by the police."
"It was an uprising by the whole population of that village against a recently established chemical plant, which in a short time had caused very severe air, water and soil pollution."
"What do I mean by this news item?"
"I mean that new environmental, ecological, health and social demands are now emerging in these new economic powers too, as a result of industrial growth."
"That clearly shows us our role in the future international division of labour: designing and selling technologies to enable those countries to grow without repeating our past mistakes, such as pollution and social oppression."
"In view of all that, I think the summit has had a positive outcome, because it has genuinely reinvigorated the Lisbon Strategy on the basis of the interdependence of the three pillars; it has revitalised the European Union’s global role as a leader in the field of sustainable development; and it has put forward a protocol for Kyoto 2 that is highly ambitious and important precisely in this context."
"What I think is good above all is the political reform of the management of the Lisbon Strategy according to the principle that everyone must play their own part to the full – the Member States, the Community, local communities, the European Union, and so on."
"Parliament too must play its own part, as has been clearly stated. We shall do so better, Mr President, if, as you hoped, the collaboration that has been occurring recently among the institutions on the task that concerns us – drawing up advanced legislation – continues."
"I think that one of the main areas where this challenge will lie will be the REACH directive."
"I am sure that the desired collaboration will take place in the coming months in order to achieve this result."
"As chairman of this Parliament’s delegation for relations with the People’s Republic of China, I should like to say something to the President of the Council about lifting the arms embargo."
"I note that, even though you know that this is opposed by a large majority in this House, the Council remains intent on pressing ahead with it."
"I even have sympathy for the Chinese when they question this as a political gesture and say that, in a strategic partnership such as ours, there is no room for embargos of this kind."
"If, however, we want to make a political gesture, we must ask for one in return, and this we are not yet getting."
"Far from it; the Anti-Separation Law, which was adopted in China last month, sends the wrong message."
"Later on this month, a delegation from the Chinese People’s Congress will be explaining to this House what, precisely, was the intention behind this, and I shall be listening to their explanation with a great deal of interest."
"I also think that we should ask for a gesture in connection with individual human rights, because there has been too little evidence of improvement in this respect in China recently."
"So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if the Council wants to make a political gesture, I urge you to demand gestures in return from the Chinese Government."
"I hope that the Council will be prepared to adopt this line, which enjoys the support of a large majority in this House."
"Mr President, the outcome of the Spring Summit suggests that the European Union has unfortunately taken a step backwards."
"It is becoming ever harder to attain legitimate economic objectives."
"The goalposts seem to be moving further away."
"Relaxation of the principles governing the Stability and Growth Pact is very worrying."
"Introducing something akin to manual control, and applying the Pact’s principles only to certain countries and not to others that infringe its principles as a matter of course, is a short-sighted approach."
"What kind of message does this send to those Member States that decided to undertake painful reforms in order to achieve financial discipline and meet the convergence criteria?"
"What kind of example is this setting the new Member States?"
"Regrettably, the Lisbon Strategy statements remain on paper."
"The Member States and the Union as a whole must transcend rhetoric and support those fine declarations with specific and consistent actions."
"It is impossible not to agree with the Presidency Conclusions, namely that completion of the single market as far as the free movement of services is concerned will support Community objectives regarding economic growth, employment and competitiveness. The services directive is one of the best parts of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Consistent action aimed at bringing about the single market is the best way of supporting the Lisbon Strategy."
"All these objectives will be attained faster and more effectively if the services directive currently under discussion is not diluted, weakened and postponed, departing from its original form."
"We must ensure free and unrestricted provision of services throughout the entire territory of the Union."
"As we work on this directive, we must make sure that it contains as much common sense and as few restrictions as possible."
"The Union needs powerful economic catalysts if it is to attain its economic objectives."
"One such catalyst was the accession of ten new Member States in the enlargement that took place last May."
"We are now called upon to go further."
"We must serve the interests of future generations, and not think only of contemporary political wheeling and dealing, elections and referendums."
"The citizens of the Member States expect us to do our duty."
"Fine words will not transform or magic away contemporary reality, characterised by the lack of a will to change, to open up markets and also by a weakening of macroeconomic discipline."
"We must find the courage to face up to the future."
"The advantage of speaking at the end of a debate is that it is possible to elaborate on a number of matters that have already been discussed, and I should like to do this by mentioning three misconceptions that have been dominating the debate."
"The first misconception concerns the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This was not just a matter of horse-trading among those Member States that struggled to meet the Pact’s standards; there was also discussion of economic policy and about what the Pact was meant to achieve in economic terms in the context of macro-economic policy."
"This may not have come across very well in the way the media covered it, but this was certainly something to which the Luxembourg Presidency gave its attention. I hope that the Commission, from this more macro-economic vantage point, will be able to use the Pact’s reform as an instrument for improved European macro-economic policy."
"A second point concerns the integrated treatment of the economic guidelines and the employment guidelines, as well as micro-economic policy as presented yesterday by the Commission."
"All this does of course, fit into the framework of the Lisbon strategy, and my group argues that we should streamline these processes and opt for an integrated approach."
"We should, however, make sure we do not create a kind of hierarchy of procedures, so that no one particular Council formation, Commissioner, specialist committee, or integrated structure in this House, predominates."
"We do not want a super-Commissioner, a super-Council or a specialist committee concerned with nothing else."
"A third point concerns the services directive."
"In this connection, I should like to stress once more that opposition to this is not about stopping the free movement of services and labour, but about the conditions under which such movement is supposed to take place."
"The Commission did not do its homework very well, and we must realise that the migration of labour is inextricably linked to the free movement of services and that, in this respect, much more should be done than has been done to date, quite apart from this services directive."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is done."
"We have had the summit, the Stability and Growth Pact was – as many are saying – reformed or – as others are saying – abolished, and an attack was launched on the services directive."
"Nothing more stands in the way of the prosperity and recovery of Europe."
"Now we shall manage it."
"That might be one message."
"I am grateful to you, Mr President of the Commission, for having said at the beginning of your speech that the discussion about the Stability Pact had been started because the consensus about compliance with the rules hitherto had broken down and there was therefore no choice but to do something new."
"Then the question arose as to how to go about it."
"In the meantime, there was talk of liars."
"I, in any event, do not feel uncomfortable dancing to the tune of the European Central Bank and the German Bundesbank when evaluating the Stability and Growth Pact."
"If you then also bear in mind that many states have threatened, in connection with further growth, to stop applying the law which applied hitherto, then I wonder if this is how things are going to be now."
"Will we, in future, be taking decisions of this sort in Europe?"
"On the Lisbon Strategy, I should like to say that I hope for a strong Commission."
"I am aware of the fact, Mr President of the Commission, that it is harder for you than it was for Jacques Delors to realise a vision, because Jacques Delors had different Heads of Government at his side."
"At that time, he had Mitterrand and Kohl, who actively supported European progress."
"It is important for the Commission to concentrate on what Europe can achieve and not to produce too much paper."
"For the Council, it is important that the Member States commit to what they themselves regularly agree on and do their homework, so that we too can attain the goal."
"On the services directive, I have just one thing to say: we shall probably vote on Romania and Bulgaria this afternoon."
"To those who are up in arms against this directive in the Council, I should just like to say that we have problems with respect to freedom of services with the 10 states, because it was not included in the accession treaties."
"We should not repeat the same mistake now and take it out on others; on the contrary, freedom of services should be corrected in the Bulgaria and Romania concept in accordance with the will of those who are for it."
"Otherwise, we shall face the same problem."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decisions made at the Spring Summit appear to be good, but we are aware that they will only be judged by events."
"There are some great opportunities and also some risks in what we decide."
"Overall, we are allocating new responsibilities to the political decision-making body, and we must try to make these responsibilities promote integration rather than dissociation."
"Transposed directives and national reform programmes must consist not just of generalities but of genuinely focused and measurable choices."
"The flexibility of the Pact must be increasingly transparent and managed exclusively for purposes of growth, according to sound common criteria."
"In this respect, a sensitive case involving Italy has started, and I want to say that we call on the government, the Commission, the Council and Eurostat for each of them to carry out their work wisely, transparently and fairly, because the people of Italy are entitled to clarity and truth in respect of their public accounts, that is to say their own future."
"With the decisions of the Spring Summit we shall no longer be in the situation we were in before: if we do not have more Europe, we shall have less."
"That is why it is so important to make decisions that can guarantee integration and hence the Commission’s role in the coordination of macroeconomic policies, the improvement of basic statistics, the involvement of national parliaments, the genuine integration of national and European planning instruments, the strength of the Union’s budget, investments in infrastructure and research, the European dimension, and so on. We shall have to work hard to achieve all that."
"For now, in any case, I offer my heartiest congratulations to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by simply saying bravo to Mr Juncker, the President-in-Office of the Council, to Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and his colleagues, without forgetting the Heads of State or Government."
"Thanks to you, I believe that this Council of 22 and 23 March has been decisive in terms of moving Europe forward. In terms of its content and its form, it has probably been one of the best Councils I have experienced."
"This Council has provided solutions to several issues which have been facing us for a long time."
"First of all, an intelligent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that in politics, including European politics, intelligence is required."
"Secondly, improvements and new orientations to ensure that the legislation under way is balanced. I am thinking of the directive on services, of REACH."
"Thirdly, the environment, at a time when Kyoto is being implemented."
"And finally our relations with China and European effort in the field of research."
"On this subject, I would like in particular to stress the historic decision taken on the launch of ITER."
"From this point of view, I hope that the European Union will not have to wait too long for the good will of Japan; that we negotiate with the Japanese, provided, Mr President, that the draft is launched on 14 July, because this is an essential issue, essential for Europe, for the future of energy and for young people, that is to say for those people who will be living here in 30 or 50 years’ time."
"This is why I fully support the joint resolution that expresses Parliament’s positive view of this extremely important and extremely positive Council."
"Mr President, the good news about the Spring Summit was that a decision was taken to draw up a long-term strategy to reduce greenhouse emissions."
"A decision was also taken to consider setting binding targets for the mid- and long-term."
"It is absolutely essential that steps should now be taken to make ambitious proposals for the time after 2012."
"Unfortunately, recent history has shown that it has been considerably easier for the European Union to draw up and agree ambitious targets than it has been to implement them."
"If we seek a new, successful start to the Lisbon Strategy, we should look for new leadership in the European Union in all areas of policy."
"We need to consider the interests of the Community, commit to the agreed decisions, and act in such a way that all the Member States derive added value from European cooperation."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you have both devoted the lion’s share of your speeches to the Lisbon process."
"The President of the Council did this in broad strokes and with the emphasis on balance and economic growth, which cannot be achieved without environmental and social responsibility."
"You illustrated this trinity, Mr President of the Council, by the integrated approach to which the Council conclusions also bear witness."
"I would also like to express my appreciation for the attention you gave to SMEs."
"I have never before seen Council conclusions in which the words SME, innovation and the environment featured so often."
"In the resolution on which this House will be voting today, we demand new dynamism in the Lisbon process, new dynamism with a ‘focused approach which shows new leadership’."
"Mr President of the Commission, I would now like to turn to you."
"This leadership and dynamism can be achieved only if you operate in tandem with the Member States, the regions and the social partners."
"In this morning’s speech, I did not get the feeling that this , as the President of the Council put it, is all that evident."
"I may be wrong, but I get the impression that an awful lot of paperwork is being inflicted on the Member States, and that less attention is being paid to the social policy agenda and that it is not being given teeth."
"I also have the feeling that this with Parliament leaves something to be desired as regards integrated employment policies, in which area I would like to see a certain degree of consultation in future."
"– Mr President, the Luxembourg Presidency is, I believe, a good presidency, which already counts among its achievements the creative compromise on the Stability Pact, which allows the Member States in the eurozone to move forward on the basis of the rules of financial prudence but with the necessary degree of flexibility."
"At the same time, the Luxembourg Presidency managed during the European Council in Brussels to make the Lisbon Strategy more specific, but it really is a pity that it was not possible to name at this point the Member States which are not managing to promote this strategy."
"Another major issue which we have before us within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy is the services directive, which I hope will be examined in a rational manner and, more importantly, will endeavour to clear up the misunderstandings, so that the fog on the horizon which is preventing us from seeing the substance of the issue will lift, as the impression is sometimes created that we are talking throughout the European Union about a different matter entirely."
"Finally, I would like to wish the Luxembourg Presidency success henceforth with a very major issue which we are dealing with, by which I mean the financial perspectives, especially the budget for the Union's regional policy, for its cohesion policies."
"This is a very major and difficult issue."
"I personally believe that we are all doomed to reach an agreement by June, because otherwise regional policy programmes will be the victims of any disagreement at European level."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the last European Council gave the European economy a new direction, that is, the direction of pragmatism, flexibility and encouragement of innovation."
"With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, I am delighted that realism and flexibility have taken over from dogma and blind respect for rules which were decided upon during a period of economic growth that was much more sustained than the one we are experiencing today."
"Rules are necessary, of course, since the stability of our common currency depends on them, but the reform of the pact is positive in that it reconciles the fundamental principle of respect for the rule of law and the minimum flexibility required for the management of the Member States’ public funds."
"I would like to thank President Barroso and President-in-Office Juncker for their clear-sightedness and their powers of persuasion on this thorny issue."
"This pragmatism has also been applied to the draft directive on the liberalisation of the European services market."
"By recognising that the current wording of the directive does not fully respond to the requirements and by calling for every possible effort to be made in order to make the internal market in services fully operational while preserving the European social model, the Council has not – as the media have too often said – pleased France."
"Rather, it has recognised that the country of origin principle raised clear problems in terms of the risks of social and fiscal dumping and has left it to the wisdom of the European Parliament to find an acceptable solution."
"That is the kind of attitude the citizens expect from Brussels."
"The future of our economy will be in jeopardy if we do not make an increased and huge effort in terms of investment in the field of education and training and in the field of research and development."
"We are way behind our American and Asian partners in these two areas."
"The 25 have confirmed their will to make the Union a more attractive area for investment and job creation, in order to promote knowledge and innovation and to sustain growth."
"These ambitious and necessary objectives will be achievable provided that our States provide the political will and the necessary funding."
"– Mr President, the Council's enlargement strategy is wide of the mark."
"There is discrimination against Croatia, a central European country which meets the criteria better than many a Member State."
"Romania, a manifestly European country, but one which fails to meet the criteria by a long chalk, is being rushed through, as it were."
"Ukraine, certainly a European country, but one which will not be ready to accede for decades and which we too shall not be ready to accept within the next few years, has been put off until heaven knows when; no specific strategy is being developed."
"Yet with a clearly non-European country such as Turkey, accession negotiations are to commence this year."
"I really must call on the Council to rethink this strategy thoroughly and to ensure first of all that the green light is given for accession negotiations with Croatia without delay – by 21 May at the latest – and that the working party generously set up as a result of your intervention, Mr President-in-Office, reaches a result without delay."
"Secondly, I should like to call on you to indeed allow Romania and Bulgaria to accede by the deadline set, but to give us the chance to wait until the autumn, until the corresponding progress reports are available."
"Thirdly, I should like to call on you, once Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia have joined, to grant the EU a long breathing space for the internal consolidation it so urgently needs."
"Furthermore, I should like to call on you to prevent accession negotiations with Turkey, which will overtax and overstretch the EU, from commencing in the autumn, and to develop a good neighbourhood strategy here and also to develop a concept for Ukraine."
"Otherwise, what came out of the Orange Revolution will also fail, and that would have serious repercussions for Europe."
"Mr President, at the end of this debate, which has largely been very disorganised, I would like to clarify certain points."
"I am pleased that, with regard to the decisions of the European Council on the Lisbon Strategy, there has been very little controversy."
"That seems to me entirely normal, coherent and logical, since and some people would do very well to read it the European Parliament's resolution that has been adopted on the Lisbon Strategy has been almost entirely reflected in the European Council's conclusions."
"The fact that certain elements are being criticised today would suggest that you are taking a highly self-critical approach."
"That is my observation!"
"Furthermore, I believe that it is essential that we at least give the European Council's decision on the Lisbon Strategy credit for having placed great responsibility on the shoulders of the Member States."
"We were in considerable agreement in January when we debated the issue, stating that it falls to the national governments to make a success of the Lisbon Strategy not just for each of their countries but for Europe as a whole."
"From now on, the national governments will have to consult their national parliaments on their national reform programmes, the Council will be answerable to the European Parliament, and the Commission will play the role it has always had, that is to say the role of facilitator and initiator, a role that consists of uniting all the Member States in a spirit conducive to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, which has been designed to ensure that, in the future, the European social model remains accessible to the greatest possible number of Europeans."
"I would note that, within certain groups that are rather more ecumenical than catholic, there are entirely divergent views on the essential elements of the form political action should take at European level."
"It is easier, Mr Radwan, to reach a compromise on the Stability and Growth Pact than to achieve coherence within the group to which you belong."
"I have witnessed this today and yesterday."
"On the Stability Pact, I should like to say that I am most surprised that all the interim stages of the reform of the Stability Pact have been accompanied by the same ferocious rhetoric and commentary on it."
"When a number of governments suggested that entire expenditure blocks should be written out of the Stability Pact, the criticism sounded exactly as it sounds now, now that it has not come to pass."
"Something must be wrong."
"The preventive part of the pact has been substantially strengthened."
"Why was this necessary?"
"It was necessary because this aspect was simply – and quite criminally – neglected by the old pact – with the gestation of which I had a great deal to do."
"A number of governments also failed in so-called good times to follow the right policy for reducing deficits and debt."
"That may of course take a turn for the better following a number of forthcoming elections, although I seriously doubt it."
"The corrective part of the pact has only undergone minor changes, compared with what the Treaty and the Stability Pact say on the matter."
"Of course, if you imagined that, for the purpose of the pact, 3.0% really meant 3.0%, that proceedings would be instituted against countries with a deficit of over 3.0% and that these countries would be subject to sanctions if they did not get below the 3.0% limit the following year, then the reform of the Stability Pact does not come up to expectations."
"That would have required considerable amendments to the Treaty and, as a result, we would no longer have been able to use the old Stability Pact as a guide in important areas."
"The Treaty does not say that any deficit over 3.0% is an excessive deficit."
"Anyone who says so is misinterpreting the Treaty."
"It simply does not say that in the Treaty and I cannot accept that we should act as if it did and that those who are again finding their way back to a correct interpretation of the Treaty are now being treated like stability sinners."
"How can one take it upon oneself to claim sole responsibility for interpreting the Treaty and the Stability Pact?"
"I read – and it even amuses me somewhat – that the Council, the 25 Ministers for Finance, the 25 Heads of State or Government, bowed down before Germany and France."
"This is completely ridiculous and, for the rest, offensive to the other twenty-three."
"The idea that it only needs a peremptory shout from Berlin or a clear signal from Paris to make the other twenty-three governments knuckle under is a totally un-European perception and contradicts the constantly recurrent need to achieve a viable working relationship in Europe and find compromise solutions."
"I do not want to have to ask myself how serious the criticism here in this House would have been, had we failed with Lisbon, had we failed to achieve the balances of which your House reminds us or had we failed totally with the reform of the Stability Pact."
"Some take the view that the old Stability Pact was so good that it did not need to be changed."
"However, this view is shared by not one government of the 25 Member States."
"The idea that the 25 Heads of State or Government and the 25 Ministers for Finance have put themselves on course for deficit and spiralling debt is a perfectly bizarre idea which I should like to vigorously contradict."
"Apart from that, Mr President, a lot has been said about the credibility of Europe."
"I believe that it is sometimes very much under threat and I have not entirely understood Mr Watson’s point. I was not sure whether he was addressing me or addressing a group of Member States."
"I hope you are not reproaching me for not having persuaded the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to take the same position on all the issues, because I do not represent the PPE-DE here."
"I represent the European Council."
"To those people who have drawn everybody’s attention to Europe’s lack of credibility, I will say this: I would like very warmly to thank the Members who have been attending this debate since 9 a.m. this morning."
"The visitors to the European Parliament today have been surprised not to see more people at a time when Europe is debating some essential issues."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"I hope – or should I say I expect – that the criticism has been taken on board."
"Mr President, I shall conclude very briefly."
"With regard to the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, we must genuinely acknowledge – if we want to have an honest debate – that the problems did not begin with this reform, but that they have existed for some considerable time."
"In November 2003, there was no longer any consensus on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"What we have just produced, what the Member States have just produced with the active support of the Presidency and the European Commission, is a credible reform of the Pact."
"I can offer you every guarantee – and I address this in particular to those people who have expressed concerns, which are legitimate concerns – that the Commission intends to apply these Stability and Growth Pact rules objectively and in a uniform manner amongst all the Member States."
"I can also assure you that the Commission’s role has not been diminished by this reform, quite the contrary."
"In fact, the range of situations in which the Commission will be required to give its opinion or to take the initiative on an action has been considerably extended."
"We therefore now have a pact that it will be possible to apply much more credibly than the one we had before this reform."
"Furthermore, with regard to Lisbon – and I have seen this during this morning’s discussion – there is clearly a very broad consensus on a system to enhance governance, in which there is a better distinction between the competences of the Union and the competences of the Member States."
"The Member States have accepted this enhanced governance and, once again, this also increases the credibility of our Lisbon objectives."
"I would like, however, to return to an important point from the conclusions of the European Council that I did not mention in my introduction to this debate: the development policy within the context of the Millennium Development Objectives."
"At its last meeting, the European Council asked the Commission to speed up its work on finalising the Union’s positions with a view to the important meetings within the United Nations next September."
"I am pleased to announce that yesterday, right here in Strasbourg, the Commission adopted an important package of proposals, which Commissioner Michel and myself also announced yesterday."
"It contains new mid-term objectives, more emphasis on the quality of aid and greater coherence amongst policies."
"In this ‘development’ package, particular emphasis is also placed on Sub-Saharan Africa."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission treats these proposals as a great priority."
"We are currently working actively with the Member States to make this meeting relating to the Millennium Objectives a success, and we are very much counting on your support."
"Another reason why I have given this example, Mr President, is to illustrate a point that I believe to be important. That is that we are truly working on operational decisions."
"Within the European Council, we have established the objectives and the new instruments for the renewed Lisbon Strategy and we have also just approved the integrated guidelines, encompassing macroeconomic policy, microeconomic policy and employment."
"We have just presented them here in the European Parliament."
"The European Council has drawn up a request relating to development, and we are presenting concrete proposals."
"I am well aware that, at the difficult times we are currently experiencing in Europe, our attention is often more focussed on controversial aspects, on the things on which there is no agreement from the Member States or unanimity amongst them."
"I would like to stress, however, that, despite these differences and despite, at times, our divergences, we are able to reach very significant consensus, as was the case at the Spring Council."
"I would therefore like to underline what the President-in-Office of the Council has just said."
"How would you react if we had not come here with results that, despite everything, reflect a consensus, and what message would we be sending to our public?"
"This is why, at this stage, while I share many of the worries and concerns expressed by some of you, the question is whether we should place the emphasis on aspects on which there is no complete consensus or whether, on the other hand, we should place the emphasis on the things we can do together."
"Because that is the culture of compromise we have in Europe, and I would like to place great emphasis on this point."
"We will not make any progress in a Europe of 25 if we do not explain to our citizens that, in Europe, no one can achieve 100% of what they want."
"No Member State can achieve 100% on all of its positions."
"Our Europe is becoming increasingly complex. So it is up to those of us who have a leading, and indeed political, role in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to explain to our fellow citizens that we have to make compromises, that Europe means compromise."
"Europe means working together towards objectives that are much more important than short-term issues or national sensitivities."
"That is what responsibility means, and responsibility is the most important thing if leadership is to be effective, and leadership is what Europe needs at this stage."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission."
"Six motions to wind up the debate have been received in accordance with Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
". – To its dismay, the European Council of 22 and 23 March was characterised by an issue that was not on its agenda but which was imposed upon it."
"Recent polls showing a possible victory for the ‘no’ vote in the referendum in France on 29 May on the so-called ‘European Constitution’ have set the alarm bells ringing."
"The Right and the Social Democrats have teamed up and have got down to work, encouraging almost open interference in the campaign taking place in France."
"Parliament is spending EUR 8 million on the ‘yes’ campaign, and this is unacceptable."
"Heads of State or Government, and anyone who feels they can have an influence on the outcome of the referendum, are queuing up to attempt to convince the French people of the ‘advantages’ – hypothetical and non-existent as they are – of the so-called ‘European Constitution’."
"The major employers and union leaders that are dominated by Social Democrats and the Right – spearheaded by the European Trade Union Confederation – are all pulling out the stops to endorse this project, which damages people’s sovereignty and encourages neoliberal capitalism and militarism."
"The Commission and Parliament are putting off taking decisions in a bid to avoid providing more and more valid arguments to vote ‘no’."
"Despite the contradictions, a ‘no’ vote in France will be the best answer."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, I would like to inform you, before the vote on the calendar for our 2006 part-sessions, that we have very great concerns about this draft calendar."
"According to this calendar, the distribution of committee meeting weeks and the number of working days for committees will, in 2006, be at the lowest level since 1994, which was a non-election year."
"Despite the increase in parliamentary work and the increase in the number of Members, the number of committees and the number of amendments, we all know that, since 1994, Parliament’s competences have increased in the field of codecision and that the order of the Strasbourg and Brussels part-sessions and constituency weeks will not allow the parliamentary committees to respect the time periods laid down in the code on multilingualism for the adoption and presentation of reports for part-sessions."
"A clear example: for the part-session of 11 and 12 October 2006, the reports will have to be adopted by the parliamentary committees in July at the latest."
"Do we want a Parliament that fulfils its legislative duties in a dynamic manner?"
"With this calendar, this would appear not to be the case."
"In terms of method, moreover, I would simply like to warn all the honourable Members that we are going to have enormous problems in 2006, because we have respected the dates of the European school holidays."
"Mr Daul, judging from the applause, I can see that many Members of Parliament share your concern."
"I would like to point out to you and to everybody that we are currently only voting on the calendar for part-sessions."
"The Conference of Presidents will then analyse the weeks corresponding to committees, groups, etc. I know that it is all pretty much predetermined but, in any event, today’s vote does not define periods for meetings of committees, but only of part-sessions."
"Mr President, I wanted to propose an oral amendment to Mr Alvaro’s amendment, namely to also add that we should no longer work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. That way, money could be sent to our homes."
"Mr Goebbels, the Presidency appreciates your ironic comments, but you have interrupted the voting procedure."
"Mr President, I had proposed an amendment on the calendar with sufficient signatures and sufficient time to reject the entire agenda and ask the Bureau to table a new proposal, because the committees can now no longer function, and so this House’s power is being eroded."
"I cannot find this in the list."
"You have presented an amendment rejecting the calendar in its entirety. There is no provision for doing this, however, and your amendment has not therefore been put to the vote."
"Only partial amendments to the calendar can be voted on."
"Mr President, I have a – positive – last-minute oral amendment to the report, which the Council supports."
"It states that we approve the declaration attached to the report as agreed in the last-minute trialogue held a few minutes ago with the Council."
"Now this paragraph of the Joint Declaration should replace the report as such."
"This is a message signifying agreement with the Council on the financial implications of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The substance is this: ‘we approve the Joint Declaration attached to the report, as agreed a few minutes ago with the Council’."
"Can the Council confirm the modification resulting from the amendment announced by Mr Lewandowski?"
". Mr President, following a number of contacts that we have been able to establish, it has been possible, in collaboration with the Members of Parliament who have taken part in this exercise, to agree on the financial and budgetary terms of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"We have recently concluded a trialogue, and I have had the pleasure of announcing that an integral agreement exists on this matter."
"I should like to warmly congratulate all those who have contributed to it."
"I would like to make it clear that, if my interpretation is correct, that means that paragraph 1 of the motion for a resolution, rather than saying ‘Regrets that the Council has not agreed’ should say ‘Is pleased that the Council has agreed to adopt the joint declaration’."
"– Mr President, we have heard a truly very important statement by the President of the European Council and I should like to thank the Luxembourg President-in-Office, Jean-Claude Juncker, and also Mr Schmit, for withdrawing the Council's previous reservations and for safeguarding the financial and other rights of the European Parliament."
"That is a major success."
"For those who do not know what has happened over the last few hours, we as a group decided yesterday evening that we would request that our assent to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania be postponed on the grounds that Parliament's rights, in other words our financial rights, had not been safeguarded."
"As we now see that the Presidency has managed to remove this reservation, our Group will not request that the decision be postponed; on the contrary, everyone will vote according to their conscience."
"I thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for the efforts that you have made in the last few hours."
"Mr President, a very simple procedural motion."
"Do we have a right to know what decision has been made?"
"It should be told to everybody, because we were not there."
"It would indeed be helpful to learn what has been decided."
"No decision has been taken for the moment because Parliament has not yet voted."
"There is a proposed amendment, which is ratified by the Council, and which I presented earlier."
"– Mr President, I think what Mr Poettering just said is most helpful."
"We can indeed, as a result of the very tense and obviously very lively discussions that have taken place, especially yesterday evening in the PPE-DE Group, agree on how to proceed."
"The President-in-Office has announced that the Council now accepts the draft."
"For Mr Cohn-Bendit's benefit: the first point of the draft due to be voted on, as it now stands, says that the European Parliament regrets the fact that the Joint Declaration contained in the annex to this draft report, according to which the three institutions must reach agreement on the financial repercussions of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, has not materialised."
"That has now been replaced – and I would also propose this as an oral amendment – by our welcoming the fact, as the President-in-Office said, that agreement has been reached, because this means that all Parliament's prerogatives vis-à-vis the Council have been respected and we can therefore vote in favour."
"I would like to make it absolutely clear that the joint statement by the Presidency and the Council, which until now had not been accepted and which is now being accepted, is included in the annex to the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the intention of our oral amendment is to replace the resolution as a whole by the declaration of the European Parliament that states that the European Parliament approves the Joint Declaration attached to the report as agreed in the trialogue of 13 April 2005."
"With your permission, I shall read the Joint Declaration agreed between the Council presidency and Parliament’s negotiating delegation, which is very short:"
"‘1."
"Without prejudice of the draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe"
"a. The representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting with the Council declare that the amounts in Title III ‘Financial Provisions’ of the Act of Accession, annexed to the draft Accession Treaty submitted under the assent procedure of the European Parliament, are mentioned without prejudice to the European Parliament’s rights and the powers and prerogatives of the budgetary authority conferred by Article 272 of the EC Treaty and the relevant provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999."
"b. The Council, the Commission and the European Parliament confirm that the classification of the expenditure in Articles 30-34, Title III ‘Financial Provisions’ of the Act of Accession, annexed to the draft Accession Treaty will constitute non-compulsory expenditure after 2009.’"
"The second paragraph has caused the most controversy and reads:"
"‘2."
"The Commission confirms that its proposal for a financial framework (2007-2013) is based on the assumption that Bulgaria and Romania will be Member States on 1 January 2007."
"The European Parliament and the Council take note of the indicative amounts, for Bulgaria and Romania, provided by the Commission in March 2004 and considered by the Council in its conclusions of 22 March 2004 on ‘the financial package for the accession negotiations for Bulgaria and Romania’."
"The financing of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will be ensured without jeopardising the commitments for existing multiannual programmes and the decisions on the next financial perspectives."
"3."
"The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission recall the importance of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 in the functioning of budgetary procedures and that this can only function if all the institutions comply fully.’"
"This is the Joint Declaration attached to the amended paragraph."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we could have had all this earlier on."
"In these negotiations, Parliament’s delegation went to the pain threshold."
"I am delighted that the Council has now been able, at the last minute, to agree to this Joint Declaration, which is meant to be a declaration by the Council and Parliament."
"As far as the procedure itself is concerned, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and I agreed the following right at the end of the trilogue: the proposed oral amendment by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets – as you have just heard – is to replace our entire report."
"This is the only plausible way forward."
"We would ask you to vote on the oral amendment proposed by Mr Lewandowski instead of our report."
"This will guarantee that Parliament, that plenary today also accepts the Joint Declaration by the Council and Parliament guaranteeing budgetary rights."
". Mr President, Mr Böge rightly pointed out that it would have been better, more reasonable, more intelligent and wiser, if we could have passed in good time the resolution which has just been adopted."
"I would like to point out that the failure of this to happen was not attributable to a lack of good will on the part of the Presidency."
"I shall pass on our common regret, the regret of the House and of the Presidency, to the three capitals with which we had to negotiate up to five minutes ago."
"– Mr President, on Rule 5 (3) of the Rules of Procedure in connection with the Van Orden report, I welcome the fact that the trilogue was successful and that Bulgaria and Romania did not become hostage to a tug of war between the Council and Parliament."
"As regards Amendment 5, I find it outrageous that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is turning individual support from individual members of our group for this Amendment 5 to the Van Orden report into a proposal tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I see a certain political manipulation in this and would like to expressly emphasise that this proposal has been individually supported by my national delegation."
"I thank our group and our chairman for respecting and admitting the different stances with respect to the Kozloduj nuclear power station."
"The Presidency does not understand what your point of order consists of."
"– The intervention on a point of order was made because an amendment to the Van Orden report on Bulgaria – on which we are about to vote – has been moved in the name of the PPE-DE Group, whereas this amendment was supported only by individual members of our group, including my delegation."
"I wanted to point that out before the report was put to the vote."
"Mr Salafranca, I hope that your point of order is more intelligible."
"I hope so too, Mr President, and I believe that when I explain it, it will be easy to understand, particularly for somebody as intelligent as yourself."
"Mr President, I simply wished to say that, in view of the oral amendment we have just voted for on the Böge/Dührkop report, Amendments 2 relating to the favourable opinion by Mr Van Orden and the one by Mr Moscovici, presented by our political group, no longer make any sense, and I wished to say before the vote that we are going to withdraw them because they are not compatible with what we have just voted for."
"– Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, I wish to raise another point of order, for the sake of clarification."
"The proposal on the date for shutting down the Kozloduj nuclear power station was not submitted by us in error."
"I am perfectly aware that not everyone in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the same view as certain of that group’s Austrian members, as far as fulfilling the protocol on Kozloduj is concerned."
"I am not that naive."
"However, I do not want a procedural error – one that was obviously made in the secretariat – to compromise this important position."
"I again expressly thank individual members for their initiative in supporting this proposal concerning the timely shutdown of Kozloduj."
"I would like to make it clear that the amendment in question exists and is presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and other Members."
"Mr President, at the request of the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, we would like to add the word ‘illegal’ before the word ‘logging’ in the last line of this amendment."
"Mr President, I have an oral amendment that applies to four amendments."
"In Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden’s reports, and also in the recommendations, we want to have a reference to the exchange of letters between you and the President of the Commission on the full association of the European Parliament in the forthcoming process over the next 20 months concerning safeguard clauses."
"The original amendment is not precise enough with regard to the eventual postponement."
"Therefore, in those four places I propose to replace the amendment with a new text, which I will read only once, but which can be referred to in the other three instances."
"The new text will read: ‘... having regard to the exchange of letters between the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission on the full association of the European Parliament with any consideration of activation of one of the safeguard clauses on the Treaty of Accession’."
"That will apply to all four texts."
"Mr President, in accordance with Article 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls for a postponement of the vote on assentfor Bulgaria."
"I shall explain it very simply."
"We have two different situations: Bulgaria and Romania."
"With regard to Bulgaria, we believe that there are still issues to resolve and that, since we are talking about a 2007 accession, we do not think it useful to vote today."
"The Verts/ALE Group in the European Parliament solemnly declares that it is in favour of accession, that it does not wish to vote against, but that, as regards assent, it can only say yes or no or not take part in the vote."
"As we do not wish to vote no, however, and as we state that, given the nuclear energy situation in Bulgaria, for instance, we cannot vote yes today, we simply ask for the vote on assent to be postponed. We also ask that firstly, according to the clauses of the agreement with the Commission, a progress report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs be drafted to allow a vote on assent to take place at the beginning of 2006, one year prior to accession."
"According to our Rules of Procedure, having heard the arguments of the proposer, one Member can speak in favour and another against."
"Mr President, I should like to request that, if the Verts/ALE Group makes a similar request on Romania, the vote as to whether we delay be taken by roll call."
"We must apply the Rules of Procedure."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance knows what it must do."
"They are grown-ups."
"Mr Swoboda has the floor to speak in favour."
"– Mr President, I should like to speak out against this proposal on behalf of my group."
"It must have escaped Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is this very debate that we have had – and in very great depth –with the Council and the Commission over recent weeks."
"What we have achieved, as Mr Wiersma's proposal shows and with the assent of this Parliament, is this: according to the assurances of the Commission and the Council – I should like to mention both and also to thank Commission Rehn, we shall be fully involved in further consultations and in the possible application of the clause which should allow this accession to be postponed."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Lagendijk."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, if you had spoken with him more closely, you would have realised how much hard work we, and Mr Brok, have put into this, thereby reaching a positive result."
"That is why I wish to vote against this motion."
"Mr Nassauer will take the floor to speak against."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know of nobody of any standing in this House who would not be in favour of us welcoming Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union."
"I do, however, know of a great many Members who – for the reasons Mr Cohn-Bendit has spelled out – are loath to take a decision on this matter today."
"Delaying today’s decision would therefore be an eminently sensible move, as it would allow us to indicate that although we are still very much in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU, we wish to wait for the Commission’s next progress report before we actually take a final decision on the matter."
"This would be one way of addressing many of the concerns that have been voiced, without giving rise to doubts about our basic willingness and determination to welcome these countries into the EU."
"I therefore have every sympathy with Mr Cohn-Bendit’s views."
". Mr President, as the rapporteur on Bulgaria, I would be very much against any delay in the assent procedure."
"We have overcome the interinstitutional problem concerning the budget."
"Safeguard clauses have been built into the Accession Treaty."
"There is no good reason to delay giving our assent."
"I believe that it would be irresponsible on the part of this House to have any delay today."
"I call upon the House to vote in favour of assent."
"Mr President, I move the same revised amendment as I proposed earlier on Mr Van Orden’s report."
"This is the same text that I want to put into the recommendation."
"– Mr President, I thought that you had understood the point of order I presented previously to call for the withdrawal of Amendments 2 to this favourable opinion and to the favourable opinion by Mr Moscovici."
"Alright, Mr Salafranca, it has been withdrawn and there is no need to vote on it."
"Mr President, this is the same text that we adopted in the Van Orden recommendation and report."
"We will be repeating the same text in the two votes on the Moscovici report and recommendation."
"– Mr President, I would call for the vote on the accession of Romania to be adjourned in accordance with Rule 170(4)."
"The House has just voted in favour of the resolution by an overwhelming majority, yet if Members actually read this resolution, they will discover that, although the progress made by Romania on economic matters has been admirable, progress on political issues, such as freedom of the press and corruption, has been such that no one can claim that Romania could join the EU in its present state, at least not if we are to believe everything we have written in our own report."
"It has frequently been said before – and we repeat it now – that we are in favour of accession and that we have faith in the new government."
"The question we must ask, however, is why we should give the benefit of the doubt to a country experiencing such fundamental problems with democracy as corruption and a failure to protect the freedom of the press."
"No country can overcome problems of this kind in a hurry."
"We are therefore proposing that ..."
"It was suggested during our group meeting that Members will be required to vote either in favour or against during the vote, with abstentions not being allowed, as is the case in an assent procedure."
"I would ask the President whether it is possible to abstain from voting in an assent procedure, as previously Parliament’s Rules of Procedure only allowed Members to vote in favour or against in such instances."
"We would also like the Bureau to explain the electoral legislation to us."
"This voting procedure provides for the possibility of voting in favour, voting against, abstaining or not participating in the vote."
"Mr Wurtz has the floor to speak against the proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are some genuine shortcomings in Romania with regard to human rights and the fight against corruption."
"The authorities have undertaken commitments in this area and it is obviously necessary, in my view, to impose strict controls over their implementation."
"I believe, however, that the justifications given for such a postponement in voting do not rest on that point, since exactly the same request was heard with regard to Bulgaria, which is in a different situation."
"That is the reason why my group wishes to focus attention on one of the consequences of a possible delay."
"It would lead, against our will, to the cancellation of the signature of the Accession Treaty, which is scheduled for 25 April."
"We would therefore send, against our will, a message to Romania’s people, the consequences of which would be extremely dangerous."
"That is why my group, by a very large majority, does not support the call for a postponement, and will vote in favour of assent."
"Mr Voggenhuber will take the floor to speak in favour of the proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us, for the first time in the EU’s history, voting on whether to welcome a country into the EU 20 months before the planned accession date – a country, moreover, in which serious violations of human rights and democratic standards are committed, as became apparent from yesterday’s debate."
"There can be no question that proceedings would be initiated under Article 7 against any EU Member State that violated democratic standards and human rights to such an extent, and this should be obvious to everyone today."
"The vast majority of Members of this House, myself included, will be glad to see Bulgaria and Romania join the EU, and eagerly await the day when they will be able to do so."
"There is, however, no good reason why Romania should be given 20 months before the date of its accession, especially since this would be the first time such a thing has happened in the EU’s history, and would have the effect of removing the pressure that negotiations bring to bear on the country."
"We should take steps to prevent such serious violations of democracy and human rights."
"France is in the process of taking a decision on the Constitution."
"We must not send out a message that ..."
"Mr President, would it be possible for the secretariat to remind Mr Cohn-Bendit that it was the European Parliament that recommended 2007 as the entry date for Romania, and therefore now is the time to activate that recommendation?"
". Mr President, I indeed believe that at a time when the people of France are debating the Constitutional Treaty, the signal to send out is not one of scepticism with regard to enlargement."
"Enlargement of the European Union is not a constraint. It is a project."
"It is a common desire."
"And it is for that reason in particular that, today, we must vote."
"I believe that that does not justify a postponement."
"Let everyone reach a decision in line with his or her beliefs, for or against, but surely not in favour of a postponement."
"There is, however, another argument, which is very powerful."
"I have heard many Members say during the debates that they fear that our Parliament will be signing a blank cheque today or giving its last word on the matter."
"As a matter of fact, we have had, through an exchange of letters between yourself, Mr President, the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission, every guarantee that our Parliament will be fully involved in all of the future decisions to be taken, and we know that there is the possibility of invoking the safeguard clause."
"I therefore believe that all Members can vote today both with knowledge of the facts and with full peace of mind, because this Parliament will play its full role in the procedure that will follow between now and 1 January 2007."
"I therefore call, in turn, for the rejection of this postponement."
"Mr President, I should merely like to point out that it is customary for voting time to end at 1.30 p.m., as we all, of course, have guests and must attend to the public’s needs."
"My apologies, Mr President. I have risen to speak on the basis of Rule 160, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the vote on a number of amendments be taken by roll call."
"We had, however, agreed that we would go along with the compromise reached with the other groups."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will therefore vote against these amendments, even though we do agree on certain points of substance."
". 'The ALDE group tabled an amendment to the 2006 calendar which would have ended all plenary sessions at lunchtime on Thursdays and started the Brussels sessions at 10.30 on the Wednesday."
"The purpose of this was to ease Members' travel from Strasbourg and to suppress the fag-end Thursday afternoon sessions."
"Unfortunately, this amendment was deemed inadmissible by the authorities.'"
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have long supported attempts to ensure that the European Parliament has only one official seat, and that it should be in Brussels."
"The costs to the taxpayer of the Strasbourg seat is estimated at around £150 million per annum."
"This is a gross waste of public funds."
"British taxpayers deserve to have value for money."
"Our proposal to delete Strasbourg days does not imply that we wish to reduce our hours of work but to carry out our work where it is most effective and cost efficient, namely in Brussels."
"The costs of having to support parliamentary operations in both Strasbourg and Brussels have now become indefensible, and we will continue to campaign to have Parliament sit only in Brussels in future."
". My vote in favour of the proposed calendar, which keeps the periods of plenary sessions in line with the demands of high-quality parliamentary work expected of an institution such as the European Parliament, does not alter my view that parliamentary work, and the costs associated with it, must be streamlined, not least by adopting Brussels as the sole, permanent seat."
"The process of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania must be accompanied by a realistic evaluation of the financial implications, as in previous rounds of enlargement. Otherwise, enlargement will become an exercise in reducing the levels of prosperity and development enjoyed by the Union’s Member States."
"Accurate evaluation is not a selfish gesture on the part of those already in the Union, but an example of an institution behaving responsibly."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I offer a welcome to the citizens of Bulgaria, who with this vote see the culmination of their desire to join the European Union."
"In addition to congratulating the citizens and their current government, which has achieved this result, I should like to recall the major commitment made by previous administrations, particularly the government of Ivan Kostov, which started negotiations with the European Union in the early, most difficult days."
"Lastly, I hope that the pensioners of Bulgaria, together with the younger generation, can build a better world together with all of us in the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, along with my fellow Members, I have voted against the reports on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, but for clarity’s sake, I should like to say that we very much consider Bulgaria and Romania to be European countries that have their rightful place in our European cultural community and, moreover, that we feel something of a debt of honour towards them for their decades of suffering under Communist dictatorship."
"We are therefore convinced that – unlike Turkey, for example – both Bulgaria and Romania will be welcome in our political community before long."
"Our friendship with Romania and our sympathy for Romania and Bulgaria should not prompt us to sign a blank cheque."
"We have to have the courage to say – and that explains why we voted this way – that unfortunately, in very many areas, including political and economic areas, Romania and Bulgaria are not yet ready for full membership."
". I welcome the European Parliament Vote to give assent to Bulgarian membership of the EU, but insist that the Bulgarian authorities must continue down the path of judicial reform, as any weakening will result in a reconsideration of the European Parliament position."
"The process of Bulgaria’s accession, which is subject to an individual assessment, is moving ahead at the expected rate. The country does not yet meet the criteria to begin the application process."
"Not surprisingly, we are still a long way off being able to say that Bulgaria fulfils the necessary conditions for EU membership."
"There are reforms to be carried out, there are habits that take time to acquire and there is an adaptation process which is legislative and which must be completed in such a way that the Union will not lose its character and that Bulgaria will not become incapable of honouring its new obligations in the future."
"That said, as things stand, everything points to the conditions being fulfilled within the timeframe laid down. We must therefore welcome the fact that this further step on the road to enlargement has been taken."
". Given the fact that insufficient progress was made in comparison with the progress made by the 15 enlargement States on 1 May 2004, Bulgaria’s plan to join the EU on that date was postponed."
"It is now clear, however, that Bulgaria has made significant efforts to fulfil Community criteria and to move closer to the Union in political, economic and social terms."
"I should like to highlight the progress that has been made on a political and budgetary level, which will provide stability for the remainder of Bulgaria’s path to European standards – a journey that will neither be short nor easy."
"Against this backdrop, the European Council of 17 December 2004 decided in favour of Bulgaria’s accession on 1 January 2007."
"The Commission took a similar decision on 22 February 2005, having issued regular reports on how the process was progressing."
"Parliament should follow suit."
"Of course, the accession to the Union of a country such as Bulgaria will inevitably entail costs, which will hopefully be backed up by increasingly effective commitment to internal cohesion, and, most importantly, by Bulgaria enhancing its own ability to interact with and relate to the world – in other words, greater diversity."
"I voted in favour."
". I voted in favour of Amendment 5 on the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant on behalf of the delegation from the Austrian People’s Party, and not on behalf of the European People’s Party."
".– The Communist Party of Greece is against the EU because it is a union of capitalist states which safeguards the interests of big business and better conditions for it to compete with the other imperialist centres."
"From this point of view, it is also against the accession of Bulgaria, the objective of which is to annex it, plunder its wealth and its economy, exploit the workers and turn it into a NATO satellite, in order to serve its aggressive policy."
"We note the particularly onerous terms laid down for the accession of Bulgaria to the ΕU."
"Already the pre-accession procedure and the process of restoring capitalism have resulted in worsening unemployment, starvation wages of EUR 61 a month, inflation, poverty and drastic cuts in social services, with painful consequences for the working and grass-roots classes in the country and, on the other hand, increased profits for Euro-unifying big business."
"The Communist Party of Greece expresses its solidarity with the working class and the people of Bulgaria in their fight against the anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU and the political agents of big business."
". The Right and the Social Democrats in Parliament and beyond continue to seek to impose neoliberal capitalism on countries applying to join the European Union."
"The example of Bulgaria speaks for itself."
"Parliament ‘praises’ the so-called ‘structural reforms’ within the framework of the ‘market’ and capitalist ‘competition’, which are deemed to have taken place in Bulgaria."
"It expresses its ‘satisfaction’ with the ‘enlargement of the private sector’ and the ‘progress made in liberalising vital industries’."
"What is more, it ‘calls’ for the introduction of ‘greater flexibility in the labour market’ and for the pace of privatisation to be kept up."
"Why all of these words?"
"The entire accession process has been characterised by other requirements that we feel are unacceptable, such as discrimination as regards the movement of workers and equal access to Community funding, and the existence of unilateral safeguard clauses that can be activated against the interests of these countries, and only these countries."
"The enlargement is moving ahead within a political and financial framework that does not take account of Portugal’s interests, nor the needs of those countries applying to join."
"Whilst we are fiercely opposed to the manner in which the enlargement is taking place, we have no objection to the accession of new Member States, provided that this is indeed the will of the people and that Portuguese interests are safeguarded."
". It seems clear that Bulgaria will be in a position to join the EU on 1 January 2007, in line with the decisions taken by the other European institutions."
"I therefore feel that Parliament should add its opinion to those already delivered and publicly declare itself in favour of that country’s accession."
"Aside from this point of principle, it is clear that there are some gaps that must be securely plugged, particularly as regards the legal and policing systems, in order to improve efficiency in fighting crime and to provide for the increased transparency and procedural safeguards that are essential under the rule of law."
"At this preparatory stage, it is also important to attach special importance to the rights of ethnic minorities and the need to guarantee their identity, and to protect the most fragile and most vulnerable sections in society, such as children and the elderly, especially in a changing society."
"I voted in favour, in the expectation that Bulgaria can soon join the 25 in an ever bigger and ever more plural Europe."
". The CSU Members of the European Parliament are of the firm belief that Romania should become a member of the EU."
"At the same time, however, the CSU has always maintained that countries must meet certain criteria before they join the EU."
"We are opposed to these criteria being watered down in any way, and we do not believe it is currently possible to carry out a final assessment of whether they have been met."
"The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that Romania has a great deal of ground to cover before it meets the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"Another matter of some concern to the CSU is the safeguarding of Parliament’s rights, which are enshrined in the Treaties."
"This applies in particular to its budgetary rights, which we have now learnt will be respected."
"In our opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report."
"The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"For all the above reasons, the CSU Members cannot at this time vote in favour of Romania joining the European Union."
". We continue to abstain, just as we did on the occasion of the last EU enlargement, with the exception of Cyprus, on whose accession we voted in favour, by way of a protest against Turkey’s unacceptable occupation of the north of the island."
"We are not in principle opposed to the accession of new Member States, provided that this is the will of the people and that it does not undermine Portuguese interests."
"The fact is that, although we do not know the feelings of the Romanian people, accession gives rise to expectations, following enormous demands and impositions that we feel are unacceptable, not least structural reforms leading to privatisations, which have had a negative impact on people’s lives."
"The new demands that various Members of this House have attempted to introduce strike us as excessive and unacceptable."
"The truth, however, is that demands are already in place, such as derogations with regard to freedom of movement of workers. Furthermore, we also disagree with the scant financial resources made available, especially for farming."
"Lastly, we also disagree with the proposals, currently under negotiation, on the new financial perspectives, which do not take account of countries in difficulty, such as Portugal, nor the needs of the countries seeking to join the EU."
". Assessing whether a country has fulfilled the criteria for EU accession must be done on a case-by-case basis, even if one country happens to join at the same time as another."
"This must not, however, disguise the most important factor on the road to accession, namely that the criteria to be met must be realistic."
"This is the only way in which we can ensure that the EU – including all of its Member States – and the applicant country derive all of the potential benefits of accession."
"For this to happen – and I must stress this point – the assessment must take place at the right time, using objective and realistic criteria."
"As such, I welcome the fact that accession can be postponed, should it prove necessary, not that I wish that to happen."
"For reasons of internal politics, Romania has begun its reform process later than would have been in its interests."
"The impetus with which the reforms are now being carried out gives us the hope and the belief that the adaptation can take place within the timeframe set by both parties."
". Romania’s accession to the EU has been in the pipeline since 1995."
"The negotiations that have taken place and the efforts made by the Romanian authorities have led to significant changes in the country in recent years."
"Accordingly, the Council decided in December 2004 to conclude negotiations, with a view to accession in 2007."
"Nevertheless, I wish to point out the concerns raised at the time of the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne (A5-0103/2004), around one year ago."
"I highlighted serious problems, not least the absence of the rule of law, high levels of corruption, no press freedom and the lack of an independent judiciary. These factors meant that Romania could not join the EU along with the other new Eastern European Member States in 2004."
"I support this motion for a resolution because, among the concerns that it raises about this country are concerns that I share."
"The EU’s doors are open to Romania, but the country must realise that there is an urgent need to find workable solutions to the most serious problems."
"I voted in favour."
". Today, I voted against Romania’s request to join the EU, and I have to say that I did so with great regret."
"After all, the new government is displaying enormous political commitment and has made clear in a very short space of time what it stands for."
"That is good news."
"All that remains to be done is to convert this commitment into concrete actions whose effects can be measured, because it is the results that matter."
"Everything seems to suggest that Romania has a great deal left to do in the areas of corruption, protection of minorities, competition, state support and the environment, and yet this House has been asked to deliver its verdict no fewer than 20 months ahead of accession."
"This is unheard of, and the logic of it escapes me completely."
"At a time when the EU enjoys little support and its legitimacy is fragile, it is important that the European institutions should keep to the agreements they have made."
"I am not opposed to Romania’s accession."
"Romania Europe and will become a member of the European Union."
"What I do want though, is for accession to take place on the basis of what we have agreed on in the past."
". Owing to the lack of progress under its previous socialist Government, Romania is still finding it very difficult to be ready in time for EU accession in 2007."
"The situation in the areas of corruption and administrative and legal stability in particular is a cause of major concern."
"It seems entirely possible to me that in due course there will have to be a year’s delay."
"The European Parliament has been placed in the impossible position of pronouncing judgment 20 months before accession."
"At the moment however we can see that the new government is putting the required reforms into practice on schedule and also that the European Commission, as recently in the case of Croatia, takes a strict line in its assessment of candidate members."
"I am therefore prepared to give both the Romanian Government and the European Commission the benefit of the doubt."
"I hope that progress continues as at present, because only in that case will I be able to continue giving my support to the accession of Romania in 2007."
"Parliament always monitors the situation in countries that formally declare an interest in becoming an EU Member State, and it has naturally done this in the case of Romania."
"It should be stressed that Romania has been monitored especially closely in light of the delicate situation in the country and the consequent slow progress of accession negotiations."
"Romania has in recent years worked hard and has adopted important measures. Hopefully, further solutions can be implemented in the pursuit of Romania’s objective to become a member of the EU."
"To this end, a number of reports have been drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, including that of Mr Moscovici (A6-0077/2005)."
"The newly-elected Romanian Government also deserves clear words and signs of encouragement."
"After a number of postponements and Romania’s failure to be one of the ten countries that joined last year, I have no doubt that, if it meets the remaining criteria, Romania will, along with Bulgaria, be one of the next countries to join the EU."
"I voted in favour."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, also with regard to the vote in favour of Romania’s entry into the European Union, I offer the Romanian citizens and their government my compliments and congratulations and say how pleased I am at this important step towards a better future."
"In particular, I must emphasise how important it is that all the citizens in Romania, elderly pensioners as well as the young, should strive alongside the governments to make tangible progress for the sake of their collective well-being, instead of confining themselves to making plenty of promises that are followed by few tangible results, as many governments in Europe and throughout the world do."
"Mr President, I voted today against the recommendation for Romanian membership, for the following reasons."
"It is plainly obvious from all the reports that Romania still essentially fails to meet the conditions of membership."
"It is unfortunate that we have not decided to postpone making the decision."
"Given the situation, I have no other choice but to vote against, although in principle I warmly support Romanian membership."
"I vehemently object, however, to the clearance sale of membership conditions that Parliament has agreed to today through its recommendation."
"Adherence to the criteria that have been jointly agreed and once again put to the citizens of Europe in talks on enlargement should be a normal gesture, not anything exceptional or remarkable."
"Unless we keep to our agreed principles, we will drift into a situation in which we betray the tenets of representational democracy and drastically reduce our chances of keeping to agreements in the future."
"Mr President, I should like to explain my positive vote on Romania."
"I have the impression that certain people have taken a whole nation hostage, because they have been more respectful of their own domestic political situation, indeed of the respective institutional issues that we were experiencing, whilst what we should be doing is supporting Romania’s efforts towards achieving democracy."
"These efforts will be made easier with Europe, which must play a very great role."
"I should next like to say to the Romanian people that, within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a large number of Members take their side and support the efforts to establish a genuine Christian Democracy in Romania."
"I should like to pay tribute to the instigator of Christian Democracy in Romania, Cornelia Coposu, who, after the revolution, founded this party."
"I should like to say that the accession of Romania will be a remarkable cultural enrichment for Europe."
"."
"It is my firm belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."
"Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply."
"The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires this to be done in the event of enlargement."
"I regard this as an unacceptable encroachment upon Parliament’s budgetary rights."
"The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, as well as of the collapse of the trilogue on adjustments to the Financial Perspective."
"It would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report. The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"I regret that I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time."
". I reaffirm my belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."
"Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply."
"The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires this to be done in the event of enlargement."

"The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"It is for this reason that I particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor."
"It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, as well as of the collapse of the trilogue on adjustments to the Financial Perspective."

"The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"I regret that I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time."
". I do not believe that the purpose of the European Union has ever been to remain an exclusive club of the rich."
"I am in favour of future enlargements."
"The evidence points to Bulgaria and Romania having their place in the Union."
"I deplore, however, the way in which governments, particularly those of Chirac, Blair, Schroeder and the like, deal with these issues."
"Grandiose speeches and closed wallets seem to be the motto."
"We have just experienced an enlargement without prior deepening."
"Now, certain Member States want to impose new enlargements on us with less money for the European budget."
"I have nevertheless voted yes, so as not to mix up my protests with those of the opponents of enlargement."
"We support Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to the EU in principle."
"It is a natural consequence of the enlargement by 10 Member States that occurred in May 2004."
"Extended cooperation – properly implemented – can favour economic development, democracy and human rights in Europe."
"At the same time, we must not close our eyes to the major problems that enlargement may entail if the candidate countries are not well prepared."
"Mr Moscovici’s and Mr Van Orden’s reports confirm how great the problems are."
"According to the Commission’s and the European Parliament’s benevolent assessments, only the political criterion is being fulfilled."
"The economic or administrative criterion has not been fully complied with, but is expected to be so by 1 January 2007."
"An important objection to the resolutions comes from the Committee on Agriculture, which points out that the costs of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s EU membership have not been taken into account in the EU’s long-term budget for 2007-2013."
"This needs to be remedied."
"The process of negotiation and of adjustment to the EU has been going on for approximately eight years, which means that Bulgaria’s and Romania’s membership is more or less a ."
"At the same time, it is important that the process of adjustment be allowed to continue."
"If, however, these countries are not seen to fulfil the requirements, the Council must not hesitate to use the protection clause to postpone EU entry by a year."
". We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."
"Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply."
"The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"It is for this reason that we particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor."
"It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria."
"In our opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report."
"The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"We regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time."
". I reaffirm my belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."

"The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"I regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time."
". French representatives of the Independence and Democracy Group have voted against the Van Orden and Moscovici reports for several reasons, which have to do with their implications for Bulgaria and Romania, member countries of the International Francophone Agency, and long-standing friends of France."
"We think too much of them to make them fall prey to the Eurocratic trap, which promises much, offers little and takes the most important thing – sovereignty."
"The Soviet-style ‘limited sovereignty’ imposed by the EU is, moreover, resisted by some prominent citizens of these countries, who refuse to see their nation bribed by EU subsidies, and who call for the support of our no vote."
"It will be possible, outside the iron collar of the EU, to achieve with them a Greater Europe founded on cooperation. This cooperation will be tailored to the interests of each participant, in serving the freedom of the people."
"On the other hand, Romania and Bulgaria’s entry ensures an unbroken territorial line towards Turkey, which favours the latter’s accession. This would complete the EU’s development as a culturally divided agglomerate, which is powerless, if not politically enslaved."
"This vote does not, therefore, deny the European character of Bulgaria and Romania, which have always been European countries."
". I have felt inclined to vote against further enlargement, not because of the question of whether Romania is ready for accession, but because of the fact that I do not feel that the EU is itself ready for further enlargement."
"This is evident from the current impasses in decision-making and the suspicious attitude of various ‘old’ Member States towards ‘new’ Member States on matters such as the services directive."
"In consequence new Member States have insufficient opportunity to benefit fully from the Internal Market."
"Unbridled pursuit of enlargement without deepening will lead to administrative impotence and possibly even to an implosion."
"This does no one any good, especially not the candidate Member States, which have in recent years had to compromise enormously to meet the admission criteria."
"I express the ardent wish that with the acceptance of the constitutional treaty, administrative decisiveness and economic absorption will increase such that it is justified for both the EU and new candidate Member States to work together on further enlargement."
"Simply offering a juicy carrot and ultimately fobbing these countries off will lead to great dissatisfaction and given the objectives of political stability and economic prosperity that cannot ever be the intention."
". It was with grave misgivings that I voted for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, because the reports about corruption in Romania in particular give me no reassurance about the suitability of this country for membership of the European Union."
"The way in which the Council decided on the financing of accession for these two countries, only recognising the budgetary authority of the European Parliament at the last moment, also detracts from the need to decide on the accession of these countries 20 months in advance."
"It is the geopolitical benefits of the accession of these countries that are the deciding factor for me however."
"In addition, the European Union has held out the prospect of membership for many years and fundamental changes have been made in the legislation."
"It is unclear what negative reactions a refusal of membership of the European Union would provoke."
"The accession treaties also contain safeguard clauses that can be used to postpone accession."
"All this has brought me to a cautious ‘yes’."
". Bulgaria and Romania are members of the European family of nations, and so their future lies in membership of the European Union."
"Before they can join the EU, however, they must meet set criteria."
"Since the collapse of communism, both Bulgaria and Romania have made efforts towards reform, and these efforts should be acknowledged."
"At the same time, however, the Commission’s regular progress reports make it clear that both Bulgaria and Romania still have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet these accession criteria, and much work remains to be done, particularly with regard to the thorny issues of the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"The reform process must continue, and it must be concluded before accession."
"In the interests of both parties, the two candidate countries should be given longer to implement the Copenhagen criteria."
"In view of these considerations, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the next progress report has been presented, instead of committing ourselves today."
"Much to my regret, therefore, I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time."
". I believe that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."
"Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria. As MEPs, we must ensure that the two countries comply with these criteria."
"Our constituents expect nothing less."
"The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"It is for this reason that we particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor."

"In my opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report."
"The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"Much to my regret, I therefore feel obliged to vote against accession. This is not due to any failings on the part of this House."
". We endorse Bulgaria’s accession to the EU."
"Portugal is well aware of the benefits of its own accession, and should be among those Member States that best appreciate the advantages of accession and that support it most strongly."
". We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."
"Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply."
"The Commission’s latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."

"The Commission’s latest progress reports note that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law."
"It is for this reason that the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government, which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the failings of its predecessor, are particularly welcome."
"Given that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, and in view of the fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession, I do not feel able at this time to vote in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU."
". I, like my British Conservative colleagues, support Romanian and Bulgarian accession and regret the 11th-hour attempts by some Members to deny assent to those countries on the grounds of interinstitutional wranglings and budgetary considerations, now resolved anyway."
"Although the delay of 20 months between our assent and eventual accession on 1 January 2007 is ludicrously long, it is too late to have this debate now and our position on this should have been made clear earlier."
"I am reassured by the commitment of President Basescu's new government in Romania that corruption will be considered a threat to national security and aggressively prosecuted."
"Furthermore, the commitment given to plenary by Commissioner Rehn that our Parliament will be fully involved in the unlikely decision of activating the safeguard clause to delay accession by one year."
"Not giving our assent now would send all the wrong signals to the people and governments of Romania and Bulgaria and would be a grave mistake, and I welcome both countries in the EU."
". We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU."
"Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply."
"The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires that this be done in the event of enlargement."

"The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay."
"We regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time."
"Mr President, although, like most of my fellow Members, I am in favour of the EU including Romania and Bulgaria, and of their becoming full members of it, I do believe that this should happen in due course and according to the rules."
"This is why I abstained from voting on both of the reports, as it is my belief that the countries have not yet achieved compliance with the criteria we established."
"This is, in fact, a general problem, as Member States are failing to comply with the Stability Pact criteria, and the conditions being applied to Turkey differ from those we actually agreed on."
"Croatia has to meet far more rigorous standards, whereas advance approval is now to be granted to Bulgaria and Romania."
"I believe that we are neither predictable nor consistent enough, and it is for this reason that I abstained from voting."
". In its common position, the Council has made a number of amendments to Parliament’s position at first reading and as such there has been a clear departure from the Commission’s original position."
"Consensus appears to have been reached on the aims of improving working conditions, precluding market disruptions – in light of the discrepancy between working conditions in different countries – and improving road safety, hence the need for realistic and workable checks on working time."
"The Council found that there were serious practical problems standing in the way of across-the-board implementation – or at least the extent of implementation that the Commission would like to see – of roadside checking for compliance with the working time directive."
"The purpose is therefore to strike a difficult balance between, on the one hand, complying with standards on working conditions and driving and rest times (in its biennial reports on the implementation of Regulation (EEC) 3820/85, the Commission has noted a steady rise in the number of infringements) and, on the other hand, the adoption of workable and realistic checking mechanisms."
"The rapporteur sought convergence with the Council common position, and as such I endorse the report."
". We voted in favour of this second reading despite some differences of opinion on certain aspects of the new directive establishing design requirements for energy-using products."
"We believe that it is crucial to invest in making the most efficient use of energy and in informing consumers, whilst ensuring that the new legislation does not overburden small businesses with costs."
"The directive covers everyday objects, such as hairdryers, washing machines and computers, which are responsible for around 40% of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere."
"Cars are not covered here, since there is already special legislation covering them."
"The report contains important proposals to safeguard micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the consumer."
"We shall see the Council’s position."
". I welcome the main objective of the proposal before us, which is to ensure the free movement of certain energy-using consumer products, to improve their environmental performance and to help reduce their energy consumption."
"Proposals of this nature must be realistic, so that a good proposal does not become unworkable or onerous for the industry, and this aspect is safeguarded."
"It is crucial that proposals to improve environmental and energy quality be balanced."
". The purpose of this recommendation for a second reading is to set design requirements for energy-using products throughout their life cycle, the main aim being to reduce the adverse impact of such products on the environment."
"This is an issue of major importance and Parliament accordingly tabled a range of important amendments at first reading, including amendments on conformity assessment of products, eco-design requirements that must be met, setting up a credible and effective market monitoring system, support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and informing consumers."
"In its common position, the Commission and the Council adopted some of the amendments put forward by Parliament, thus leaving behind significant concerns in this area."
"I support the rapporteur’s proposal, which is in my view realistic and stands a reasonable chance of being implemented."
"Examples of this include the clarification of concepts such as importer and manufacturer, the suggestion that surveillance must be tighter, whilst concern is shown for SMEs and some leeway is provided for adapting standards to the specific characteristics of the Member States."
"I voted in favour of the new amendments, which, in the name of balance, reinstate the previous positions held by Parliament."
"The gradual growth and development of maritime transport offers a number of benefits, including environmental ones. It must also, however, be accompanied by constant commitment to reducing the adverse effects on the environment that will always arise."
"Accordingly, and taking account of the interests and concerns opportunely raised by Portugal, I feel that I am in a position to vote in favour of this directive."
". The rapporteur’s proposal is in keeping with Parliament’s original position at first reading."
"According to the amendments tabled by Parliament, shipping emissions would be reduced by 80% by comparison with the year 2000, whereas the Council’s position would only serve to reduce them by 10%."
"Among the proposals tabled, I should like to highlight the rapporteur’s point that progress must be made in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the role that the EU could play in making that happen."
"The United States, Canada and Mexico have all sought to tighten up IMO agreements and the EU, especially given the recent accidents that it has had, can and must take action in this area."
"I also welcome the rapporteur’s suggestion of promoting the development of environmental technology by creating a market for it."
"The suggestions put forward in this area provide a more effective solution to protecting human health and the environment."
". I voted as I did on the amendments before us because I share the concerns – and the aims – of this proposal for a directive aimed at bringing in sufficient harmonisation to develop the internal market, whilst complying with the rules on public health protection."
". The report before us highlights the danger to public health of the use of certain substances, as raw materials or as intermediary materials."
"Following experiments of various kinds, toluene and trichlorobenzene have been categorised as chemicals that pose a serious risk to public health."
"The aim of the Commission’s proposal, which the rapporteur, by making only one amendment, calls on us to support, is to restrict the use not only of toluene and trichlorobenzene, but also of preparations that contain them."
"The EU has always been concerned with these issues, which are of major importance to the lives of its citizens, pursuant to Article 93 of the EC Treaty."
"Given the evident benefits of adopting the proposal in terms of protecting European citizens’ health, I voted in favour."
". The 2006 budget concludes the 2000-2006 budget ‘planning’."
"With a sum of less than EUR 120 billion, it remains 20 times smaller than the US budget, for a Europe that is seeking an American-style constitution, without having the means, nor even the desire, for 450 million men and women to change their lives."
"Within this budget can be found a litany of limited budgetary themes: leftovers to recover, minimal loans for the Balkans, mosquito nets required for children struck by malaria, the financial application of the CAP reform, chatter on the development of the countryside without country people, the paltry funds allocated to fishing, and so on."
"It is a budgetary strategy lacking in originality, because it serves an absence of ideas."
"In pursuit of the Millennium Development Objectives, for instance, the budgetary authorities do not consider new customs duty technology, which, if made deductible, would allow an African country exporting in bulk to benefit from drawing rights on importing countries, which would be equal to the sum of customs duties sustained."
"In 2006, as always, budgetary imagination is not high on the agenda in Brussels."
"."
"The 2006 budget has assumed strategic importance within the aim of sustaining dynamic growth in Europe, because it is the last of the current financial perspectives and therefore constitutes a strategic framework within which Parliament will decide its priorities for 2007-2013. 2006 is set to be a key year also in terms of meeting the goals of restoring dynamic and sustainable growth and providing for more and better jobs."
"Europe will face enormous challenges in 2006."
"Quite apart from the need to meet the financial needs of a Union of 25, the EU must ensure that the institutional and political adjustments arising from the new Constitutional Treaty proceed as efficiently as possible."
"These challenges must therefore be underpinned by coherent, well coordinated and adequately financed actions, and the 2006 budget must play a central role in meeting them."
"The challenges set by 2005/2006 are not confined to consolidating enlargement and the new Treaty, however. The EU must also take decisions on various ongoing accession processes, reinforce its role on the international stage and launch new measures to reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy."
"Once again, these goals require the necessary resources to put them into practice and sustain them."
"I voted in favour."
"The Moderate delegation has voted against the proposals on social legislation relating to road transport and on minimum conditions for the implementation of this legislation."
"Both contain extensive detailed regulations, which do not necessarily increase road safety."
"Moreover, we believe that issues concerning social legislation need to be dealt with in the individual Member States and thus are not issues to which the EU should apply itself."
". On the occasion of Mr Markov’s report, I wish to protest against the state of European legislation, which is notoriously inadequate (both in terms of working time, and working conditions and pay) in properly ensuring road safety for all."
"The European Union has chosen a method that sets possible limits for working time and a few minimum social rules."
"It does, however, offer the possibility of better regulations in certain Member States."
"In reality, however, this system causes social dumping, as the free competition of services leads to carriers from countries where there is a better social framework being penalised."
"As a result, the pursuit of competitiveness exerts pressure, in terms of the deterioration of working conditions and pay in these countries, and this is not acceptable."
"The European Union ought to have instituted a different process, of upward harmonisation, by a system of progressive social convergence."
"This strategy ought to have inextricably linked the creation of a base level (one that is more favourable than that used at present) and the obligation for a progressive reconciliation towards the highest level."
"This is not what is planned, and the situation arising from European legislation cannot be accepted."
". I voted in favour of this report because, in the vote on various amendments, we achieved a range of solutions that satisfy the specific interests of an outlying country in relation to the major centres of production and consumption, and that was achieved without undermining security requirements."
"Furthermore, it is the workers who benefit most from this, because it provides for flexibility, which is in their interests."
". I welcome the expected final adoption of the proposal, which is to abrogate Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 and replace it with a new one, aimed at clarifying, simplifying and updating the current regulation."
"The overall objective is to avoid different individual interpretations, which in the past have led to legal action. In addition, the obligations of employees and employers have been laid down more clearly, with the primary aim of ensuring that they are able to be enforced more effectively."
"The rapporteur has once again shown that he is working towards the Council Common Position and in so doing has sped up the process of adopting this important piece of legislation."
"Important amendments will enter into force regarding compulsory daily rest periods and the maximum number of driving hours. Additionally, a legal framework under which Member States may impose penalties on Member States found guilty of serious breaches."
"This will hopefully meet the primary objective of improving road safety."
"I should also like to echo the rapporteur’s wish to foster a climate of fair competition, in which the social interests of those involved in road transport are protected."
"As for the amendments, I voted for the balanced proposals that take into account the particular needs and interests of the more outlying countries such as Portugal."
". The EPLP welcomes the directive on drivers hours."
"We believe they will make a major contribution to road safety."
"We had however reservations about amendment 11 concerning the express delivery industry."
"While recognising that there may be a problem in some countries we feel that the solution being proposed is unworkable and so could bring the directive into dispute."
"Accordingly we chose to abstain on that amendment."
"We voted against the joint resolution on the spring European Council, because the positions that we hold were not taken on board and because the proposals that we tabled were not accepted. Among these proposals, I should like to highlight the following:"
"- Takes note of the European Council's agreement on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact; considers this as an implicit admission of the fact that the 1997 Stability and Growth Pact produced negative consequences for employment, public investment and real convergence and prolongs the stagnation of the European economy; considers, therefore, that it is essential to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact;"
"- Strongly criticises the fact that the ‘structural reforms’ will be taken into account in budgetary assessments, as this will lead to perverse anti-social incentives for Member States to dismantle social security and the welfare state in order to avoid being penalised in the event of excessive deficit;"
"- Highlights the Council's statement that the current draft of the directive on services in the internal market 'does not fully meet the requirements' to preserve the European Social Model, but regrets that the Council did not seize the opportunity to reject this draft in total."
"- Considers that the fight against income inequalities and the promotion of real convergence should be at the top of the EU´s economic and social agenda."
". The European Council held last March was the occasion for a new demonstration of hypocrisy by the leaders of the European Union, panicked at the idea of a victory for the ‘no’ vote in the French referendum."
"In spite of the soothing discussions, the Bolkestein directive was neither thoroughly reviewed nor withdrawn."
"It continues along its normal legislative path, with just one concession: the Council of Ministers will attempt to find a consensus."
"We are made to think it is a great diplomatic victory when it is no more and no less than the application of a 40-year-old method, the ‘Luxembourg compromise’."
"The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, that harmful budgetary constraint, is also window-dressing."
"The negotiation of the European Constitution could have provided the opportunity for in-depth reform of the Maastricht criteria, which make scarcely any economic sense. It could also have provided the opportunity to force the European Central Bank to support employment and growth as a matter of priority."
"Nothing has been done."
"In its place, we have these paltry finishing touches, whilst the Pact continues to have the effect of amplifying, indeed of provoking, the economic and social difficulties of our countries."
"These manoeuvres are absurd."
"They will not trick those who, in increasingly large numbers, reject the development of the Europe of Brussels."
". I and my British Conservative MEP colleagues have abstained on this vote because of our strong disappointment with the outcome of the European Council on 22-23 March."
"We remain supportive of the President of the Commission's commitment to fundamental economic reform in Europe, but believe his efforts have been badly served by the decisions of Heads of State and Government at the March European Council."
"The attempt to dilute the Services Directive for short-term political considerations has undermined the reform agenda and inhibits attempts to improve Europe's competitiveness."
"The changes put forward to the Stability and Growth Pact demonstrates that political factors are outweighing economic considerations, making the Pact increasingly less credible."
"We welcome some aspects of the Presidency Conclusions, including the commitment to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol and also the Motion's strong words against lifting the arms embargo on China."
"We also welcome the increased sense of urgency in preparing for a possible flu pandemic."
". Contrary to what was asserted, in France, by supporters of the European Constitution, Mr Chirac did not obtain the withdrawal of the Bolkestein directive in Brussels on 23 March."
"In its official record, the European Council declares that the directive will not be withdrawn, indeed pointing out that it must remain on the European agenda, since the Growth and Jobs Strategy implies the opening up of the services market."
"This lie is not, however, the first to be uttered by the hypocrites of the yes camp."
"Mr Bolkestein himself pointed it out: until this year, neither Mr Chirac nor Mr Raffarin had voiced the least reserve on his directive, which was approved by the French Commissioners, the socialist Pascal Lamy and the Chirac supporter Michel Barnier."
"Mr Bolkestein, with good reason, did nothing but carry out a decision taken in 2005 during the Lisbon Summit, where France was represented by Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin."
"This directive is, however, only an outline of what awaits us if the European Constitution is adopted."
"Articles 144, 145 and 148 of the text are clear."
"Did you like the Bolkestein directive? You will love the European Constitution."
"By voting no on 29 May, the people of France will be defending their jobs and their social rights."
". I voted in favour of the resolution on the results of the European Council, but with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, I am anxious to point out the following: I regret the fact that the debates surrounding reform of the Pact often amounted to exercises in self-justification and not to objective discussions."
"I had emphasised the fact that this attitude has had devastating psychological effects."
"Not only has the principle of equal treatment between Member States suffered as a result, but also the foundations of a Community governed by the rule of law appear to have been shaken."
"The suspicions that surround this reform are the result of this behaviour."
"The reassertion of the intangible character of the common rules decided would have been more useful than the triumphant, tiresome declarations of various Heads of State at the end of the European Council."
"We need to ask the question of whether everyone is fully aware of the fact that the management of a common asset, the single currency, is at stake."
"I should like to remind you of what I said last autumn: I prefer a reformed Pact to a dying Pact because it is respected to a greater degree."
"To continue in allegorical terms, I will state that the Pact is doing better today, but that it is a very weak convalescent that will not withstand further traumatic experiences."
". I voted in favour of the resolution on the March Council Summit."
"Given that growth currently stands at a meagre 1.7%, and employment at 63% rather than 70%, new priorities were urgently needed for the Lisbon process."
"SMEs, which are responsible for generating 80% of jobs and 70% of apprenticeships, will be the most likely to benefit from the new focus on growth and employment."
"Accusations of neo-liberalism are misguided, as the aim is create more and better jobs, not to introduce lower standards, and to reinforce the European social model by means of investment in human capital, modern social protection and greater involvement of social partners."
"The European Youth Pact, with its objectives of long-term integration into the labour market, improved general and vocational education and increased mobility for young people, is particularly important in this respect."
"The Active Ageing campaign is of key significance for older people, as the experience, skills and productivity these workers have gained deserve greater recognition."
"Action must be taken that enable them to stay in employment for longer and to take greater advantage of education and training opportunities, and overall improvements must be made to the way our senior citizens are integrated into society."
"I am counting on specific solutions being proposed that provide responses to the Commission’s Green Paper on the demographic situation in the EU."
". – The reform of the Stability Pact and the midterm review of the Lisbon Strategy are the two whips which will be used more intensively against the peoples, especially young people."
"A new anti-grass roots assault is being prepared."
"The reformed Stability Pact does not revise the objectives of the anti-grass roots policy against the workers."
"On the contrary, arm-in-arm with the Lisbon Strategy, greater impetus is being given to big business and the demands of the Franco-German axis are being satisfied."
"The decisions on poorer pension systems, the abolition of collective agreements, the generalisation of part-time and temporary work, the liberalisation of working times, the reduction in state aid, the reduction in subsidies, full liberalisation of the market with more privatisation, drastic cuts in employers' social security contributions and the generalisation of private insurance are a fact, the direct repercussions of which are wage and pension cuts and more poverty and unemployment."
"In particular, the European Youth Pact and the promotion of training and lifelong learning mean lifelong illiteracy and flexibility for the convenience of big business."
"The way forward for the peoples and young people is resistance and disobedience to the anti-grass roots decisions of the European Council."
". Although I have voted in favour of this resolution, I must say that I am somewhat disillusioned by the conclusions of the European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005."
"Both the review of the Lisbon Strategy and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact display a lack of ambition."
"Public finances require greater streamlining and investments must be more efficient; what they do not need is further debt."
"It is also true, however, that the Lisbon Strategy needed a review, in order to make it more realistic and more geared towards genuine competitiveness."
"Jobs are not created by decree, but by means of a healthy economy, and it cannot be said that the Union has been moving purposefully in that direction."
". It appears, at first glance, that the Brussels European Council will be inextricably associated with the review of the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, which underwent amendments following numerous cases of non-compliance."
"Although these amendments are far-removed from the excessive rigidity that characterised the previous version, it is also essential that they avoid any vagueness, because otherwise they might have a negative impact on the euro’s credibility internationally and on the stability of Member States’ public finances."
"A further relevant aspect that the Council focused on was the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, in light of the lack of success at this mid-term stage."
"I feel that the Strategy has been a victim of its own ambition and of the vague, almost bombastic nature of some of the targets that were set, without their being pegged to a properly laid out and workable timetable."
"More realism is needed, to go with the ambition."
"In spite of some reservations with regard to parts of the Services Directive, particularly the announcement and the exaggerated defence of the so-called country of origin principle, I believe that it contains some highly positive aspects that we should adopt and put into practice at European level."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as I feel that it clearly identifies and criticises the most significant effects of the Council’s proposals."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on regional integration in the Western Balkans."
". Mr President, I thank Parliament, and the rapporteur Mr Samuelsen, for the forward-looking resolution on the Western Balkans and for the commitment of Parliament and of its Foreign Affairs Committee to the region."
"Currently, most of the countries in the Western Balkans are making tangible progress in their relations with the EU."
"Yet, many issues still need to be addressed and progress consolidated and reinforced."
"The years 2005 and 2006 will be crucial for the Western Balkans in relation to the European Union."
"We are at a real watershed."
"We have to overcome certain short-term issues to be able to focus on long-term economic and social development."
"The most critical immediate issues concern the conclusion of the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia – ICTY – and the settlement of the future status of Kosovo."
"As a former Member of the European Parliament, I have always been proud of the strong record of this House in advocating respect for human rights and related international obligations, as well as in supporting the multilateral system based on the United Nations."
"This is why I particularly welcome Parliament’s views in paragraphs 37 and 46, where full cooperation with ICTY, the Hague Tribunal, is underlined."
"This support for human rights, the rule of law and UN-based multilateralism is the reason why the European Union has made cooperation with ICTY a condition in its relations with the countries in the region."
"This autumn, probably in November, the Commission will present the enlargement package and report in more detail on the progress made by the countries in the region."
"Let me now take the opportunity to sketch out where we stand today as regards these countries."
"Looking at Albania, I share the concern expressed in Parliament’s resolution on the political climate, particularly in the context of this summer’s parliamentary elections."
"I have recently written to Prime Minister Nano to underline that the Commission will only be able to propose the conclusion of negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement if the parliamentary elections this summer are conducted in accordance with international standards."
"Tangible achievements must also be made in fighting corruption and organised crime."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively tackling the priorities we identified in the feasibility report in late 2003."
"Once the country achieves significant progress in all priority areas, we can recommend opening negotiations on the Stabilisation and Accession Agreement."
"I hope to be able to do so next month."
"On ICTY cooperation, there is significant progress, and the trend must be reinforced to lead to full cooperation."
"For the opening of SAA negotiations, the police reform is a particularly important condition for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The High Representative and the Union have been instrumental in advancing stability and reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I believe, however, that the country is ready to assume more responsibility for its own future."
"With responsible and democratically accountable authorities in place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I foresee a smooth and gradual phasing-out of the Office of the High Representative."
"As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, it is indeed time to move from the era of Dayton to the era of Brussels."
"I was disappointed that Croatia was not able to ensure full cooperation with the ICTY by mid-March."
"As you know, in December the European Council decided that accession negotiations could only be opened on 17 March, if there was full cooperation with the Hague Tribunal."
"This concerns the willingness and ability of the state structures in Croatia to comply with the rule of law and international obligations."
"Croatia must now demonstrate that it is fully cooperating with the ICTY."
"Let me be clear."
"Croatia’s future is in the European Union."
"Through the adoption of the negotiating framework, the EU has done what is necessary to start the negotiations."
"The EU is ready, once Croatia is ready."
"Let me turn to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"President Barroso and I met Prime Minister Bučkovski in February when he handed over the country’s replies to the Commission’s questionnaire."
"My services are currently analysing the 13 000 pages – 45 kg – of replies."
"We expect the government to make further progress in its reform agenda, to strengthen the rule of law and to implement the Ohrid Framework Agreement."
"I am concerned about the OSCE reports on the repetition of irregularities in the latest municipal elections."
"The authorities must now react decisively and ensure that future elections can take place in full compliance with international standards."
"Depending on the political development, on the progress in legal, political and economic reforms and on the technical quality of the replies, we aim to adopt the opinion by the end of this year."
"Yesterday the Commission took a positive decision on the Feasibility Study for Serbia and Montenegro."
"We now consider the country to be sufficiently prepared to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union."
"We need to treat countries equally at equal stages; we must use the same yardstick at the same stage for each country."
"Negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement is very different from negotiating accession to the Union."
"We will demand more as Serbia and Montenegro moves forward in the process."
"To reach this stage Serbia and Montenegro had to make special efforts."
"I welcome the agreement concluded last week on the Constitutional Charter, which ensures the legitimacy of the State Union Parliament."
"I am pleased that the country has finally made significant progress in cooperating with the Hague Tribunal."
"So far this year, a dozen persons indicted for war crimes have boarded the plane to The Hague."
"Efforts should be reinforced until none of the remaining indictees is still at large."
"Accession negotiations proper cannot even be considered until the country has achieved full cooperation with ICTY."
"With the tenth anniversary of Srebrenica approaching in July, Radovan Karadzić and Ratko Mladić must be brought to justice."
"This is the beginning of the European road for Serbia and Montenegro."
"The country has achieved a great deal over the past few years."
"Now it is time to move on, time to reward significant progress, and time to show the citizens of Serbia and Montenegro that meeting critical international obligations brings them closer to the European Union."
"Kosovo will be high on the agenda in the months to come, with the standards review coming up in mid-2005, likely to be followed by discussions on Kosovo’s future status."
"We are focusing on helping the Kosovo authorities to make progress on implementing UN standards, especially the rule of law and the rights of minorities."
"Once the status has been settled, we will continue to support Kosovo’s progress towards European integration."
"The Commission plans to present a Communication next week on ‘A European Future for Kosovo’."
"It will give a clear signal to the leaders and people of Kosovo that the EU is fully committed to their European future."
"We also expect the Kosovan leaders to show a constructive attitude, including meeting Serbian leaders who have stretched out a hand to them."
"Belgrade also needs to work constructively to settle the issue."
"In the Feasibility Study for Serbia and Montenegro, we made it clear to Belgrade that the country’s EU aspirations are linked to a successful resolution of Kosovo’s status."
"To sum up, although there are difficulties and pitfalls on the Western Balkans’ road to Europe, most countries are currently making steady progress."
"Those countries struggling to reform antiquated economies, and to build modern societies based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, have, at the same time, to deal with the legacy of war."
"In this context I would like to highlight the importance of regional cooperation."
"Good neighbourly relations and regional economic cooperation are the very essence of the European Union."
"They are the catalyst for stability, reconciliation and normalising political relations."
"This is a major challenge to the countries of the region and to the European Union."
"It is a tall order, but I am confident that we are on the right track."
"The less we need to focus on stability and security, the more we can channel our resources to economic and social development, which is rightly underlined in the Samuelsen report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU foreign policy ought to focus on South East Europe, and the EU ought to take consistent measures to finish what it started in the mid-1990s. To date, however, such measures have been thin on the ground."
"The aim behind this report was to allow us to exert a certain amount of pressure on the Council and the Commission, and today we have learnt that this course of action has proved successful, at least at this stage of the game."
"I was glad to hear the Commissioner say a few moments ago that the Commission now, at long last, plans to present a communication on Kosovo, and Mr Schmit also said that the Council would try to ensure that the increased interest in this region would be backed up by action."
"At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves what action the countries themselves are taking."
"The two previous speakers have already referred to the need for Albania to ensure at long last that the forthcoming elections are conducted properly and that the results are not manipulated in any way."
"The Albanian Government must also take the business of governance seriously once and for all, by combating corruption and implementing legislation."
"We are all aware that Macedonia must press on with the Aarhus process in order to enable its Albanians, who make up 25% of the population as a whole, to feel as though they are on an equal footing with other citizens."
"Until this happens, it will be impossible for Macedonia to act as a stabilising force in the region."
"The Commission and the Council have for some considerable time needed to bring pressure to bear on local politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina to amend the Dayton Agreement in such a way that a functioning community can be established."
"The country will never be able to join the European Union in its current state."
"There is still too little cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, and not enough refugees have yet returned to ."
"Turning to Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, the confederation between Serbia and Montenegro is still far from robust, and a decision should be taken in the near future as to whether it should remain in existence or be dissolved."
"Belgrade and Pristina must work together under the auspices of the UN and the EU to find a solution to the Kosovo issue as quickly as possible, and there is no reason why such a solution should not be found, given that all the countries concerned wish to join the European Union."
"I hope that Croatia will be able to persuade the monitoring mission that it is cooperating fully."
"All the above-mentioned countries are facing enormous problems with regard to their judicial systems and the fight against corruption, and they also lack administrative capacity."
"We must take steps to help them in this respect, and indeed we should help all these countries in a more committed and coherent fashion."
"We should provide them with access to pre-accession instruments so that they develop functioning national economies and functioning democracies."
"If this happens, everyone will benefit, especially the young people in the countries in question."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU."
"There can be no question that something resembling enlargement fatigue has set in, both among the Members of this House – including some of those who voted in favour – and among the public."
"It has been a particularly challenging task of late to discuss the next rounds of enlargement, but the Council, the Commission and Parliament must work together to explain to the public that this is the only way in which this region can be stabilised. We must also make it clear that negative developments in these countries lead to an increased risk of various problems such as cross-border crime, corruption or renewed outbreaks of ethnic conflicts, and that this risk can be averted only if the countries have a clear prospect of European integration."
"I am extremely grateful to the Presidency and the Commission for having emphasised this point today."
"Our attention must now be focused firmly on this region, particularly in view of the decisions we have taken today, and I am grateful to the Council for having found a solution aimed at helping Croatia."
"This solution involves close monitoring of the steps taken by the country with a view to handing Gotovina over to the Hague Tribunal, and I hope that both parties will set about adopting it without delay, as this would enable us to open negotiations with Croatia in the near future."
"Croatia made a great deal of progress under previous governments, and there is a real chance that the present government could act as a beacon or a driving force – depending on which analogy you prefer – for the rest of the region."
"Any agreement we reach with Croatia should therefore not be seen as an attack on Serbia or any other country, as it would be intended to benefit the region as a whole."
"Of course, I am sure that we would all be delighted if Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo were to join together in perfect harmony to form one country."
"Given everything that has happened, however, particularly as far as Kosovo is concerned, this is highly unlikely."
"I am therefore of the opinion that a way should be found in which these countries – or at any rate Kosovo – can gain independence whilst still maintaining their existing historical and ethnic links."
"Regardless of whether the Community of Independent States is taken as a model or whether another form of cooperation is established, I would ask the Council and the Commission to be as imaginative as possible when working on this task, as it is essential that we come up with a serious solution to the problem of Serbia and Montenegro, as well as to that of Kosovo, before the end of 2006."
"I can assure you that this House will be right behind you if the proposals you put forward are good ones."
"Mr President, it is true that there are still many problems in this region."
"That has also been emphasised by the speakers from the Council and the Commission, and I should like to thank them for the accounts they have given."
"It is also true, however, that this region has a good deal in prospect, including in terms of its integration into the Europe we have today."
"I should like to cite an example from Denmark."
"The latest enlargement of Europe was a real eye-opener for a great many Danes who came to see Europe in a new light: not just as an economic club for the rich, but as a political club that was based upon a number of common values and that could be a driving force in the development of democracies and security."
"Recently, we have seen how one of the Danish parties that plays a crucial role in the EU debate, namely the Socialist People’s Party, has changed from being eurosceptic to being europhile."
"Moreover, they have quite clearly done this in the light of the development we saw involving enlargement."
"The next major challenge is this particular region, and, as we have recently seen, there are still of course problems in Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro, Kosovo and Croatia, with accession negotiations having had to be postponed."
"What is important, however, is to insist that these countries have prospects in terms of Europe, for it is those prospects that can be the very driving force they need."
"Moreover, we in the rest of Europe very much need to show that what we have here is a key area for European cooperation."
"We are entering an exciting year."
"It will be a year in which we shall of course – and hopefully as quickly as possible – have found a positive settlement with regard to Croatia."
"It will no doubt also be the year in which we can come closer to solving the problem surrounding FYROM’s or Macedonia’s name, and it will also hopefully be a year in which we come closer to settling the matter of Kosovo’s future status."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to say thank you for your cooperation in connection with the resolution and its preparation."
"It has become a useful tool that will help maintain not only the pressure and momentum that are now hopefully part of developments, but also the commitment that the EU must demonstrate if a solution is to be found to the region’s problems. We can then get the process seriously under way, and matters will make sense to all the parties involved and appear to be going somewhere."
". – It has been stressed by various speakers in this debate and also in various reports and pronouncements by the Commission and the Council."
"The countries of the Western Balkans are future members of the European Union, but in the present social climate that is easier said than done."
"We heard it in the debate this morning about Romania and Mr Swoboda has referred to it: there is a certain enlargement fatigue."
"I am very afraid that this enlargement fatigue will in particular have repercussions on our Balkan policy."
"I remain convinced that – however unpopular it may be and I emphasise it here once more – the European Union needs a Balkan strategy."
"Yesterday the International Commission for the Balkans, whose membership includes a good many interesting and expert people, published a report."
"I quote from that report."
"It is about the Western Balkans. ‘The wars may be over but the smell of violence is still hanging in the air.’"
"If you travel round the Balkans, in whatever country it may be, then is the situation and that means that the EU simply cannot afford to think that it is not very convenient for us for the moment, let us let these countries be for now."
"In this new strategy, in this strategy for the Balkans aimed at membership, two factors are important."
"Firstly – although it is patently obvious, I will say it again – the social and economic development in the region at the moment is disastrous and that is the main source of instability."
"With high unemployment rates it is virtually impossible for young people leaving school here to build a future locally."
"This leads to additional criminality, uncertainty and instability, and that should not be what we want."
"If the European Union is good at anything, it is in the fostering of economic ties between these countries and between them and the European Union."
"A second element that we must not abandon is the adherence to the basic conditions with regard to human rights and minority rights."
"Although we as Balkan spokespersons were divided amongst ourselves about this in respect of Croatia, it has already been proven in my view that the adherence by the Council to cooperation with the Hague Tribunal as a condition for the start of negotiations has positive effects in both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia."
"I am glad and my compliments to the Council that it stood firm on cooperation with the Tribunal."
"Then the matter that concerns us all: Kosovo."
"I have just been there and am convinced that the report about the standards and what has happened so far will come as a matter of course."
"I am completely confident that this debate about status will be held."
"In that debate, Europe, whether it likes it or not, must take the lead because we have the root in our hands."
"We have the reward for Serbia and Kosovo in our own hands."
"This debate about the independence of Kosovo must be conducted under all kinds of conditions that are clear even now: no separation, no cooperation with Albania or Macedonia and respect for the Serbian minority."
"To do nothing and look away, though, to act as if it is too difficult for Europe to deal with the Balkans at the moment, that is an approach that we cannot afford."
"Doing nothing will lead to an intolerable and dangerous situation."
"Let us not inflict this on ourselves and the countries of the Balkans!"
". In the 1990s we thought we could solve the problems in former Yugoslavia by setting up protectorates, sending external administrators and soldiers there and forcing refugees to return to areas where there was now a different ethnic majority."
"This American model leads to stagnation."
"It forces the people there back into the role of under-age children."
"They are going to bide their time until these foreign busybodies have left."
"The alternative to this stagnation is that we seek a peaceful, democratic way from the bottom up by taking seriously how the people in Kosovo, Montenegro, the separate entities in Bosnia or the two large language areas in Macedonia itself for example see their future and what they want to call themselves."
"States and population groups that opposed each other in the 1990s still reject domination by their neighbours but they do want to cooperate with open borders."
"An early start to the negotiations on accession to the European Union, starting with Croatia and Macedonia, can contribute to this."
"Europe must now without prejudice seek the real solutions together with all concerned."
". Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina is a time bomb waiting to go off!"
"Clear language on the part of EUFOR, the European Union’s military mission in that country."
"Nearly ten years after Dayton the former warring parties are continuing their ethnic struggle unabated in the political arena."
"By no means did the ad hoc delegation of this Parliament gain a comforting picture of the present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo and Mostar last week, but it was certainly a realistic one."
"This underlines once more the usefulness of the EUFOR mission locally."
"You might expect a conciliatory contribution from the religious communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Representatives of Council, Commission and EUFOR reported the opposite."
"I would like to urge Council and Commission to keep reminding the church authorities and the of their great responsibility in this regard."
"The recent arrest of Bosnians in Chechnya is an ominous sign. It illustrates the danger of religious extremism for which EUFOR sources were seeking our attention."
"A moving part of the visit of the ad hoc delegation to Sarajevo was an inspection of minefields."
"Council and Commission, only the clearance of these fields of death can make the transition to a peaceful existence possible."
"So please invest extra in the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this way!"
"Mr President, we all know only too well that recent years have brought great sadness to the Balkans region and to the many people who lost family and loved ones as a result of the wars there."
"The final phase of this war resulted in the NATO attack on Kosovo and the collapse of the regime."
"I very much support the policies of the European Union, which have been put in place to help to rebuild the economies of the Western Balkans region."
"The European Union is right in the most part to treat the Balkans area as a single region."
"Politically, this is a very sensitive issue in terms of the future relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkans."
"The European Union is, of course, the single largest contributor of economic aid to the Balkans region at this time."
"Monies are being used to improve basic infrastructures in the field of transport, environment, energy and telecommunications."
"European Union support is also being directed towards improving the efficiency of public institutions, focusing in particular on the judiciary, police forces and public administration."
"That does not mean, however, that the European Union is not critical of political developments in the Balkans region."
"The European Union is still demanding that war suspects be handed over to the international war tribunal in The Hague."
"However, there have been many very positive developments in the Balkan region in recent times."
"I welcome the American Government’s decision to withdraw its troops from Bosnia and hand over peacekeeping control to European Union forces."
"It is clear that there is broad political stability in the region."
"We know that we must keep a very close eye on political developments in that region and I support what is known as the stabilisation and association process."
"I am in favour of these countries becoming members of the European Union if they comply with the Copenhagen criteria in terms of respecting the rule of law and promoting human rights."
"The European Union as a political entity knows and will meet its obligations in this regard."
"– Mr President, the Western Balkans have always been the testing ground for trying out the efficacy of the European Union's external action."
"European policy to date has been typified by its fragmentary character, scattered actions, lack of coordination and the fact that it is out of step with the development potential of the area."
"As I see it, the challenges for shaping a more productive European policy in relation to the Western Balkans are:"
"First, to build measures to further trust, social cohesion and security."
"Secondly, to link European support for and the European prospects of the Balkans to strict terms of political adjustment, administrative reform and justice."
"Thirdly, to prepare an advanced and cohesive strategic plan for the development of the Balkans, with the intermediate objective of integrated and sustainable growth and the final objective of convergence with the European Union."
"The plan will articulate the priorities of each country, seek out areas of cooperation and mutual benefit, lay down priorities and lines of action, set out and quantify requirements in basic sectors and make provision for resources to implement it."
"Fourthly, to support regional economic integration, with the focus on cross-border infrastructures and the trans-European networks."
"Fifthly, to invigorate regional cooperation policy by establishing a structured political dialogue, in accordance with the precedent of the European Conference on Central and Eastern European Counties prior to their accession."
"Finally, Mr Samuelsen's amendment and other similar amendments concerning the name of the FYROM are, to my mind, unacceptable for the reasons set out in the joint declaration by the New Democracy parliamentary group, a copy of which has been sent to all the members of the European Parliament."
"As a minimum sign of institutional and political responsibility, I consider that all the members of the European Parliament and of the other institutions of the European Union should use the official names, the United Nations names, as Commissioner Rehn in fact did."
"– Mr President, the initiative by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposing amendments on the question of the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and calling for the country to be recognised by the European Union with its constitutional name force me to take a stand from the outset on this issue alone."
"I wish to state in the most categorical terms that this initiative directly conflicts with the resolutions passed by the UN and the decisions taken by the European Union and its institutions, including the European Parliament."
"This is an initiative which flies in the face of every notion of solidarity with a Member State of the European Union, with Greece, which is one of the parties participating in the negotiating process under way within the framework of the UN to find a mutually acceptable and dignified solution, an honourable and logical compromise."
"When all of us, including them, have denounced the unilateral action of the United States in connection with the recognition of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, they come along today to confirm and accept the unilateral action by the United States of America, recognising the FYROM with its constitutional name."
"This stand creates a real problem, when today we should be debating and should be helping to shape a joint, integrated European strategy for the major challenges and dangers of renewed confrontation and instability in the area of the Western Balkans."
"This would indeed be an important contribution to the defence of European interests and to the strengthening of the European prospects of the countries in the area."
"Conflict and war in the Balkans should make us all more careful, more responsible and more realistic."
"Greece has succeeded in assimilating the lessons of the recent history of conflict in the Balkans and has proven, with peace and cooperation initiatives, to be a stabilising factor."
"It is the first European country when it comes to investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, investments which have created more than 20 000 jobs."
"It has demonstrated a real sense of responsibility, realism and a willingness to compromise at the UN in order to resolve the problem of the name and find a logical compromise which leaves both countries' dignity intact."
"That is why I call on my honourable friends in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the rapporteur, Mr Samuelsen, to withdraw their amendments, at least for the time being, just as I call on the President-in-Office of the Council and the Member of the Commission to take a stand on this issue."
"(Thank you Mr President."
"I wish to speak about the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from the geo-strategic aspect of the process of the enlargement of the European Union towards the southeast."
"Its geographical position in the unstable Balkan region is extremely important for the European Union, especially in a situation where the constitutional status of neighbouring Kosovo has not been finalised and is witness to sensitive constitutional reform being carried out on the basis of the Ohrid framework agreement."
"The framework agreement is a constitutional documentation of the principle of cultural diversity."
"In it the majority national group of Slavonic Macedonians express how they will at all levels, from national to local, subscribe to sharing power with the minority national group of Albanian Macedonians."
"The importance of the agreement for the stability of the situation must therefore be measured by the criteria of a civilisational turning point."
"Reform of the fundamental societal relations is progressing parallel to economic reform."
"In order for it to continue, the country needs a clear prospect of establishing closer relations with the European Union, and our help in consolidating its new identity."
"And a part of this is the question posed by rapporteur Samuelsen: ‘Has the time not come for the European Union to consider recognising it by its constitutional name – the Republic of Macedonia?’"
"Thank you."
"Mr President, there can be no question that all of the nations and ethnic groups in the Balkans that are pinning their hopes on the EU after a long history of suffering are European."
"On closer inspection, however, it unfortunately becomes apparent that ‘old boy networks’ still operate in many of these Balkan states."
"The promised reforms often exist only on paper, and for this former members of the are mainly to blame."
"Virtually no serious efforts are being made to stop corruption, and the gap between rich and poor is growing."
"The illiteracy rate is rising in some areas, and the situation of minorities, in particular the Roma, leaves much to be desired."
"Elections are manipulated by means of bribes and sometimes even violence."
"All the EU institutions should take a much closer look at what is really going on, and they must not allow members of the ‘old boy networks’ to pull the wool over their eyes."
"I believe that we should take our time and examine the situation in more depth before we agree to countries joining the EU."
"Mr President, contrary to what these documents claim, Croatia does not belong to the Western Balkans. It is a Central European country, and the only one, apart from Switzerland and Liechtenstein, that does not yet belong to the EU."
"Given that it meets the criteria, we should open negotiations with it at once."
"In the real Balkans, however, there is still more than enough to do."
"A constitutional reform must take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to transform it into a strong federation of three nations with equal rights, and Lord Ashdown’s dictatorship must be brought to an end."
"Before the end of the year, Kosovo must be presented with a clear roadmap to independence, albeit with conditions attached."
"Any other approach would be devoid of any basis in reality."
"Serbia and Montenegro must allow thorough monitoring of their compliance with human rights."
"In this respect, I am somewhat concerned that the decision taken this week by the Commission rested rather too much on misapprehensions."
"As far as Macedonia is concerned, the name issue must finally be settled, and, much as I respect the Greek Members, I would call on them to abandon their narrow-minded way of thinking on this matter."
"In Germany, Franconia is a part of Bavaria, and we also have Frankfurt, yet no one would ever suggest that France must instead start calling itself the Republic of Paris, because it might otherwise make territorial claims to Frankfurt or Franconia."
"We are in the 21st century now, and there is no longer any place for such nonsense."
"We must make it clear exactly where the EU’s boundaries lie."
"Mr Langen belongs to the ranks of those who repeatedly point out that the EU would be overstretching itself if it allowed Turkey to join, yet South East Europe is quite clearly European."
"We must focus our energies on stabilising South East Europe and Croatia, which is a Central European country that has as little reason to be called part of the Balkans as does the beautiful Bohemian town of Kaden an der Eger, or as do Munich or Altenkirchen in Siegerland."
"Croatia belongs to Central Europe, and it must be integrated into Europe. This would also stabilise the neighbouring Balkans."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to continue where my esteemed colleague Posselt left off."
"I agree with the numerous reports deriving from the resolution, and I will therefore support it."
"However, in the resolution I miss the important emphasis that the establishment of peace itself does not yet signify a resolution of the complex and fundamental issues of coexistence for the peoples of that region."
"It would be highly erroneous for us to form the impression that we now have fully formed democratic states in that region, and that with them and the EU everything should be about rapid modernisation and integration with the EU."
"In my opinion the EU should take more initiative and responsibility to ensure that the fundamental status of certain states in that region is settled by peaceful means, without the use of force, by agreement and, most importantly, on a more permanent basis."
"For instance, the unreformed Dayton Agreement represents a hindrance for the development of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the status of Kosovo must be settled, the majority of Serbs and Montenegrins wish to live in independent countries, and so on. I think these are fundamental issues that deserve a more fundamental response than we are able to give at this moment."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when speaking of the Balkans, we cannot think of a stable arrangement except within the European Union."
"European integration can only be achieved, however, if there is a great impetus from the people."
"In the Balkans this must also result from a political truth and reconciliation process, alongside the criminal proceedings at the Court in the Hague – which is certainly important but by itself cannot ensure that everybody is aware of who did what in the war of the early 1990s."
"The scenario that we are dealing with today may represent a restoration of the situation in which violence broke out and in which victims and persecutors can now confront each other."
"Such profound confrontations are the only way to turn the page so that nobody can return to it."
"This is a necessary step in building a democracy, because it implies mutual respect and trust."
"The Union is in need of great determination directed towards the future and must not remain imprisoned by the past."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is not a lot that can be said in two minutes, especially if the subject is as big a one as that of the Western Balkans."
"I therefore intend to mention a few things that are common to all the countries in the region and to our attitude towards them."
"The Western Balkans is an area affected not only by war and destruction but also by 50 years of Communism."
"We who have experienced a war know how easy it is to start one and how difficult it is to bring it to an end."
"We who have experienced Communism also know how long a period is required to build up democracy."
"In all of these countries that we are talking about today, there is some sort of division: in Croatia, between the democratic and non-democratic forces, in Bosnia between the federation and the Republika Srpska, and in Serbia and Montenegro between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians."
"When we engage in discussions with these countries and impose various requirements, we must keep this in mind and try to help the democratic forces that exist in the Western Balkans but that are not always as strong or even as authentic as we believe."
"When we talk, for example, about those accused of war crimes in Republika Srpska or Serbia queuing to come to The Hague, there are not many in this Parliament who know that those people and their families are given a lot of money from the authorities for doing so."
"When we talk about Macedonia voluntarily participating in the negotiations concerning its change of name, there are not many in this Parliament who know that that is only a part of the truth, for only Greek representatives are present at the negotiations and not Macedonian representatives able to put forward their views on the matter."
"I also wish to emphasise that all the decisions of this Parliament are interpreted and analysed carefully by both the negative and positive forces in the region."
"We therefore need to be extremely careful about the signals we send out to the people of these countries, irrespective of whether we are talking about the demands for the return of refugees to Kosovo, Macedonia’s change of name or Croatia’s future membership of the EU."
"Whatever we do, we must support those fighting for peaceful and democratic development and impose sanctions upon those obstructing such development."
"Mr President, I was in Bosnia-Herzegovina recently and saw the successful start of EUFOR, the EU peacekeeping mission."
"Bitter enmities remain between the country’s Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian groups."
"In spite of the fact that up to 10 000 people are implicated in war crimes, only 34 public indictments have been made."
"The road to Brussels cannot be journeyed until respect for the EU’s standards of justice is achieved."
"That is why the European Parliament is right today to insist on full cooperation with the ICTY by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia."
"Today Europe invests 25 times more money and 50 times more troops per capita in Kosovo than in Afghanistan."
"It is in the EU’s economic, as well as political, interest to integrate the Western Balkans, and it is their historic destiny."
"The prospect of EU enlargement helped the countries of Eastern Europe to transform."
"We have to hope and work to ensure that it is the same for the countries of south-east Europe, so that they can join us as well in this Parliament and in our Union."
". First of all I should like to congratulate Parliament for having taken the initiative in holding this debate."
"In actual fact, as the Commissioner and I have both emphasised, the situation in the Western Balkans is of vital interest to the European Union."
"I note that we do not, in fact, have any major alternative to the European perspective."
"The European perspective is the only tool that we have in order to convince these countries to change, to undertake reforms, to find the way to Europe – which means, first of all, the way to European values – and to find the way to reconciliation."
"It is not absurd to tell these countries to find the way to reconciliation, because we ourselves set an example of such reconciliation sixty years ago."
"I believe, therefore, that so-called ‘enlargement fatigue’ is a fact, and that people are questioning these constant movements towards enlargement, towards new accessions."
"However, we must explain to them that it is in the interests of every one of us to achieve peace, stability and economic development in this region."
"Someone referred to the record rates of endemic unemployment in Kosovo and Bosnia."
"We are confronted by a situation which at first glance seems impossible to resolve. Why is there unemployment?"
"There is unemployment because there is no economic development."
"There is no economic development because there is no private investment and there is no private investment because there is neither confidence nor security: no one wants to invest in regions where the future and development are uncertain."
"We therefore have a fundamental mission: to consolidate security, to provide security and to convince the people that their future lies in security, in reconciliation, and in respect for minority rights."
"I believe that this is how we can release a positive dynamic, which is first of all an economic dynamic."
"In fact, as long as there is no economic recovery in this region we shall not really have a stable peace."
"This is an important mission for the European Union."
"Once again I should like to thank Parliament for having realised and pointed out the fact that there is a need for urgent action in this region, by means of all the avenues which have been mentioned and described."
"Finally, I agree that there is a risk of extremism."
"Here in Europe we have a possible focus of radical extremism, in particular Islamic extremism."
"In this respect too, we must ensure prevention, and the only way of ensuring prevention is via dialogue. We must demonstrate that this part of Europe belongs to Europe, that it shares European values, even if it also includes people of the Muslim faith."
"I believe, therefore, that what we are doing today is sending an important signal, and we must continue to send that signal throughout the years to come."
". Mr President, I would like to join Minister Schmit in congratulating Parliament on taking the initiative to hold this debate."
"It is extremely important that you hold this debate at this critical moment to help keep the Western Balkans on the agenda of the European Union and of the international community, both of which have quite a number of other issues to tackle."
"It is important, therefore, that we discuss the Western Balkans and try to improve our policies in that region."
"One of the issues raised by several speakers in this debate was enlargement fatigue and I think this is a very serious challenge."
"We must bring the peoples of the European Union along with us on our road to enlargement."
"Our next steps, therefore, must be gradual and carefully and prudently managed."
"It is also important to underline that enlargement is in itself a security policy."
"The legal and political reforms, as well as the economic development stimulated by the EU perspective, will reduce instability and conflict, for instance in the Western Balkans."
"We need to have a dialogue and explain this point to our citizens to ensure that the future of the Western Balkans is not held hostage by unwarranted fears."
"I shall try to provide answers to two questions specifically raised here, the first concerning the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the second a question regarding the constitutional complexity of Serbia and Montenegro."
"As regards the name issue, the Commission supports the efforts of the United Nations for a mutually agreeable solution to the name issue between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"We hope that the recent proposals by the UN facilitator, Mr Nimetz, will contribute to this objective."
"A solution to this bilateral issue would clearly contribute to regional stability in the Western Balkans at a delicate moment."
"Concerning Serbia and Montenegro, the Commission has deliberately developed a twin-track approach in response to the complex structure of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro."
"This allows both republics and the State Union to make progress in their respective areas of competence."
"The State Union is mainly responsible for foreign policy and security issues, while the republics are responsible for most aspects of economic policy and trade relations."
"Thanks to this twin-track approach we have recently been able to sign the bilateral trade agreement in textiles with Serbia, which is important for investment and employment in that republic."
"We will report on the progress of Serbia and Montenegro through this approach in the Commission’s annual report on the stabilisation and association process this autumn."
"The constitutional framework should be respected but at the same time should not hinder the country’s progress on its European road, if it meets other conditions for pre-accession and later perhaps accession."
"Finally, one of the biggest challenges we face in refining our policies on the Western Balkans and bringing the countries closer to the European Union is the weakness of the states in this region."
"They are chiefly weak states."
"If the state cannot ensure that the basic daily needs of its population are met, it certainly cannot rise to European standards."
"It is as simple as that."
"We must, therefore, find better ways of building institutions in the region, such as the approach to building Member States rightly advocated by the report of the International Commission on the Balkans, which was published yesterday."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Samuelsen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Parliament, and I very much look forward to working with you for stability, progress and prosperity in the Western Balkans."
"I have received one motion for a resolution to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the aim of our annual report is to set out a proposal regarding the ways in which cooperation between the Council and Parliament, or between the Commission and Parliament, could be altered and improved. This is particularly important in view of the fact that we are currently in the first year of a new parliamentary term."
"We are well aware that the main responsibility for the foreign, security and defence policy rests with the executive. Parliament’s role in this respect is largely confined to the exercising of control, although its budgetary powers allow it to exert a certain amount of influence."
"Particularly as far as the latter are concerned, it would be useful if the Commission and the Council could avoid presenting Parliament with in the future, and involve it at an earlier stage of proceedings."
"It should not be the case that Parliament is only informed after the event; instead, it should be involved in the planning and development of strategies, in order to ensure that consideration is given to its wishes. This would then make matters simpler for all parties concerned, as we would already have identified an approach that would allow us to make good progress."
"This House believes that it is important for the same priorities to apply in foreign policy as have done to date."
"There is an old saying that war is the failure of politics, and it is true that war should always be a last resort."
"This is why we believe that it is essential to strengthen the preventive aspect of our foreign policy, and to ensure that our prevention and crisis management capabilities are greatly extended."
"This is the same line as that followed by the European Union as a whole, as prevention is clearly identified as an objective in the draft Constitution."
"We should make our position on this matter quite clear, not only to gain public support, but also to develop strategic positions."
"This leads us to very practical considerations regarding the question of where our priorities should lie."
"The answer must be the Middle East conflict, as a result of which we are cooperating more closely with the Americans, the Russians and the UN within the Quartet. The aim of this cooperation is not only to provide support to the Palestinians and Israelis and to bring about peace, but also to gain better control over cover-up activities for terrorism in the broadest sense, which is in fact our second main priority."
"The solidarity provisions in the Constitutional Treaty relating to mutual assistance are also of major importance in this respect, and we must ask ourselves how the European Union can use a combination of new instruments to respond to external and internal security threats, and how we can make further progress in this field."
"We must ensure that priority is given to matters relating to the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, for example in Iran and North Korea, if we are to succeed in gaining any credibility at all where this issue is concerned."
"We must also ensure, however, that greater space is given to this instrument in the neighbourhood policy of the European Union, which is after all a security concept in itself, as it creates links between countries in order to ensure that they never wage war against each other again. At the same time, we must ensure that we move on from the traditional model of neighbourhood policy that we have pursued in recent years."
"The European Union’s capacity to act also depends on its borders, and so we must ensure that neighbouring countries, which we wish to have on our side and are important to us, and which we wish to help in developing and stabilising democracy, are offered an alternative to full membership, whether this be called a European Economic Area Plus or given another name."
"We must find a multilateral starting point of this kind in order to ensure that we can provide countries such as Ukraine with an answer now, and not in 15 or 20 years’ time, when they ask us how they can improve."
"We hope that the Council and the Commission will be more imaginative in this respect, and not rely on tried and tested political methods, as they frequently have in the past."
"The Commissioner is in fact adopting a new approach by seeking to find such a starting point."
"There are two final issues I should like to touch upon."
"I am delighted that the vast majority of Members are in favour of upholding the arms embargo against China until the country improves its human rights record and stops adopting laws that legitimise war."
"We must reach an agreement on this issue before transatlantic relations are put at risk."
"Multilateral approaches, as adopted in our relations with the United States, should be complemented by a partnership that follows clearly defined objectives and is aimed at setting up a transatlantic marketplace by 2015."
"I should like to make it quite clear to those Members who tabled amendments that I support the proposals by various groups to call for the European Union to be given a seat in the Security Council, and I say so speaking particularly as a German."
". Mr President, I should like to start by considering two different scenarios."
"When we discussed this issue in committee, Mr Ilves asked what would happen if another terrorist attack on the same scale as the Madrid bombings were to take place in an EU Member State, and if, in the aftermath of such an attack, it were to emerge that the security services in another Member State had been aware that preparations were underway for the attack, but had been unable to inform the authorities in the country in question."
"In all likelihood, this would trigger a real crisis of legitimacy for the European Union."
"I will now move on to my second example. The European Union has taken command of the NATO-led troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This is the first time that the European Union has had an opportunity to prove that it is capable of conducting security policy in this area, and to gain practical experience in such matters."
"I know from talking to my constituents that many people believe that the EU would be delivered from evil, as it were, if it kept its involvement in other people’s business to a minimum."
"This kind of attitude can turn out to be fatally flawed, and the European Union does in fact need a security strategy."
"It is for this reason that the vast majority of committee members welcomed the document which was drafted by Javier Solana during his term in office, and which the committee has continued to work on. We also welcomed the support shown by the governments of the Member States for the document."
"There are, however, a number of issues that must be given particular consideration, as they reveal the unique nature of the European Security Strategy."
"The first of these is the need to understand security problems and their many and diverse possible causes, which include human rights violations, poverty and disease, in a broad context, and not to reduce the Strategy to its military aspects."
"The Security Strategy is primarily a political concept, and as such transcends military considerations."
"The second issue is the need for a commitment to international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
"The third issue relates to the need to strengthen international order by means of effective multilateral structures and to safeguard citizens’ fundamental rights within the EU, whilst taking all measures necessary to combat terrorist threats."
"In view of these factors, we should not be ashamed to say that the European Union does indeed wish to acquire military decision-making structures and capabilities."
"The greatest benefit of the Security Strategy is that it enables us to tailor the combination of civilian and military crisis management capabilities to each individual situation."
"Opposition to this approach came from two deeply opposed camps within the committee; on the one hand, some members find it impossible to envisage the European Union as anything other than a subsidiary of NATO, whereas on the other hand some members condemn militarisation in the shape of new organisational forms and capacities."
"Both of these camps represent polar opposites, yet what they have in common is that they use their arguments to oppose and campaign against the European Constitution."
"In spite of this opposition, however, a broad consensus was reached within the committee in favour of the Security Strategy, which involves the establishment of various instruments such as a situation centre, a civilian/military planning cell and the setting up of battle groups or the Defence Agency."
"These are not alternatives to NATO, and indeed most EU Member States are also NATO Member States. Instead, they provide the European Union with new options it has not had in the past."
"This is the only way it can become an equal partner, for example of countries on the other side of the Atlantic like the United States."
"A great deal remains to be done, however; for example, we still have no coherent plan of how civilian crisis management forces should be organised."
"There is a lack of permanent air transport capacity and of permanently available deployable troops, as well as of adequate communications and reconnaissance capacities."
"The aim of this report is to ensure that the European Parliament – also in view of what Mr Brok said in his introductory speech – can exert an influence on the future development and practical implementation of the European Security Strategy within the framework of dialogue with the Council."
". Mr President, first of all I should like to thank, and also congratulate, Parliament, and especially the two rapporteurs, for the work they have accomplished, and for the ambitious but also realistic approach which they have developed in these two reports."
"Somewhere you quote two figures, the 60% and 70% of support which, according to public opinion, is given to the development of a common foreign and security policy."
"This is probably one of the areas which receive the highest level of support, according to public opinion."
"You are the representatives of the European citizens, and that means that this policy can only be developed together with the citizens, which also means together with your support, in the dialogue, as the rapporteur Mr Kuhne has just said."
"The European Council adopted the European Security Strategy on 11 December 2003."
"The fifteen months which have passed since then obviously do not allow us to draw up a complete and exhaustive report on its implementation, but they do at least enable us to evaluate the impact which the strategy has already had, and to discuss the path we need to follow in its future application."
"The year 2004 was a crucial year for the political development of the Union, whose ambitions and responsibilities in the world have been increasing."
"The citizens of the Union, like their international partners, have also been demanding a stronger presence for Europe on the international scene."
"The Union has responded to this appeal by trying to pursue a more active, more consistent and more effective foreign policy based, in particular, on the principles of the United Nations Charter."
"The European Union is a player on the world stage, and it is based on political, economic and other achievements."
"The fact that the ‘European model’ that we talk about so much in the context of the European Constitution is highly thought of throughout the world is something that gives us cause for satisfaction, but it should also be, for us Europeans, a strong motive force encouraging us to do more."
"The European Security Strategy to some extent sets out the broad guidelines for the day-to-day running of our common foreign and security policy."
"It defines the challenges and threats which we have to face, as well as the tools that we need to use to tackle the problems."
"Reference has been made to the war on terrorism."
"This is certainly one of the crucial problems."
"We have put in place a certain number of mechanisms, and more intensive cooperation between Europol and Eurojust."
"Therefore the war on terrorism is a good illustration of the fact that the concept of security does not consist solely of a foreign-policy dimension, a military dimension, but that it goes much further than that."
"There is also a development dimension, and a dimension of defending and promoting human rights."
"There is also, of course, a dimension which is concerned with solving major conflicts, in particular the conflict in the Middle East, not forgetting a presence in the regions which we spoke about earlier, in particular Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the Western Balkans."
"Taking into account the principal threats identified in this strategy, in December 2003 the European Council adopted an EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and this constitutes a supplementary measure."
"This is also an area in which Europe has shown that it knows how to act, particularly in relation to Iran."
"I believe that in doing this we have achieved an important milestone in the quest to find political solutions to questions which are extremely sensitive and at the same time extremely dangerous to international peace."
"The European Security Strategy is based on the idea that most problems can only be solved in a multilateral context."
"On this point too we agree with the two rapporteurs."
"The European Union clearly needs to pursue its objectives in this multilateral context, in partnership with all those involved, in particular with the United Nations."
"Consequently, it is in the European Union’s own interests to see the UN, the multilateral system, strengthened."
"We must support the Secretary-General’s efforts to modernise the UN system and to make it more effective."
"The reform of the United Nations is actually a very important aspect of the European Union’s security policy and a very important aspect of its foreign policy."
"I congratulate Mr Brok on what he has said on this subject, especially in connection with one particular point."
"I shall just mention briefly the importance of the transatlantic partnership, since it is only a few weeks ago that we held a debate on that subject here in Parliament."
"This partnership has also been relaunched, in particular since the visit of President Bush to Brussels, and we must ensure that this relaunching is followed up."
"We have many interests in common – I would go so far as to say an enormous number of interests."
"We have an enormous number of opportunities for greater cooperation, but on an equal footing."
"We, together with the Americans, can find solutions to major problems, in particular, as has already been mentioned, to one priority problem, namely the conflict in the Middle East."
"The European Union is also busy developing its economic, political and cultural cooperation with its traditional principal partners such as the United States and Canada, but also with partners such as Russia and Japan."
"I believe that cooperation with Russia, despite the problems, is important to the European Union and to stability and peace in our continent."
"Having said that, I should also mention that there are also new players on the world scene, such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa."
"There are also regional bodies, such as the African Union, with which we held talks a few days ago with a view, as the Commission has said, to strengthening our policy towards Africa, the objective being to promote peace and development – two things which are closely connected – on that continent, which is particularly close to the European Union"
"The strategy also serves to further our relationship with other neighbours to the East and South."
"We have just held a debate on the Balkans."
"The Euro-Mediterranean partnership and European policy on neighbouring regions are of fundamental importance in promoting stability in the countries concerned, but they are also in our own interests, both economic and political."
"I remember precisely what was said."
"It is not enough to close our eyes in the hope of avoiding contamination by the problems."
"The problems of these countries very quickly become our problems, either through uncontrolled, illegal immigration or through terrorism or the threat of terrorism."
"The importance of human rights from the security point of view also lies at the heart of solving the conflicts, and this aspect has been particularly emphasised by the latest report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"Without respect for human rights there can be neither development nor peace."
"It was in this spirit that the High Representative recently appointed a personal representative for human rights, with the aim of improving the consistency and effectiveness of our policy in this area within the CFSP."
"As far as the more military aspect is concerned, the strategy suggests that the European Union needs to be more operational in the various areas where it has to play a role."
"We must provide solutions to the conflicts."
"We must act, and we must play a more active role in maintaining and restoring peace."
"We must ensure better consistency between the civil and the military aspects."
"We must, first of all, have an approach which is based on the prevention of conflicts."
"In this context, it is important that 7 000 European soldiers are currently deployed, under the flag of the European Union, with the task of safeguarding peace and encouraging the pursuit of reforms and of reconciliation."
"We have discussed, in particular, the subject of the Balkans, but the European Union has also accepted responsibility for major operations elsewhere, for example in the Southern Caucasus, in Africa and in Afghanistan."
"Significant progress has been made in the area of military capacities."
"The first of the thirteen tactical units has been created as part of the European Rapid Reaction Force."
"The European Union has also set up the European Defence Agency in order to rationalise the costs linked to defence purchases and in order to increase the quality and the quantity of the military capacities at the disposal of European States."
"Cooperation between civilian and military circles has been raised to a higher operational level, in particular by the creation of a civil-military cell."
"All these measures should enable the Union to increase its crisis-management capacities so as to be able to deal successfully with the complex security crises of the 21st century."
"Cooperation with NATO has been highlighted in particular."
"I believe that we need to think about developing the ‘Berlin plus’ provisions in a spirit of partnership rather than a spirit of submission."
"I think that, in this respect too, the role of the European Union is very important."
"Thus the European foreign and security policy has strengthened its consistency and its operational capacities, but we cannot afford to relax our efforts."
"We need institutional back-up, clear commitments, particularly as regards solidarity in the face of potential threats, and greater visibility of the European Union on the international scene."
"In this respect I think that the future Constitution, once again, will lead to considerable progress in the development of the CFSP and of our policy on external security."
"The creation of an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs is a major innovation which will allow greater coherence in the Union’s external relations."
"The fact that the Minister in question will chair the External Relations Council will provide the coherence which we are all so anxious to ensure, and it will also give us greater visibility and at the same time better continuity."
"Another important aspect which I should just like to mention – and I know it is something close to the heart of Mr Brok among others – is the creation of the European External Action Service, the practical details of which are still under discussion."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is paying close attention to the progress achieved in setting up this European External Action Service, and to the views of the European Parliament on this subject."
"We do not want the creation of this service to dismantle surreptitiously certain Community mechanisms by giving preference to intergovernmental mechanisms."
"This service was designed to signal major progress in the conduct and implementation of the Union’s foreign policy, in particular in the form of greater effectiveness, greater coherence, an increased presence of the European Union, and the better use of all the resources available."
"We want the institutional rules and respective powers to be observed."
"The national diplomatic services must become more widely involved."
"We must make them, as it were, more European, but without producing a sort of renationalisation or intergovernmentalisation of what currently operates in accordance with Community rules."
"That is the broad outline of what we are defending in creating this service."
"I should like to say a final word about the information aspect."
"I believe that the current Presidency, like previous presidencies, wants to have an exchange of views with the European Parliament about the major options and important dates in relation to foreign policy."
"We want to have this dialogue, and it is important, as I said at the beginning of this speech."
"On behalf of this Presidency, I can give an undertaking that efforts will continue in this direction and that there will be the contacts and the meetings which you want to see happen in order to achieve precisely this kind of coherent common foreign and security policy, which will have the real support of all the people involved and all the institutions of the Union."
". Mr President, honourable Members and rapporteurs, let me start by thanking you most warmly for your weighty and even-handed reports, most of which leave little to be desired where clarity is concerned."
"I would like to pick up three specific things that enhance Europe’s global role."
"One of them is effective multilateralism."
"I see this as being beyond doubt the right response to our being ever more closely connected internationally."
"This year, 2005, will be decisive in terms of reform and the reinforcement of multilateralism, of international law, and, in particular, of the United Nations."
"The UN Summit in September will take the latest report by its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, as a basis for essential decision-making in this area."
"I believe it to be essential that Europe should make a contribution to this debate on reform."
"This is an area in which it has a leadership role, one that it must actually play."
"It is for that reason that the Commission is currently engaged in producing detailed proposals on the issues to which I have referred."
"As you will be aware, I am currently pressing for the EU to have a seat on the UN Security Council."
"The details of how this will work out are a matter for discussion, but what matters is that the EU should, in important international bodies, carry the weight that is rightly its due."
"As Mr Schmit has just said, multilateralism can be effective only if it is founded upon a strong transatlantic partnership."
"Effective solutions to the world’s problems can be found only if the United States of America and Europe are really singing from the same hymn sheet."
"President Bush’s visit to Brussels clearly showed that the United States of America is very much aware of the ever-expanding and ever more important role of the EU."
"It is with this ever-broader agenda that our common structures must be able to cope, while at the same time remaining flexible."
"The Commission is currently examining whether, and if so to what extent, our institutions need to amend the New Transatlantic Agenda."
"What emerges from our deliberations will then form a contribution to the EU-US Summit in June."
"I believe – as do others, both individuals and groups, in this House – that closer relations between it and the US Congress are essential in this regard."
"The reports rightly reflect the fact that Europe’s foreign policy is already underpinned by a comprehensive concept of security."
"I believe that guaranteeing Europe’s security is not just about defence policy or military operations; today, above all, it has to do with conflict prevention, with civilian crisis management and common policies on trade, the economy, energy, justice, health and the environment."
"The European Security Strategy already takes account of these complex potential threats."
"The Commission is making an important contribution, not least to its implementation, in our day-to-day close relations with third countries and, most recently, also through various communications, not only on such issues as anti-terrorism and improved civil protection, but also in terms of the reform of development policy, concerning which we, in the Commission, put out important communications yesterday."
"I believe that the broader concept of security must, ultimately, focus on the safety of people, which has been a constant theme in my own work."
"Behind structural security risks, there are often offences against the freedom and dignity of individuals."
"To sum up, the actions referred to in the Security Strategy in respect of such things as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or defences against terrorism, the ways in which we deal with failed states and regional conflicts can be successful only if they form part of a wider policy of conflict prevention and conflict resolution."
"One example of this is Afghanistan, and we hope that Iraq will one day be an example of how such an approach can bear fruit."
"This is where the EU’s unique collection of instruments puts it at a comparative advantage, but, if we are to work efficiently, we need to deploy them all – civil, military and sectoral – in a coherent way."
"We have to make long-term plans for crisis regions, targeting and deploying as an integral whole our Community instruments – not only overseas aid, but also the prospect of closer relations with the EU."
"In addition to that, there is the help we give with nuclear non-proliferation, in the shape, for example, of the enormous amount of aid the EU has given for nuclear safety and non-proliferation since the beginning of the 1990s, not to mention our commitment to fighting terrorism, the spread of small arms and landmines, and drugs."
"I mentioned earlier another key instrument for implementing the European Security Strategy, by which I mean, of course, our development policy."
"Here we are again trying to move forward, not least with the UN’s Millennium Goals in mind, for it is here too – as I said earlier – that we Europeans must set the pace."
"Let me now also draw your attention to the Commission’s forthcoming proposals for reform of European crisis management and civilian protection, which we will be presenting next week in a communication to the Council and to your House, the details of which you will of course have an opportunity to debate."
"I will also take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its support for the European Security Research Programme, on which the Commission is working very closely with the European Defence Agency."
"I also want to stress that I attach importance to Parliament’s proposal for a regular debate on the Security Strategy, which would also involve the parliaments of the Member States."
"We are right to cite democracy and the rule of law as essential values underpinning Europe, and hence also as integral parts of our foreign policy."
"The European Union can, however, be strong on the international stage only if its actions really are coherent, and so, if it is to face up to the new challenges, it needs more than just the common foreign and security policy in the strict sense of the term."
"The common foreign and security policy is one among several instruments that the EU possesses in the foreign policy sphere and complements our other policies."
"The success of this broad-based approach is, I believe, demonstrated by the concept of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which illustrates one of my own particular priorities; the export of security, stability and prosperity to our neighbours and facilitation of structural reforms, all of which clearly has a security policy dimension to it."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy parallels exactly our European development policy in being a long-term and intelligent security policy in the regional context."
"We have already made a start on implementing this."
"It is being used to gradually deepen our relationships with our partner states, above all through the detailed joint action plans, which give them clear prospects for drawing closer to Europe."
"Parliament’s forthright support for the neighbourhood policy was very important to me, and it still is."
"I therefore look forward with interest to Mr Laschet’s report."
"One can – and I will – describe the European Neighbourhood Policy as our security policy on a regional scale."
"It helps to promote stability and reform in regions with a crucial geopolitical impact through their long-term association with Europe and through specific joint activities, such as anti-terrorist cooperation."
"This makes it an essential instrument in implementing the European Security Strategy."
"We have already concluded detailed and ambitious plans of action with seven partner countries, of which Ukraine is one, and five more are in the pipeline."
"One of the last things I would like to say is that the reports also put a great deal of emphasis on the need for institutional reforms."
"This is something that our new Constitutional Treaty will renew in fundamental and positive ways, and these the Commission very much endorses."
"I am therefore very interested in your detailed proposals and will take note of them."
"We have for some time been making preparations for the Treaty’s implementation, in order that it may become operational at once following what we hope will be its successful ratification."
"This will be accomplished not least through the establishment of a Joint Foreign Service, concerning which very profound discussions are going on between the Council and the Commission."
"These reforms really are important."
"Even more effective collaboration between the EU institutions is indispensable."
"Mr Kuhne’s report rightly highlights the obvious need for the EU, as an actor on the global stage, to be endowed with the financial resources it needs."
"For that reason, I, too, am confident that we will soon be able to come to an agreement on the reform of our foreign aid instruments that the Commission has proposed."
"At the same time, though, it is also clear that institutional reform and improved finances can be no substitute for the political will that we need."
"It follows that Europe needs even more to think of itself as a global player."
"As the forum for a broad, transparent and democratic debate, your House plays a crucial role in articulating that political will."
". – Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the Kuhne report, I should like to take this opportunity to offer Mr Kuhne my warmest congratulations on the exceptionally difficult process which he has been through in order to be able to find a compromise between so many opinions in such a strong and excellent report."
"I wish to touch on four points: security policy, in its present form, quite rightly focuses not on military means, but on all the other means which the European Union can use in order to promote the fight against all the causes of insecurity in Europe."
"One of these is terrorism, but it is not the only one."
"We have to be very careful, when preparing such a strategy, not to get carried away with the danger of the day and ignore so many others."
"Within this framework, it is very important, when we act abroad, that we act with respect for human rights."
"Guantanamo-type phenomena cannot be tolerated by the European Union."
"I emphasise this, because even the United States did not imagine a few years ago that it would be able to tolerate them, but we can see what is happening."
"I would prefer that we start applying the brakes now, rather than deal with this later, when we are not ready."
"My second point is that, as Europeans, we need to promote democracy."
"Both the rapporteurs and the Commission quite rightly emphasised that the way in which democracy is promoted in Europe is very different from the way in which it is promoted by other major powers on Earth."
"Let us keep it that way, with the UN always with us."
"We cannot act outside its framework."
"My third point is that Parliament must be kept informed of and must debate questions of foreign policy."
"It cannot keep being ignored in procedures which touch on fundamental rights, such as, for example, the famous PNR, the information given to the United States allegedly in order to fight terrorism. Parliament has instituted proceedings against the Commission on this and will, I hope, win its case."
"My fourth and final point concerns the famous SITCEN, which is an important service."
"My committee does not know exactly how it acts, what the boundaries on its action are or how it collects information, but information and the collection of information and personal data are equally sensitive as far as this Parliament is concerned, irrespective of whether they are collected by SITCEN or by anyone else."
"The question of the principle of availability of information and its exchange are being discussed in my committee at this very moment."
"It has not reached a decision and I thank and congratulate Mr Kuhne for the importance which he attaches in his report to cooperation between our committees."
"The need to combat terrorism does not sanctify any means."
"We need to take serious account of this in this Chamber and in this Parliament."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Kuhne most warmly for his wide-ranging report."
"I believe it to be of the utmost importance that Parliament’s line on this Security Strategy is supported by four major political families in this House – the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Liberals and the group to which I belong, thereby putting us on a footing unheard of 10 years ago."
"The report discusses the Security Strategy devised by Javier Solana, and this House shares his view of the threats."
"The three major ones are, without a doubt, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and conflicts among our neighbours with direct effects on the European Union as a result of floods of refugees having a direct impact on the public in it."
"What is absent from his analysis, in my view and that of many others, is homeland security, which is normally at the heart of all defence policy."
"If we consider the attention given to homeland security in the United States in comparison to how little we hear about it here in the European Union, then I think there is a deficit here that must be made good."
"There is also, I believe, a need to add to the conclusions drawn as to what must be done."
"As the conclusion put forward in this report cannot be turned into practical actions, I believe it important that the next thing we need is a White Paper on European security and defence policy containing perfectly clear specifications of substance and timescale – rather clearer than what we have been given to date."
"It is important that the crisis intervention force, which was very much virtual in nature when it was decided on in 1999, has today become active in reality: in Macedonia, in the Congo and now in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"I was there on a visit with the defence sub-committee when, for the first time, a British general, bearing on his sleeve the European emblem with its stars, introduced himself to me as a European soldier, I realised that something had happened here that would reverberate throughout history; you, Mr Schmit, may mention ‘European troops’ or the ‘forces of the European Union’, only in passing, but there is no doubt that this is a development with historic significance."
"It is in Macedonia that the general approach of relying on more than merely military action to deal with a crisis is proving itself; the European Union’s strength lies in the civilian aspect of peacekeeping, where we are doing more than the United States."
"It is a good concept."
"On the other hand – as we have seen in the sudden emergence of unrest in Kosovo – it is vitally important that we should not lose sight of the fact that our troops must remain capable of intervening and also of taking robust action if it is necessary to protect minorities."
"These are two of the tasks that our troops have to cope with there, and they are equally important and difficult."
"Among the things we learned from our visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina was that the combat troops that are currently being mustered, some of whom – we hope – will be capable, as soon as possible, of short-term intervention and deployment, need the best equipment."
"What they are being called upon to undertake there are peacekeeping missions, but, should they need to carry out peacemaking missions or combat operations, the very diverse equipment that our troops there have will prove very much a disadvantage."
"We demand that what are being termed the European battle groups, which are currently being assembled, should be equipped as uniformly as possible, that they should be the first to get the latest equipment and should get it without delay, and that this be made a matter of priority."
"As we were also told when we were there, there is also a need for helicopters if large areas are to be secured, and also for additional mine-proof vehicles."
"We were told that it would take until 2010 for Bosnia-Herzegovina to become free of mines, so mine clearance is proceeding too slowly, and this needs to be made an additional financial priority for our work."
". We are today discussing the report on the external performance of the European Union in 2003."
"I am especially pleased that the rapporteur, Mr Brok, has stressed that the involvement of the European Parliament should not be limited to a discussion after the event."
"I am therefore taking the liberty of considering in particular some matters that have been on the agenda in the past year and of taking a look at the future."
"The development of the European security strategy, which is also up for discussion here, will have an important part to play in this."
"The Kuhne report – and I commend the rapporteur – gives an excellent evaluation of the concrete impact of this security strategy to date."
"I would like to ask the Commission but also the Council and of course the High Representative to take these recommendations very seriously."
"There are two points I would like to highlight."
"Firstly, there is the military dimension."
"Europe can only play a central role if we are also willing and able, if necessary, to take military action."
"The prevention of conflict escalation to the point where military intervention is necessary is and remains the prime concern, while when it comes to the actual use of military means the emphasis must continue to be placed on interaction with other tools: humanitarian intervention, the guaranteeing of legal order, the institutional structure, democratisation and economic development."
"In the first major European military mission, the Althea mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, an abundance of experience is currently being acquired with such a combination of civil and military capacity."
"Apart from a material side, the development of the European defence arm also and in particular has a political side."
"The European Union must develop a political framework that allows us to use military means where this is considered necessary."
"My second point is about the interfaces between internal and external security, which come very much to the fore in the struggle against terrorism in particular."
"The connection between them is insufficiently developed in European policy at the moment."
"The Council has rightly asked the High Representative to bring forward proposals in this area and I urge him to involve Parliament in this."
"Attention to this is sought in the Brok report but also in the Kuhne report."
"The implementation of the common foreign and security policy is not unfortunately always as common as I would like."
"Nevertheless, my evaluation of the past few years is not all that negative."
"The European Union has played an important part in the revolution in Ukraine."
"The prompt reaction of the Presidency and the good coordination between Parliament and Council, and the action of the High Representative and the Heads of State of Poland and Lithuania made a significant contribution to the positive outcome of that political crisis."
"The efforts of France, Germany and the United Kingdom within the EU in the conflict involving the Iranian nuclear programme has in my view so far been a good example of how things can be tackled in a European way."
"The outcome is uncertain but the diplomatic approach, the model that is being used in this process, is very important in our view."
"The basic principles of European common foreign and security policy, multilateralism, preventive involvement, a broad approach in which democracy and social and economic development take centre stage, conflict resolution and a halt to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have our full support in the rank and file."
"We cannot emphasise enough, though, that collectiveness is a condition, because only by acting collectively can Europe bring its political weight to bear."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Kuhne on his report, which has turned out to be really outstanding."
"I also want to say how very grateful I am to him for his constant and frank cooperation, the result of which has been broad support from the relevant groups in this House."
"The European Security Strategy is the timetable for European foreign policy for the coming years and decades, albeit one containing very many questions as well as good answers."
"A common foreign and security policy worthy of the name may well be a European goal, but it is not yet a European reality."
"What this report spells out is that Parliament supports the Council and the Commission in their efforts to overcome the self-seeking attitudes that the nation states still have in this area."
"At the heart of the report is the statement that the traditional concepts of security no longer hold water."
"What do we mean by internal or external security?"
"Which crises can we effectively prevent by civil means?"
"At what stage in a conflict we have been unable to prevent are we obliged to deal with it by military means, as opposed to the civil means we had used previously?"
"When, following the end of a conflict, can we again consider going back whence we came without jeopardising people’s safety, and what instruments do we need to that end?"
"Such are the questions that we Europeans must answer; this report does so, whenever it is able to, by reference to the great significance of civil and military cooperation."
"That is why we endorse this report and will be voting in favour of it."
"In deliberating all these questions, it is clear to us in the Liberal Group that the principles of the UN Charter remain the central benchmark."
"That is why it is so absurd for the Communists to make assertions about the alleged militarisation of the EU."
"Having had so much experience of military build-up, though, they surely ought to know what they are talking about."
"This report is an intermediate step; it spells out the fact that, at the beginning of the third millennium, we have to develop not only the instruments of our foreign policy, but also the thinking underlying it."
"It is precisely for that reason that I am glad that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have been mandated to join together in thinking about how, at a time when terrorism is being fought, the protection of citizens’ rights can be ensured and, where necessary, improved."
"If we are to defend our values, we must also treat them with respect."
"I might add that I believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to which I belong, I would like to give a warm welcome to both these reports and, above all, to express my gratitude for the constructive cooperation."
"There is one item in the Council’s Common Position that I would like to highlight."
"Mr Brok’s report is most emphatic in demanding active cooperation with Parliament."
"It will not be enough for us to be merely informed, and that after the event."
"I say that in advance of the debate on the Constitution."
"The European Security Strategy is not a matter of statistics."
"As threats change, we will be required, again and again, to ascertain where there are deficits – as there are today in the civil sector – or where we need to change direction, but we will be able to get it across to people that European security policy is credible, and communicate to them the positive aspects of it that the Constitution will strengthen, only if you work together with Parliament."
"If Parliament opposes you, you will not manage it."
"I can tell you that there are substantial indications that we are on the right road, such as the attempt by three European states to join with Iran in finding a peaceful solution to the proliferation issue, and the endeavour to reinforce the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, for it is on these things that our multilateral policy depends."
"The second of these indications – and one to which reference has already been made – is that international law is being applied."
"Those in this House who oppose the Constitution on the grounds of alleged militarisation are thereby ignoring the fact that it incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will therefore form part of Europe’s foreign and security policy; they are also negating all the progress we have made, throwing us back to Nice, throwing us back to the sort of renationalisation that we are currently seeing in Germany, which believes it will be given its own seat on the UN Security Council, or that it will, on its own, be able to get the China embargo lifted."
"That is not a common European security policy; it is a reversion to a policy that we, in our motions for resolution, criticise rather than endorse."
"We Europeans are stepping out in new directions by taking on civil and military responsibilities."
"The decisive moment will come, in the foreseeable future, in Kosovo."
"We will be able to make use of these instruments, which will ultimately help to reconcile societies to some degree and to stabilise Europe, only if we, along with our societies and the European public, carry on in the same direction towards the one peaceful and multilateral objective with the help of transatlantic cooperation, an objective that our people expect of us."
"You, who represent the Council, will have to pay attention to what this House says; without its support, the peoples of Europe will not be behind you either."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find the Kuhne report extremely worrying and dangerous, because it does not recognise the primacy of the United Nations and international law in European security and defence policy."
"The report places the UN on the same level as NATO and other organisations and institutions, clears the way for approval of the theory of preventive military intervention, which violates international law, and lumps military intervention together with humanitarian action, implicitly relegating humanitarian development aid to a functional role subordinated to military and security policies."
"It also claims that NATO and the European Union are complementary, ignoring the subordinate role of the European Union within NATO and the need to promote an independent and non-aggressive European foreign policy."
"Lastly, it fails to say that the application of international law and UN resolutions and the end of military occupations are the only conditions for a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East."
"EU support for non-proliferation should also include calling on Israel to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty."
". Mr President, this report clearly shows where the European Union is heading."
"It calls for the common foreign security and defence policies contained in the European Constitution to be initiated without waiting for the inconvenient and unpredictable matter of its ratification by the Member States."
"The report contains the telling line that the fight against terrorism blurs the traditional distinction between foreign and domestic policy."
"This is another example of how any argument will be used in order to promote European integration in any and all spheres of policy."
"The threat from terrorism makes national borders and national interests all the more vital, not less so."
"This report is another step in the process of the European Union attempting to further its foreign policy and military ambitions in order eventually to rival the United States of America on the world stage."
"Meanwhile, all talk of an ethical foreign policy is put into perspective by the European Council’s intention to lift the embargo on arms sales to China, which Mr Brok rightly criticises and which is driven by the requirements of the French arms industry."
"Parliament’s opposition to the lifting of the arms embargo on China will, of course, be ignored by the Council, demonstrating once again the irrelevance of this Parliament."
"Britain should regain control of its own foreign, security and defence policies."
"The only way to do that is through the UK Independence Party’s policy of unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of myself and the Europe of the Nations Group I would like to express our recognition to the honourable Member Mr Kuhne for his well-executed report on the European Security Strategy."
"This includes the extension of the concept of security in line with the current situation, offers a reasonable opinion concerning current events in the field of European security, and points out deficiencies."
"I will deal with just one aspect."
"I think that in his report Mr Kuhne has demonstrated in a wholly justified fashion to the European Parliament the need to promote participation in implementing the European Security Strategy."
"Fulfilling this objective is a comparatively complex task for European Members of Parliament, and, of course, also for the European institutions."
"We must, however, admit that we do not have the requisite security of information and specialist back-up within the European Parliament to be able to discuss thoroughly and with a solid grounding the activities of the relevant Directorate-General within the Commission and of the Council in implementing the European Security Strategy, not to mention the possibility of more or less understanding measures taken by national governments, with their mutually reciprocal actions, in implementing security and defence measures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge that that is a serious problem."
"In fact, there are various problems relating to aspects of joint security in the European Union."
"At the basis of them are shortages of a financial nature, as well as of the development of military capabilities, a lack of security of information and deficiencies of other kinds."
"During the past months, during which I have been a European Member of Parliament for the first time, I have had the opportunity to gradually understand how security policy in Europe is formed, and who the most important players are."
"Therefore it seems to me that I am fully justified in saying that the report is of a sufficiently high quality."
"Since 70% of European Union citizens support the need for a single European defence policy, we should agree that monitoring the implementation of the European Security Strategy ought to be one of the priorities for the widening of the scope of the European Parliament’s activities."
"The threats of the 21st century – trans-national terrorism, the unlawful proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts and Islamic fundamentalism – impose a duty on everyone to understand our global challenges, and the European Parliament must play an active part in preventing them."
"Mr President, the common foreign and security policy covers a great many primary and secondary aspects and it is of course impossible to be exhaustive in this short space of time."
"Two points nonetheless."
"First and foremost I would like to point to a gap in the list of priorities and that is the support for Europeans or people of European origin in other parts of the world."
"Above all I am talking about southern Africa, not just South Africa itself but also Zimbabwe."
"It is high time that the European Union started to take strong measures to bring an end to the attacks on farms and the systematic expropriations of farms run by Europeans."
"Such action would for that matter be in the interest of the whole population there."
"I refer for example to Zimbabwe, the country that used to be known as the granary of Africa and that is now ravaged by starvation, in part and in the main because of the mismanagement of dictator Mugabe."
"Another problem that deserves more attention is nuclear disarmament."
"The report places the emphasis on compliance with the non-proliferation treaty, but overlooks the colossal security risk posed by poorly guarded or semi-abandoned nuclear facilities in former Soviet states and a number of other countries, and the misuse that can be made of them by terror organisations such as Al-Qaida."
"We must as the European Union sit down urgently with the countries and international organisations concerned and ensure that the necessary resources are released to defuse this ticking time bomb."
"Mr President, this House feels very strongly that significant progress was made last year regarding the European Security and Defence Policy, and that it was therefore possible to break the impasse following the Iraq conflict."
"We welcome the establishment of the European Defence Agency and believe it will play an important role with regard to the supply of new equipment."
"We also welcome the inclusion in the Constitutional Treaty of provisions creating a future for the ESDP, in particular on the subject of structural cooperation, that is, the solidarity clause."
"Another very significant development was the Commission’s announcement of the European Programme for Security Research that will be operating with a budget of at least EUR 1 billion as of 2007."
"Finally, probably the most important event of last year was taking the stabilisation mission in Bosnia over from NATO."
"This is actually the European Union’s first major military operation."
"In this context, we also feel very strongly that the four questions raised over six years ago, when the notion of a European Security and Defence Policy was first floated in Cologne, remain relevant."
"Firstly, what action is required to ensure that our defence capabilities are in line with our aspirations and challenges, the challenges that have now been enshrined in the European Security Policy?"
"Secondly, how can the cohesion of the European Security and Defence Policy be assured?"
"Thirdly, how can the ESDP be developed without detriment to the defence commitments of the majority of Member States that are also members of NATO?"
"Fourthly, how can financial resources be managed wisely at both national and Community level?"
"These questions are addressed primarily to the Commission and the Council, because Parliament, the Commission and the Council will have to work together to come up with the answers."
"If we fail to do so, the ESDP will be simply a paper policy, and we shall be powerless."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join many of my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteurs for two important reports that present a thorough overview of Europe’s foreign, security and defence policy and the progress made, and propose highly convincing guidelines for Europe to have an effective presence as a global actor on the world stage."
"The Constitutional Treaty may strengthen Europe’s role with innovations that will ensure closer integration and cooperation, and right now I believe it is fair to bring forward – as they say – a collaboration between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Europe’s central objective is to promote effective multilateralism, which means ensuring security and also the expansion of democracy, human rights and opportunities for development and growth."
"In short, it means controlling globalisation by prioritising political, civil and economic methods but not ruling out military methods as a last resort, and consequently keeping open the option to use force in legitimate circumstances."
"In order to have legitimacy, however, the authority of the United Nations system needs to be restored, as the Brok report quite rightly points out."
"That authority has been shaken and weakened partly by the theory and practice of preventive and unilateral war."
"Europe has no choice but to condemn that theory and practice, and I believe the resumption of cooperation between Europe and the United States has to take this matter of principle into account."
"In this context, I believe there is great value in the demand made by many Members – and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner as well – that Europe should have a seat at the United Nations, as it would represent a quality leap in the relationship between the European Union and the United Nations."
"I should like to underline one priority in this picture, which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis in the Middle East."
"We have quite rightly pointed out the new opportunities and hopes."
"I should like to add a word of concern, however: the meeting between George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon itself revealed a fairly sharp disagreement over the Israeli policy of expanding the settlements, which in practice means the annexation of East Jerusalem and part of the West Bank."
"If this policy were to go ahead, any hopes for peace would soon be cast aside."
"If even the US Administration is now voicing its criticism, Europe needs to do so too, strongly and clearly, in order to prevent decisions that might jeopardise any hope of peace and ."
"First and most of all I would like to congratulate Mr Elmar Brok on his excellent report that provides a coherent, forward-looking and realistic view of common foreign and security policy."
"All too often we forget how young this policy actually still is."
"I can remember quite vividly that 20 years ago the words security, foreign policy and least of all defence policy were not even allowed to appear in European texts or in programmes of European political parties."
"Ten years ago there was an embryonic common foreign and security policy, but it was carefully wrapped up in a separate, almost exclusively intergovernmental pillar."
"Today we have our own separate vision and strategy – still in the making it is true – but whose originality cannot be denied."
"This originality is above all that we want to take responsibility for both the civil and the diplomatic and military aspects of such a policy."
"I would like to underline that the constitutional treaty contains a number of especially important demands in this area, which for that matter is also one of the main reasons why this constitutional treaty deserves to be ratified."
"In this annual report there are calls to involve the European Parliament and the national parliaments more closely in the preparation and implementation of common foreign and security policy and not to limit this involvement to discussions."
"The three-monthly exchange of views with the High Representative and with the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy in which representatives of the national parliaments will be able to take part offers an excellent opportunity for this."
"That is one aspect of the proposals that we are glad to support."
"Mr President, for the sake of avoiding excessive sameness, here comes a different position."
"The European Security Strategy states that ‘the first line of defence against new threats will often be abroad’."
"In no way does the Kuhne report dissent from this."
"The European Security Strategy is meant to be binding on all EU Member States."
"It is meant to commit EU military policy more and more to planning for pre-emptive warfare."
"The Kuhne report calls for even more rearmament in order to ensure that the EU, relying on NATO capacities, can intervene militarily across the globe."
"According to what we have heard, the EU is meant to become a global player, and primarily in military terms."
"It is for precisely this reason that my group has produced a minority opinion."
"On the one hand, it is asserted that there is no military build-up in the European Union; on the other, as we have heard, everything is being done to rearm, including drawing up plans for the EU to wage ‘regional wars to secure raw materials’."
"The EU’s Constitutional Treaty, which I hope the French will scupper, its Security Strategy and the ‘European Defence Paper’ stand for a Europe characterised by rearmament and the prospect of future wars."
"Take a serious look at these criticisms."
"Polemics have had their day."
"As you will see in France, they only trip you up."
"Mr President, one minute and thirty seconds is much more than I need, given that the vast subjects dealt with in this portmanteau report presuppose the existence of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a diplomatic service and a common foreign policy."
"Yet as far as the common foreign policy is concerned, we have only the vaguest of vague outlines, given that it was decreed in 1992 by Title Five of the Treaty of Maastricht."
"Moreover, there is no common policy and there cannot be a common policy, for the very good reason that there is no agreement between the principles, the traditions, and interests and, therefore, the policies of our different nations, starting, moreover, with the vital issue of our relations with the United States of America."
"As for this minimum condition, the creation of a common diplomatic instrument, it presupposes the adoption of the European Constitution."
"Well I am very sorry to have to tell you – though to most people it is no secret – that it is highly likely that this project will never see the light of day and that all your scaffolding, constructed as it is on the complete absence of popular legitimacy, will collapse of its own accord."
"I could, therefore, stop there and not exhaust my speaking time and your nerves, but I should not like to prevent you from dreaming, because your dreams are of great interest to the advocates of sovereignty who are currently campaigning in France and elsewhere."
"When, at our meeting, we tell French people that in Washington there is a person who is known by the pompous title of Ambassador of the European Union to the United States, they are highly amused."
"When we tell French people that the said Constitution will bring with it a so-called Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that the holder of that office will be, as if by chance, a former Secretary-General of NATO, then the French people are even more amused, or intrigued, or scandalised."
"By all means then, ladies and gentlemen, you Europhiles and Euromaniacs of all kinds, please carry on supplying us with such amusing arguments."
"Mr President, the Union’s common foreign and security policy may not be a virtual policy, as sceptics maintain, but it certainly looks far better on paper than it does in practice."
"If, like the authors of the draft resolution, we look to public opinion surveys for the will to implement this policy, its future seems distinctly uncertain."
"If the 60% of Union citizens that support the common foreign policy is in future reduced to 45%, and the 70% support for the common defence policy is reduced to say 47%, should we suddenly abandon this notion?"
"We should guard against relying on public opinion surveys."
"The House is divided on the issue of the degree of support for the idea of a common security policy and a common foreign policy."
"We need to face up to that fact."
"Nonetheless, we are all of one mind on a number of issues."
"The first is that Islamic terrorism is a real threat."
"The second is that military action cannot be the first course of action when it comes to dealing with certain problems."
"The third is that we must follow the joint EUFOR activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina carefully."
"True, the Union did previously undertake the Concordia mission in Macedonia, but that was relatively minor, as were the police activities we were involved in, for example in Bosnia-Herzegovina or, more recently, in Africa"
"Finally, we can speak with one voice when it comes to insisting that the Council complies with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union concerning consultation on the main foreign policy actions for the coming year."
"It is not a question of the Council deigning to provide the information."
"It is actually bound to do so."
"As a major international player, the European Union bears a global responsibility."
"In view of this fact, I should like to emphasise that the success of EU foreign policy depends upon our partnership with the United States."
"In spite of the differences that exist between us, the United States, of all the global players, is the closest to Europe, and it is not only common values that unite us."
"The partnership is a natural result of our common interest in achieving stability throughout the world, in strengthening the rule of law and democracy and in ensuring that global markets operate properly and that raw material resources throughout the world remain available."
"The North Atlantic Alliance continues to act as a fundamental guarantee of European and US security, yet the challenges we are currently facing are by no means only security-related."
"I would therefore like to call on the Commission and the Council at this point to present an action plan for a strategic partnership between the European Union and the United States, which would put our dialogue on a broad range of global issues on an institutional footing."
"The partnership would tackle matters ranging from the functioning of financial services to the stabilising of international order, as well as global agriculture, the fight against Aids, water availability, global climate change and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"One of its aims should be the establishment of an EU-US free trade area, which could potentially act as a driving force for the global economy."
"We learnt from President Bush’s visit in February that the Americans are aware of the need for a strong partner on the other side of the Atlantic."
"It is therefore my belief that the European Union should seize this opportunity to strengthen a partnership that could act as a key to world order and stability."
"– The European security strategy challenges us to consider the Union’s role in world governance, and the reports by Mr Kuhne and Mr Brok make excellent contributions towards addressing this challenge."
"If they are to be effective and coherent, Europe’s foreign security and defence policies must place the accent firmly on the citizens, promoting human rights, international and humanitarian law and multilateralism in international relations. In other words, they must be rooted in the concept of human security, as emphasised in the Kuhne report, in line with the Barcelona report on the Human Security Doctrine."
"The importance of this area is all the greater given that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism must continue to be at the forefront of Europe’s priorities in terms of security."
"We must incorporate these concerns into every aspect of external relations, in particular the new neighbourhood policy, and in this context the Union must have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, as has previously been said."
"The EU must also strive to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament treaties and to tighten controls on exports of nuclear material and arms in general."
"The Union must also ensure that its action plan to combat terrorism works closely in tandem with its foreign and security and defence policies, as part of the integrated global strategy for fighting terrorism recently announced by Kofi Annan."
"The development commitments made by the European governments in the Millennium Declaration must also be honoured."
"Poverty and injustice are fertile breeding grounds for terrorism."
"If we are to achieve a security and defence policy resulting in greater strategic independence for Europe, greater capacity and greater integration of defence resources, and a genuine internal market, the European Defence Agency must provide us, for our debates, with information on policies relating to the procurement, development and research of equipment."
"It is now up to the Member State governments to lay the groundwork for this new agency to work. The next financial perspectives must demonstrate that our governments are committed to the success of European security, which largely depends on the resources at its disposal in the Union."
"I shall conclude by relating that last week in Sarajevo, along with Mr Von Wogau and other Members of this House, I witnessed the proud British General in charge of EUFOR actually handing out national honours."
"I could not help thinking that, had there been a foreign policy and a European security and defence policy in place 15 years ago, Europe might have prevented the war in the former Yugoslavia or might have stopped it at an earlier stage."
"The important work of the Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina is proof that, with the appropriate resources, Europe can and must take on more responsibilities in European and worldwide security."
"– Mr President, both the reports being debated today clearly present the identity and the aggressive imperialist character of the European Union."
"They confirm the joint strategy of the European Union with the United States of America against peoples and countries which, apart from anything else, will be founded on the ferocious doctrine of preventive war, which is mentioned in the reports and clearly referred to in the Constitutional Treaty."
"They set as an immediate priority better preparation of the European Union for new strategic interventions, jointly with ΝΑΤΟ and the United States of America or independently."
"In the name of the security of the European Union, countries and areas for new interventions are being photographed, starting with the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle East and extending over almost the entire planet, on the pretext of strengthening the international order."
"The philosophy behind the common foreign policy and defence policy and the European security strategy is the European version of the imperialist doctrine of the United States of America on protecting US interests, in the name of which hundreds of interventions have taken place and have spread death and destruction to all the corners of the planet."
"We believe that the peoples are waking up."
"They will resist and they will not allow the implementation of this policy."
"We ultimately ask the following question: who is threatening whom?"
"The European Union has forces in a great many countries in the world."
"It participates in an endless network of bases, has participated in three wars and, moreover ..."
"Mr President, Commissioner, critical though I may be of individual aspects of Europe’s Constitutional Treaty, it does strike me as important that the common foreign and security policy be strengthened."
"If Europe is to assert itself as a power for global peace, it will need to speak to the outside world with a single voice, as well as possessing the capacity to get its way in matters of military and security policy."
"Although I believe that every tendency leading towards the development of a centralised European state must be energetically repudiated, I do think it is right that there should be a single EU foreign minister with extensive powers and responsibilities and a strong position within the EU."
"This leads me to welcome the development of a European Foreign Service."
"It is unacceptable, though, that such a foreign service for the European Union should be dominated and sustained only by the larger Member States of the EU."
"Smaller Member States, Austria among them, must be involved in the shaping of European foreign policy, just as the European Parliament must have equal rights with the Council in deciding what that policy should be."
"If the smaller Member States are to contribute in the same way as the larger ones to the common European defence policy and to the operation of the single European rapid reaction force, they must also be guaranteed the same right to be consulted."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there are two of Parliament’s statements in this report that I would like to revisit, and they have to do with the foreign and security policy situation in the Far East."
"It is my belief that the People’s Republic of China, by passing its Anti-Secession Law, has put the region in a much more precarious position."
"The Anti-Secession Law is something that we should firmly repudiate; by enacting it, the People’s Republic of China is attempting, without any justification, to legitimise its military threats against Taiwan and to acquire the right to attack it."
"This is in breach of international law, and completely unacceptable."
"Taiwan’s 23 million citizens have the inalienable right to take their own democratic decisions on their future: on whether they want to be reunited with the mainland or to continue as an independent and sovereign state."
"We should all be calling on the People’s Republic of China to stop making threatening gestures and instead begin direct dialogue with Taiwan on the basis of mutual recognition in order to bring about between the two countries and secure peace in the Far East."
"I am addressing the representatives of the Council when I say that, if this is to happen, the arms embargo on China must not be lifted."
"The European Council was right to impose it in 1989, and we can see that the position as regards human rights and the rights of minorities has indeed improved, although these are as yet far from adequate."
"This House has observed on many occasions that the situation in China as regards fundamental civil, cultural, religious and political rights does not even meet the international standards that China itself recognises."
"I hope that the President-in-Office will take some note of that."
"Particularly at the present time, and in view of China’s ongoing infringements of human rights, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message and would also appear to be a reward for the Anti-Secession Law."
"Mr President, we have received a document describing European policy in the area of security, which is the most difficult policy for any country or international organisation to tackle."
"This document will constitute a basis or a point of reference when it comes to establishing how best to consolidate the policies of Member States, and to ensure that foreign policy is more effective."
"We would do well to remember that the costliest way of conducting foreign policy is not to have one."
"The Union is failing to take advantage of the opportunities open to it in many areas, precisely because it lacks policies."
"Allow me to mention another plain truism, and now I am addressing in particular those who have been pontificating on militarisation in the House for some time."
"Defence capacity is a of an effective policy."
"Military capacity is essential."
"We would also do well to remember that the principles drafted concerning the safeguarding of our security in the broadest sense can constitute an excellent starting point for dialogue with our American partner, and a basis for the creation of a new kind of transatlantic relationship."
"On the one side there would be the United States, uncertain as to the difference between leadership and hegemony, and on the other the European Union which is just starting to develop its role in this particular area."
"We shall need to bring patience and creativity to this process, but expertise will also be required."
"In this connection, I believe that Mr Kuhne’s report represents a good commitment for all the European institutions, helping them to consider European security."
"In addition, it is significant that Mr Kuhne’s report is being debated at the same time as the annual report on the European Union’s foreign policy."
"This represents good input and a fine contribution by Parliament, helping to ensure that we can at long last speak of a real European policy rather than a virtual one."
"Mr President, if you take the view that the European Union should evolve into some sort of integrated European State, then it is both logical and necessary that it should have its own currency, its own police and judicial system, its own diplomatic representation, its own army and defence budget and all the rest of the panoply of statehood brought together under the legal framework of a constitution."
"The two reports before us today derive their inspiration precisely from this impulse."
"I have to say that British Conservatives take a rather different view."
"We are fundamentally opposed to further European political integration."
"In fact, we would seek to unwind and repatriate many of the excessive powers that Brussels has accrued."
"Not surprisingly, therefore, we oppose the very idea of a European constitution as well as its detailed ingredients."
"The reports focus particularly on security and defence policy."
"They seek to enhance the EU’s military credentials by distorting the nature and role of NATO and then sidelining that organisation while wastefully duplicating its structures, seeking to displace the nations as actors in the transatlantic security relationship while claiming ownership of their capabilities, and subscribing to misplaced ideas of socially engineering our armed forces."
"I do not believe that the European nations have strategic security interests that should be separated from those of its transatlantic and other allies."
"There may be times when Europeans should bear primary responsibility for provision of military forces in their own region."
"That is precisely what has happened in the past ten years or more in the former Yugoslavia, where it is mere sleight of hand to imply that the EUFOR military operation in Bosnia is fundamentally different to that which was there before."
"Of the 7 000 troops in NATO’s SFOR, over 6 000 were European."
"It is dishonest, therefore, to pretend that the EU is contributing to any enhancement of security when most of its Member States are reducing rather than increasing their defence expenditure and the EU itself is merely replicating the planning, decision-making and command and control systems of the highly successful organisation that is NATO."
"Ladies and gentlemen, new security threats have emerged since the end of the Cold War."
"These include international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organised crime and a whole range of regional conflicts."
"It is becoming apparent that no country, no matter how large, is in a position to deal with these security threats on its own, and it is for this reason that the EU’s common foreign, security and defence policy should be extended and strengthened."
"This is a belief held not only by the majority of Members of this House, and not only by Council or Commission representatives, but also, and above all, by the European public."
"This is a point that has already been made in this House."
"Something else that is becoming apparent is that we cannot overcome any of these threats by military means alone; instead, we need to make use of a combination of both military and civilian means."
"Both the reports tabled today and both the rapporteurs provide clear and detailed answers to the question of how this could be achieved."
"The success and future development of the common foreign, security and defence policy depend on two conditions being met; the European Constitution must be ratified, and appropriate funding must be set aside."
"You cannot have more European security for less money."
"Mr President, I will focus on two key issues."
"I wish to begin by saying a few words about the European External Action Service."
"It is of the utmost importance that the service be situated in the Commission."
"We must avoid all attempts to water down the new service by placing it primarily in the Council."
"Under no circumstances should the service be allowed to develop into an uncontrollable intergovernmental agency which starts to live a life of its own."
"Only with maximum parliamentary accountability can we be assured that Europe’s noble goals for the rest of the world are achieved."
"Fighting poverty, defending democracy and advocating human rights are all issues in which we can, and must, cooperate based on common values."
"An intergovernmental service would be at risk of falling prey to many and more sectoral and strategic interests, and our common values and goals would be lost in the mix."
"Secondly, we need to take both an ambitious and realistic approach to European foreign policy under the new Constitution, if and when we get it."
"The Constitution advances European foreign and security policy in many key respects and we must ensure that these commitments are upheld."
"Even though the developments embodied in the Constitution’s clauses of mutual solidarity – as well as in increased rapid reaction capability – are reflections of current practice rather than being innovations, we have to ensure that they are interpreted in an ambitious, concrete and binding fashion when they take effect."
"The inclusion of mutual security guarantees in the Constitution should also be welcomed and consolidated."
"The opposition of some Member States can be countered with a few simple arguments."
"NATO is, and will remain, the backbone of European defence, there is no doubt about that."
"We proposed European guarantees simply to complement NATO provisions with a much-needed European dimension."
"They also support and consolidate decades of European political and security cooperation, which has existed outside the scope of the EU."
"They do not constitute a radical rewriting of Europe’s foreign and security ambitions: they simply establish that Europe must finally be mature enough to begin matching its economic muscle with some political voice and commitment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in recent times the European Union has increasingly become a driving force in the creation of a new international order."
"This has particularly been the case since last year’s enlargement."
"The success of European integration means that the European political system is becoming more attractive to the people of countries beyond the Union."
"Certain US analysts are now referring to so-called European soft power and to the European dream that is coming true before our very eyes."
"Terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, the collapse of nations and organised crime all call for a global dimension in the Union’s external actions."
"In addition, they call for greater democratic accountability concerning those actions."
"To this end, we should be referring to the letter and the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty regarding matters with a bearing on the common foreign and security policy."
"The future European Foreign Service must play a crucial role in this area, assisting the European Union’s foreign ministers."
"As soon as the Constitutional Treaty comes into force, it will be essential to make every effort to invest the solidarity clause with real meaning as regards the defence matters provided for in the Treaty."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Brok contains many fresh, visionary and encouraging ideas."
"I want to add some remarks on the problems of the new, non-state terrorism."
"First, what more could we recommend than what Mr Brok does?"
"The fight against so-called terrorism calls for a clear description of political terrorism."
"Its aim is to achieve concrete political goals, and what are those goals?"
"A distinction needs to be drawn between the new, political, non-state terrorism, which allegedly has no exact state address, and the traditional state terrorism, which is found mainly where democracy fails."
"That sort of political terrorism tends to provoke revengeful responses by certain groups and organisations, as is now happening with Russia’s terrorist – or terrorising – war in Chechnya."
"The democratic community cannot successfully confront any abstract concept of terrorism , as it would be rooted only in ideology or fanaticism."
"No, the real enemies to be fought are terrorist organisations and states that use such methods and support such organisations."
"Two fresh efforts have been made to find addresses in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"They are now the only places where terrorist organisations appear to be on the defensive."
"In the field of defence, this would more than fulfil Europe’s desire to compete with the United States."
"Finally, there is a sort of diabolical profit to be made from this phenomenon of non-state terror, as democracies may now perhaps realise more clearly what their endangered values are."
"When creating the concepts and structures of the European security and defence policy, we should concentrate more and more on the question: for the sake of what, for what Europe are we working?"
"Surely not for a consumerist and suicidal Europe that is losing its identity and sense of values, despite talking so much about it?"
"That is defending the indefensible."
". Mr President, I think that this debate has once again demonstrated the extremely valuable contribution which Parliament is making towards the broad lines, the broad concepts, of the common foreign and security policy."
"It has also demonstrated that this dialogue, which Parliament wanted so much, exists in a very practical form, and I understand why Parliament is seeking this contact, this dialogue with the Council and the Commission."
"The debate has shown that this dialogue exists not only , so that we can talk about the past, but also in relation to present and future policies."
"Moreover, I believe – as someone has said – that we should not pursue a foreign policy which is against the wishes of Parliament."
"Since I have had the pleasure of representing the Presidency, I have never had the impression that the Council was pursuing a policy against the wishes of Parliament."
"On the contrary, I have had the impression that the policy was pursued entirely together and, moreover, today’s debates and also those during previous sittings on the Middle East, Lebanon, and a few hours ago the Balkans, show that Parliament is involved not only in the analysis of our policy, but also in the conception and future directions of that policy."
"I cannot help but notice that there is a broad consensus on the general lines of this policy, on all its facets, and on the idea that Europe must have security, on the fact that that security is not merely security in political and military terms but rather an overall security which includes aspects such as the environment or human rights."
"I am also particularly sensitive to what has been said on the value of symbols and on what goes far beyond symbols, in other words the fact that an encounter with military personnel who wear the European stars on their epaulettes is something to send a shiver down your spine, and effectively demonstrates that Europe is on the move, that the unification of Europe is on the move, and that we have just completed a further stage, in particular by means of our security and defence policy."
"I should like to make just one final comment, on the subject of China."
"At the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Jarzembowski, I adopted a position, and I see that gradually the position I adopted is being confirmed."
"I believe that we should face up to reality: we must develop a relationship with China, because it is a country which is increasing in importance."
"We must therefore engage with China in a general dialogue which covers all aspects."
"Thank you very much for your contributions."
"I think that this has been a fruitful debate, a useful debate and a debate which demonstrates that the dialogue between the various institutions of the Union is working."
". Mr President, like my colleague I think it was an interesting and comprehensive debate because it has shown that many specific questions have been tackled under banners of the CFSP and EDSP."
"Many of the individual issues will resurface in other debates we hold."
"Of course we have not forgotten human rights."
"Human rights have been mentioned by many of you and I think they are already intrinsic to our whole policy."
"It is very important that we become a global player with a European Charter of Human Rights and, hopefully very soon, a Constitution."
"There is an issue that was not mentioned in this debate, but I would like to mention it because it is so important for security and development."
"This is the gender issue that is being so well promoted in Europe, including as part of our development and neighbourhood policies."
"This is part of the overall policy we want."
"I would also like to agree with the comment that the European Union needs to work with partners to avoid nuclear and other sensitive materials coming into the hands of terrorists."
"This is a key objective in our joint work action plan."
"I also agree with Mr von Wogau and others who said that there is a very important link between internal and external security."
"This is also key for close cooperation between the different directorates in the Commission and DG External Relations."
"Finally, there was a very specific question on demining."
"It is not only a problem in Bosnia."
"It is an issue throughout the world and we are therefore very happy that the Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines was held in Kenya, where we saw that this issue that has been promoted by the European Union has come forward very strongly."
"There are many more things to be done, but we have a good, comprehensive basis."
"Let us work together on that basis."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The Presidency is known to be drafting a Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"What stage have the preparations reached, and do we have any grounds for hoping that it may yet apply to Members of the present Parliament?"
". In answer to your question, Mr Seppänen, I should like to remind you that the procedure for adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament is laid down in Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty and in Article 108(5) of the Euratom Treaty."
"Under these rules, the European Parliament determines the Statute and general conditions governing the performance of its Members’ duties, after consulting the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting by a qualified majority."
"The President of the Council intends to bring to a successful conclusion, if possible during the first six months, the negotiations regarding the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, including those concerning its entry into force."
"I can assure you that work is ongoing to arrive at this conclusion."
"Minister, some Member States of the Council have not accepted the proposal for a compromise which was being discussed by Parliament and the Council last time."
"Do you intend to propose the same sort of package again or do you have your own proposals for amendments to this package, and what would these possible amendments be?"
". You will recall that we were very close to reaching a compromise under the Irish Presidency."
"Unfortunately, we have fallen at the final hurdle; it was a compromise that had been negotiated between the Council, and the Irish Presidency in particular, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other."
"I believe that a good many elements of this compromise remain of value and, therefore, I believe that it is a good starting point."
"For obvious reasons, however, it is necessary to define where adjustments are required."
"We are working towards this."
"I can assure you that we are working, within the Council but also with Parliament, on acceptable solutions: acceptable, I hope, to all Member States if possible, or at least to a qualified majority among them."
"I wonder whether the President-in-Office of the Council has had a chance to study yesterday's vote in the European Parliament on the discharge."
"If so, does he agree with me that Parliament's lack of will, or ability, to reform its own house demonstrates the urgency of the need for the Statute and that the only way to enhance the reputation of this institution is through the achievement of a Members' Statute?"
"You are the only ones who can judge on the organisation and internal workings of Parliament."
"I leave that responsibility entirely to you."
"I can assure you that the Presidency is determined to find a solution with Parliament and with the Council."
"This is the commitment that we have made and I hope that we will succeed."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he accepts that the Members' Statute and the package of allowances of this Parliament are being taken together, as was agreed in November or December twelve months ago, just before the Irish presidency."
"The Members' Statute is urgent because it could enable us to clear up the whole debate surrounding the allowances."
"Yesterday's vote on the budget discharge showed that those who are politically honourable and who accept the agreement made eighteen months ago, stood by it despite pressure from the media and others to do otherwise."
"We need reform; we need reform of the whole package: Members' Statute and allowances."
"Could you guarantee that within this presidency we will have a Members' Statute put to us?"
"Could you guarantee that those colleagues who jumped ship at Council level last time, when we thought we had a compromise under the Irish presidency, will be on board this time around?"
"Have you had negotiations or any assurances from those countries?"
". Any solution must be all embracing: a sort of package, as you described it."
"I cannot guarantee at this stage, of course, that we will have everybody on board. You will probably recall the fundamental reasons behind the failure of this package that had been negotiated."
"They were rather exceptional reasons."
"We hope that a solution can be found this time around, that everybody will be able to support this solution, and that nobody will let themselves be influenced by certain articles in newspapers that I will not name."
"We have a time-limit under the Rules."
"Each question is followed by two supplementaries."
"This is my first time in the Chair for Question Time, and, because of the importance of the subject, this is the only time I will break the rule."
"I wish to join with other Members in urging the Presidency to expedite this statute."
"I was struck by the hypocrisy of Members who opposed the discharge of the accounts yesterday, having drawn expenses themselves from those accounts they now say they oppose."
"I have never seen such hypocrisy in my life and it was very distasteful."
"I would urge the Presidency to bring forward this Statute so that this matter is regularised once and for all in terms of both our remuneration and expenses for our work."
"There is absolutely no chance that the hypocrites who kicked up a fuss here yesterday will refund the money to put right what they say is wrong with the accounts they refused to discharge yesterday."
"This is absolutely disgraceful behaviour."
"I think the presidency has answered that already."
"Mr President, if the Statute now comes into being, the European institutions must actually be aware that everyone is being paid independently of their countries."
"Are, then, Members from all countries to be paid equally in future?"
"Will there be a substantial difference from officials’ salaries, or is an effort being made to strike a balance?"
". With regard to the first point of your question, I believe that if there is indeed one key principle of the European Union, it is the non-discrimination principle."
"I believe that it must also be applied in this instance."
"The second part of your question had to do with balance, and this is perhaps a matter of subjective judgment."
"Although I am unable to give you a clear answer to that question, I do believe that our discussions are proceeding on the basis of a balanced package."
"Bearing in mind the pressure on governments to reduce CO emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol, is there not scope for far more renewable energy developments?"
"What steps are being taken to encourage wind power, wave and tidal energy, and are new initiatives hampered by the power of the oil industry lobby?"
". Let me answer Mr Evans."
"On 10 March 2005, in anticipation of the annual spring meeting of the European Council, the Council, within the context of the environment, adopted a contribution to the deliberations made regarding the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Generally speaking, the Council is emphasising the need to take action from 2005, in particular to confront climate change and to promote eco-innovation, in addition to the efficient use of energy and resources."
"It has, in particular, asked the Spring European Council to recommend sustainable consumption and production methods of which eco-efficient innovations are a contributory part, with a view to disassociating economic growth from the use of resources and degradation of the environment."
"It has, moreover, invited calls for the Commission to draw up a European initiative in 2005 in favour of energy efficiency, in addition to a Green Paper comprising a list of significantmeasures."
"In substance, the Council has first of all recommended the implementation, as a matter of urgency and in its entirety, of a course of action promoting eco-technologies – ETAP – to guarantee the prospect of a fair and competitive market for eco-innovations."
"Secondly, it has advocated the vigorous promotion of eco-innovations and eco-technologies in all sectors of the economy, particularly in the energy and transport sectors."
"Finally, it has recommended alleviation measures intended to reduce the long-term risks and costs connected to climate change, resulting in an economy that emits low levels of carbon."
"This will be achieved, in particular, by reinforcing the deployment and development of high yield renewable energy technologies and of new fuels."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that response, and very wholesome it was too."
"May I draw your attention to the last point, where I refer to the power of the oil industry, which to my mind tends to ride roughshod over governments and strangle new initiatives in this field."
"I wonder whether you agree with me, either personally or in your capacity as President-in-Office, that if similar investments had been made in alternative energy sources, funded by the oil industry, then we might have made the sort of substantial progress that Council is now making."
"Do you think we should put pressure on the oil companies to reduce our dependence on the world's diminishing supplies of fossil fuel?"
". I believe that the current situation with regard to the oil market, and the level of oil prices in particular, will encourage many parties to invest in alternative energy sources and renewable energy sources."
"This is where a balance will come about."
"We know, in fact, that the price of oil is due to some economic developments in certain areas of the world and also to some trends in financial speculation."
"The consequence of this will be to make renewable energy sources more appealing and, through these mechanisms, we will perhaps succeed in putting pressure on oil companies and in taking steps which favour the energy sources of the future."
"Mr President, I too believe that the only way to deal with the greenhouse effect is to make use not only of renewable energies, but also of nuclear power and energy-saving measures, but, if the questioner is asking what should be done to promote the generation of electricity from wind, wave and tide power, and whether these new initiatives are being hindered by the oil lobby, I would ask you what initiatives are being set in motion in the nuclear energy sector, and whether these initiatives are being interfered with by the renewable energy lobby."
". I believe that this is a question faced by every country at national level."
"Every country must choose the methods of energy production with which it has the greatest affinity."
"I believe that you have expressed, it seems, an affinity with one particular energy source."
"I understand your position; I do not necessarily share it."
"The Council, I believe, leaves it to every Member State to choose the options it favours."
"It is generally accepted that demographic developments and Europe's ageing population mean that people will have to remain in active employment after the age of 55."
"Does the Council have a clear picture of the current policy of each Member State on early retirement?"
"What measures does the Council intend to take to prevent the early retirement of workers once they reach the age of 55 so that the added value of their experience can be used, without reducing the job opportunities for young people and the unemployed?"
". For some years now, employment guidelines have sought to promote active ageing with a view to increasing the average retirement age particularly the specific guideline 5 of the 2003 guidelines, which were renewed unaltered in 2004."
"The European Council of Stockholm has, moreover, set the ambitious objective of bringing the employment rate of people aged between 55 years and 64 years up to 50%, whilst the European Council of Barcelona has set an additional ambitious objective, namely the raising by five years, by 2010, of the average retirement age, which is currently 61 years according to Eurostat estimates."
"The Council looks upon maintaining older workers in active employment as a major challenge, as is evident from the key messages it has recently adopted for the attention of the Spring European Council."
"In these messages, it points out that it is appropriate to give priority to this issue in reforms seeking to ensure social adequacy and the viability of future pension plans, according to the circumstances of each individual country."
"An increase in longevity will indeed require a new delay in the age at which workers exit the labour market, which presupposes the progressive dismantling of incentive measures for early retirement."
"– Mr President, within the framework of the freedom of European citizens and the abolition of age and other types of discrimination and with the prospect of making use of the accumulated experience of workers of pre-retirement age, will provision be made for joint European political bases, so that young people can also benefit from the experience of people taking retirement, without being prevented from taking up the jobs which belong to them?"
". As a matter of fact, I believe that maintaining the active employment of older people must not be at variance with the employment of young people."
"The European Council, in deciding upon the relaunch and revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy, has taken an initiative with regard to young people, to offer them greater employment prospects."
"I believe that the two can go hand in hand, provided that other means of managing employment are perhaps implemented."
"Yet managing employment takes place primarily within the business community and businesses should take note of what you have said, namely that experience, and therefore also age, has its price and its worth."
"I am delighted that this item is on the agenda and that the issue of active ageing is being followed so intently by certain colleagues up in the gallery."
"It is an issue that affects many of us."
"Could you confirm the active ageing policies of the European institutions, and specifically that there is no longer age discrimination in the employment policies that you and your colleagues operate as employers?"
"You referred to the role of employers and the EU institutions are themselves employers."
"I did ask Commissioner Kinnock this question, but I never managed to get a straight answer."
"I wonder if you could supply one?"
". If I have understood your question correctly, there is no policy of discrimination with regard to older peoplewithin theinstitutions."
"Moreover, I recall that last year, the Commission proposed a report for the Spring Council that was focused on the idea of active ageing."
"I believe that it is the responsibility of the institutionsto promote this idea."
"I do not believe that there is a genuine policy of discrimination within the institutions."
"One encounters people of all ages there with, of course, the retirement age as the limit, but that is another debate."
"Given the likelihood that the Accession treaty with Romania will be signed in April, can the Council outline the progress, if any, made in the human rights situation in Romania, with particular regard to the conditions for children and young adults in orphanages and other state-run institutional facilities?"
"Is it satisfied that sufficient progress has been made in this area to allow for the signing of the Accession treaty?"
". The European Council of December 2004 notes with satisfaction that the progress made by Romania, in the implementation of the and undertakings entered into, has allowed the formal closure of all outstanding chapters in the accession negotiations."
"Today, you have, I believe, decided to give your assent to the accession of Romania."
"Noting the evaluations and recommendations presented by the Commission, the European Council has judged that Romania would be in a position to assume all of its ensuing obligations at the time scheduled for its accession."
"At the same time, the European Council clearly pointed out that the Union would continue to carefully follow – and I believe this has been amply stated this morning – the preparations carried out by Romania, as well as the results obtained."
"The Council thus assures the honourable Member that, as in the past, the subject of children will be followed very closely."
"It is noted moreover that, in its 2004 report on the progress made by Romania on the path to accession, the Commission recorded steadyprogress in the reorganisation of child protection, in particular as a result of the closure of outdated large institutional facilities and the implementation of alternative procedures."
"For its part, the European Union has provided financial support towards Romania’s efforts, with a view to improving the quality of state-run child care organisations."
"Whilst there remains work to be done and improvements to be made, it can be said that, by and large, the living conditions of children placed in Romanian state-run institutional facilities have decidedly improved, and that the Romanian authorities will continue with their efforts to fully implement reform of the child protection system, as of course, all the institutions, and particularly the Council and the Commission, have called upon them to do."
"President-in-Office, my question referred to young adults as well, and perhaps I should have added 'with disabilities', because there are some issues around this."
"Could you advise me on the state of the rollout of the national pilot project for the reform of institutions under ANPH, and specifically in relation to Negru Voda, and when this pilot project might be rolled out nationally?"
". I believe that that is a question to be addressed primarily to the Commission and I regret to inform you that I cannot provide you with further details."
"The question needs to be addressed to the Commission."
"Is the Council aware that many British citizens who have chosen to retire to other EU Member States cannot currently vote in national referenda on the proposed European Constitution?"
"Under current domestic legislation, if they left the UK more than 15 years ago they no longer have the right to vote there, yet they are not automatically granted the right to vote in their new country of residence either."
"Whilst it is up to individual Member States to grant such a right, should there not be some coordination between Member States so that the voices of such people can be heard?"
"Surely it has to be fundamentally wrong that any European citizen is denied a vote on such an important issue?"
"Does the Council know how many European citizens are affected in such a way, and can it propose ways for Member States to work together to resolve the problem?"
". The Council reminds the honourable Member that the organisation of electoral procedures, like the rules relating to the entitlements of the voter, are governed by the national law of each Member State."
"Whilst considering it important that the right to vote may be exercised as fully as possible within the Union, it is not for the Council to express an opinion on the issues raised by the honourable Member."
"I would not only like to ask a supplementary question but would also like to re-ask the original question, because I notice that the Minister has now ducked the previous question as well as this one, which is not very appropriate."
"I accept that this is a matter for Member States."
"My question is whether the Council can, by encouraging use of best practice, use its influence so that we can better learn from each other."
"My attention has been drawn specifically to the case of British expatriates in Spain who have told me that, whereas they used to be able to vote in their home country of the UK provided they had been registered within the previous 20 years, our present government has now made it more difficult by reducing this time to 15 years."
"Do you know of any other Member State that is making it more difficult for expatriates to vote and would you not wish to encourage your colleagues to make it easier?"
"Please answer and do not say nothing."
"I turn to the Minister."
"I believe that Mr Bushill-Matthews is on to something here, but we are both Conservatives!"
". Frankly, I believe that the Constitution has defined the competences of the Union to a greater degree."
"Here we have an area that is genuinely outside of the Union’s competences."
"It is therefore the responsibility of each Member State – I can only repeat what I have already said – to define its electoral rights, even if one can hope that these rights are as extensive, as effective and as well organised as possible, but that remains a competence of each Member State."
"What is the Council Presidency doing to assist Christian churches and religious communities in Turkey in finally obtaining a guaranteed legal status, which would be an important step in the direction of religious freedom?"
". In responding to questions on this issue, the Council has already had, and myself for that matter, on behalf of the Council, I have often had the opportunity to stress that, if religious freedom is guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, certain conditions for the operationof non-Muslim religious communities, in accordance with the practices in force in the Member States of the European Union, must still be laid down."
"In its 2004 Regular Report, the European Commission reported on some instances of progress made by Turkey in this fieldbut equally it recognised significant shortcomings that must be improved, particularly with regard to the legal personality and property rights of non-Muslim communities, in addition to training of the clergy In this regard, important legislation on basic rights still remains under consideration by the Republic of Turkey Prime Ministry."
"The Commission had been invited to comment on this legislation, which is currently being reviewed."
"The European Councils of 16 and 17 December 2004 decided that Turkey adequately fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria in order for accession negotiations to be opened with the country."
"At the same time, the European Council clearly indicated that the full and effective implementation of the political reform process must continue to be closely monitored by the Commission."
"The Commission is asked to look into all the areas of concern registered in its Regular Report and recommendation,including of course, religious freedom, and to regularly brief the Council."
"The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that it will continue to closely monitor the progress made by Turkey on this issue, particularly on the basis of an Accession Partnership setting out the priorities of the reform process, of which a revised text proposal will be presented to the Council by the Commission in the Autumn."
"The Council can further assure him that, as in the past, the Union will not fail to raise outstanding questions in the various forums of political dialogue and within the bodies instituted by the Association Agreement."
"Mr President, as that will be one of this year’s most exciting and important issues, I would like to ask the Presidency of the Council whether it might not be reasonable for the Council to report to the public and to this House, at certain intervals, on how negotiations are actually progressing, for they are being conducted by the Member States rather than by the Commission."
"We would like to be advised on a regular basis as to what progress has been made on the important issue of church property and freedom to actively practice a religion."
". I think, Mr Posselt, that you are jumping ahead a little, as we have not yet entered into negotiations with Turkey."
"We, and in particular the Commission, are, so to speak, in dialogue with Turkey to ensure that the reform processes to which it committed itself are followed through."
"I can assure you that, when the time comes after 3 October, if we enter into negotiations with Turkey, Parliament will of course be kept informed of the progress of those negotiations."
"Despite the fact that Hizbollah is an organisation that has claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist acts, the EU has chosen not to list Hizbollah as a terrorist organisation."
"The reason put forward for this is that the situation in the region is too sensitive."
"In fact, the situation currently appears to be so sensitive that indifference on the part of the EU towards Hizbollah is considerably more dangerous."
"Hizbollah is financed by Iran and its acts are sanctioned by Syria, which makes Hizbollah a threat not only to the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which has now resumed, but also to the nascent aspirations to independence of the Lebanese."
"Hizbollah is an organisation dedicated to terrorism, which is indisputable."
"The organisation must, therefore, be included on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations."
"For all the forces working for peace and freedom in the Middle East, it is important that the EU clearly signals its opposition to the Iranian-sponsored terrorism of Hizbollah."
"When does the Council intend to regard Hizbollah as the terrorist organisation it undoubtedly is?"
". The issue of the inclusion of the Shiite movement Hizbollah on the list of terrorist organisations has been examined several times by the bodies of the Council and remains open."
"The honourable Member will be aware that a decision in this regard must meet the conditions laid down in common position 931/2001 and that it requires unanimity."
"Furthermore, in its conclusions of 16 March 2005, the Council reaffirmed its support for a sovereign, independent and democratic Lebanon and reiterated its call for immediate full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, which calls in particular for the disarmament of the militias present on Lebanese territory."
"The European Council endorsed this approach at its meeting in Brussels on 22 and 23 March 2005."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Presidency for its answer to my question."
"It was not, however, really an answer to the question I asked, which was not about disarming various organisations in Lebanon but about ensuring that the Middle East peace process could continue under stable conditions."
"We know that terrorism is the most serious threat to that being possible."
"We know that, via Hizbollah, Iran funds and supports terrorism and has the unambiguous intention, clearly declared on a variety of occasions, to take steps to annihilate Israel."
"If the point is not made to Iran that it is unacceptable to support acts of terrorism and if Hizbollah is not declared a terrorist organisation, the question must be asked: in what way is Hizbollah not, in fact, a terrorist organisation?"
"In what way, moreover, can it be made clear to Iran that it is not permissible to support terrorism?"
". I think that your question goes beyond the rather more precise subject of Hizbollah."
"There have been debates regarding the best approach to take in this particular case, and there are various possible options."
"Obviously, the greatest threat to the peace process is terrorism."
"We still need to find a better way to combat this scourge and, at the moment, I can only confirm what I have just said: that the approach taken at this stage is not, for now, to include the organisation to which you referred, that is to say Hizbollah, on the list."
"That is not to say that we do not consider the activities of that group to be dangerous, but it is the approach we have chosen and it has also not been criticised by some of our most important partners."
"I wish to support the Council in the approach it takes to Hizbollah."
"There is a certain logic."
"If you oppose terrorism – which we all do and we know Hizbollah has links to terrorism – then proscribe Hizbollah."
"However, that would be a very short-term approach, because there will be no permanent settlement in the Middle East without the active participation of Hizbollah."
"Therefore, while the Council is right to keep the issue of proscribing this organisation under review, it would be far better in the short run to have a dialogue."
"Given the financial connections between Iran and Hizbollah, is the Council’s ‘softly softly’ approach to Iran, as illustrated by its weak attitude to Iran’s pursuit of its nuclear ambitions, also at work on this subject?"
"Are we seeing that same ‘softly softly’ approach to Hizbollah because of the Iranian connection?"
"I believe Hizbollah to be one of the most pernicious and vicious terrorist organisations at work in our dangerous world today and it should be treated accordingly?"
"If the experience of my part of the world teaches us anything, it is that cosying up to terrorism does not work."
"What has happened with the IRA since demonstrates that beyond all doubt."
". I do not think that the issue here is whether or not to take the ‘softly softly’ approach."
"You have also put this question in a wider context."
"We do indeed also need to enter into dialogue with Iran regarding its attitude and its support for terrorist activities, and also regarding its attitude towards a peaceful resolution to the problem in the Middle East, and we are doing so. We have done so and we are also in the process of doing so in this overall approach that we have adopted and that we are currently applying in that country, particularly in the context of non-proliferation."
"With regard to Hizbollah, to respond to Mr Martin’s speech, I think that it is a complicated group."
"Indeed, that organisation has several wings, including a parliamentary wing, because it is represented in the Lebanese Parliament."
"It is for that reason, too, that my response emphasised this Lebanese wing, which we cannot exclude or separate from the more specific context of terrorism against Israel."
"What is the Council's assessment of the current state of negotiations for Croatian accession to the EU?"
". The European Council of June 2000 established that all the countries of the Western Balkans were potential candidates for EU membership."
"Subsequently, in June 2003, the European Council reiterated its determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries, which will become an integral part of the EU, once they meet the established criteria."
"It is therefore essentially up to the countries concerned – I think that the debate we have had on the Western Balkans has adequately demonstrated this – to set the pace at which they come closer to the EU by aligning with the and by meeting the criteria established by the Copenhagen European Council."
"On 16 March 2005, the Council reaffirmed the European Union’s commitment to the accession of Croatia and adopted the framework for negotiations with that country."
"It also referred to the importance of full cooperation with the ICTY on the part of all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"That is an essential requirement for closer relations with the EU and I think that, in the previous debate, I did emphasise this once again."
"In that regard, after deliberation by the Council and in the absence of a common agreement, the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia has been postponed."
"The bilateral intergovernmental conference will be convened by common agreement as soon as the Council has established that Croatia is cooperating fully with the ICTY, and you will be aware that, to enable the Council to take this decision with full knowledge of the facts, we have set up a group chaired by the Presidency, and involving the next two Presidencies as well as the Commission and the High Representative."
"The first meeting with the Croatian Government will take place on 26 April, to discuss precisely this aspect of cooperation with the Hague Tribunal."
"Your answer was very helpful, but, if the fugitive general is out of Croatia, what evidence will the Croatian authorities be able to give to you to show that they are cooperating with the International Criminal Court?"
"It seems that they are now in a bind."
"If he has left Croatian territory they will be unable to capture him."
"If they cannot capture him, how can they show willingness to comply with the International Criminal Court?"
". Mr Martin, I think I have already had an opportunity to provide a clear answer to this question."
"We have never said that the opening of negotiations with Croatia depended on arresting General Gotovina and bringing him to The Hague."
"That has never been seen as a condition."
"The condition is Croatia’s cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, which means cooperation involving the provision of all information leading to his arrest."
"Indeed, if the general is somewhere else, I do not know where, we cannot oblige the Croatians to arrest him if he is not in their country."
"I therefore think that this condition must not be confused with the more general one of full cooperation with the tribunal, in other words the provision of all information leading to the arrest of General Gotovina."
"If he cannot be arrested because there is not enough information to allow it, that does not mean that Croatia’s accession would be permanently blocked."
"That would be unfair on that country."
". The Council has on many occasions condemned the massacre of civilians, including journalists, and has always emphasised the need for the authorities concerned to carry out extensive investigations each time an incident occurs."
"The Council is aware of the fact that a number of incidents have still not been properly explained and have still not been investigated thoroughly."
"It will continue to bring up these incidents and to call for investigations within the desired timeframe."
"With regard to the specific incident referred to in the questions, the investigation carried out by the United States’ authorities concluded that the American forces were not to blame."
"The victim’s family, however, has filed a lawsuit against the American soldiers involved."
"Under those circumstances, the Council does not think it would be appropriate to comment on the matter."
"Mr President, Minister, your reply is very disappointing because we are trying, or we have tried, to sell all the European citizens the idea that, on the basis of the Treaty establishing a Constitution, everything relating to common security is going to require a single policy for all the Member States."
"Five days ago was the second anniversary of the death of this journalist and the European Union is being asked not just to use judicial channels, which the families have already done, but to call on the United States Government through political channels to carry out an impartial investigation."
"Everybody knows that the place where this journalist died, the Palestine Hotel, was a non-military target that should have been protected and in which all of the accredited international press was based, and the response of the United States authorities is not, therefore, acceptable and we want the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to demand clearly and vigorously that the United States Government open up an impartial investigation."
"I therefore regret your reply and I hope that you will accept the view that we should continue to demand this investigation as firmly as possible."
"Mr Schmit, I am rather disappointed by your response."
"It amounts to saying that, because the family has reacted and is taking legal action to defend the interests of a brother, a cousin, in other words a loved one, the Council has nothing to say."
"That means, if we understand correctly the answer you have just given, that the Council would only have reacted if the family had been inactive, which is a completely incomprehensible, not to say intolerable, response."
"You have two choices."
"Either you have the courage, on behalf of the Council, to say that you are completely satisfied with the investigation carried out by the American authorities – you have the right to do so, but, in that case, have the courage to say that the American authorities’ investigation, which concluded that nothing had happened, satisfies the Council completely."
"Have the courage to say so in public, in this forum."
"Or you say that you are not satisfied and that you are going to call for further explanations."
"Passivity, though, is never an answer, and it does not help to bring people closer to their government and their institutions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me start by publicly expressing our satisfaction at the steps taken by the President of the European Parliament and one of Parliament’s Vice-Presidents, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, specifically, to secure the release of the French journalist, Mrs Aubenas, and her colleague, Mr Al-Saadi, who have been held hostage for exactly 100 days today."
"This is an occasion for me to remind you that, in Iraq, a number of journalists and other press employees have been victims of kidnappings, which is rare during a war, and there have been several dozen kidnappings."
"I would like to insist, on the strength of both my experience and my new functions, that the Council should submit a request for a joint investigation, before the people take to the streets to demand it, as happened in Italy for Mr Calibari."
"It is something that is both moral and technically feasible."
". First of all, I would like to thank Mr Cavada for reminding us that it is now 100 days since Mrs Aubenas and the person accompanying her were taken hostage."
"I think that I can, on behalf of the Council, and certainly on behalf of the Presidency, express our full solidarity with Mrs Aubenas, and with all the hostages in Iraq, because there are others."
"There is another group of three Romanian journalists who have been taken hostage."
"This is the time to express our full solidarity with them and also our desire to do everything we can to secure their release as soon as possible."
"I also understand, in a way, the disappointment that has been expressed, but I cannot go any further: now that a lawsuit has been filed, and the families are taking legal action, I cannot, at this stage, get further involved and express a political opinion on the matter."
"Believe me, we will continue to follow closely all these matters and incidents, some of which have been particularly tragic."
"How does the Council envisage the European Union’s future relations with the Andean Community of Nations and what steps does it consider should be taken so that the European Union may help strengthen it?"
". The importance that the European Union attaches to relations with the Andean Community and to progress towards its integration can clearly be seen from the Guadalajara summit between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in May 2004."
"On that occasion, the Heads of State or Government welcomed the decision of the concerned parties to open the process leading to Association Agreements, including a free trade area."
"This prospect should give new impetus to strengthening the regional integration process."
"In the meantime, the prior joint assessment phase has been launched – this will involve technical assessments – and the joint ministerial meeting planned for the end of May in Luxembourg will be a new opportunity to go into a subject so essential to our future relations in more detail."
"The European Union welcomes the desire reiterated by the Andean political representatives to continue along this path, as it does the increasing closeness of relations between Mercosur and the Andean Community."
"With respect to the fight against drugs, the European Union welcomes the high-level meetings with specialists in the Andean countries regarding drugs and their precursors – the next of these meetings will take place during the first half of this year in Lima."
"The two parties will keep up their efforts to combat this scourge with an approach based on cooperation and co-responsibility."
"In terms of commercial policy, the European Union is giving the Andean countries a prime position in the proposed GSP+."
"In the aim of basing sustainable political relationships on the interests and participation of the population, the Council would finally like to emphasise the important contribution resulting from the meeting with representatives of civil society from the Andean countries which took place on 3 March in Brussels."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the explanations the President-in-Office of the Council has given me and I simply wished to ask a brief supplementary question."
"With regard to the progress of the negotiations with these countries, when there is also talk of the creation of a broader Latin American system, in particular by means of the union between the Andean Community and Mercosur, I wished to know whether the negotiations with Mercosur and the Andean Community are related to each other, are parallel negotiations or are linked in some way."
". If I understand you correctly, Mr Medina Ortega, it is a process between the Latin-American countries, in other words between the countries of Mercosur and those of the Andean Community."
"I think that the European Union does indeed have the aim of encouraging all forms of regional integration, the wider the better."
"I think this is an approach that can only be encouraged."
"And if these countries succeed in further improving their cooperation, or even integration, I think that it must also be taken into account in the relations they have with the European Union."
"In its reply to my question H-0139/05 at Question-Time on 9 March, the Council of Ministers confirmed in the Chamber that it knows that the activities of the Member States’ secret services in our fight against organised crime are coordinated, but it said that it had no details."
"If that apparent contradiction can possibly be true, does the information about coordination among secret services reach the Council as a simple anonymous note saying ‘we are coordinating but will not give you any details’?"
"Is the Council satisfied with knowing nothing about the activities of what our secret services are doing jointly?"
"Who, then, if anybody, keeps an overall ministerial eye on their secret coordinated activities which, we must hope, are carried out usefully on behalf of Europe’s citizens?"
". As the Council has already had the opportunity to tell the honourable Member during the part-session in March, the Secretariat of the Council has not been informed of the activities of the Member States’ secret services in the fight against organised crime."
"No provision in EU law obliges the Member States to provide the Council with such information."
"As the Council told the honourable Member during Question Time in March, that does not mean that there is no contact between the national secret services of the Member States in this particular field."
"Like all of us here in this Chamber – or all those who should theoretically be in this Chamber at this moment – you represent the public."
"We in Parliament do not want to know the operational secrets."
"Of course we do not, because that would be very damaging."
"But we want to know, on behalf of the public whom you represent and whom we represent, whether an elected politician is in charge of coordinating the activities that the secret services jointly carry out."
"Is anybody watching what they are doing?"
"If you say the Council is not doing so, then who is?"
"Who is elected?"
"Who is coordinating and supervising this work?"
"It is very alarming if you say nobody is."
". I think that supervision of the secret services is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, and that it is the Member States who must ensure that the activities of the services concerned take place within the limits of the rule of law and in accordance with their legislation."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 17 to 41 will be answered in writing(1)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Honourable Members, this is my first session in the chair and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of this House for the trust that they have placed in me."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Wurtz on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, Mr Désir on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and Mrs Flautre on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on redundancies at Alstom."
". Mr President, the issue of Alstom Power Boiler has left us all with our backs to the wall with respect to our commitment to create a Europe of full employment, with a strong high-tech industry, a Europe that cares about the environment, a Europe that is free from the technological and financial domination of the United States."
"What is this about?"
"A subsidiary of the Alstom group, whose creative, research and production resources are established in Europe – 250 employees in France, in Vélizy, 300 in Germany, in Stuttgart, and a number of plants in the Czech Republic, Portugal and Poland – but whose headquarters are in the United States, in Connecticut."
"This company’s expertise is in the manufacture of boilers for generating steam and electricity."
"It is the world leader in the production of clean coal and is developing new technologies for CO2 capture."
"With the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the need to diversify energy sources, it is clear that such technologies have huge potential."
"However, for reasons that are unclear, the management of Alstom has decided to transfer the European expertise to the United States, to reduce the workforce in Vélizy by four fifths and to halve that in Stuttgart, probably with the aim of eventually closing the main European sites."
"The pretext for this siphoning-off of European expertise was a pseudo-study carried out – what a surprise – by the Americans, announcing that the market was expected to shrink by a third over the next four years."
"Following the example of the employees of Power Boiler, we cannot take this study seriously, especially when we know the enormous demand in this field that is emerging throughout the world."
"As they say in my country, though, when you want to kill your dog, you accuse it of having rabies."
"A lack of a real long-term industrial strategy, a frantic scramble for immediate profits, those have been the main characteristics of the Alstom Group since it was privatised."
"The Commission, and also the French Government, must also take some of the responsibility."
"Fortunately, the employees at the European sites affected, supported by their trade unions, have not thrown in the towel."
"The employees in Vélizy, in particular, have come up with a counterplan based around withdrawing the company from the Alstom group for a sales price in the region of one symbolic euro, creating a European public limited-liability company grouping together the Vélizy and Stuttgart sites and retaining the plants in the Czech Republic, Poland and Portugal."
"This plan is based on the voluntary participation of the employees."
"It has the advantage of fitting in with the demands of 7 July 2004 drawn up by the European Commission with regard to Alstom on the subject of the disposal of assets, the aim being to safeguard and increase employment and European technological potential compared to the United States."
"This cooperation between European employees is at the forefront of the application of European law, as it will result in the creation of a European public limited-liability company."
"We must work fast, though, as the company’s intellectual property is on the way to being transferred to the United States and Switzerland and Alstom’s general management is working to put the company in financial difficulties."
"If, ladies and gentlemen, we are committed to the growth of industry and employment, we must do all we can to support this initiative."
"It is true that the directive on European public limited-liability companies and the regulation on the involvement of employees in corporate governance have not yet been transposed into French law, but it is always possible to look ahead."
"It is a question of political will and I expect the Commission to show this will."
"So, let us not disappoint these workers, whose jobs are threatened but who are so proud of their unparalleled technical achievements and are always ready to innovate."
". Mr President, I am delighted to see you in the chair for your first sitting, inasmuch as your appointment to this post is connected to some excellent news for my group and for European socialists: the victory of the socialists in Portugal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Member, Mr Henin, I am one of the authors of this question to the Commission."
"A few weeks ago, we received here a delegation of employees of the Alstom group made up of representatives of both French and German trade unions from the two sites of this subsidiary that specialises in boilers."
"These workers are now affected by the announcement made by their management on 16 February 2005, of the closure of the company or, at any rate, of major cuts in jobs and activities, both in Stuttgart and in Vélizy: 150 jobs out of 350 will be lost in Stuttgart, and 150 out of 200 in Vélizy."
"This means that, in the end, these two sites will probably be doomed."
"A few months ago, on 7 July 2004, the European Commission approved aid granted by France to Alstom subject to strict disvestment conditions but with the aim, not only of re-establishing sound competition conditions, but also of safeguarding the long-term future of the Alstom industry and of its various subsidiaries."
"The subsidiary Alstom Power Boiler, as has already been mentioned, is a company that specialises in the construction of power station boilers."
"It is a technological leader in Europe, and in the world, in a number of fields, particularly in difficult and clean combustion and CO2 capture."
"From the point of view of the European Union’s priorities in terms of the Lisbon strategy, which we have debated recently and which will serve to ensure that Europe develops its competences and its technology and becomes the most competitive economy in the world, and also from the point of view of our objectives with regard to sustainable development and clean energy, this company is a strategic tool, and the fact is that, obviously, many jobs depend on it."
"That is what justified the agreement given by the Commission in July 2004 to a considerable quantity of aid: EUR 3 billion granted by France to the Alstom group to help with its restructuring."
"In its final decision, the Commission stated that, with regard to the Power Generation and Transport sectors, the restructuring plan was adequate to ensure industrial recovery."
"It considered the planned job cuts to be proportional to the level of over-capacity in these industries, and felt that the estimates of the costs of this restructuring and of the saving that would result seemed realistic."
"Today, though, the group’s management is going beyond the job cuts announced at that time, and is going beyond the disvestments to which it committed itself."
"Consequently, I think that the European Commission needs to take an interest in the decisions that have just been taken by the management of the Alstom group."
"Indeed, as the Commission is always very scrupulous with regard to compliance with the competition rules after aid has been granted, it must be equally scrupulous with regard to the consequences for employment."
"After all, unless I have misunderstood, Commissioner, it seems to me that the ultimate justification for granting aid for the restructuring of a business is to keep this activity going, particularly and ultimately because it makes it possible to save jobs, because it generates a multitude of benefits, tax revenue, etc., but above all because it makes it possible to save jobs."
"The Commission cannot be hemiplegic – it cannot, having granted aid, only look at the effects on competition and respect for competition."
"It must also ensure that this aid actually does contribute to maintaining activities and employment on all sites, insofar as it was indeed decided, when this aid was approved in July 2004, that the planned job cuts were adequate and that it is therefore not justified to go beyond that."
"We are therefore now counting on the Commission to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and that the two sites in question are not closed down."
". Mr President, I am standing in for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, with whom I have been following this matter for five years."
"I think that Mr Désir’s speech set out the real problem."
"I said to former Commissioner Monti years ago that the day would come when the Competition Directorate-General’s main task would be not so much to refuse aid as to see whether that aid was properly used."
"What authorises a country to award State aid in apparent violation of Article 87 of the Treaty?"
"It is the fact that Europe considers it to be in its interest because, if this aid were refused, jobs would be lost that could not be replaced."
"A source of expertise, and of work in the interests of the EU’s objectives, of its citizens and of its consumers would disappear."
"In their great wisdom, the Competition DG and the Commission granted this aid to Alstom a year ago."
"It was not a case of bowing to pressure from the French Government."
"It was a case of expressing an opinion on the fact that, in the condition in which Alstom was proposing to continue, yes, it was worthwhile for a state to grant it aid."
"It was good for the whole of Europe."
"Well, if this assessment was right a year ago, it is right today."
"However, Alstom is in the process of proving that, when it asked for this State aid, it was not trying at all to maintain the supply of clean technologies in Europe, it was not trying to contribute to the objective of full employment in Europe."
"It was simply trying to obtain State aid according to the principle of the privatisation of profit and the nationalisation of loss."
"This is something that neither the left nor the right in Europe can accept."
"I therefore believe that we have here a key example on which the Commission should base its policy."
"If the fairly extensive list of authorisations for granting State aid – there are a dozen cases in Article 87, which is also retained in the Constitution – really forms the basis, so to speak, of industrial policy in Europe, this is the time to prove it."
"The Commission must say whether the aid granted a year ago simply served to bail out the Alstom group’s shareholders or whether it really served the interests of the people of Europe, their future, and in particular compliance with the Kyoto Protocol."
". Mr President, I, too, wish to begin by congratulating you on your office and wishing you success in your term of office."
"This issue can – and indeed must – be considered from two angles, first in terms of industrial policy and secondly in relation to the monitoring of state aid."
"Being myself responsible for industrial policy, I feel myself on very safe ground when I say that it is in Europe’s political interests not only to maintain, but also to extend, innovative technologies, modern enterprises and modern jobs in Europe."
"It is of the utmost importance to the European Union that we should retain in Europe a strong industrial base, without which we will not be able to maintain our competitiveness in global markets."
"It is with this in mind that I tell you, in my capacity as the Commissioner with responsibility for industry in Europe, that I am very much concerned that Alstom should successfully complete the restructuring it has started and continue to exist as a healthy, successful and profitable business."
"So much for the industrial policy aspect."
"Today, though, it is not industrial policy that we are talking about."
"What is at issue is the monitoring of state aid."
"It is indeed the case that the aid by the French state could not have been granted had not the Commission approved Alstom’s restructuring plan."
"The Commission did so and imposed conditions on both the plan and the aid."
"The honourable Members are quite right to say that it is the Commission’s task to ensure that those conditions are complied with and that the aid is used for the purpose for which the Commission approved it, and we are checking to see that this has been the case."
"In particular, the Commission stated at the time that approval of the aid was conditional on certain areas of the business being disposed of and on operational restructuring being carried out."
"The question to be answered this evening is whether or not the present supplementary restructuring plan runs counter to the Commission’s decision."
"If this restructuring plan is not in breach of the conditions, then it is the company’s management, rather than the Commission, that is responsible for implementing it;"
"Alstom is not run by the Commission, but by its own management."
"Although I have been informed by the departments responsible that the Commission has not, so far, had any indications that the conditions it imposed on the granting of aid have been breached, I can assure you that we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation and will be paying very close attention to see that the conditions are complied with to the letter."
"As a matter of principle, the Commission is committed to seeking, in partnership, solutions that take account of all economic, social and environmental considerations."
"In its latest communication, ‘Restructuring and Employment’, it explicitly envisaged the mobilisation of all social forces to better accompany restructuring, with the aim of bringing about sustainable development of competition and employment."
"In particular, the Commission proposes the organisation of reinforced sectoral and regional follow-up, with special funds being made available to support the implementation of this strategy."
"Retaining and improving Europe’s capacity for innovation, research and development is also of strategic importance."
"Only a few days ago, the Commission presented a framework programme on research and innovation."
"I am well aware that our options are very limited indeed where job losses are concerned, and I share your sentiments in this regard, but the Commission must adhere strictly to the law as it stands."
"I have given you an undertaking that we will examine this case with great care and will take action if it should emerge that the conditions attached to this aid have not been met."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Alstom group has been causing grave disquiet for many months."
"It is the future of Alstom’s 25 000 employees in France that is at issue."
"We have had to fight hard and our government has put itself firmly on the side of the Alstom employees."
"It was our Minister for Finance, Mr Sarkozy, who negotiated with the Commissioner at the time, Mr Monti, so that we could grant the aid that saved Alstom."
"It was of course a question of safeguarding the future of the employees, but also of saving a jewel in the European energy and transport industry."
"This evening, we are talking about Vélizy and Stuttgart, but also about Brno in the Czech Republic and Setúbal in Portugal, and large numbers of subcontractors throughout Europe."
"Today, the announcement that 350 jobs will be lost, including 200 in Vélizy at Alstom Power Boiler, increases the worry for the employees still further."
"It is true that the weakening in the market for boilers is clear, but it is not at a level that would justify such job losses."
"It is not down to the Commission, of course, to dictate the management of companies or to manage, on behalf of governments, social assistance for any redundancies."
"It is worth pointing out that Alstom Power Boiler is a leader in the field of the production of clean coal and is developing technologies for the capture of carbon dioxide."
"We are therefore not talking about a company condemned by ossification and obsolescence."
"Acceptance of its migration across the Atlantic or, even worse, its disappearance, is like looking at the future through a rear-view mirror."
"The employees – and we must congratulate them for this – have developed a plan based around the concept ‘let us create the European champion in clean combustion’."
"They have, with the help of experts, developed a plan for the future covering all aspects: the legal structure of the new company, technological aspects, commercial aspects, social aspects."
"We must welcome this approach, which represents a refusal to cave in."
"It has been brought to the attention of the European partners: the Commissioners responsible for employment and social affairs, enterprise and industry, trade, competition, and environment, who are awaiting your conclusions."
"Commissioner, today you must look ahead to the cultural and social revolution set in motion by the draft constitutional treaty."
"In future, social rights, with the constitutional treaty, will prevail over the perfection of the internal market which had the upper hand in previous treaties."
"Social dialogue will be institutionalised, but above all we must formulate an industrial policy that favours skills centres and will safeguard the social market economy proposed to us as a social model in Article 3 of the constitutional treaty."
"The question being put to you today, Commissioner, is this: how do you see the future philosophy of the constitutional treaty?"
"Do not be the clerk of the old Europe, but instead put in place the new Europe, the one intended by the constitutional treaty."
"You have a good opportunity to do so, by safeguarding the future of Alstom Power Boiler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission on fiscal and environmental dumping, by Mr Ford, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by Mrs Mann, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by Mr Watson, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (B6-0172/2005),"
"- by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (B6-0229/2005)."
". Mr President, as the Commission will be aware, we have almost 300 jobs at risk at the British cellophane plant in Bridgwater in my constituency in the United Kingdom."
"This plant has been taken over by a company called Innovia, which currently has plants in Kansas, Carlisle and Bridgwater."
"What is being proposed threatens to rip the heart out of the town of Bridgwater; allowing for suppliers to the company, almost one thousand jobs are at risk in the area."
"Tonight we have an almost unprecedented request from all parties – Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat – in the region and in the United Kingdom, who are united in their reaction to this appalling decision by Innovia and are asking for the Commission’s help and assistance."
"What leads the company to make this decision?"
"The plant in Kansas has never in its history made a profit; the plant in Bridgwater has never in its history made a loss."
"But we have a proposal to close Bridgwater."
"Why?"
"Because the State of Kansas, led by a Democratic majority, who, in spite of the opposition of Republicans in the State House of Representatives and the State Senate, has offered Innovia certain things."
"The first is a bribe of USD 2 million to shift jobs from the European Union to the United States."
"The second is a five-year tax holiday, which means that all the taxes paid by the workforce will be paid back to the company over the next five years."
"And, most interestingly, it has offered a suspension of environmental regulations, which will allow the cellophane to be produced cheaply and re-exported back to the European Union."
"I should like to ask the Commission whether these financial bribes are allowable under WTO rules."
"If not, will it raise the issue with the US Government?"
"What will be done when Innovia produces cellophane in Kansas and dumps it back on the European market?"
"How will the Commission tackle that problem?"
"Also, while I agree that at the moment the WTO rules do not forbid environmental dumping, and while we recognise that different countries may have environmental standards that differ from ours, we object to the suspension of those different standards, something we are increasingly likely to see because of the Kyoto Agreement."
"In the European scheme of things, this is comparatively small beer."
"Nevertheless, it is very important for the region."
"It is also very important in terms of the precedent it sets for the future, because if the United States, its companies and its State governments can get away with this on one occasion, there is absolutely no reason why they will not do it again and again."
"Therefore, this is an important issue of principle that the Commission needs to take seriously, and I expect some action."
". Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, my group has decided to join this oral question in order to supplement it."
"The question raised by Mr Ford relates in particular to compatibility with WTO rules."
"For my part, I would like to come back to a question that concerns the European Union and the situation within the EU’s borders."
"During the last parliamentary term, the Ecofin Council agreed on the designation of around 60 national tax measures within the European Union that were considered to result in harmful competition as understood in particular in the work carried out within the OECD."
"The provisions of what is known as the Primarolo Code of Conduct – from the name of the official who chaired this working group – related both to standstill clauses and to rollback clauses, in other words to the gradual dismantling of the national provisions thus identified by common agreement within the Ecofin Council."
"I have noticed that we no longer talk very much, neither within Parliament nor in the media, about the situation with regard to that dismantling process and I would like to know what the Commission’s opinion is on that process."
"I am well aware that the issue essentially falls within the competence of the Member States and that there is agreement between the Member States within the Ecofin Council."
"That said, competition policy is an exclusive competence of the EU and the Commission has a very important mission in that regard."
"From this point of view, therefore, I believe that the Commission should have a role of monitoring and providing incentives, or at least of warning and providing information, regarding verification of the commitments made within the Ecofin Council."
"I will supplement this question by saying – and you know this as well as I do – that we are still a very long way from harmonisation of corporation tax and of the tax base within the EU, which were debated by the Prodi Commission on the basis of its work with regard to a common minimum level for company taxation within the EU."
"This is a development that my group considers desirable."
"We therefore see the decisions taken within the Ecofin Council as a and I really hope that the Commission will be able to comment on this process this evening and in the coming months."
"This is because I think that the problems we are encountering in some countries with regard to the draft European Constitution are not helping us, unfortunately, and that there is a legitimate concern that harmful competition will continue and get worse within the European Union."
"That is why, in my opinion, it is an extremely important policy mission to ensure that, at the very least, the commitments made within the Ecofin Council are met and that the Commission, just like Parliament, plays a part in the development of this process."
". Mr President, I rise on behalf of my Group to add my concern to that expressed by previous speakers about this terrible situation in relation to an innovative and, frankly, quite remarkable company in the constituency that Mr Ford and I represent."
"Innovia Films is a profitable company, which has developed a process discovered in the United Kingdom in 1898."
"I suspect that had that process been discovered in Scandinavia in 1998, it would have been viewed as best available technology, plastic packaging would have been banned and cellophane would have been used instead."
"Sadly, for cellophane, it was discovered rather earlier."
"However, I welcome the cross-party support that is being shown for the campaign to recognise the problems being caused by the policy of the Americans and to deal with this issue."
"This morning we debated the outcome of the European Council meeting held to review the Lisbon Agenda."
"In the resolution adopted by Parliament with cross-party support, we agreed that there has to be such a thing as industrial policy."
"If there is industrial policy, then we have to look at how we can support companies like this one."
"When I wrote to Commissioner Piebalgs on behalf of the company some while ago, in order to see whether any kind of support was available for that company, he replied that there are programmes that support new and innovative systems, but this case would not be eligible for such support."
"I wonder if we should not be looking again at our industrial policy."
"The letter from Commissioner Mandelson to Mel Dando, one of the trade union officers involved, looks at the problems that we have encountered with the policy at the plant in Kansas, as regards declaring a tax holiday and suspending environmental regulations."
"Mr Mandelson points out that the measures, in the form of tax exemptions, appear to be subsidies but do not fall into the prohibited category."
"He then goes on to point out that there are no provisions in the WTO agreements that cover environmental dumping and says that, therefore, these measures appear not to be in breach of current WTO rules."
"My question to the Commission will be this: if there are no provisions in the WTO agreements that cover environmental dumping, why not?"
"What is the Commission doing to ensure that we have provisions to cover environmental dumping?"
"This incident, affecting, as Mr Ford said, perhaps not a huge number of jobs when viewed on a European scale, but a very large number of jobs when viewed on the scale of a small industrial town like Bridgwater, is one that could be replicated right across the European Union if we found that the policy of different States in the United States of America in this area was about to rob us of jobs in this way."
"This is the ugly face of capitalism."
"We have here a buy-out of a company by a consortium dedicated to asset-stripping and to returning as much money as possible to the investors without looking at the general health of our society and our industries."
"It is the kind of case on which the Commission should take action."
"I hope that Commissioner Verheugen, the Commissioner here tonight, and Commissioner Mandelson will raise this case with the Americans and see what we can do to get action to save the plant in Bridgwater and to save potentially many other hundreds of thousands of jobs across the European Union that could be affected by this kind of development."
". Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to debate fiscal and environmental dumping with regard to British Cellophane in Bridgwater."
"British Cellophane has had a long and honourable history spanning more than 50 years."
"It has an enormous background of industrial muscle and might in Bridgwater."
"Bridgwater is also one of the leading industrial towns in the West Country."
"Over the long term, the workforce at British Cellophane has been reduced but it has always had an outstanding productivity level, an outstanding relationship with its employees and has given outstanding help to the town at all levels."
"Cellophane is a massively important commodity throughout the world."
"British Cellophane produces approximately 60 000 tonnes per year."
"The commodity has been produced in highly productive, motivated and profitable plants."
"In the past few years the company has changed dramatically: it was bought by Candell Investments and I should like to talk about three of its five plants."
"Two plants are in Britain and one is in America."
"The two in Britain are productive, motivated plants, one in the north and one in Bridgwater."
"I wish to dwell on the third plant in Kansas."
"Kansas State legislators have spent an enormous amount of money to keep the plant there."
"We are talking about millions of dollars, not a few hundred thousand."
"They voted publicly to give public money to the plant and they have also been given a five-year environmental holiday to further undermine British Cellophane’s prospects."
"It does not stop there."
"The plant is unproductive and does not make a profit."
"Why would one give money to a plant that does not make a profit and is not productive, whether it is in China, Australia or America?"
"Three hundred UK jobs in a profitable, highly productive plant are being put under threat by a plant that does not meet the WTO rules."
"Every year British Cellophane puts approximately GBP 20 million into the economy from wages, direct and indirect goods."
"We are talking about a profitable and highly productive plant."
"It has done everything to change and it out-performs the Americans by far."
"It produces more and better quality goods."
"The plant has done everything to stay profitable."
"We should not allow it to be sacrificed simply because an American plant can get away with something that we cannot."
"The subsidies are unfair trade, involve unfair dumping and the use of unfair competition against profitable plants."
"We should not allow this to happen."
"If this is a world of free trade, the World Trade Organization should be asked to consider this matter."
"I ask the Commission to take this up urgently."
"There is cross-party support for this."
"I believe that the WTO should act."
"I urge the Commission to take up the case."
". Mr President, let me begin by dealing with the specific case at issue."
"The Commission is aware of the plans for the closure and possible relocation of the Innovia Films plant in Bridgwater and we have asked the services to examine whether the measures taken by the State of Kansas constitute a breach of WTO rules."
"We will also explore, in cooperation with the Member States concerned, whether any other remedy is available under international law in this situation."
"I wish to add that my own political judgement with regard to this case is absolutely the same as that expressed by honourable Members in the debate."
"If US State aid rules apply in Kansas, that is certainly a practice that is not allowed here."
"However, fortunately or unfortunately, the State of Kansas is not part of the European Union."
"In particular this involves looking at the possibilities offered by the complaint procedure in the context of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, which state that OECD enterprises should refrain from seeking or accepting exemptions not contemplated in the statutory or regulatory framework related to environmental, health, safety, labour, taxation, financial incentives or other issues."
"It should be noted, however, that these guidelines and the recommendations that may result from the complaint procedure are not legally binding."
"As regards the WTO, the Commission is evaluating the compatibility of the measures taken in Kansas with the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures."
"These rules, while in principle allowing WTO members to decide on their own fiscal regime, prohibit tax exemptions when they directly promote exports."
"That is the case that we have to examine: whether the measures in Kansas directly promote exports."
"If so, they run against WTO rules."
"I wish to add a few general remarks on the role of the WTO in the area of environmental policy."
"Let me first stress that WTO members have explicitly recognised the importance of working towards sustainable development and making international trade and environmental policies mutually supportive."
"The European Union plays a particularly active role in this respect, but the work is not complete."
"WTO members are free to choose their own environmental policy at national, regional and, in the case of multilateral environmental agreements, global level."
"This also implies that any action against illegal breaches of existing regional, national or international environmental legislation should be taken at those levels."
"The appropriate answer to ‘environmental dumping’ at global level is, therefore, to enhance environmental governance by means of legally binding instruments such as multilateral environmental agreements, and the Commission is active in that field."
"As regards the other question raised, about harmful tax competition in the European Union, all EU Member States are committed to the code of conduct on business taxation."
"The code aims at combating specific tax measures that affect, or may affect, the location of business . Almost all the harmful tax measures identified following a peer review process have been or are in the process of being removed."
"More generally, the Commission’s tax policy aims at promoting the principles of the code towards third countries in order to tackle harmful tax competition on as wide a geographical basis as possible."
"In this respect, the Commission has already included a reference to the principles of the code in several international agreements with third countries and aims at including this reference in future agreements."
"Furthermore, the Commission supports the OECD efforts to remove harmful tax practices."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow the four Members who have already spoken by addressing to you another question on the problem under discussion."
"It was in 1992 that we joined with the United States in adopting the New Transatlantic Agenda, which provides for various dialogues, some of which work well, and others less so."
"We know that the business dialogue works very well, as does the consumer dialogue, but we have been noticing for many years that there are serious problems with the dialogue that is meant to bring employees together – the labour dialogue, as it is known."
"There are various reasons for this; to some degree, it has to do with the different traditions in America and Europe."
"The next summit is scheduled to be held in the summer, and, as a matter of urgency, I would ask you, when preparing it, to get together again with the Council and, as a Commission, to consider what you can do to support this dialogue."
"Although this is something that should be left to the trade unions, I have learned from experience that it will be necessary to review what we in the various European institutions can do to really keep this dialogue going or, perhaps, to resurrect it."
"I would have thought this example would be a good one for you to refer to in an attempt to revive this dialogue."
"I would, moreover, recommend that you raise the problem in the context of the business dialogue and talk to the businesses themselves in order to see whether it might not be possible to come to an understanding, so that the OECD guidelines to which you have referred are actually implemented in practice, rather than being set aside by various states – in this case Kansas, although any other might well have done likewise."
"That strikes me as enormously important, for, in a global context and with competition at international level certainly not becoming simpler, but rather more difficult, it is only right that the states operating within the OECD framework should actually play the game by the rules."
"Perhaps you might say where you stand on this point, and say whether or not you can consider including this as an item for discussion."
"If I might turn to the second point you addressed, that the Commission and the Council – like, I would add, this Parliament – have for many years been pressing for more intensive discussion within the WTO, and for it to include labour standards, environmental standards and social standards, let me say that it would appear to me to be right and proper – although I know it will be very difficult – to return to this issue during the current round, and I can assure you that this House will again refer to it in a resolution."
". Mr President, I would like to discuss this question by the Greens and, potentially punishable offences against the WTO apart, to address a couple of questions to its author."
"Mr Juncker, your question expresses the fear that the removal of barriers to trade might result in tax dumping."
"In it, you also make reference to subsidies undermining the multilateral trade system."
"Do you not believe that there is a connection between high taxes and high subsidies?"
"Do you assume that, in a world without tariffs – which are barriers to trade – and the competition to which they give rise, social and environmental standards would invariably and inevitably fall?"
"As you never fail to mention competition in the same breath as words like ‘harmful’ and ‘dumping’, are you afraid of it?"
"What does actually bring prosperity and jobs – the exchange of goods and services in open markets without barriers to trade or, instead, more fragmented markets with high barriers to trade?"
"Do you, like me, take the view that only a competitive national economy is in a position to comply with high environmental standards?"
"If so, should we then not abandon, once and for all, the constant pretence that low taxes and open markets amount to the same thing as low environmental and social standards?"
"I would also be interested to learn what the Commissioner thinks about this."
"– Good evening, Mr President. It is a pleasure to have a compatriot in the chair for this evening’s sitting."
"In the case before us, a British cellophane factory has been enticed to relocate to the State of Kansas, purely on the basis that that State has derogated fiscal and environmental legislation."
"Unfortunately, this is not an exception to the rule, because the rule itself has encouraged such action."
"This case, in common with the Alstom case that was discussed earlier, clearly illustrates a well-known problem, namely that of relocations for reasons of anti-social or anti-environmental competition."
"I could give you similar examples in Portugal."
"Indeed, the day before yesterday, workers came to Strasbourg from Yasaki Saltano, a firm that has two plants in Portugal, and 10 altogether in Europe."
"This Japanese multinational has employed 7 500 people in Portugal, yet today it employs half that number."
"Just yesterday the board issued the threat that without further government support 500 more workers would be laid off in August."
"It should be pointed out that this company was given land and infrastructure free of charge, that it had enjoyed Community funds for years, that the level of work-related diseases, such as arthritis, among its workers is abnormally high and that this is the argument used by the board not to issue redundancies but to persuade the sick to resign."
"Mr President, this lie has to come to an end some time."
"It is sad to see the Commission’s impotence in such cases, which shows that it has given up."
"The United States and the EU call one day for the end of protectionism at the World Trade Organisation, only the next day to reinstate it or establish comparable benefits based on unfair criteria."
"The breaking of protectionism must be accompanied by higher levels of social rights and tighter environmental controls."
"This is the alternative to the neoliberal order in which there will be no more Kansases to complain about."
"Mr President, I note with satisfaction that we have this evening debated issues that really ought, in fact, to be debated and decided upon in this House."
"It is, unfortunately, all too common for MEPs to devote themselves to debates and decision-taking that, according to the principle of subsidiarity, do not belong in this House. In this case, the matter is clear, however."
"The EU has a common trade policy."
"Parliament therefore has strong reasons for monitoring compliance with the rules governing global free trade."
"Such a system is the most important way of increasing prosperity in both poor and rich countries, but the system presupposes that individual countries and trading blocks will not engage in protectionism, which often takes the form of customs duties and other trade barriers."
"It may also take the form of subsidies or special rules for certain forms of production, designed to attract or retain activities that would otherwise not cope with international competition."
"Such issues are regulated by the WTO."
"I agree with the other speakers in the House who have demanded that the Commission as soon as possible take measures against countries and EU Member States that breach the WTO’s regulations."
"It is, however, important to be aware of the fundamental difference between permitted and prohibited instruments, or between production-friendly policy and dumping."
"It is not prohibited to choose a generally low level of tax in order to promote growth."
"What is forbidden is to favour selected companies or industries with tax benefits."
"That is called tax dumping."
"It is also permitted for a country to have relatively low ambitions in terms of environmental policy during a phase when the country is poor and has to give priority to growth."
"That is what today’s rich countries did when they were poor."
"What is prohibited is to allow special dispensations from current environmental requirements with a view to favouring individual companies or industries."
"That is known as environmental dumping."
"I propose that, in its analysis and in the measures it takes, the Commission clearly distinguish between legitimate rules for promoting growth and prosperity, and illegitimate dumping methods."
". Mr President, in view of the fact that Commissioner Verheugen has stated that the Commission is investigating whether the subsidies are directly promoting exports – which would be illegal – I should like to ask him, on behalf of the Commission, to write to the company to ask it to defer its decision on the plant closure, which is due within 15 days, until that has been established."
". I shall pass on that question to my colleague, Mr Mandelson, who is in charge of the file."
"I should like to say to Mrs Mann that I take note of and fully accept the recommendations."
"I will ensure that the issue is discussed at European-American business round tables and in other fora."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on discrimination against workers and companies from the new Member States in the EU internal market by Mr Protasiewicz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (B6-0173/2005)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in less than three weeks’ time it will be a year since the enlargement of the European Union."
"For millions of citizens of Central Europe, enlargement meant the fulfilment of dreams about a common Europe governed by fair principles and with equal opportunities for all."
"In preparation for enlargement the new countries opened their markets wide, allowing in a flow of Western companies, goods, services and workers."
"This often took place against a background of heated internal debate and despite strong protests by many groups, mainly those representing workers."
"The latter feared the loss of their jobs and argued strongly that national markets should be protected from unfair Western competition."
"Nonetheless, we felt that above all membership of the European Union meant being part of the common market in which freedom to undertake economic activity anywhere on the territory of the Union is guaranteed."
"At the same time, we were convinced that the European treaties laid down fair rules for all actors, regardless of their country of origin."
"Unfortunately, over the last 11 months there have been numerous instances of discrimination against entrepreneurs from the new countries wishing to undertake economic activity in some of the countries of the so-called old Union, and also against their employees."
"The most blatant cases of discrimination are taking place in the Netherlands, Austria and Italy."
"The legal systems of those countries allow companies and workers to be treated differently depending on whether they come from the so-called old Fifteen or the new Ten."
"A specific example is the requirement imposed on the latter to apply for permits for expatriate workers even before the start of economic activity."
"This is a very time-consuming procedure that can take up to six weeks in Austria, and the requirement is imposed only on companies and workers from the new countries."
"Economic entities from the old Fifteen are not required to present applications of this kind."
"Instead, they are simply required to notify the relevant authorities and provide them with a single sheet of information and a list of expatriate workers."
"They can begin to provide services immediately without any unnecessary delay."
"Should the authorities wish to undertake checks, these may take place whilst work is in progress, without interfering with the company’s economic activity."
"This is a clear example of discrimination sanctioned by national law, resulting in violation of the conditions for fair competition in the common Union market."
"There are also a number of other countries where although there are no formal discriminatory provisions, the administration and officials behave in such a way that, in practice, it is impossible for companies from the new Member States to exercise their activity freely."
"I have with me a collection of complaints from entrepreneurs who received particularly unfortunate treatment, even though they had complied with all the formal requirements."
"The kind of treatment both the owners of the firms and their workers were subjected to whilst their work was in progress includes having their hands stamped, being handcuffed, having dogs set on them and even being arrested for no good reason."
"I am sorry to have to say that Germany and France are countries where this kind of treatment is imposed all too often."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner what action the Commission intends to take to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Treaty regarding equal treatment for companies and citizens?"
"Has the Commission already undertaken an audit of the provisions in Member States with a view to ensuring a level playing field for economic entities from the new Member States?"
"If so, what was the outcome?"
"If not, when will this audit of legal provisions and practices be undertaken so as to prevent discrimination?"
"I should also like to draw attention to a view shared by a large number of my fellow Members. We feel that unless the Commission becomes actively involved in combating discrimination against companies and workers from the new Member States, we shall fail to achieve the economic objectives identified in the Lisbon Strategy."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that I trust the European Commission is aware of this situation."
"Commissioner Verheugen’s presence in the House today in his capacity as Vice-President of the Commission gives me reason to hope that this is indeed the case."
"Mr President, if there is anyone in this House who knows what the problems in the new Member States are like, it is I, having spent five years being responsible for enlargement, so you do not need to tell me about them."
"Turning to the case to which you have referred, the Commission has received complaints in respect of one particular Member State, which is accused of breaching Community law by requiring work permits for workers from the new Member States sent or to be sent to this Member State to perform services."
"The Commission has therefore taken the necessary action against this Member State, has sought to bring infringement proceedings against it, and will ensure that the situation is corrected."
"The Commission knows nothing of any other complaints."
"There have not, in particular, been any complaints relating to freedom of establishment, to which you have referred, and which was not implemented as recently as 1 May 2004, but rather as long ago as the mid-1990s."
"If you know of cases of discrimination in connection with the freedom of establishment, the Commission would be obliged if you would communicate that information."
"The only official complaints received by the Commission have to do with freedom of establishment in one single Member State, and the necessary action has been taken to deal with it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of equal treatment for entities from the various Member States is one of the cornerstones of the European Union."
"We are today discussing cases of discrimination against entrepreneurs and workers from the new Member States on the markets of old Europe."
"I should like to query if it is appropriate for the French administration to ask Polish entrepreneurs wishing to provide services in France in what way they think they are better and can therefore justify being allowed to operate in France."
"I have undertaken a good deal of research, and have found that in most cases entrepreneurs from SMEs in the new Member States rarely complain to the relevant authorities about the discrimination they have experienced."
"These entrepreneurs have only limited resources at their disposal and make a conscious decision not to engage in lengthy and expensive legal proceedings."
"They are simply afraid of further persecution by the host countries, given that the average entrepreneur is in a very weak position when pitted against the whole apparatus of the state."
"One of the tasks entrusted to us by our constituents is coming to the defence of the victims of discrimination."
"We are therefore guardians of the fundamental principles of the Union, and would do well to ask ourselves what condition Europe might come to be in if discrimination is not combated first."
"There are two issues of crucial importance to the future of the Union."
"One is the Lisbon Strategy and the other is the draft services directive."
"We all understand that discrimination paralyses the internal market and prevents it from operating properly, which in turn makes it impossible to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is therefore in all our interests to ensure that the internal market really does become a single economic entity free from discrimination."
"This cannot be achieved if numerous national barriers are erected."
"In conclusion, I should like to point out that the instances of discrimination on the internal market discussed in the House today are regrettable obstacles to our joint efforts to integrate."
"If we allow these obstacles to remain, we shall all have to suffer the consequences."
". Mr President, I would need two hours to detail the problems that migrant workers face coming into and working in Ireland."
"We have the reputation of being one of the most generous countries in terms of allowing access from the ten new Member States."
"That is true."
"There are many good employers in Ireland who treat their workers well."
"Unfortunately there are employers in Ireland who treat workers from the ten new countries appallingly."
"We have cases of workers being expected to work for 12 hours per day, 7 days a week for EUR 1 per hour."
"We have situations where the Polish Embassy is on record as saying that it has queues of people coming to it in tears, having been fired on the spot by employers who know that there is a queue of Polish workers waiting to take their jobs."
"The specific case I want to raise tonight relates to an actual case not in a Member State but in a candidate country: a Turkish company employing Turkish workers in Ireland that is engaged in the systematic defrauding of its employees."
"It has been transferring funds belonging to these workers to a Dutch bank, the account of which it controls. It is suspected that this company owns that bank."
"I want the Commissioner to investigate that case."
"I want the Commission to contact the Irish authorities to find out why it has taken a Member of Parliament to reveal the facts, despite the fact that we have a department responsible for investigating breaches of labour law."
"We have 21 inspectors covering the whole state, a deplorably small number."
"We need at least 100."
"I would also like the Commission to investigate whether Gama – the company to which I refer – is involved in money laundering and illegally shifting money that belongs to workers out of Ireland to a bank in the Netherlands which, it is claimed, it also owns."
"I want an investigation into this."
"It is not good enough for us to pat ourselves on the back and say that we are doing great things, creating competition, ensuring that people get work, when those same people are being exploited deplorably."
"It is not good enough."
"The Commission must accept its responsibility to ensure compliance with European legislation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of the economically backward countries such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland that joined the Union later, the Union adopted a consistent policy encouraging the development of entrepreneurship and competitiveness."
"Part of this policy involved facilitating access to the Union market, which led to an increase in the balance of trade of the countries in question."
"This was one of the key factors in the rapid increase in jobs, tax revenue for the countries, investment and, as a result, swift economic development."
"Easier access to the Community’s markets allowed the backward countries to significantly reduce the gap between themselves and the more developed countries."
"I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen: did the former Communist countries aspiring to the European Union enjoy the same opportunity?"
"The answer is that they did not."
"Instead of demonstrating a spirit of solidarity and providing aid, the Union exploited its own strength and capital advantage."
"It also took advantage of the submissiveness and corruption of leaders and delayed accession to extract further concessions."
"The clearest example of the above policy was the negative balance of trade between Poland and the European Union that was in excess of EUR 10 billion per annum."
"The new jobs and profits were created in the Union, not in Poland, but it was Poland that had to suffer increased unemployment and poverty."
"What did opening up their own market to Union companies mean to Polish companies?"
"What did accession to the Union mean to them?"
"Firstly, it meant unfair competition from companies enjoying technological and capital advantages."
"Secondly, it meant Polish businesses, banks and financial institutions being bought out for a pittance by Union concerns."
"Often the foreign concerns did not pay taxes or invest in Poland."
"Even worse, they transferred their benefits out of the country."
"Thirdly, it meant Poles had to make great sacrifices to modernise their companies and bear the considerable costs involved in order to comply with the Union’s requirements, standards and regulations."
"Fourthly, it meant agreeing to expensive and cumbersome bureaucratic and administrative procedures and also consenting to tax systems that made Polish firms less competitive and increased labour costs."
"VAT is one example of this."
"Fifthly, it meant consenting to quotas, limits and restrictions on production imposed by the Union either in relatively competitive and modern sectors such as the Polish shipbuilding industry, or in sectors producing high quality products, such as food."
"Almost a year has gone by since Poland became a Member of the Union, and it has turned out that despite all the restrictions and difficulties placed in their way, Polish companies have managed to be competitive, to export and to work better."
"This is also true of individuals."
"The reaction of governments and local administrations of Member States has been to resort to other measures in order to restrict access to Union markets by Polish businesses."
"Examples of such measures are the rules concerning the provision of services, which is the sector of the market responsible for 70% of gross GNP whilst creating virtually 100% of new jobs."
"The restrictions imposed on Polish companies and on the workers employed by them in the building industry are another example."
"To make things worse, these restrictive provisions are implemented by over zealous local officials."
"One could write a book about the persecution endured by Polish firms."
"Complaints lodged with the local authorities are not followed up."
"It comes as no surprise to learn that those same over zealous officials never take an interest in cases where Polish workers are underpaid or employed illegally, or when they fill unattractive jobs."
"The question that arises is what is the European Union and what does it aspire to?"
"Were all those slogans about solidarity, doing away with differences, accelerated development and the common market so much hot air?"
"Poland and the other former Communist states cannot give in any more to the European Union."
"They have given all they could."
"That is why Polish entrepreneurs are going to stand up for their country and we, the Polish Members of this House, will stand shoulder to shoulder with them."
"We are calling for swift and firm decisions to eliminate instances of discrimination and their causes."
"Our demands are not unreasonable."
"All we want is a level playing field and fair play for all."
"We shall fight until we win our case, even if that means the collapse of the European Union!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Protasiewicz for dealing with this matter."
"Mr Protasiewicz represents the same constituency as I do, and in fact there are four speakers from Lower Silesia, which makes it somewhat of a standard bearer for this cause."
"This is indeed praiseworthy, and I am glad of it."
"Not only did enlargement result in many economic benefits for the new Member States, it also led to enormous economic benefits for the Union as a whole, particularly as regards potential benefits."
"This happened because the new countries offered slightly lower taxes and slightly cheaper labour whilst at the same time the legal framework for conducting economic activity was stabilised thanks to integration."
"These countries are therefore providing opportunities for the European Union, not threats, as certain speakers have implied."
"This is the reason why we are alarmed at the situation whereby Polish, Czech, and Hungarian entrepreneurs are coming up against obstacles deliberately placed in their way by administrations, hindering their economic activity on the territory of the old Union."
"Unfortunately, all the ten countries are affected."
"Closing the common market to these entrepreneurs amounts to acting to the detriment of the new countries."
"It is also detrimental to integration because it undermines the level of trust the people of Europe have in the process of integration."
"Most importantly, however, it is detrimental to the well being of Europe."
"We all have in mind the conflict over taxes and social policy."
"We will not endorse the socialist view that competition between social or tax systems amounts to dumping and is detrimental to the well being of all Europeans."
"Either we adopt a pluralistic approach to taxation and social policy issues in Europe, or we shall lose out to trading partners located far further away than the new countries. I refer to China and India."
"The decision may be taken to continue keeping Polish and other entrepreneurs out, but it should be remembered that this will lead to Europe sinking deeper into the mire of economic stagnation."
"Instead of coming up with vague ideas for the harmonisation of different aspects of economic and tax law, the European Commission should focus on completing the basic task that has been outstanding for some 50 years, namely bringing about the common market."
"The Iron Curtain collapsed fifteen years ago, and people from Eastern Europe were sincerely looking forward to becoming equal partners, certainly after having met certain economic criteria."
"What is the truth today?"
"Mr Verheugen, along with many parliament members, was compassionately discussing here the problems caused by lay-offs in Alstom, mentioning the destiny of 250 employees."
"Dear Mr Verheugen, more than anyone else you should be aware that in Slovakia not hundreds, but thousands were left without jobs due to the reforms we had implemented to become a member of the European Union."
"To achieve this goal, Slovaks made great sacrifices."
"I believe no one regretted that – on becoming equal partners a year ago, we all rejoiced."
"At least we thought that way then."
"What is the truth today?"
"I firmly believe that the old fifteen members, and not us, were far from being prepared for enlargement."
"The free movement of goods in an eastward direction has indeed come true – today our shops are as nice as yours, and this is fine;"
"Slovaks do not need to go to the West to buy exclusive goods any more."
"But how do matters stand with the free movement of people?"
"Even though discrimination based on nationality is forbidden, preference in offering employment should be given to workers from new member states over workers from third countries."
"With the exception of three countries, all the others have imposed transitional provisions lasting from 2 to 7 years, with an option to reconsider the issues afterwards; and, as a consequence, these periods might even be extended."
"This further deepens the legal uncertainty of employees."
"We know perfectly well that, being in the West, our people – highly skilled members of the younger generation, educated and multilingual – are earning higher salaries, but under what social, and humanly unworthy, conditions."
"This is what I am asking you: please, also pay attention to this."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-known fact that both workers and businesses from the new Member States are discriminated against."
"This discrimination starts with the way that businesses from the old Member States and other developed countries act as though they had never heard of labour legislation while operating in Central European countries."
"Certain Czech supermarkets, for example, are renowned for their medieval working conditions for check-out assistants, with people regularly being sacked during the three-month probationary period."
"There are many other examples of such abuses, with the ban on trade unions, which of course is not officially set down in writing anywhere, being particularly worthy of mention."
"Shopping chains also adopt typically colonial attitudes towards their suppliers, and the long payment periods, advertising charges, shelf fees and extremely low prices they impose have already been criticised on numerous occasions."
"These practices are commonplace in Central and Eastern European countries, and it is also normal for little space to be allocated to goods from local suppliers, for suppliers to be required to provide monetary deposits before starting to supply goods, and for them to have to supply goods at any time of the day, seven days a week."
"There are therefore a great many issues that remain to be resolved with regard to working conditions in the new Member States."
"At the same time, however, workers from the new Member States find it extremely difficult to gain recognition for their qualifications when they arrive in the old Member States, despite the fact that international agreements have been concluded on this matter."
"Trained nurses from the Czech Republic and Slovakia regularly work as trainee nurses in the old Member States and are paid accordingly, even though they are overqualified for such jobs."
"Similarly, it is rare for our skilled craftsmen to have passed any state-recognised exams, and this means that they are classed as unskilled workers in accordance with their wages, regardless of the work they have actually done."
"This is particularly the case in the building trade."
"The recognition of university qualifications is also a major problem, and current legislation leaves much to be desired in this respect."
"By way of example, the three laws in force in the Czech Republic on the matter are far from perfect."
"It is high time that something was done about this state of affairs, and I am therefore calling on the European Commission and on Mr Verheugen to put forward a proposal outlining appropriate legislative measures."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Thank you."
"In this Chamber President Barroso has stressed the importance of the Lisbon Strategy and the urgent need to establish the free flow of services, just the latest of the key features of the European Union’s internal market."
"On the one hand therefore, there is a clear desire to remove barriers so as to achieve the best possible functioning of the internal market, while on the other hand we new Member States have observed that our companies are frequently in an unequal position."
"For instance restriction of corporate enterprise in the internal market is exercised in the area of the production and installation of machinery and equipment, in the area of metal constructions, building work, decorating, processing of natural stone and so on."
"Commissioner, you have said that you are familiar with the difficulties in the new Member States."
"Yet today we are not talking about these difficulties, but rather about difficulties in the old Member States."
"You have said that the Commission will take action against violations."
"We would of course be glad to know when this will happen, and what the results of such action will be."
"The extent of discriminatory behaviour is clearly very great, while the effectiveness of those that should be ensuring adherence to the Community acquis is poor."
"I have the feeling, Commissioner, that the new Member States of the European Union were much better prepared for membership of the EU and for its enlargement than the European institutions."
"I would be glad to hear your opinion on this."
"Mr President, I should like to start by warmly congratulating you on your election and on your first appearance as Vice-President."
"Commissioner, the outcome of today’s debate could not come at a better time for the many business people and citizens who believe that everyone has equal rights in the enlarged EU, and who want to sell their most valuable asset, namely their own labour, in the old Member States."
"Yet there are many people who no longer wish to work in the European Union."
"These people have already attempted to do so, but have been treated unequally and come up against government and local authorities that commit violations of law."
"These violations take the form of over-enthusiastic checks, frequently involving dogs and policemen, or arrests during which individuals’ hands are stamped and they are handcuffed."
"This is an infringement of their personal rights."
"These companies and individuals will never wish to work or provide services again in the old Member States."
"Is this what the market for services and labour is to look like in the United Europe?"
"As representatives of our constituents, we are duty bound to defend their rights in the EU."
"I have not heard of a single instance of people being treated in this way in Poland, even though many thousands of foreign firms operate in the country, and a large part of industry and the majority of banks are controlled by foreign capital."
"Polish organisations, business people, ministries and embassies are regularly informed of cases in which Polish firms and Polish citizens who provide services as subcontractors to European businesses have been discriminated against."
"The case of the Apola company, which is based in Poznan, is a prime example of such discrimination, and one of the many that have come to my attention."
"The company’s employees and representatives were intimidated, arrested and persecuted by the French police and authorities in the Gard region."
"In many cases, such behaviour stems from the fact that the officials are human, or rather inhuman, and insufficiently acquainted with the rules."
"We bear no general grudge against nations or governments in this respect, but the issue should be discussed in this House, and it is for this reason that today’s debate should be followed up by a resolution in which such violations of the law are condemned."
"Finally, I should like to highlight one more instance of discrimination on the basis of nationality."
"It relates to new requirements brought in by the European Commission, which only apply to Polish nurses and midwives."
"The latter are now required to have worked for at least five out of seven years in order to obtain a certificate confirming their qualifications, without which they cannot work as nurses or midwives in the EU."
"Citizens of all the other 24 Member States are only required to have worked for three out of five years."
"As well as depriving these nurses and midwives of the chance to work and of their previous rights, these requirements, which are enshrined in European legislation, are an insult to their professional dignity."
"I have been waiting for an answer from the Commission on this matter for several weeks, and several hundred thousand nurses and midwives are waiting for a response to the petition they submitted to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU economy is in poor shape, with the French and German economies having been hit hardest, and it would appear that more or less everyone is to blame for this state of affairs."
"The United States are to blame for the excessively low dollar exchange rate, the Far East for using slave labour and the new Member States for pursuing genuinely healthy and competitive economic policies."
"New words are even being invented that are classic examples of Orwellian newspeak."
"To reiterate a point made by Mr Szymański, for example, the word ‘dumping’, with all its negative connotations, is being used instead of just talking about healthy economic competition."
"Even though the draft Bolkestein directive had many merits, all the advocates of what is known as a ‘social economy’ took umbrage at it when it was tabled."
"Angry mutterings from Paris and Berlin were all that was needed to ensure that this excellent draft directive was thrown out."
"Other approaches are possible, of course, and one of these is discrimination."
"The latter is in fact very much in evidence, as noted by the previous speakers, who gave a long list of individuals and businesses that have experienced it."
"Commissioner Verheugen is highly regarded in Poland, and this is something I should like to stress, yet I find his claims that he has only received a complaint concerning one country astonishing."
"In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I have drawn up a long list of cases of discrimination, and I forwarded this list to Commissioner Verheugen, to the Dutch Presidency and to Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I find it regrettable that Commissioners are incapable of exchanging such information between themselves."
"If Commissioner Verheugen, who is extremely popular in Poland, as I mentioned, claims to know nothing about the matter, then that leaves us at a loss."
"If no exchange of information takes place within the Commission, then to whom should we forward this information?"
"The Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact were intended to turn the EU economy into the world’s leading economy, yet they failed to do so."
"Now we are hearing enigmatic statements to the effect that the aim is merely to turn the EU economy into one of the world’s leading economies, even though there is a fundamental difference between these two goals."
"This House has heard numerous complaints about the closure of the Bridgwater Cellophane Plant in the UK, with production being moved to Kansas."
"This is the choice you have, ladies and gentlemen: either you allow companies to move production to Poland, the Czech Republic or Slovakia, or they will move it to Kansas or the Far East."
"Internal solidarity and external competitiveness were intended to be the foundations upon which Europe is built."
"Neither has been achieved, and we find this regrettable."
"As the American Indian saying goes, if you find out that your mount is an ageing mare instead of a mustang, then you should stop riding it immediately."
"I would urge you to stop riding an ageing mare in the shape of an inefficient European Union social economy, with France and Germany leading the way in inefficiency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two Europes in existence today, an old, high-class EU and a new, low-class EU."
"The first of these is inconsiderate, short-sighted and sets little store by competitiveness."
"In other words, it is cutting off the branch on which it sits."
"The second may well have been given an official invitation to dine at the EU’s table, but in actual fact it is discriminated against."
"If your aim is to pit these two Europes against each other, then you should continue with your present course of action."
"I am curious to see what the outcome of the constitutional referendums in the Czech Republic and Poland will be."
"Those are two unrelated issues, I hear you say."
"Officially they are, but how do you intend to persuade the citizens of the new EU Member States that this is the case?"
"You are asking the EU’s younger relatives to support the Constitution for a united Europe, at the same time as warning them to keep their distance from the united EU market."
"This is an extremely short-sighted attitude, and those countries, governments, societies and companies that subscribe to it are boosting Euroscepticism in Europe."
"Instead of overcoming the old divisions, they are creating new ones."
"We cannot even comfort ourselves with the thought that this is merely individual nations or industries being selfish, as it is in fact the same old stupidity we are used to, with all the disastrous consequences it has in both political and economic terms."
"It is an extremely unwise course of action, for consumers in the old EU Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to sober up."
"Mr President, as we have heard in this House today, there are quite a few examples of it still being easier for a hammer to cross the Baltic than it is, for example, for a joiner to accompany it and drive in the nail."
"I am therefore delighted about the draft Services Directive whereby we shall shortly be able to talk about four freedoms – freedom of movement for goods, services, people and also capital – and not, as at present, about only three."
"Under the current Treaty, a number of the things that, for example, go on in my own home country, Sweden, involving state-sanctioned and express discrimination against people from the new Member States are, however, completely unacceptable."
"Allow me to offer a very short but extremely frightening and, unfortunately, far from unique example of the way in which trade unions and authorities together deny the EU’s new Member States access to the internal market."
"The Swedish case began with a local authority having to build a school and, because they followed the European rules on public tendering, a Latvian construction company (LP-Bygg) was engaged."
"Soon, the construction workers’ union was there, blocking access to the work place, halting the work, carrying placards and chanting ‘Go home, go home’ Their reason for doing this, they maintained, was that the Latvian company was responsible for signing a specifically Swedish collective agreement and that the Latvian one was not valid, despite the fact that it paid better than the Swedish one."
"The decision had been taken: the Latvians should leave."
"The company had recourse to the authorities, and the Labour Market Tribunal, on which the union sits, obviously adopted a position in favour of the trade union movement."
"Our Minister for Employment – and recent head of the trade union movement - also adopted a position in favour of the trade union movement."
"It is at such moments that I am ashamed of being Swedish."
"Exactly one week ago, the Latvian company was forced into bankruptcy."
"As a result, we have school children without a school, taxpayers with additional tax to pay and unemployed Latvians."
"All so that the cartel in the Swedish labour market can continue to operate."
"Strengthened by its successes, the union is now, with the government’s support, conducting a campaign around the country, demanding that people who ‘do not look like proper Swedes should carry clear ID badges’."
"That is unacceptable, and I wonder what the Commission intends to do to put a stop to this racism and protectionism that are rife in Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, reference has been made in this House on many previous occasions to problems relating to discrimination against workers and companies from the new Member States on the EU internal market."
"I myself drew the House’s attention to the issue over seven months ago, yet I regret to say that nothing has changed since then."
"It is for this reason that we have heard so many Members from the new Member States speak again today about blatant violations of EU legislation in this respect."
"In addition to the so-called transitional periods that were imposed upon the 10 new Member States, the old Member States are placing an increasing number of legal and administrative obstacles in our way."
"Such practices encroach upon the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, both of which apply to any entity that is legally registered in the European Union and both of which are enshrined in the Treaty."
"Evidence already exists of a great many instances in which discriminatory provisions, which again run counter to EU legislation, are to be found in the national legislation of the old Member States."
"The fervent opposition voiced by countries such as France, Belgium and Germany during debates on the liberalisation of services, as detailed in the Bolkestein directive, is further evidence of attempts to discriminate against companies from the new Member States."
"I find it quite astonishing that countries that agreed to the enlargement of the European Union and to integration with Central and Eastern European countries, knowing that the aim of such integration was to create a single and powerful socio-economic unit, are now standing in the way of efforts to achieve this aim."
"This was not the kind of EU we voted in favour of in the referendums held before last year’s enlargement."
"I would therefore call on the European Commission to take action and to make known its views on the issue, and also to take the appropriate steps to stop discriminatory practices against the new Member States."
". Mr President, honourable Members, let me repeat that the Commission has received official complaints only in respect of one single Member State."
"The Commission cannot take action on the basis of having picked up this or that here or there; if it is to act, a formal complaint has to be made."
"Every Member of this House is familiar with the rules."
"To those honourable Members who have, today, spoken of hundreds of cases of discrimination, the only thing I can say is that they should advise those who believe themselves to have been discriminated against to submit a formal complaint."
"The Commission will follow up every single case, as it is obliged to do so."
"I really would ask you not to throw accusations at me to the effect that the Commission has not considered any complaints other than those against this one Member State."
"I ask you not to doubt the truth of what I am telling you."
"If I tell you that we have received complaints directed only at one country, then that is indeed the case."
"See to it, then, that those who believe they have been discriminated against go down the appropriate channels, and then action will be taken."
"The Commission has already taken the necessary action to deal with the Member State in respect of which a complaint has been made."
"I did not say that we would do something; we already have, and the upshot of that is that these problems are being resolved."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Krahmer on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their re-usability, recyclability and recoverability and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC (COM(2004)0162 – C5-0126/2004 – 2004/0053(COD)) (A6-0004/2005)"
". Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is much obliged to Mr Krahmer for his report and for his unusual and considerable personal commitment to first reading of the directive on recycling."
"I would like to start by recalling how the draft directive is based on the provisions of the directive on end-of-life vehicles, which your House and the Council adopted in September 2000, and which contains very ambitious goals for the recycling and reuse industry to achieve by 2015."
"If we are to ensure that these targets can be met, then the car manufacturers have their own contribution to make, and hence we are calling on them to build cars whose components are better able to be recycled and reused, right from the very moment at which they roll off the production line."
"Many of the proposed amendments are significant in policy terms."
"The most important has to do with the ban on the use of heavy metals."
"The report inserted a clause making it mandatory to ascertain that the manufacturer has used none of the heavy metals prohibited by the end-of-life vehicles directive."
"This is an initiative that the Commission welcomes, in that it makes it possible to apply the provisions of the end-of-life vehicles directive systematically and uniformly, instead of leaving it to the Member States to enact national laws that might well differ one from another."
"This obviates interference with the smooth operation of the internal market."
"Although the dates by which this directive was to be implemented, a core element in it, presented plenty of difficulties, this issue, too, eventually proved capable of resolution."
"It is now proposed that the directive be implemented in two stages, and the Commission endorses not only this proposal, but also the administrative simplifications that your House has proposed;"
"I might perhaps sum up by saying that the Commission unreservedly endorses the amendments proposed by Parliament and looks forward to this text being adopted without delay."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, for their good and constructive cooperation."
"Some 15 million motor vehicles come off the production lines in the EU every year, and the motor industry is one of the most important business sectors in Europe, creating jobs, encouraging innovation and vital in terms of our competitiveness."
"Cars, though, also produce waste, and that is what we are discussing this evening."
"Every year in Europe, ten million vehicles end up on the scrapheap."
"If cars are not piled up as high in scrap yards as they used to be and are less of a blot on the landscape, that has something to do with the considerable extent to which parts of cars can be reused and recycled."
"The objective of the motor vehicle type approval directive is to lay down provisions whereby motor cars and light commercial vehicles can be constructed in such a way that they meet the minimum quotas laid down in the end-of-life vehicles directive in respect of reusability, recyclability and recoverability."
"The end-of-life vehicles directive imposed binding targets on manufacturers."
"With effect from 2006, at least 85% by mass of a car – and with effect from 2015 at least 95% of it by mass – must be recoverable and reusable or capable of being recycled."
"These – the 95% from 2015 onwards in particular – are very ambitious targets, for they would mean that the cars of the future would produce scarcely any waste."
"Whether or not this goal is achieved will depend not only on the manufacturer’s use of certain materials, but also and primarily on the further development of recycling technology and on the definition of recyclability."
"There is nevertheless no disputing the fact that the recyclability of automobiles and the avoidance of waste are important objectives for Europe’s environmental policies."
"It is astonishing, however, that cars contribute only 1% of the total quantity of waste in the EU."
"The EU has made a particularly good job of minimising waste not only from packaging, electronic scrap and batteries, but also from used cars."
"Let me now turn to the core issues."
"Although the Commission put forward an eminently respectable proposal for a directive, it was necessary for us in this House to make a number of improvements to it."
"Following the committee’s vote and a successful trilogue, we have put together a compromise package for agreement at first reading, backed by the three main groups in this House."
"This being what one might call my maiden report, I, as rapporteur, regard that as a major success."
"Our joint amendments, on which we will be voting tomorrow, are aimed above all at improving the way in which the directive will be implemented, without jeopardising the achievement of the recycling targets, which are so important in terms of environmental policy."
"Type approval is meant to be practicable from the point of view of the competent authorities in the Member States and of the manufacturers, and to entail the minimum possible costs."
"The amendments also take into account important aspects of best practice in type-approval. As rapporteur, I have from the very outset been particularly concerned to maintain the distinction between the testing of new types and new models."
"New models are defined as automobiles that are already on the market in the EU – there are currently about 600 of them – while new types are automobiles that will come onto the market in the future, approximately 100 a year."
"The intention is that priority be given to the testing of new types."
"Neither the authorities nor the manufacturers would be capable of doing what the Commission envisaged in its original proposal, namely testing all models in the EU within 36 months of the directive’s entry into force."
"The testing of new types must be given priority in order to ensure that all of those coming onto the EU market in the future comply with the binding targets as imposed by the end-of-life vehicles directive, and so the 36-month time limit proposed by the Commission should apply to new types, enabling the models already in existence to be tested thereafter."
"We have agreed in this House – and with the Council – on a period of 54 months, corresponding to the arithmetical mean between what the Commission originally proposed and the 72 months that I originally put forward, which itself corresponds to the life-cycle of an average automobile."
"The definition of ‘reference vehicle’ is another case in point."
"It is good practice and avoids misunderstandings if the authority and the manufacturer select the type by mutual agreement."
"‘Reference vehicle’ means the vehicle that is most problematic in terms of re-usability, recyclability and recoverability."
"Turning to the ban on heavy metals, I am glad to be able to say that we have been able to agree that the prohibition of heavy metals should be referred to under the heading of the preliminary assessment rather than that of type-approval, where it does not belong."
"It is in any case my view that the Commission had good reasons for refraining from banning heavy metals in its original proposal, for heavy metals are already prohibited by many other items of legislation."
"We did have a problem with one amendment from the Council, which reached us, so to speak, just before close of play, and which was intended to permit the comitology procedure through another back door."
"Parliament fought to get amendments to the end-of-life vehicles directive treated as legislation rather than as implementing measures, and so we could not accept the possibility of making technical adjustments to the end-of-life vehicles directive without reference to this House."
"I am glad that, in the trilogue, the Council and the Commission eventually agreed to that."
"This is a step in the right direction, towards more democracy and transparency in the process whereby European laws are made."
"Let me close by returning to the subject of regulation."
"Automobiles are, in the EU, regulated to an extraordinary degree."
"When enacting legislation, we must always consider that it will have to be implemented in places that are a long way from Brussels and Strasbourg."
"We have to consider the businesses that will ultimately be affected by it."
"Commissioner Verheugen, what I now say is addressed to you personally."
"I particularly welcome your initiative where the assessment of legislation’s impact is concerned and am glad that, in your role as industry commissioner, you have rediscovered your liberal roots."
"It is important that new directives and regulations, particularly those relating to the protection of the environment and of consumers, should in future be subject to checks to ascertain what effect they have on competitiveness."
"Existing directives must be examined in order to be capable of being implemented quickly in the Member States."
"When considering future regulations, though, we must, as a matter of priority, ensure that they really do help to protect the environment rather than entailing more bureaucracy."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your kind words."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see that the presence of the acting President means that the MEPs’ team is one man up on the Commission’s."
"That is in any case quite astonishing on an evening like this."
"Mr Krahmer has described his report with great clarity and very comprehensively, and I do not propose to go through it in detail again."
"I just want to say that it is, ultimately, the amendments that have made this report, which we are sending on its way, the work of us all, for we told Mr Krahmer that our discussions with the Council and the Commission had resulted in agreement, thanks to the amendments which essentially constitute the heart of this report."
"I am sure that a large majority will tomorrow give its backing to this report, for the three major groups have endorsed it."
"This directive takes as its basis the used cars directive and has a preventive effect, enabling the automobile industry to guarantee recyclability in the future."
"It is a huge triumph if 95% of a car is capable of being recycled or reused, and a positive quantum leap if one thinks back to the first debates that we had back at the beginning of the 1990s."
"I am also very grateful to the automobile industry for helping to put this directive together, for communication with this industry – one of enormous importance for Europe – is vital if long-term competitiveness is to be guaranteed."
"I am also sure that those who at present export to us from South-East Asia, as well as those in China and elsewhere from whom we will be importing vehicles in future, will be obliged to abide by these rules and apply them."
"It will be difficult enough to implement and monitor these preventive measures there, but it will send an important message about how to continue to compete across the board with the European automobile industry."
". Mr President, tomorrow we will be approving an amended proposal that will ensure that motor vehicles are designed so that they can be recycled properly at the end of their life cycle."
"The need to take account of the end of the life cycle when designing new motor vehicles has its origins in the early 1990s, in the Netherlands amongst others, when bilateral agreements were concluded between manufacturers and the authorities."
"European manufacturers have now gained a huge amount of experience of recycling."
"The manufacturers estimate the costs of the recycling obligation at an average of EUR 30 per vehicle, but the industry will very quickly recoup these costs."
"The prices of raw materials are rising explosively, mainly because of the huge demand from China."
"Rising costs of raw materials are making recycling particularly profitable."
"With this environmental innovation Europe is also gaining an edge on its competitors, because there are no recycling regulations in either Japan or the United States."
"Our group can accept the amended proposal and in any event heartily thanks the rapporteur."
"I would like to offer the apologies of the shadow rapporteur who could not be here this evening."
"I would like to take the opportunity today to look at the motor industry in rather broader terms."
"At the beginning of this year the High Level Group on CARS 21was set up."
"The role of this High Level Group is to formulate recommendations for the European motor industry."
"Above all this is about competitiveness and employment, but also safety and environmental performance."
"Let me say first that I am a great advocate of the sectoral approach."
"The Lisbon process must be put into practice within sectors."
"With the CARS 21 initiative the European Commission is moving in the right direction, but I am afraid that the setting up of the High Level Group at the end of the journey will prove to be nothing more than a deregulation operation for the benefit of the motor industry, the scrapping of tiresome rules in the area of environment and social protection under the guise of improvements in competitiveness."
"I would therefore urge that we look further ahead and to show more ambition because environment and competitiveness are not inconsistent with one another; on the contrary, they reinforce one another."
"A branch of industry that constantly achieves better environmental performance improves its worldwide competitive position."
"I am convinced that environmentally friendly motor vehicles are essential for a viable European motor industry."
"This is why I have taken the initiative to set up a Low Level Group on Cars."
"In the spirit of the Lisbon objective employment, competitiveness and a cleaner environment will take centre stage in the Low Level Group."
"Together with interested fellow Members I shall be drafting a number of recommendations that I shall present to the responsible commissioners and to the High Level Group in July."
"Which way should the European motor industry go?"
"The motor sector has gradually made a lot of progress in the area of environment and safety, but is that the right way for the future?"
"I think that we must reflect together in Europe on the motor vehicle of the future."
"This motor vehicle will in any event be lighter, smaller, more economic and more efficient."
"It will also be the basis of a modern, competitive and environmentally friendly motor industry."
"The rising prices of raw materials are making recycling and reuse of materials profitable and the technological progress in this area can contribute greatly to a good competitive position for the European motor industry."
"Mr President, for one moment, I thought you had forgotten me."
"It is to me that the honour falls of being the last speaker and bringing today’s long sitting of the House to an end."
"Let me remind you that today has seen us voting – favourably, as it turned out – on Bulgaria and Romania, both of which possess major motor industries and are directly affected by the directive we are discussing."
"This proposal is of immediate relevance to product-based environmental protection, as members of the public use motorcars and light utility vehicles almost every day."
"I would also like to point out that we have laid down rules elsewhere – in particular in the exhaust gas regulations – applicable to immediate effects on the environment, and to ask the Commission to get to work quickly, particularly where the Euro 5 exhaust gas standard is concerned, in order that these exhaust gases may be reduced in Europe too."
"I would remind them of the fine dust that is now polluting German cities in particular and is causing a number of problems."
"While the approach chosen is one that is, in principle, to be welcomed, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats saw certain points as being particularly important."
"For a start, it is self-evident that the requirements for the components to be used must not present any risk to the public – by which we mean both drivers and pedestrians."
"It follows that the materials used must be both recyclable and safe, which does of course also mean that there is a need for more intensive materials research in Europe if we are to retain our leading position on the world market."
"Secondly, the procedures and rules must be straightforward, transparent and practicable."
"What that means is that the authorities and car manufacturers must consult together in choosing one vehicle as being representative, in that it presents the greatest problems in terms of pollution."
"It makes no sense and would no doubt also be too bureaucratic to repeat the whole test on vehicles with only a few additional features."
"Deadlines must be ambitious but also, of course, realistic, for it would make little sense to require too many alterations to existing models that are already reaching the end of their economic life cycle."
"This sort of environmental protection makes sense and can benefit both the public and industry."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"I am grateful to all of the speakers and to the Vice-President of the Commission for their participation."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0036/2005 - B6-0168/2005) by Mr Sifunakis, on combating doping in sport."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's oral question and the related motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture and Education on combating doping in sport follows on from extended efforts by the European Parliament."
"I would merely remind you that the first initiative by the European Parliament on doping was the resolution of 7 September 2000 on the Commission communication on a Community support plan to combat doping in sport and that the last major initiative was the public hearing organised by our committee just last November, entitled 'Drug-taking in sport: obstacle to the ideal of athleticism', at which a large number of invited experts gave their views."
"This public hearing was held after the Olympic Games in Athens, which demonstrated once again that doping in sport continues, unfortunately, to be a real and worsening phenomenon."
"It is worth noting that we had 22 incidents of athletes who tested positive during doping controls at the Athens Olympics, which was twice the number at Sidney."
"Today's oral question relating to the motion for a resolution is the result of these previous initiatives and of the acute concern in our committee about the proportions which doping has taken on today in a bid to increase athletic performances."
"The problem is two-fold."
"On the one hand, doping is contrary to the ideals of athleticism, as put forward in the Olympic Charter on sport."
"The spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play – in other words all the values which make sport a social, cultural and educational activity – are obviously irreconcilable with doping, the aims of which are to cheat and to acquire riches and fifteen minutes of fame."
"On the other hand, doping is dangerous to the health of the athletes who take recourse to banned substances, often in knowledge of the inherent dangers."
"I should like here to comment in particular on the fact that chemical substances are used not only by professional athletes, but also by a large number of amateurs."
"According to a recent study by the European Commission, 6% of young people who train in fitness centres, in other words more than four million young people, use 'pharmaceutical' substances in a bid, of course, to enhance their performance."
"We believe that coordinated action by the Member States is vital in order to develop common methods for controlling and certifying the use of these so-called 'pharmaceutical' substances. At the same time, account must be taken of the fact that many of these substances are also sold via the Internet."
"It would also be advisable if widely available preparations carried labels stating that they were anabolic substances."
"We are, I believe, all in agreement on these issues. We all share the conviction that specific action is needed to combat this dramatic phenomenon."
"Consequently:"
"- taking account of the fact that the issue of doping is primarily a public health issue,"
"- likewise taking account of the fact that the Constitutional Treaty provides an appropriate legal basis to draw up and implement Community action,"
"- and again given the fact that, according to a survey by Eurobarometer, four out of five citizens believe that the European Union should take action to combat doping,"
"· we call on the Commission to tell us what initiatives it intends to take today to combat doping in sport:"
"· How does it intend to inform European public opinion, especially young people involved in amateur sports, about the very serious dangers inherent in the use of banned pharmaceutical substances?"
"· How does it intend, especially in cooperation with the Member States, to point out these dangers through education, given that raising awareness among young people, who are the most vulnerable group, starts at school?"
"· Does the Commission intend to finance, within the framework of the Seventh Framework Programme, research programmes into new, effective methods for detecting the use of banned pharmaceutical substances?"
"· How, finally, does it intend to cooperate with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation, as well as with the Member States, in order to guarantee the success of the actions required?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today we are calling on the European Commission to take immediate action to ensure that the present situation improves quickly."
"Mr President, I have been asked by Commissioner Figeľ to represent him here this morning. He very much regrets that he is unable to be here himself."
"Let me start by saying that the fight against doping remains a major concern for the Commission and one that we are determined to address."
"The Commission has taken this task very seriously and has promoted initiatives within its areas of responsibility."
"However, the European Community Treaty clearly does not provide for harmonisation in this specific area and, therefore, our actions will have to be guided by the legal framework within which we operate."
"In this difficult task, we thank the European Parliament for its continued support, and in particular its Committee on Culture and Education, which has been following this issue very closely."
"Doping has been on the Commission’s agenda for some time."
"In 1998, the European Council invited the Commission to submit a Community support plan to combat doping in sport."
"The support plan formed the basis for pilot projects for a period of two years on the fight against doping between 2000 and 2002."
"Around half of these projects concerned research, the other half information and education."
"The European Parliament actively supported this plan."
"Three of the pilot projects concerned the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"An external evaluation, carried out by an independent consultancy, gave a favourable opinion on the type of actions undertaken."
"The pilot projects were a positive and encouraging network-building exercise for all those involved."
"Secondly, apart from co-financing pilot projects, the Commission financed three studies on doping-related issues."
"Thirdly, the Commission continues to liaise closely with international organisations in this field, in particular the Council of Europe."
"In addition to these actions, important work has also been carried out by DG Research."
"The Commission is pleased to see that Parliament continues to have a strong interest in this topic."
"For instance, the hearing of 29 November 2004 organised by Parliament’s Committee on Culture was a major event during which representatives of the sport movement made encouraging statements."
"At the hearing, Mr Figeľ underlined that, provided that appropriate funding could be made available, action could be envisaged in three fields: research, information and education."
"These proposals would represent a natural sequel to the work undertaken by the Commission in 2000-2002."
"This is the way forward, given the absence of a specific legal basis to fight doping in sport."
"It would be premature to present more concrete proposals in the current environment, given the fact that these proposals depend on the budgetary situation."
"Subject to the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the Commission will have a basis – the new Article III-282 – to develop the European dimension in the field of sport."
"In particular, it would enable us to promote initiatives on the moral and physical integrity of young sportspeople."
"It is, however, important to prepare the implementation of this new provision carefully."
"The Commission is committed to working closely with all interested parties in order to meet this challenge."
"What can be done in order to lay the groundwork for the Constitution’s eventual entry into force?"
"To answer that, let me return to the points that Mr Figeľ made at the hearing of 29 November 2004."
"The first point Mr Figeľ mentioned referred to actions in the field of education."
"Here, substantial contributions would already be possible on the basis of areas for which the Community is already responsible."
"Around half of the anti-doping pilot projects that received Community funding 2000-2002 were education-based."
"We are currently examining the possibility of integrating doping-related issues into the Commission’s activities in the field of education."
"The second point related to actions in the field of information."
"In fact, amongst the three studies on doping carried out in 2000-2001, one looked at the possibilities for a pan-European anti-doping campaign."
"This drew on experience from campaigns of this nature carried out in some Member States."
"Therefore, substantial preparatory work is already available."
"But it is important to note that such an initiative could not possibly be carried out without an autonomous, earmarked financial instrument."
"Mr Figel’s third point dealt with actions in the field of research."
"There is already material to build on in this area."
"The Commission has helped to foster network-creation between eminent specialists in the field."
"In the absence of a specifically dedicated financial instrument, it may be possible to integrate anti-doping research more firmly and more visibly into existing Commission activities."
"Funding has been provided by the Commission via its research budget, including the recent CAFDIS and HARDOP projects."
"We now have to start looking to the future."
"This is why Mr Figel’ has initiated discussions with Mr Potočnik to see whether there is room for synergies between the work of our respective services."
"Finally, the Commission will continue to liaise with international organisations and to support the role played by the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"The Commission believes that the relevant players have a moral duty to join this fight."
"To conclude, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its continued support."
"It will remain crucial for the Commission’s current and future work in the field of sport and will play a key role to ensure the well-needed progress in the fight against doping."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative by the European Parliament, as expressed in the motion for a resolution on doping by the Committee on Culture and Education, is an important step forward and a direct plea to all the jointly responsible agencies to combat this phenomenon in a more substantive and effective manner."
"I feel optimistic about the future, because my tremendous awareness of the war on the scourge which threatens our young people and which has been the subject of questions and speeches in the past is today echoed by my honourable friends."
"We must not forget that doping does not only concern professional athletes."
"On the contrary, it constitutes a threat which is growing constantly, both because of the constant increase in the range of recipients, which includes amateurs and young people throughout the world, and because of the emergence of newly developed products which change hands through various and constantly multiplying channels, such as gyms, the Internet, pharmacies and the ordinary postal service."
"May I remind you that turnover from the trade in anabolic substances exceeds two billion euros per annum in Europe and approximately six billion euros per annum in the entire world."
"The European Commission must step up its cooperation with the competent organisations and support a mechanism for combating the problem, which will include the necessary research, proper information, education and the promotion of clean sport, with the objective of protecting public health and defending athletic ideals."
"The Treaty establishing a Constitution allows for more satisfactory implementation of this objective, while the European Union should take account of the problem when adopting and implementing any policies which come within its jurisdiction."
"The European Union must take immediate action and must not forget this major scourge of young people, which is threatening children throughout the world."
". Mr President, I believe that at this stage we all agree that combating doping is not just a question of cleaning up sporting competitions, but also of promoting the health of our fellow citizens."
"Combating doping in sport must therefore clearly be one of our political objectives, as it is in many of our countries."
"I would like to deal with this issue by insisting on the need to provide anti-doping research with a European dimension."
"Some countries of the European Union have already included research programmes in their anti-doping plans, both with regard to what may be considered the new doping substances and their effects on the human body, and with regard to the possibility of providing laboratories with better and more appropriate instruments for detecting these substances."
"In other countries, such as my own, Spain, the government has already announced specific research programmes to be included in the national R+D plan."
"But this issue obviously has a clear international dimension, and it is therefore very important for the European Union also to support the inclusion of anti-doping research in our research and development plans."
"I proposed this to Commissioner Potočnik at his first hearing with our Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and he expressed interest in the proposal and promised to study it."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to take significant measures in this regard from this point of view."
"Furthermore, Mr President, I believe that an initiative of this type would also comply with Article III-282 of the new European Constitution, which talks of developing a European dimension for sport, promoting fairness and equal opportunities in competitions and protecting the moral and physical integrity of our sportspeople."
"Mr President, as we know, sport itself does not have sufficient resources to deal with the problem of doping."
"That is why all of us are needed in this important work."
"All those involved in the broad field of sport need to be active in support of values that are right and wholesome, all the way from the grass roots to international sports organisations and the official agencies that organise sport in different countries."
"This work is not just restricted to our continent of Europe: this is a global task."
"Obviously, as Europeans, we wish to ensure primarily that our own house is in order, as it is difficult and it totally lacks credibility if we teach others while we ourselves are not in harmony with the agreed rules."
"The role of states and the actions they take are especially important if we are to be able to prevent the illegal manufacture, import, export and spread of doping substances effectively."
"Legislative cooperation to prevent the spread of doping substances and partnerships between the authorities are ways in which the doping problem can be effectively addressed and prevented."
"The World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, coordinates and develops the fight against doping worldwide."
"The international Olympic movement has been very closely involved in WADA’s administration, but the role that states play has not been so vibrant."
"It should be possible for the EU Member States to make a combined effort to strike a better balance with regard to the contributions the various countries make to the work of WADA, thus creating more effective preconditions for it to function efficiently."
"The EU should not establish its own doping agency: it should join the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention and this way be closely involved in work to combat doping across Europe."
"Furthermore, Unesco is drafting a global anti-doping convention."
"The EU should actively monitor the preparation of the convention and coordinate the views of the Member States."
"With increasing powers in the field of sport, that is to say the Constitution, which will thus provide a future legal basis, the EU should take an active part in the implementation, promotion and support of the obligations under this future agreement."
"Matters relating to the issue of doping often make up quite a conspicuous part of the sports news in the media."
"A sense of proportion, however, should be maintained here."
"As elsewhere in society, in sport there are and always will be those who do not follow the rules that apply to everyone."
"We in the EU nevertheless have to do all we can to promote a wholesome sports and physical exercise culture."
"In the midst of the debate, we should always remember that sport is a positive thing: it promotes human health and well-being."
"Mr President, this resolution is, of course, moving in the right direction."
"At the last Olympic Games, we all saw a certain number of athletes – very few, in fact, compared to the thousands of competitors taking part – being caught for having taken a few doses of banned substances."
"These were mainly old doping products, and not particularly the new preparations available these days."
"It is clear that the first thing we have to do is to adopt an attitude of defending the public health of our athletes, elite athletes, professional athletes."
"However, there is a contradiction at this level, as we saw recently."
"The World Anti-doping Agency, which undertakes some very important work, has just decided, with regard to corticosteroids in particular, that tests will be performed and that a certain level – I believe it is 30% – of corticosteroids will be accepted in the samples taken."
"They are, therefore, taking a stand against the medical profession, a stand that comes down to accepting a certain dose."
"This reminds us, and certainly reminds me, that, with regard to haematocrit in the world of professional cycling, a level less than or equal to 50% is accepted, but no more."
"One demand is missing from our resolution."
"This demand will be expensive, but it is essential: we must provide permanent, independent medical monitoring for athletes."
"In this way, we will be able to see, regardless of the age of the sportsperson and the sport played, how athletes look after themselves throughout their career, right from the start – because athletes, too, have the right to look after themselves – and what legal, and unfortunately illegal, drugs they could have taken."
"If we do not have an instrument of this type in the field of doping, in Europe, in the European Union and in the world, then nothing we have said will count for much, as long as we do not have this independent, ongoing medical monitoring."
"– Mr President, the real cause of the huge problem of doping in sport is the commercialisation of sport through the capitalist method of production, the objective of which is to increase the profits of the monopoly business groups; the acceptance, in other words, that an athlete may be professional and that there can therefore be professional athleticism."
"When a sports team is a business, winning at all costs becomes for the athlete and the team what the market demands in order to advertise and sell the products of the business groups, in other words in order to increase their profits."
"Children and young people become the object of savage exploitation."
"For example, there is a huge range of pharmaceutical preparations in supermarkets, where they are freely available and are poisoning every moral value of sport, as well as having particularly serious and painful repercussions as far as the physical and mental health of young people is concerned."
"Allow me to draw particular attention to the hypocrisy which exists in the international organisations and in their relations with the major business groups, with the result that dozens of pharmaceutical substances are not banned and their use is permitted in sport."
"In our view, sport is a social commodity and cannot be subject to the profit rationale."
"There needs to be a policy shift in sport."
"All forms of professionalism need to be abolished, all ties between companies and sport need to be severed and mass amateur sport needs to be strengthened."
"Finally, allow me to say the following: as long as this more general anti-grass roots policy continues, which is predicated on the profit motive and the competitiveness of capital, the repercussions will be painful as far as young people and sport are concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to the Committee on Culture and Education the Athens Olympics demonstrated that doping in sport is a genuine threat."
"Yet the only reason why so many cases of doping were detected at the last Olympic Games was that the International Olympic Committee, under the leadership of its new President, Jacques Rogge, finally took determined action to combat doping."
"Political will frequently plays a large part in matters such as these."
"We are all aware that the US Olympic Committee covered up cases of doping involving its competitors, especially its athletes, and that it continued to do so until quite recently."
"We should have no illusions about the fact that the fight against doping involves not only thwarting the ambitions of certain competitors, trainers and campaigners, but also waging war on the huge drug industry and on powerful and well-funded lobbyists."
"Strategies we can employ in this fight include severe penalties, for example the instant imposition of no-questions-asked and life-long competition bans, clear rules to ensure that no one is more equal than anyone else and new methods of detecting doping techniques that are becoming increasingly sophisticated, as pointed out by the previous speakers."
"Like politics, sport will always be a dirty business, but there is undoubtedly room for it to clean up its act."
"This is the idea behind the motion for a resolution, and I should like to thank the authors for ensuring that this is the case."
"The EU Constitution refers to sport both as an important educational tool and as a means of fostering social cohesion and a healthy lifestyle."
"Doping puts the very essence of sport at risk, as it does away with the principle of equal chances and seriously violates the spirit of fair play; performance no longer reflects the quantity and quality of effort invested."
"Doping is dangerous for the competitors themselves; the literature reports several hundred fatalities."
"According to former IOC president Samaranch, doping is the death of sport."
"Dangerous performance-enhancing substances have made their appearance in the field of leisure sports and gyms too."
"Production, trade and consumption of these substances are now taking place on a massive scale; millions of people are affected and at risk."
"Worldwide, the battle against doping is being waged at three levels: 1) prevention, information and education; 2) testing prior to, during and after competitions using the latest methods science has to offer; 3) imposing severe penalties or sanctions strong enough to act as a deterrent."
"The EU can participate in the first two areas of this broad-based, concerted effort to combat doping, given that punishing crime is not within the scope of our competences."
"Some countries have already passed legislation imposing severe penalties on doping akin to those for drug use."
"For my part, I too recommend that we take an active role in cleaning up or, if you like, saving sport."
"Let us take the message of our Constitution seriously and cooperate more closely than hitherto with the WADA."
"At present, only 12 of the 25 EU countries have an accredited laboratory."
"Let us help enable the other 13 to obtain these valuable technical facilities."
"Let us set up a unified EU testing network to facilitate close cooperation, not only in the field of testing, but also in research in sports sciences."
"Let us not forget that sports science is already intensively studying a new form of doping that could prove even more dangerous than previous forms, namely genetic doping."
"I also recommend that the EU Ombudsman create a mechanism enabling European citizens to report any manufacture, trade or consumption of doping substances that they encounter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has, on many occasions – in resolutions and Council conclusions, in the Helsinki report on sport, in the report by the Committee on Culture and Education, in hearings and so on – made reference to the problem of doping; it has both demanded and taken various courses of action."
"The fact is, though, that doping in sport is on the rise."
"The pharmaceutical industry is developing products, constantly improving them, making them harder to detect, and bringing them onto the market in the most diverse formats, and improving its access to an ever-expanding interest group."
"Those who are opposed to these developments must counter them by doing more to bring them to light."
"I therefore ask the Commission to make the investigation of doping a priority in the research work under the Seventh Research Framework Programme and to make additional funding available for it."
"The EU’s Constitution will open up new possibilities for sport, among other things, and I cannot but hope that voting for the Constitution will secure us these possibilities."
"Sport performs important tasks in society; it must not be brought low by doping and racism, which bring discredit on the work of thousands of enthusiasts."
"Mr President, all those who have so far contributed to this so-called debate by reading out texts have expressed their vehement opposition to doping."
"Nevertheless, there are probably two sorts of people in existence with an interest in sport. There are those who – at least partly thinking of the success it can bring – are indeed in favour of doping and turn a blind eye to it; and there are those who do not."
"It goes without saying that I count myself among the latter;"
"I believe that every instance of doping strikes to the heart – so to speak – those who are interested in sport, and young people in particular."
"Our friend on the Left argued that doping is inseparably associated with capitalism and is foreign to totalitarian states;"
"I believe the opposite to be the case."
"The purity of sport becomes all the more important as economic conditions become tougher and as the problems that small businesses and the self-employed face become greater; that is why we have a real chance to put a stop to doping."
"Where the Seventh Research Programme is concerned, though, I would welcome it if you were to concentrate on football."
"There are practical issues here: is it indeed the case that the G 14 – the association that monitors the Champions League in particular – is preventing checks on doping?"
"Is it the case that youth teams in particular avoid carrying out doping tests?"
"I can do no other than encourage you to ensure transparency in these areas."
"Mr President, this debate, looking at least at the great majority of contributions, has been very valuable."
"The whole issue of doping in sport has recently received much greater attention, which is important."
"The objections to doping are threefold."
"First of all it distorts the very nature of sport."
"Those who take unfair advantage over their fellow athletes are simply destroying the whole purpose of sport."
"Secondly, as we know, it damages the health of athletes."
"Thirdly, I believe it damages society because it instils the notion that winning at all costs is the only purpose."
"Colleagues have referred to the very considerable financial benefits and advantages that can be now gained, which makes this issue even more difficult."
"We have here present colleagues with Olympic experience, and I believe that three Member States are bidding to become hosts of the Olympic Games."
"Does the Commissioner think it might be appropriate, even this side of ratifying the Constitution, for the Council to adopt a joint resolution not merely condemning doping in sport, but stating what measures the individual governments that have a strong interest in winning the bid for the Olympic Games propose to take?"
"My final point is this question of winning at all costs."
"One of the most memorable events in the recent Olympic Games was the case of the long-distance athlete who was likely to win, but was prevented from doing so by a member of the crowd simply running out and stopping him."
"He was given a special award in recognition of the fact that he continued the race even though it was quite clear that his chances of winning had been spoiled."
"It seems to me that if we are going to appeal to the young and to society at large, we have to get back to the basic purpose of sport."
"Doping is a scourge that has to be dealt with."
". Mr President, I have listened very attentively to the comments of the Members present."
"Your commitment is clearly strong, as is ours, to do what we can to have an effective campaign against doping in sport."
"As has been pointed out, doping has far-reaching effects on our societies, not least on young people."
"The Commission will have a clear legal basis with the entry into force of the Constitution."
"In the meantime, we will continue to take the necessary action to prepare the groundwork for this."
"Parliament has rightly pointed out a number of levels on which the issue can be tackled."
"The Commission believes that prevention is an important facet of our efforts."
"Our actions must therefore focus on education, research and information."
"Commissioner Figeľ is committed to moving this issue forward within the context of budgetary means and in preparation for the Constitution’s entry into force."
"I now turn to some specific points that have been raised."
"Firstly, with regard to relations with federations and with the World Anti-Doping Agency – WADA – Mr Figeľ is keen to develop such relations and has already held a number of meetings to that effect."
"On the possibility of financing WADA, I should like to point out that we finance WADA on a case-by-case basis through projects."
"We do not finance the structure of WADA owing to certain problems of which we are all aware."
"Regarding research, as I mentioned, Commissioners Figeľ and Potočnik are working together and we can be hopeful of a good outcome in that regard."
"On the point raised concerning a European plan, I wish to remind you of the existence of the support plan of 1999."
"The Constitution’s entry into force will give us a more solid basis for moving forward."
"A point was raised with respect to equal opportunities in sport."
"Commissioner Figeľ is committed to this aspect and takes it very much into account."
"Our source of inspiration is the Fraisse report adopted by Parliament in 2003."
"A point was raised concerning the Unesco Convention on Doping."
"The Commission follows the work of this body and will continue to do so in the future."
"I have also taken note of the suggestion made by Mr Beazley and will forward it to Mr Figeľ."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament’s resolution on combating doping in sport."
"The Commission has been very active and has been taking initiatives in this field for the last six years, as I pointed out in my introductory remarks."
"We intend to continue our efforts, with the support of the Member States and the European Parliament."
"Parliament’s resolution will help the Commission, in cooperation with Parliament, to continue its work and actions on doping."
"The Commission has no objection to amendments 1 and 2."
"Amendment 2, in particular, could contribute to an effective fight against doping."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0037/2005 - B6-0169/2005) by Mr Sifunakis, on the draft UNESCO Convention on cultural diversity."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this oral question by the Committee on Culture and Education and the following motion for a resolution on the draft UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity are the outcome of the acute interest which our committee has in the progress of negotiations on this important text."
"The draft UNESCO Convention follows on from the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity made by UNESCO in November 2002, which was a positive step towards international cooperation but which has proved to be an inadequate response to threats to cultural diversity today from the intense globalisation of the market in cultural goods and services."
"The UNESCO Convention has as its objective the defence and promotion of the diversity of cultural contents and artistic expressions through appropriate measures and aims to facilitate the development of cultural policies and encourage wider international cultural exchanges."
"This Convention must, in our opinion, be a tool of international cooperation in favour of cultural development."
"We believe that the draft Convention represents a serious attempt to address the challenges posed to cultural diversity through globalisation and international trade policy."
"We all hope that it will constitute a binding standard-setting instrument for the protection of cultural diversity."
"This is the only way forward for Europe, given the domination today on the European markets of American television and film productions, for example."
"I would simply remind you that American productions account for between 60% and 90% of purchases of audiovisual material in the Member States of the ΕU, whereas the corresponding European share of the American market is in the order of a mere 1-2%."
"Within this framework, however, efforts are being made by a limited number of non-European countries, mainly in the English-speaking world, in a bid to weaken the proposed UNESCO Convention."
"That is why we need to resist pressure from these few but strong countries, so that the final text of the Convention clearly underlines the right of States Parties to develop, maintain and implement policies and laws designed to promote and protect cultural diversity and media pluralism."
"It is essential that any attempts to dilute or weaken these rights in any way through the Convention in question be successfully resisted."
"Given that, even within the Union, there are different conceptions as to the content of the Convention, the Member States must make every possible effort to coordinate their positions, both among themselves and with the Community."
"We should point out here that any lack of unity will undermine the Union's position and credibility in the negotiations."
"That is why we are insisting that the European Union and its Member States should do nothing during the process of the negotiation and conclusion of the Convention in question to compromise cultural diversity or undermine the ability of governments to support cultural diversity."
"Consequently, the question of the relationship between international trade law and the future UNESCO Convention is a key aspect which should be approached in the best possible way and which must on no account be given a lesser priority."
"We also believe that the Convention must recognise the very important role played by public services, notably public service broadcasters, in efforts to safeguard, support and develop cultural diversity."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the constant presence of the European Commission at the negotiations and taking account of the acute interest of the European Parliament in progress in the negotiations and its institutionally protected right to be informed immediately and fully at all stages of the process of the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements,"
"· the European Parliament calls on the Commission to keep it informed about progress made in respect of the content and timetable of negotiations and"
"· the European Parliament asks when exactly the text is expected to be ready, so that it can be approved by the UNESCO General Assembly in Paris in October 2005."
"Could the Commission please give us detailed updates on the various positions formulated within the framework of the negotiations?"
". I would like to thank the honourable Members for the question, which allows me, on behalf of Commissioner Figeľ, to update the European Parliament on the state of play of the ongoing negotiations for a Unesco Convention on Cultural Diversity."
"This follows Parliament’s request to be kept informed of the discussions on this issue within the ambit of Unesco."
"The oral question and the motion for a resolution on Unesco follows on from Parliament's report and resolution on the safeguarding and promotion of cultural diversity and the role of the European region, and the international organisations such as Unesco and the Council of Europe."
"These were adopted on 2 December 2003 and 14 January 2004 respectively and the rapporteur was Mrs Christa Prets."
"Both texts had called on the Commission to inform Parliament regularly, and in particular the Committee on Culture and Education, of the negotiations taking place in Unesco."
"The Commission responded to the invitation positively."
"Following the provisional Unesco timetable for the negotiations on the future convention, the intergovernmental negotiations were launched in September 2004, and the negotiations on substance started in December 2004, with the first meeting of the Drafting Group."
"A few weeks after the end of the Drafting Group meeting, the Commission accepted Parliament's invitation to take part in a mini-hearing on the Unesco negotiations."
"This meeting was held on 25 January 2005 with members of the Culture Committee, with Mr Schmitt in the chair."
"It gave rise to a substantial discussion with the Commission and the Luxembourg presidency on the current negotiation process."
"The Commission remains available to take part in similar meetings in the future."
"The Culture Committee has already envisaged one such meeting for later this month."
"Negotiations are well under way in Unesco."
"From an EU point of view, the last negotiating session, in February, took place in a good collaborative spirit, on the basis of a Code of Conduct adopted by COREPER on 27 January 2005."
"The unity of the EU's representation has been strictly respected throughout the session on the basis of common positions established through numerous Community coordination meetings."
"With a single voice, the European Union has become a reference for the debate and a major partner in the negotiation."
"However, the Commission’s observer status in Unesco entails numerous restrictions that limit its ability to negotiate."
"The European Union has thus introduced a request for full participant status for the European Community in this negotiation, and this will be discussed at Unesco in April."
"Although the February session has not been able to produce a new consolidated draft convention, the overall results of this negotiating session on substance are positive in relation to European Union expectations and positions."
"The general trend resulting from the plenary debates is in line with the European Union's common positions, including the articulation with other instruments."
"The April session of the Unesco Executive Board will have to confirm the convening of a new intergovernmental negotiating session, provisionally scheduled for 25 May to 4 June 2005."
"It will also discuss the request made by the European Community for a reinforced status in the current negotiations."
"The main next steps in the provisional timetable for the negotiations in Unesco are as follows."
"The Spring Executive Board will be held on 18-28 April 2005."
"Notably, this session will discuss the request from the European Community for a reinforced status in Unesco for the purpose of the current negotiations on the future convention."
"The next session of intergovernmental negotiations is scheduled for 25 May to 4 June 2005, while the Autumn Executive Board is to be held on 13-29 September 2005."
"Finally, the General Conference is to take place on 3-21 October 2005 when, on the basis of the provisional timetable, the Convention on Cultural Diversity should be adopted."
"On behalf of Commissioner Figeľ I wish to thank Parliament, and in particular the Culture Committee, for its early and active involvement in the Unesco negotiations, and for its general support for the Commission in this process."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is because the European Union is an economic and values-based community that we require – and, in the treaties, have hitherto ensured – not only a working internal market, but also, at the same time, and with equal status, the safeguarding of cultural diversity."
"The safeguarding of cultural diversity in the European Union is not something undertaken in opposition to the Member States; on the contrary, it explicitly signifies the safeguarding of cultural diversity within them."
"If though, we are to safeguard that cultural diversity around the world, we can only do so together – within the European Union and within UNESCO."
"We demand that the Member States and the Commission should do three things in respect of the negotiations."
"Firstly, the UNESCO negotiations should be concluded in good time for the next rounds of negotiations on international trade law within the WTO and GATS."
"The reason why October 2005 is so crucial is that we would otherwise be put at a disadvantage in terms of trade law, and there is the risk of UNESCO being too late in producing a legal instrument."
"Secondly, we need an effective instrument."
"By effective, I mean that it really does ensure equality, and ‘equality of arms’ for the legal instruments in business and cultural law."
"Thirdly, the European Union needs to take cultural diversity seriously in its own lawmaking, which means that it must not, in the services directive, be absorbed into business law. Instead, audiovisual services must be taken out of the draft services directive if we are not to lose credibility in the eyes of UNESCO or become less capable of negotiating with it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was on 16 November 2004 that the Council gave the Commission a mandate to negotiate the UNESCO convention on the protection of the diversity of cultural contents and artistic expressions."
"This House has also expressed its view of this convention by voting to adopt the own-initiative report that I produced on the subject."
"As Mrs Hieronymi has just said, negotiations are in progress in preparation for UNESCO’s general conference, which is to be held this October."
"All the items on the agenda must be worked through and completed by the end of May."
"It is for that reason that this House needs to make its position known in order to be able to influence them."
"What does this mean?"
"It means that every state is to have the right to retain, introduce and develop policies and regulations to protect and promote cultural diversity and media pluralism."
"This is not to be made subject to other international agreements and under no circumstances whatever to the WTO agreements."
"The convention must provide for a simple, unitary and binding mechanism for the resolution of disputes, enabling case law on cultural diversity to be developed within international law."
"Achievement of these objectives requires that the Commission should take up an explicit position and provide for the best possible coordination among the 25 Member States."
"At the time of the first meetings of experts from the various states last September in Paris, the EU was not yet speaking with one voice."
"Those in favour included France, Finland was among the neutrals and the British, Danish and Dutch were among the opposition."
"Now that the Commission can speak only through the Luxembourg Presidency, we have a new situation, the like of which we have not seen before, and the impression is given that the EU is not represented."
"This prompts me to reiterate my call for the representatives to carefully reconsider their strategic approach in order to avoid disunity and uncertainty."
"What is to be noted on the positive side is that the Commission has opposed the subordination of the UNESCO convention to the WTO’s rules."
"If the convention is to be effective, we need an internally coherent and binding text."
"I do believe that we must certainly bring the next round of negotiations to a conclusion before – as has already been mentioned – the WTO negotiation round is completed."
"The USA has already managed, to some extent, to destabilise Canada, a country that has always played a leading role in this initiative, while also managing to find new allies in the shape of New Zealand, India and Australia."
"Culture must not be made subordinate to economic considerations; it is a market in its own right, needing its own rules if it is to retain and develop its diversity."
"This is something for which we are all responsible."
"Thank you Mr President. Recognition of cultural diversity, which in practice means coexistence among people of differing traditions, also means respect for different cultural traditions."
"Respecting cultural diversity means having the opportunity to understand other people and accept them as they are."
"Cross-cultural relations can be exceptionally fruitful and can enrich society with a special kind of added value, while at the same time easing tensions in human relations."
"The principles of cultural diversity mean respecting our fellow human beings because of their good human qualities and not because of their origin."
"If the principle takes root in society, it becomes a natural barrier to separations and divisions."
"It has been shown that liberal and culturally diverse societies are also the most successful economically."
"The kinds of society that developed in Europe in the 20th century, despite two world wars, may be counted among the greatest achievements of human civilisation."
"We previously held the belief that these achievements could no longer be brought into question, but we were wrong."
"Where, for instance, did the majorities suddenly appear from that approved of ethnic cleansing in the 90’s, that most brutal denial of cultural diversity?"
"Numerous, but thankfully isolated events tell us that reasonable criteria can be turned into their opposite."
"If societies start tolerating hate-filled speech, if extremist politicians can utter disparaging words about the cultures of others with impunity, this means that the brakes have failed."
"Public sensitivity is lower, and those that warn against intolerance towards other cultures are themselves declared intolerant."
"Perhaps we have indeed expected too much from the model of multiculturalism, and have idealised it, but something is clear now."
"Despite their imperfections, we know that the rules of peaceful coexistence among people of different cultures have no alternative of equal value."
"Steps to promote global cultural exchange and the draft of the Unesco document addressed today are a major contribution and are our common political and economic investment in the future."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, I too would like to highlight how crucial it is that this convention is, politically speaking, underpinned by the concept of art and culture possessing a dual character."
"On the one hand, we are dealing with commodities, but art and culture are never merely commodities; they are always bearers of meaning, of identity and of aesthetic expression. That is the crucial reason why they cannot simply be made subject to the operation of the market and the logic of liberalisation."
"That is the case where pluralism in the mass media is concerned, and it is particularly true in the protection of public broadcasting, which guarantees a particular quality and makes the claim of providing as many people as possible with access to culture."
"It is because pure market forces and doctrinaire liberalisation put such an approach at risk that it is so important that we should succeed in securing this convention on the protection of cultural diversity as a matter of policy."
"I too would like to stress the absolute necessity of our remaining strong and united in these negotiations and of the Member States of the EU truly speaking with one voice."
"Internally speaking, this House’s participation – including in the definition of an explicit mandate – must be guaranteed."
"What is crucial in external terms is that – as has already been said – negotiations with UNESCO be concluded in good time, thus ensuring that we do not lag behind the WTO and GATS rounds."
"If we, and our protective agreement, are not to be left standing by the logic of the market and made subject to it, what we need is an effective legal instrument."
"What we demand for the world out there must also be protected within the European Union."
"That is why the services directive must continue to guarantee the protection of cultural diversity, and that is why it must not apply to these goods."
"– Mr President, Mrs Murko rightly pointed out in her speech that cultural diversity is intended to defend and protect minorities."
"All cultures in the globalised world are nowadays minority cultures, yet the markets do not reflect this reality, and this discrepancy is at the root of the problem."
"At the polar opposite of cultural diversity are both ignorance and those people who see culture as merchandise, along with those who maintain that the worldwide media networks are simply platforms for ‘producing content’."
"This is the prevailing tendency at international trade negotiations and has surfaced in the EU and in various governments; for example, in the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of services."
"This is why this debate is so important right now."
"The opinion of this House, and of the Committee on Culture and Education, is that another way forward must be found, one that commits Parliament, the European institutions and each Member State to seeking different priorities, different policies and different instruments."
"The resolution is very clear."
"The Member States have an obligation to protect cultural diversity; they have an obligation to protect pluralism in the media; and they have an obligation to take action, to invest in creating, producing and distributing cultural goods."
"To put it simply, the Member States have an obligation to stand firm, and this is, once again, the thrust of our request that the EU swiftly adopt a unified and resolute position in these negotiations."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, aside from a few misgivings and concerns, the resolution appears positive to us insofar as it has to do the job of expressing a common position."
"I should, however, like to express some doubts about how it can be accepted and enforced in individual Member States."
"I listened earlier to the speech by the member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, regarding which I should like to know what the criteria are in terms of tolerance and intolerance for deciding who is allowed to speak on a TV channel."
"I regret, for instance, that in Italy, a resolution on cultural diversity – the title of which, I think, can be agreed upon by all – will be used as a weapon against a politician who, whilst not represented by me, can be easily identified as the Prime Minister."
"Various exponents of the Committee on Culture and Education, including those who hardly ever participate in its work, use projects such as this one for debates on internal policy that have very little to do with the fact that culture is not a commodity or a market."
"With regard to cultural diversity, moreover, much is spoken about minority languages; I have the impression, however, that these languages are seldom safeguarded."
"I should like to ask the Commission how many European languages are in danger of disappearing?"
"I am thinking of Catalan, Basque, the languages of my country, Lombard, Piedmontese, Ligurian, and Venetian."
"It is one thing to argue about linguistic diversity in the abstract, it is quite something else to safeguard in practice the languages that globalisation is seeking to destroy."
"Aside from the resolution of which we, as Members of the and of the Independence and Democracy Group are in favour, therefore, I am concerned as to what could be the use of a document such as this in the individual Member States."
"Primarily, I should like to know which instruments and economic means the Union will use to insist upon safeguarding individual languages, so that the measure that we are about to approve is not simply a vague resolution, but has positive results in the regions concerned."
"Finally, I sincerely hope the Commission develops a map of the European languages in danger of dying out, whilst Parliament keeps quiet occupying itself with other matters."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of our debate today is culture, but we must ask ourselves what we mean by this term."
"Does culture mean everything that surrounds a person and his or her entire way of life, or only cultural products, such as paintings, sculpture, architecture, music, and above all films, which have already been mentioned today?"
"We should not forget that the role played by the state as a patron of culture has always been significant, but never crucial."
"One cannot fail to mention the role of the Medici or the popes in connection with Italy’s magnificent Renaissance art, yet they were not responsible for the fact that Renaissance art in Italy reached its zenith at that time."
"Similarly, the fact that the German princes acted as benefactors in the 18th and 19th centuries does not mean that they were responsible for the development of such marvellous music in that part of the world."
"No one can claim credit for the fact that Chopin was born and worked in Poland."
"Culture cannot be managed, and we should therefore not be fooled into thinking that any action we take will determine Europe’s success in this field."
"We should not forget that the market also has an important role to play, which is why we have fond memories of the magnificent Italian films of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, whereas American cinema now holds sway."
"Back then Italian or French films were hits, or even Polish films, which despite communism were really quite good, and today this distinction falls to American films."
"The media obviously have a large part to play in this process, even though it is an unfortunate fact that they sometimes neglect their duty by becoming entirely commercialised."
"We should not forget that statements to the effect that European films are almost unknown in America, and that American films are by far the most popular in Europe, are whinging plain and simple, and we should not overly concern ourselves with them."
"After all, American art and culture are essentially versions of European art, although we should not turn our backs on Henry James, Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck for being American."
"We should not lose hope, as after all the whole world is under the sway of European culture, even if this culture sometimes comes in an American edition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one in this Chamber will disagree with me when I say that the protection of cultural diversity and artistic expression, not only in the EU but also in the rest of the world, deserves our undivided attention."
"We should all lament the fact that these topics are not afforded more attention in this House; instead, as happens with all topics that concern society, including in this debate, ideology threatens to be given priority a lot of the time over genuine concern about this diversity."
"It has too often happened that vague and general concepts, including cultural diversity, have been given a different meaning and have served for some as a euphemism – the debate about the place of Islam in our western society is one example – in an attempt to manipulate the necessary division between church and state or gender equality."
"This is only one example of how a sacrosanct objective such as cultural diversity can serve less noble causes when cultural relativists interpret it in a different way."
"It follows that we should clearly define what we mean and identify the parties involved and, above all, ensure that the protection of cultural diversity does not lead to a set of standards derived from ideology being imposed from the top down."
"This will only be to the good of artistic freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the maintenance and promotion of cultural diversity is an important task both within and outside the European Union, one to which this House has always given political priority."
"This issue touches upon the most important democratic values – freedom of opinion, tolerance and dialogue between cultures among others – values deserving of protection."
"The convention under discussion is an important instrument of international cooperation in safeguarding these cultural values."
"In order to hold our own on the international stage, we need a mandate, and we need our position to be beyond any doubt."
"Globalisation is a threat to cultural diversity and media pluralism."
"To the national governments, too, this convention gives a legal framework for taking measures necessary to the protection – and, where necessary, also the promotion – of cultural diversity."
"Contrary to what we are often told, it is not a protectionist instrument; nor is it a blank cheque."
"It does, however, improve the international exchange of cultural goods, and fosters diversity."
"This is not about us going on a crusade against the WTO or – to put it bluntly – against America."
"We simply want the convention and the WTO and GATS negotiations to complement each other."
"What we have at the moment is something like the battle between David and Goliath."
"This is about strengthening David so that he may prevail in this battle, which is being fought in the interests of the cultural diversity that we have to protect, and it is for that reason that we need to agree on a common approach within UNESCO, so that we may prevail in the GATS and WTO negotiations."
"I want to underline what Mrs Hieronymi and Mrs Trüpel said: within the European Union, too, we have to ensure that the services directive does not apply to audiovisual materials."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Borg for the information he has provided us with on the progress of the negotiation of the Convention on Cultural Diversity."
"The Convention on Cultural Diversity must be a genuine instrument for international cooperation, which protects and promotes the diversity of cultural content and artistic expression in the face of the pressures from globalisation and international trade policy."
"Furthermore, it must guarantee pluralism in the audiovisual media and acknowledge the fundamental role of public services, in particular broadcasting."
"I must welcome the Council’s decision to authorise the European Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Union."
"Nevertheless, and despite the great precedent being set within the Union, I would like to stress the need for the European Parliament to be kept constantly informed of the content and the timetable of the negotiation and also for the views of civil society to be taken into account."
"Cultural services and products must be treated both as economic goods, on the one hand, but also as vectors of the identity of peoples, and I would like to stress that their regulation must also take account of their specific characteristics, including those of the workers in the sector."
"Finally, I welcome the proposal to create an observatory for cultural diversity within Unesco, that will operate in cooperation with the professional organisations and I would call on the Commission and the members of the international community, particularly the United States, Canada and Mexico, to support this Convention as a binding legislative instrument."
"Its adoption, during the forthcoming Unesco General Conference in October 2005, would allow these objectives to be taken into account in the commercial negotiations of the World Trade Organisation in the field of culture."
"– Mr President, the proposed Unesco Convention sets out principles on the sovereignty of States and their right to take the steps that they wish to take as regards culture, but aims as its prime objective to remove it from the jurisdiction of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"This arises from Articles 13 and 19 and the communication of 14 September 2004 of the International Liaison Committee of Coalitions for Cultural Diversity distributed by Unesco itself."
"I quote, ‘the Convention must provide for a clear engagement, in unambiguous terms, by which States commit to uphold the objectives of this Convention in other fora, notably by abstaining from liberalisation commitments on culture in the context of international trade agreements’."
"This is not only tantamount to enshrining chauvinism, isolation, or worse, new powers to ‘police’ and block direct and fruitful contact between cultures."
"The complicated part is that hundreds of specifications feature on this non-exhaustive list of cultural goods attached to the draft; games, leisure activities and sports, culinary traditions, costumes, cultural tourism, pottery, textiles, embroidery, baskets, glassware, jewellery, leather goods, wood, metal, furniture, interior decorating, designer goods, and the list goes on."
"The EC Treaty covers cultural development and respect for national and regional diversity in Article 151. This only concerns Member State cultures, however."
"When it comes to third countries and international organisations, the Treaty only refers to cooperation in the sphere of culture."
"What we ought to do is to satisfy the Member States – all Member States – in a Europe of national identities that are sometimes in fierce conflict with one another, and that jealously guard their specific characteristics, but a Europe in which the sovereignty of each Member State is completely safeguarded."
"The Treaty prohibits any harmonisation of Member States’ legislative and regulatory provisions in this area."
"To what extent, therefore, is the Commission involved in the proposed Convention?"
"Is the Commission’s intention to drag Europe indirectly into the kind of harmonisation forbidden by its own Treaty?"
"Will it want to subject Europe to the scope of the WTO, which has a dangerous abundance of situations that have unforeseen consequences?"
"The negotiations currently underway at UNESCO are extremely important for us Europeans."
"We have so far managed to gain acceptance for our principles in international circles."
"My predecessors have restated those principles in this forum: cultural goods and services are not just commodities like any others."
"Cultural diversity is wealth for the whole of humanity."
"Every government should have the right to support cultural creativity and the dissemination of culture in its country without being subject to the sacrosanct requirements of free trade or to the authority of the WTO."
"We have succeeded in having these principles respected so far, and the cultural sector has been excluded from the international negotiations on the liberalisation of services at the World Trade Organisation."
"Those who believe that cultural goods and services are part of the entertainment industry are once again on the offensive, however."
"On their initiative, bilateral free trade agreements that include the cultural sector are multiplying."
"At UNESCO, the representatives of the United States and its allies are trying, to a great extent successfully, to weaken the text originally put forward for the convention."
"The only effective way of guaranteeing our right to cultural identity and cultural diversity is to make it a universal right recognised by all peoples and defended in the international institutions by their representatives."
"The UNESCO Convention must become the international legal instrument of reference on issues of cultural policy."
"It must not be subordinated to other commercial agreements."
"It must have an effective mechanism for dealing with differences of opinion."
"Finally, it must be ready in time for the next UNESCO general conference in October 2005, during which it can be adopted."
". Mr President, I have taken good note of what was said by the various honourable Members and I will pass on their comments and suggestions to Mr Figeľ."
"In general, let me say first of all that the Commission welcomes Parliament’s resolution on cultural diversity and that our views fully correspond."
"Parliament’s resolution will help the Commission continue its work on the negotiating process in cooperation with Parliament."
"On a number of specific aspects that have been raised by speakers, I would like to make the following comments. On the involvement of Parliament, let me reaffirm our commitment to keep Parliament informed."
"We have regularly passed on information to Parliament and specifically to the Committee on Culture and Education."
"The next meeting is due to be held on 19 April and Mr Figeľ is committed to continuing the dialogue with the committee and to addressing the substance of the ongoing negotiations with the committee."
"We want to make good use of Parliament’s ideas during the negotiations."
"Parliament’s strong support is welcome and assists us in our tasks."
"On the request for more information on the negotiations, let me state that at the moment most of the negotiations concern procedures."
"The discussions on the substance will come later, during the May and June part-sessions."
"Concerning deadlines, we would like to see the timetable respected so as to allow us to conclude the negotiations during the course of this year."
"On issues of substance, we will be particularly attentive to the protection of cultural and national specificities, as also the interests of our media sector."
"On the point raised concerning languages, let me say that linguistic diversity is another aspect of our policy."
"In fact the Commission has included a proposal on lifelong learning in the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"Linguistic diversity is a pillar of this proposal and the main education and culture programme."
"The debate is closed."
"At the close of this debate, I have received one motion for a resolution(1)."
"The vote on this resolution will take place at 12 noon"
"The next item is the joint debate on the report (A6-0051/2005) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian peninsula and amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98, and the report (A6-0050/2005) by Mr Morillon on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the sole stocks in the Western Channel and the Bay of Biscay."
". Mr President, the Commission appreciates the hard work and close attention to detail by Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries in preparing for this debate with regard to the two files in front of Parliament this morning."
"The objective of the measures we are contemplating is that of safeguarding the needs of future generations from the demands of the present population."
"This is what we define as sustainability and we see long-term management plans as the right legislative instrument for achieving this."
"I am pleased to note that Parliament is broadly in agreement with our thinking."
"As always, our shared commitment to achieving sustainability in fisheries remains unwavering."
"We cannot overstate this principle."
"Our aim remains common, but our approach may be somewhat different."
"In this instance we have some differences concerning the details."
"With regard to the plan for Southern hake and Norway lobster we have held consultations with parties involved concerning the fisheries that catch these species, often catching them together in mixed fisheries."
"We agree that there should be the possibility for state aid to fishermen involved in these fisheries, but these should be applied equitably to all fishermen who may find themselves in similar situations, and should therefore be applied in the context of the European Fisheries Fund."
"We consider that the limits on TAC changes should be plus or minus 15% to be in accordance with scientific advice."
"There is no technical basis to choose a different value."
"However, I accept that this limit should be applied from the first year of the plan’s implementation."
"We should not intentionally delay stock recovery if this is feasible within the plan."
"Recovery should occur as soon as possible and in no later than ten years."
"We appreciate that there are special difficulties in the Gulf of Cadiz and that uncertainties are high."
"However, to be consistent with the precautionary approach that has been agreed in the UN and in Community legislation, greater uncertainty cannot be a reason to apply more lax conservation measures."
"We can agree to the exclusion of the Gulf of Cadiz from the same effort management scheme as elsewhere, if an alternative but equally effective management system is in place."
"After discussions with stakeholders on this point we can now agree to remove the closed areas originally proposed for Nephrops, but we think they should be replaced with other closed areas that are better adapted to protecting the stock."
"Nephrops stocks require conservation measures to restore their ability to support significant fisheries."
"I agree that Bay of Biscay sole could be moved to a management plan in accordance with its less serious biological state, but Western Channel sole should remain the subject of a recovery plan."
"Legally, a management plan cannot be applied to Western Channel sole until it is inside safe biological limits."
"We are convening a scientific meeting of STECF to look at options for target fishing mortalities for sole that will be consistent with the objectives of the common fisheries policy and with international commitments at the UN and the FAO."
"Therefore, we have to reserve our position until we have seen the results of this evaluation."
". Mr President, this report, which was approved in committee by a huge majority — I believe with just one vote against, and I would like to express enormous gratitude to all my colleagues — makes considerable changes to the Commission’s proposal establishing measures for the recovery of Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and the waters of the Western Iberian Peninsula."
"The recovery objective proposed by the Commission for hake took mortality by fishing as a reference, while my report proposes, as recommended by the scientists, an ideal biomass level, complemented by a fishing effort limitation scheme based on geographical areas and categories of fishing gear."
"Furthermore, with regard to the system for calculating fishing effort, we believe that the one presented by the Commission, based on kilowatts of power, is too complicated and we therefore propose that it be based on fishing days and that, furthermore, we establish a system of co-responsibility for fishermen in the control of fishing."
"For us, Commissioner, the period of application is not negotiable."
"It is not sufficient to establish or decide on five years for this plan."
"We would be delighted if the fishing ground could recover in five years, but the ten years, as opposed to the five proposed by the Commission, are intended to allow the industry to adapt more gradually and more flexibly, ensuring greater stability for fishing without diminishing the ultimate objective, that everybody wants to see — not just the Commission — of the recovery of stocks."
"Furthermore, I have modified and relaxed the quantities laid down in the proposal on weight, supplementary catches and other technical measures, and in this way the margins of tolerance will be similar to those in other plans already in force."
"With regard to the forecasts on Norway lobster, today everybody knows that the closed areas proposed are not suited to the stock situation, nor the duration, since the proposal is that it be indeterminate."
"Commissioner, according to the reports produced by the IEO, in only one of the areas proposed are there significant concentrations of Norway lobster and these are located in a much more restricted area than that pointed out by the Commission, at depths of 100 to 140 metres, and we therefore believe that, in the event that the closure is established, it should be limited both in area and in terms of its duration, between May and August."
"We must mention something that the Commission tends to forget: the socio-economic repercussions."
"Commissioner, the Commission’s proposal is exclusively based on aspects relating to the conservation of resources and makes no mention at all of the socio-economic impact of its application, and I can assure you that, if the Commission's proposal is applied as it stands, it would have a dramatic effect on the sector, because, in practice, the closures proposed for Norway lobster mean that trawling will be impossible in all Iberian waters, and we are talking about multi-species fishing in which Norway lobster represents barely 1% of the total catches by these fleets."
"So I have considered it appropriate to insert a reference to the socio-economic measures to be adopted to deal with the possible loss of income for the sector, either by means of the new European Fisheries Fund, as you have said, or by means of any other specific instrument that the European Union may create, and I am delighted that the specific nature of the Gulf of Cádiz is recognised and that, in this respect, it has been considered more positive to exclude it from the proposal."
"Commissioner, its inclusion for this recovery plan must not under any circumstances mean that it does not include measures to provide for its recovery and sustainable management and, in this regard, you are aware that the national authorities are producing an emergency plan for this specific fishing ground."
"I believe, Commissioner, that, as rapporteur, I have opted for the most realistic and viable approach and I must acknowledge that it is true that I placed great emphasis, as well as on the objective of preserving resources — which I believe to be extremely important and which, as you have said, guarantees the future – on that of preserving a prosperous, viable and restructured European fishing sector."
"That is the purpose of the report I am presenting to this House today."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Fisheries’ proposal establishing measures for the recovery of the sole stocks in the Western Channel and the Bay of Biscay was submitted to Parliament under the consultation procedure."
"It is based on proposals submitted to the Council in December 2002 aimed at the conservation and sustainable exploitation, as you said, of fish stocks as part of the reforms to the common fisheries policy."
"The aim of this proposal is to ensure, in the two regions concerned and within a period of five to ten years, that these stocks are maintained within or rebuilt to safe biological limits."
"It comprises five chapters."
"The first chapter, specifying the criteria to be met in order to achieve the plan’s objectives, provided that, when stocks could be regarded as being within those limits, the Council could decide to cancel the plan at the proposal of the Commission."
"The other chapters specified the technical and inspection measures intended to allow this plan to be implemented."
"During the debates held on this subject, it has become clear that, as you have said, in at least one of the two regions concerned, the Bay of Biscay, the most recent scientific reports indicate that sole stocks are not below the biological safety threshold."
"Consequently, instead of adopting a recovery plan as referred to in Article 5 of the 2002 regulation, it seemed preferable to adopt a management plan as laid down in Article 6 of that regulation."
"This proposal obviously does not result in fishermen being free to recommence unchecked intensive fishing, which would certainly have a catastrophic effect on the future of the species."
"It has resulted in amendments to the technical provisions proposed by the Commission, but in such a way as, and I quote, ‘to ensure that these stocks remain within safe biological limits’, whilst at the same time stressing, and again I quote, that ‘the objective of the new common fisheries policy is to provide for the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources, taking account of the environmental, social and economic aspects in a balanced manner’."
"I would point out that Parliament’s proposals specify in this regard that, where the Commission finds, on the basis of the annual evaluations, that any of the sole stocks concerned are at risk of collapse, it shall propose to the Commission additional measures to ensure recovery of the stock concerned."
"That summarises the main proposals in the report, which will shortly be put to the vote in Parliament with no amendments and which gained very wide support in committee, demonstrating a desire to involve the fishermen themselves in the considerations of the scientists and politicians and to reconcile the expertise of the latter with the experience of the former."
"I would like to add that the debates leading to the drafting of this report were conducted in an excellent atmosphere and I would like to conclude, Commissioner, by expressing to you my gratitude."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my group, the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to stress the importance of the role played by Parliament in this area, with its deliberate strategy of providing time and improving on the Commission’s initial drastic proposals."
"This debate began some time ago, during the last term in office."
"The Commission presented us with an initial proposal which treated the situations of hake and cod equally."
"We had to stop it and we managed to do so."
"The situation of each species could not be compared."
"The Commission eventually agreed with us and presented two separate proposals."
"We also managed to differentiate northern hake from southern hake, with two different proposals."
"All of this happened following an important joint hearing in Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries with the sector and the scientists involved, in 2001."
"In the end we achieved a satisfactory result for northern hake and we also managed, in 2003, to postpone the debate on southern hake until this term in office, which allowed the sector and the scientists to provide more data and produce more specific proposals."
"I believe that Mr Borg's visit to Spain has also been fundamental in terms of rectifying the Commission’s initial position on southern hake and Norway lobster."
"We should therefore all be pleased, since I believe that this is the right approach, as is being demonstrated in the case of the Mediterranean."
"I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez, on her work and on the final result of her report, and everybody who has contributed to it, including the Spanish and Portuguese Governments, both previous and current, and the Members from my group, Mr Fraga and Mr Freitas, for their valuable contributions."
"I would also like to highlight the amendment we are presenting today to Parliament on behalf of our group, the PPE-DE, which will give the Member States greater flexibility in the application of their recovery plans."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate and warmly thank the Xunta de Galicia, which, within the Galician Advisory Committee, promoted and achieved the required unity in the sector in this decisive area, since their consensus has provided us with the basis for reaching a satisfactory and realistic agreement here."
". Mr President, Commissioner, well done to the rapporteur for producing a report that does not present us with any major problems."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank fishermen for fishing one of the best fish, sole, that nature, for some, or the good Lord, for others, has given us."
"Long may they continue to fish!"
"We need to take a few lessons from this report and this proposal."
"First, we must be able to adapt when we need to, and the decisions taken have not been taken against fishermen."
"If there are more sole than we expected, we must be able to adapt to the situation and not remain restricted or stuck."
"Secondly, calmness in ports and confidence in the future depend a great deal on good work carried out between the fishermen and the scientists."
"One group does not necessarily believe the other, and, in my opinion, we need to persevere in improving relations between them."
"One forum, set up as part of the common fisheries policy, is, I believe, very useful: I am referring to the regional advisory councils."
"We must make the most of these bodies to ensure that these two main categories, the workers and the scientists, come to as good an understanding as possible."
"In this case, Commissioner, your work is made all the easier and we share the same aim: to maintain the largest fish stocks possible in the sea, because, without fish, there will be no fishermen and, without fishermen, there will be no fish for consumers."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Miguélez Ramos and Mr Morillon for the magnificent reports they have presented to us and which we are debating today in this Parliament."
"At the end of 2003, the Commission proposed a recovery plan for southern European stocks of hake and Norway lobster, which, according to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, would be threatened due to high levels of mortality resulting from the fishing of mature fish of those species, which was reducing their capacity for regeneration through natural biological reproduction."
"I have certain reservations about the full validity of the reports which we considered in evaluating the situation of the stocks of these species, since the associations of shipowners and professionals from these fishing grounds, or at least those that I have consulted, claim that the best way to find out whether or not stocks are at risk is by casting a net into the sea."
"Of course, the net must fully comply with the legislation in force."
"If it comes out with fish in it, it cannot be claimed that the species is in danger, and they are bringing up more fish than ever."
"Nevertheless, nobody has a greater interest in maintaining fish stocks than the people who live from this fishing sector and whose economy and way of life depends on them and, therefore, they largely accept, as we all do, that measures need to be established to protect stocks of southern hake and Norway lobster."
"It is possible, however, that the application of some of the measures proposed may affect the socio-economic reality of the sector, and it is therefore absolutely essential that the regulation provides for some type of mechanism to alleviate the consequences that the planned restrictions of fishing capacity are going to have for the people affected and to compensate for the damage done to the sector."
"Furthermore, the fishermen and companies must know that this assistance is available to them in order to provide them with the incentive to participate significantly in the recovery plans being considered."
"We are also in favour of controlling the quantities of mature fish of each species and not levels of mortality, and of the measures adopted extending over 10 years and the annual variations of allowable tonnes of catch not exceeding any more or less than 10%."
"Mr President, I am sorry to have to bring a note of discord to this fine consensus."
"We would have liked to support the Commission’s proposal much more proactively, and we regret that, faced with a situation as serious as the continual decline in fish stocks, albeit with slight differences between species, Member States are systematically continuing, with the assistance of a large number of MEPs, to attempt at all costs to dilute the objectives to be achieved."
"Even if the whole world proclaims that they support the conservation of resources, in reality it is not true, and we cannot accept this situation."
"That is why we will not vote for these two reports."
"There is no doubt that we need to hold discussions with local players and fishermen, regarding the amendment and simplification of measures that are sometimes too complicated."
"It is also important, of course, to take account of the socio-economic impact, to provide compensation, which must be made fair so that it does not always go to the same people, and also to preserve small-scale fisheries, which must also survive."
"As much as we agree with all of that, we cannot accept the systematic reduction of the Commission’s objectives, which are based on scientific data."
"Neither can we continually argue, in view of the situation."
"That is why we will vote against these two reports, whilst supporting the Commission’s intentions in this field."
"– We believe that the stock levels of Southern hake and Norwegian lobster are such that recovery measures must be taken."
"Such measures will lead to fishing restrictions, which will inevitably have social and economic consequences."
"In this context, in the event of any loss of income suffered by fishermen due to temporary suspensions or fishing restrictions arising from a recovery plan, provision must be made for fishermen to be offered financial compensation aimed at offsetting any consequent loss."
"Indeed, compensation also represents an incentive for fishermen to be actively involved in carrying out the recovery plan, because the main aim of plans of this nature is to ensure the sustainability of fisheries resources as a means of safeguarding the future of fishing."
"Consequently, recovery plans must not, under any circumstances, lead to definitive measures to reduce fishing, such as fostering the scrapping of vessels, or the paralysis of economically untenable fleets in the absence of socio-economic compensation measures."
"The scrapping of vessels leads to the permanent destruction of production resources and, in turn, to permanent unemployment for the fishermen."
"Socio-economic measures commensurate with the Community budget must be incorporated into this regulation."
"This is the thrust of the amendments that we have proposed and which we consider fair."
"We therefore trust that we will obtain your support."
". Mr President, it is not often that I can say that I am in total agreement with two separate reports from the Committee on Fisheries."
"This is one of those rare occasions."
"Chairman Morillon and Vice-Chairman Miguélez Ramos both highlight the need to ensure that the socio-economic impact and consequences of recovery plans are measured and addressed, with appropriate compensation."
"Two years ago almost to the day, I stated in this House that decisions and objectives of fish recovery plans cannot disregard the social and economic consequences they will have."
"Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks, and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry."
"The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social, economic and regional cohesion, and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions that are highly dependent on fisheries."
"Let me say very clearly, as I have said many times in the past and will say again at every available opportunity, that the common fisheries policy is not only about fish but also, and most importantly, about fishermen."
"It is about their families and their families’ futures, their way of life – the only one possible in many areas – and the future of entire coastal communities."
"Chairman Morillon and Vice-Chairman Miguélez Ramos both refuse the technocratic approach of rebuilding stocks at all cost, preferring instead to suggest ways to ensure that stocks remain within safe biological limits."
"I, for one, share that approach."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say that I shall concentrate on the report by Mrs Miguélez and, as such, I wish to thank Mrs Miguélez, Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Varela for their participation, because this report focuses essentially on Southern hake and Norwegian lobster in Portugal and Spain."
"I should also like to welcome the Commission’s proposal, which recommends that reform of the common fisheries policy should set out provisions for safeguard plans, recovery plans for areas and species with sustainability problems."
"It is undoubtedly true, however, that we had to carry out a thoroughgoing analysis in committee, in conjunction with the national authorities in Portugal and Spain, so that we could turn the Commission’s good intentions into reality."
"In fact, the Commission’s proposal, in its original form, would damage fishing as a whole, because in order to safeguard the interests of Southern hake and Norwegian lobster, the entire fishing fleet would be affected and a recovery plan for all fisheries, including Portuguese fisheries, would be drawn up."
"We therefore had to table some amendments, which were adopted. I believe that we made significant improvements to the text."
"I do not agree with some of the proposed amendments tabled in this House, because they are already laid down in the proposals that we made in committee."
"I should like to say, by way of justifying the proposal tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we want the Member States to have the opportunity to table their own proposals and to submit them to the Commission for approval. After all, the Member States know the situation best."
"– Mr President, I should like to express my opinion on the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos on measures for the recovery of Norwegian lobster and Southern hake in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian Peninsula."
"I should like to begin, if I may, by congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos on her excellent work and on the extraordinary effort that she put into drawing up the report."
"The proposals therein deserve Parliament’s overwhelming support and I trust that the Commission will duly take them on board."
"We completely share the Commission’s concerns as regards the need to protect Southern hake and Norwegian lobster stocks in those areas of the Atlantic and we acknowledge that appropriate emergency measures are called for in light of the current state of affairs."
"In the Member States in which most fishing is done, the fishermen and the vessel owners have the most to gain from seeing these measures implemented correctly. Let me stress that those measures must be appropriate measures, because the Commission’s proposals are clearly excessive given that the problem cannot be approached from one single perspective."
"As political decision-makers, we have a responsibility to seek solutions that strike the right balance between concern for defending biological resources and social and economic interests."
"If the Commission’s proposal were adopted, it would have a devastating impact on the Portuguese fisheries sector, as it would affect some 2 000 vessels, most of which catch tiny amounts of these species."
"The proposals put forward in the reports before us will enable these species to be rebuilt within ten years, thereby absorbing the social and economic impact."
"Accordingly, I am sure that Parliament will give resounding support to this report."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs, and in particular Mrs Miguélez, because I am going to refer to her report, but not because the report of the chairman of the committee is not magnificent."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that the first discrepancy between the Commission and the fishing sector usually relates to the duration of plans."
"In this regard, we must bear in mind that establishing a plan for the recovery of a species with a short life and rapid growth is not the same as establishing a plan for another species with the opposite characteristics."
"Furthermore, great emphasis must be placed, as many previous speakers have said, on the socio-economic effects of each plan, which vary widely depending on the fleets in question."
"In this case, therefore, we have established a minimum duration for recovery of ten years, which allows these conditions to be taken into account."
"We must insist that the first stage in any recovery plan must be to prevent a continuing decline of the species in question and for its recovery to begin."
"The speed with which this is achieved is of less biological relevance, but may be a disaster for the regions dependent on fishing."
"We therefore believe that once the scientists have established the biological parameters — and this report includes, for example, the biomass objective to be achieved in order for a population to be considered recovered — the Member States must be allowed a degree of flexibility in achieving this objective in a manner most suited to the characteristics of their fleets."
"Once again, the important thing is that the species recovers, rather than how the reduction of the fishing effort is achieved."
"So, as Mr Freitas has said, we have presented an amendment on behalf of our group which calls for greater flexibility for fleets."
"With regard to the issue of closures, I would refer to what the rapporteur has said; there is no scientific basis for it and, therefore, I would simply call on the Commission and the Council to support the amendments by Mrs Miguélez and the Committee on Fisheries, which introduce a good dose of common sense into this proposal."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the issue of sole stocks."
"This regulation aims to recover sole stocks in the Western Channel and in the Bay of Biscay."
"It is crucial that we act to counter declining fish stocks, but it is always important that our response is proportionate."
"The Commission proposal combines tough rules for setting total allowable catches with a scheme to limit fishing effort."
"The amendments proposed in Parliament’s report would replace the Commission’s proposal with one that aimed to manage the stock via agreed rules on setting catch limits."
"I welcome the amendments in the report by Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries."
"The Commission’s proposal was based on the premise that the sole stocks were in crisis and needed recovery plans."
"The amendments proposed in the committee’s report recognise that management action, rather than drastic fleet cuts, is more appropriate for this stock."
"I also strongly support the Committee on Fisheries’ recognition that the management action for this stock should be developed with the involvement of regional advisory councils and other stakeholders."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their hard and constructive work. I also wish to thank Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna for his good work on the hake plan."
"Concerning the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian Peninsula and amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98, I can fully agree with 14 of the 26 amendments considered by the Committee on Fisheries."
"These are Amendments 2, 4, 10 in part, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 26."
"It is appropriate to remove the out-of-date proposals concerning management by kilowatt days, to adapt the minimum quantities concerning control arrangements according to the measures set up for 2005, to establish tolerance margins and conversion factors consistent with those in the Northern hake recovery plan, and I can agree with the deletion of obsolete provisions concerning effort messages."
"The fishing mortality rate of 0.27 is acceptable because it is consistent with the Implementation Plan of the World Summit on Sustainable Development adopted in Johannesburg in 2002."
"I also agree that it is appropriate that a recovery plan should anticipate a recovery taking place within less than five years."
"Although estimates of biomass of fish stocks are uncertain, observations of stock size above a precautionary level for two years in a row could be a way to signal the need to move from a recovery phase into a long-term management plan."
"Concerning Amendment 10, we can, therefore, accept the 35 000 tonnes exit criterion, but not the requirement of a ten-year delay in recovery or the reference to ‘in a sufficient period of time’."
"Such an approach would be contrary to the FAO Code of Conduct."
"We do not fix the duration of the plans: we set an objective and estimate the approximate time we will need to achieve it."
"I cannot accept Amendments 15 or 16 because the 10% constraint on TAC changes is too tight to allow an adaptation to real circumstances."
"In line with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, the figure should be retained at 15% rather than 10%, but the 15% could apply in the first year of the plan."
"I support the principles behind Amendment 17 and can accept paragraphs 1 and 2 of that amendment, with modifications committing the Council, as well as the Commission, and making reference to maintaining the arrangements embodied in Annex IVb of Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 on a comparable basis to the cod recovery plan."
"For these reasons, I cannot support Amendment 27."
"In relation to paragraphs 3 and 4 of Amendment 17, and Amendments 3, 28 and 30, state aids should be decided in the context of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance and the European Fisheries Fund, so that comparable financial resources are made available to all fishermen who find themselves in similar situations."
"As is the case with sole stocks, which I will come to later, it is appropriate to have an interim review procedure, but this should be done at reasonable intervals."
"I could support Amendment 25, subject to the extension of the review period to four years rather than two years."
"I cannot support attempts to rebuild stock size year-by-year, because of the disruptions that this is likely to cause industry, and I cannot support Amendment 5."
"After extensive consultation with my officials and with officials and fishing representatives in Member States, I can agree to some modification in the size and number of closed areas for fishing for Nephrops."
"However, complete deletion of any reference to closed areas, as in Amendments 6, 7, and 24, goes too far to be compatible with precautionary management at this stage."
"Management of hake and Nephrops in the Gulf of Cadiz is an important issue given the abundance of juvenile hake in that area."
"On the basis of the precautionary principle, greater uncertainty in this area is not a reason to be less cautious, so I cannot support Amendments 1, 8 or 9, which would exclude this area."
"However, I accept that measures for the Gulf of Cadiz may need to be different."
"I cannot accept Amendment 30."
"Capacity needs to be managed so as to be in balance with the productivity of the fish stocks."
"If either or both fishing effort and capacity were allowed to increase again once the stocks are recovered, the result would be a decline in the stocks and a reduction in the amount of fish available to the industry."
"This would not achieve the aim of sustainable exploitation."
"Turning now to the Morillon report, I am pleased to say I can fully agree with Amendments 7, 16, 17, 18 19, 20, 21 and 22."
"It is entirely appropriate to remove the chapter concerning management of effort by kilowatt days, to apply control measures only to landings above 100 kg instead of 50 kg."
"I accept that the provision for the margin of tolerance in logbooks should be the same as that already adopted for Northern hake."
"I also accept that, as a general rule, variations in TAC should be limited to no more than 15% for these stocks."
"Notwithstanding the deletion of the kilowatt days scheme from the proposal, it will be necessary to substitute alternative effort management measures."
"For the Western Channel sole, these should be based on the measures already introduced under Annex IVc of the current TAC and Quota Regulation."
"The biological state of sole in the Bay of Biscay is apparently better than previously thought and it is appropriate to apply a management plan to this stock, rather than a recovery plan."
"I can therefore accept the substance of Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12 and 13, but only insofar as it relates to Bay of Biscay sole."
"The biological conditions prevailing for Western Channel sole are sufficiently serious for recovery plan provisions to apply to that stock."
"I also support the idea of an interim report mechanism as mooted in Amendment 11, as I mentioned when discussing southern hake and Nephrops."
"However, the plan needs to be given time to take effect before a review is useful, so a four-year interval would be appropriate here, which is a similar timescale to the one used for the interim evaluations of long-term measures agreed for the northern stocks shared with Norway."
"I can also agree with the idea of setting a target fishing mortality rate for Bay of Biscay sole, as in Amendment 15."
"However, we should take account of the scientific advice that will be provided by STECF in June on this topic, and I will reserve my position on the right figure to use until I have seen that report."
"However, I cannot agree with the idea of setting a TAC according to an annual increase in the quantity of adult fish in the sea."
"The scientific advice is simply not precise enough to allow such an approach and I fear the result would be an unwarranted, overly erratic adaptation of TACs."
"The fishing industry needs more stability than this method can provide."
"I am not therefore in a position to support Amendments 8 or 14."
"I see legal problems with certain amendments."
"Amendment 5 would be in contradiction to the requirements of the last sentence of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and the last sentence of Article 6(2) of the same Regulation."
"And while Regional Advisory Councils, where they exist, should be consulted when developing new legislation, the implementation of regulations is the responsibility of Member States."
"For this technical reason, I cannot support Amendments 5 or 6."
"However, we would certainly have no problem with Member State authorities consulting the Regional Advisory Council, on a voluntary basis, concerning such plans."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next voting time, in a few minutes."
"I now have the pleasure of welcoming to the official gallery a delegation from the Armenian Parliament, led by Mr Armen Rustamyan."
"The delegation took part, today and yesterday, in the seventh meeting of the EU-Armenia Cooperation Council."
"I wish them every success, following this welcome from the whole Parliament, in their meetings at the European Parliament, and a good stay in Strasbourg."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, in connection with adopting this resolution, we reached agreement in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on using the name ‘the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia’ when referring to this country in contexts not concerning the actual debate about the future name."
"I hope I can obtain Parliament’s support for sticking to this policy in the final resolution."
"This means, in other words, that, if amendments are adopted today with reference to Macedonia and if these are not concerned with the issue of the name, the term used in the final version will be ‘the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia’."
"We thus ensure that we shall vote on the substance of the resolution and that, irrespective of the outcome of the votes, the final result is clear to readers of the resolution."
"We can do something about the actual issue of the name when we come to Amendment 6 and Amendment 25."
"Thank you very much, Mr Samuelsen, I think that these precise details are extremely useful on a subject that is still so sensitive."
"Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Samuelsen has said, and, if we agree to this demand, to ask my colleagues to vote ‘yes’ rather than ‘no’ to Amendments 16 and 20, which have to do with the content rather than the name."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three amendments have been tabled on paragraph 32, which have been marked as being identical."
"In actual fact, Amendment 13 differs from the other two by only one word."
"Nevertheless, the difference is important, because it is one thing to talk about the whole of China, and quite something else to talk about China."
"I therefore call for Amendment 13 to be put to the vote separately from Amendments 1 and 10."
"Before voting on Amendment 13 with the slight semantic difference emphasised by Mr Speroni, we shall first vote on Amendments 1 and 10, which are exactly identical."
"Mr President, all Members have a copy of the update I have proposed, which involves the following substitution in paragraph 8:"
"‘… report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change presented to the UN Secretary-General on 1 December 2004’ with ‘… report presented by the Secretary-General of the UN entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all” on 21 March 2005."
"This simply involves an update."
"As Mr Samuelsen raised the problem of names in connection with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia I would point out that this problem does not occur in the text to be voted on."
"If it were to occur at all, it would be in the justification, but that is not what we are dealing with."
"Mr President, I wish to move an oral amendment, with which we want to add emphasis to the demand for enhanced cooperation with the Americans rather than to oppose it in principle."
"Not only do we want to welcome the cooperation that is going on in relation to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but we also would like to see more efforts being made to that end in view of this year’s non-proliferation conference."
"The non-proliferation strategy is an essential component in the European Security Strategy."
"Not least with reference to ongoing debates on non-proliferation and Iran, we wish to appeal for closer cooperation with our American partners in reinforcing non-proliferation as an instrument."
"Mrs Beer, please could you present the text of the amendment?"
"Mr President, the rapporteur has proposed the following:"
"‘Welcomes existing cooperation with the United States in the fields of non-proliferation’."
"Our proposed wording is: ‘Expresses its wish for stronger cooperation with the United States in the fields of non-proliferation’."
"That concludes the vote."
"All the explanations of vote are in writing."
"Despite some good efforts, current fisheries policy still involves the EU buying the right to misuse the natural resources of the poor."
"It is a modern form of colonialism."
"Genuine reform of fisheries policy is required, together with a totally changed view of our relationship with poor countries."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the above-mentioned report in its entirety."
"Mr Kuhne’s report deals with the European Security Strategy, and Mr Brok’s report deals with the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We are voting against both these resolutions in their entirety because they are aimed at further militarising EU cooperation and turning the EU into a major power speaking with a single voice in international contexts."
"This development would lead to the EU being given substantial resources that could be made better use of by other organisations."
"We believe that the OSCE and the Council of Europe should be given priority in conflict prevention work at European level."
"On a global scale, the UN - with its importance, experience and legitimacy - is best suited to this work."
"The UN should also have the main responsibility for global disarmament and for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction."
"The UN should also be guaranteed resources for military crisis management."
"There are no reasons for lifting the arms embargo against China, because demands regarding human rights are not being complied with."
"Encouragement should be given to the strict control of Sweden’s export of munitions."
"We are opposed to Mr Brok’s call for the immediate implementation of the proposals in the EU Constitution designed to strengthen the EU’s defence and security policy, despite the Constitution not having been approved in all the countries and thus not having formally come into force."
"It shows amazing arrogance towards Europe’s voters."
". As we have repeatedly stated, the need to preserve fish stocks must be compatible with the needs of the populations whose livelihoods depend on fishing and the needs of industries associated with fishing."
"As well as this clear need for compatibility, the medium and long-term sustainability of fisheries must be guaranteed. Yet it must also be guaranteed in the short term."
"Whilst this particular issue will not affect Portugal directly, it does have parallels with similar situations in which Portugal’s interests are at stake. I therefore voted in favour."
"The Commission’s proposal is aimed at getting to grips with unduly high fishing mortality rates and the problems of obtaining adequate reproduction in these areas."
"The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea showed, for example, in its report that fishing mortality rates had led to the quantities of mature Southern hake and Norway lobster in the Cantabrian Sea and Iberian peninsula being so low that stocks were no longer being replenished through reproduction and were now threatened with collapse."
"There is no reason for doing what the Committee on Fisheries has successfully done and voting in favour of watering down the Commission’s proposal at a time when the Commission is no doubt taking measures to get on top of the problems."
"Genuine reform of fisheries policy is required, together with a totally different view of our relationship with poor countries and of what constitutes a sustainable use of our natural resources."
"I have therefore chosen to vote against the two above-mentioned reports."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Krahmer on the proposal for a directive on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their re-usability, recyclability and recoverability, for the following reasons:"
"Firstly, the directive attaches importance to the environment."
"According to the proposal, at least 85% by mass of any vehicle should be re-usable and/or recyclable, and at least 95% by mass of any vehicle should be re-usable and/or recoverable."
"Otherwise, the model in question cannot be placed on the market."
"Secondly, the directive provides constructors and the type-approval authorities with a reasonable amount of time to carry out compliance checks on the 600 or so types on the market, a period that takes into account the car industry’s normal production cycles."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Krahmer on his important report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to their re-usability, recyclability and recoverability and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC. I support the report, in particular the guarantees provided by car manufacturers as regards the ‘re-usability’, ‘recyclability’ and ‘recoverability’ of their cars."
"Following the Lisbon Strategy, the EU must not overlook environmental policy. In this regard, one must agree that the manufacturer has a duty to prove that the vehicle concerned is environmentally friendly and to provide disposal firms with a detailed description of a recycling strategy."
"Measures such as Member States appointing type-approval authorities to check whether cars are environmentally friendly, and the provision of a longer period in which to implement this directive, 54 months, will ensure that this directive will be properly transposed and that the car industry will be prepared for the entry into force of this Community initiative."
"I welcome the aim of these proposals to help reduce waste and provide information for consumers."
"These proposals reinforce good practice already established in the UK where around 75% of the two million cars and vans reaching the end of their lives are traditionally recovered or re-used."
"However, I have some reservations about the benefits of applying the design standard to existing vehicle types, in which case the economic and administrative burden may outweigh the environmental gain."
"There is concern about the damage to the environment caused by the inexorable rise in personal car use. This has given rise to initiatives such as the one before us, aimed at reducing adverse effects by improving conditions for recyclability, re-usability and recoverability."
"Given the adoption of amendments intended to make this proposal for a directive more workable, regarding the date of its entry into force, for example, I voted in favour."
". We are disappointed that our amendments to the regulation before us were rejected, the purpose of which was to safeguard the present and future of fishermen, of fisheries and of this sector’s vital role in our diet, particularly in Portugal."
"We are compelled to condemn as an act of hypocrisy the fact that Parliament has accepted the inclusion of socio-economic measures aimed at ‘mitigating’ the socio-economic effects of these plans, while there is no legal guarantee of Community funding and the recovery plans are not dependent on the existence of these socio-economic measures."
"This was precisely the thrust of our amendments: to implement socio-economic measures that would fully compensate the fishermen’s loss of income, so that fishing would have a future."
"Unlike those who see the scrapping of vessels as a way of making easy money in the short term, without a view to guaranteeing the sector’s future and disregarding the fact that many fishermen will lose their livelihoods, we are seeking to guarantee the future of fishing."
"Given the problem of sustaining certain stocks of Southern hake and the need for their recovery, the fishermen affected must be fully compensated for the loss of income following the paralysis of their fleets. In that way, we will meet the prime objective, which is the future of fisheries."
"This is why we do not support the report before us."
". I support the report before us in the form in which Parliament received it, because it strikes the balance sought by Portugal and jeopardised by the initial proposal, which laid down a range of measures that would have been damaging to national interests, especially in the short term, without sufficient justification."
"Now that that balance has been struck, I voted in favour."
"We are in favour of Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania being more closely associated with the EU."
"Once these countries fully comply with the Copenhagen criteria, they should become members."
"That would be a natural development of the enlargement of the EU begun with the ten new members in May 2004."
"We are opposed, however, to strengthening the EU’s foreign policy, which is in many respects the aim of the resolution."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly supports the work being carried out tirelessly by Lord Ashdown, the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Of course, we would wish that the functions of the office of the High Representative are gradually incorporated into sovereign domestic institutions. However, in the interim period, It is vital that the High Representative retains the right to use the powers expressed in his mandate when the circumstances require it."
". Ever since the early 90s, there has been an issue surrounding the name of Greece’s northerly neighbour."
"Three northern Greek provinces bear names with Macedonia in them, and it also plays a role in Greece’s ancient history."
"In the neighbouring country, the resistance movement against the Ottoman Empire before 1912 also used the name Macedonia, and that also became the name of Yugoslavia’s southern federal state between 1945 and 1991."
"It would be obvious to use this self-selected constitutional name ‘Republic of Macedonia’ generally."
"Although every state chooses its own name without interference from other states or international bodies, attempts are still being made here from the outside to impose a different name in which only the last letter is indicative of the real name."
"If we were to condone this, then Luxembourg would no longer be allowed to be called Luxembourg, because there is the south-eastern Belgian province of the same name."
"Meanwhile, Macedonia has been recognised under its real name not only by the US, Russia and China, but also by Slovenia, which is an EU Member State, and by Bulgaria, which will one day be one."
"If the EU were to continue to refer to Macedonia by a different name, that would amount to unfair and discriminatory treatment meted out to what may one day be one of its Member States."
". In its neighbourhood policy, the EU must pay close attention to the Balkans, because we must monitor closely the development of countries moving towards various integration processes, and because experience of the recent past has taught us that peace cannot always be taken for granted in Europe."
"Now that a number of years have gone by since the conflict was at its worst, the Balkan countries are slowly but surely following a path that should give us cause for satisfaction, albeit tempered by the knowledge that much remains to be done."
"Let us emphasise, however, that, looking back at the past, we must feel pleased and that, happily, looking into the future, we can feel hopeful."
". – The European Parliament resolution on the western Balkans expresses the more general move of the USA and the EU towards new border changes, the competition between them to divide up the area and the EU's attempts to annex it to Euro-transatlantic structures."
"The push for the independence of Kosovo, the discussion of the revision of the Dayton accords and the reference to functional problems in Serbia-Montenegro confirm the new cycle of border changes."
"However, setting such developments in motion will create a serious situation in the Balkans, which may turn into an explosive situation as a result of the more intense fight between the imperialists to control and divide up the area."
"The Balkan people have already paid with death and destruction for border changes as a result of imperialist interventions and wars by the USA, NATO and the EU."
"Consequently, Greece as a country, its people, and the other peoples are not safeguarded under any Euro-transatlantic agreements."
"There is an immediate and urgent need to strengthen the common fight of the peoples against the ΕU, the USA and ΝΑΤΟ which, among other things, are the main parties responsible for the tragic situation which the Balkan people are experiencing."
"The majority of this brilliant text is related to provisions of the Constitutional Treaty."
"I consider this step premature and undermining the sole competence of the Member States in pushing still undecided adoption of the Treaty."
"Therefore I vote against the report."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party fully supports reform of the UN Security Council, in order that it better reflects today's world, and also supports improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN."
"However, it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat, as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members."
"We would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference."
". When we adopt this report, among the various ideas of major importance, we must not overlook the importance of combating terrorism as one of the central planks of the EU’s common foreign and security policy."
"Dialogue with third countries, international cooperation and the implementation of the 2004 EU/US Declaration are crucial factors in this regard."
"Against this backdrop, it is essential that we share with our Atlantic allies an awareness of the serious nature of the threats hanging over the free world."
"In general, I support the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"In certain crisis situations, it is natural to use both military and civil resources."
"At the same time, it is important that humanitarian principles should not be watered down and that humanitarian operations should not be used for military purposes (something that has unfortunately happened in Iraq and Afghanistan)."
"It is also important to ensure that resources intended for long-term development cooperation are not used for other purposes."
"For these reasons, I have chosen to abstain because the wordings of both paragraphs 45 and 46 can offer scope for arbitrariness regarding these aspects."
". I voted in favour of this report on the European Security Strategy (ESS), which for the first time provides a detailed definition of the concept of security."
"The ESS sees security as a prerequisite for development and focuses on factors that had not thus far been considered fundamental to security."
"In this regard, among the main threats to global security, it highlights the destructive power of poverty, malnutrition and disease."
"The ESS lays down three strategic objectives. The EU must be capable of, firstly, identifying threats and taking swift action by military as well as non-military means; secondly, promoting security within its immediate border areas, but also those of the future; and, lastly, strengthening the international order."
"I should like to emphasise, however, that the EU has serious shortcomings in terms of military means that may hinder its ability to carry out high-intensity humanitarian missions. The EU must be equipped with the technological wherewithal to assess potential threats."
". Whilst I welcome the fact that this report raises issues that are of immediate importance, it does not dispel my objections to the original document on which it is based."
"By contrast with what one might expect from a document of this nature, the time spent on identifying threats is kept brief and questions requiring thorough analysis are summed up in short paragraphs, whereas the document devotes much attention to the ways in which to press the European Security Strategy into service."
"Either the EU knows very well why it wants these resources – and the reason is not mentioned here – or it does not know why it wants them, but knows that without those resources it has no clout."
"Either way, we must express our concern at the lack of depth and substance, by contrast with similar documents drawn up by our allies."
"We see the fight against doping in sport as a very important issue."
"It is so important that, in each and every one of the Member States, it needs to be handled by the national parliament."
"We do not view sport and athletics as issues for the EU."
"We demand, however, that each Member State should have effective control of the EU’s external borders and combat the trade in illegal substances."
"Citation E of the motion for a resolution states that the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides an appropriate legal basis for drawing up and implementing Community action in the field of sport."
"One of the reasons for opposing the draft Constitution for Europe is precisely that, absurdly, it regulates matters that the Member States themselves should decide about."
"We are therefore voting against this resolution."
". ‘Doping’ in sport is a multifaceted public health issue that concerns everyone, especially those directly involved – sportsmen and sportswomen."
"The need to reach certain levels and achieve certain results, imposed by economic – sometimes colossal sums of money are involved – and political interests and mechanisms, which fly in the face of what ought to be the true values and aims of sport, fosters the use of a whole range of illicit substances that are often harmful to the health of sportsmen and women."
"Sport should be seen not as a highly profitable money-making scheme for the benefit of a few, but as an educational, cultural and social activity that plays a key role in every aspect of a person’s physical, psychological and social makeup."
"Among other measures, an educational and preventative policy must be introduced intended to encourage the healthy physical exercise of playing sport, starting during childhood and continuing throughout a person’s life."
". I fully endorse the motion for a resolution on ‘Doping in Sport’."
"Over a decade ago, I was myself an active weightlifter, although I never, unfortunately, managed to achieve that bodybuilder’s dream figure that was so much in favour with women."
"Today, I am glad that I took only lots of protein, and never clenbuterol or anabolic steroids."
"Both amateurs and professionals who dope themselves in the hope of finding sponsors, or financial support, and thereby perhaps fame, pay a high price for it."
"So often, what was then a star body is now not something you would want to look at."
"The IOC’s World Anti-Doping-Agency, which organises intensive research and the monitoring and listing of prohibited substances has acted late in the day, but not too late."
"Last year, Germany’s national anti-doping agency carried out 8 000 inspections of training camps and competitions."
"In future, doping tests are going to be carried out at 20% of all UEFA competitions."
"We need common international standards if monitored athletes are not to be put at a disadvantage in comparison to those who have not been adequately tested."
"What is needed is for those who manipulate the winning of their medals and prizes for the sake of profit or fame to be socially stigmatised for it."
"Only if sport is doping-free does it deserve recognition, and only if they are clean are sportsmen real examples to others."
". I welcome this resolution drawing attention to the problem of doping in sport."
"The number of doping incidents over the 2004 Olympic Games again demonstrates the need to combat this very real problem."
"The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides an appropriate legal basis to draw up and implement Community action in the field of sport."
"Therefore we have the legal means to protect not only increasingly pressurised sport professionals, but also the countless minors and amateurs vulnerable to doping in sport."
"I particularly welcome the call for the Commission to support a sustained information campaign in order to establish an effective prevention policy."
"It is also important for Member States and the Commission to co-operate closely with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a way which enables the European Union to act effectively with regard to the prevention and control of doping."
". By voting in favour of this resolution I am sharing the concerns as regards the use of drugs in sport, because it debases everything that sporting competition should stand for and because of the public health issues."
"Without prejudice to the rules on subsidiarity, it is clear that there is a level of intervention at which it would make sense for the Union to take action that, most importantly, might prove effective."
"We see this as an issue between the Member States and Unesco, even though the Council of Ministers has authorised the Commission to negotiate on the EU’s behalf regarding those parts of Unesco’s draft document that come within the EU’s competence."
"We do not believe that these issues should be for the EU to deal with."
"It is patently absurd that the EU should speak with one voice for 25 Member States on issues concerning the diversity of cultural contents and artistic expressions."
"We have therefore voted against this resolution in the final vote."
". We acknowledge the importance of this Committee on Culture and Education initiative on the convention on protecting the diversity of cultural goods and artistic expression, given the importance of preserving and promoting cultural diversity and on the current negotiations at Unesco, particularly during the current fresh round of talks at the World Trade Organisation, which, under pressure from the large financial and economic groups, would prefer to liberalise all markets and put almost everything up for sale."
"The creation of an international instrument in this area will help to consolidate the sovereign and cultural rights of people and countries and foster the development of public policies on international cooperation, and will ensure that cultural products will not be considered merchandise and put at the mercy of free trade and that the citizens have a fundamental right to access to a wide range of cultural goods."
"Against this backdrop, it is essential to highlight the crucial role played by the public services in safeguarding, supporting and developing cultural identity and diversity, in guaranteeing pluralism and in ensuring that all citizens have access to content and knowledge."
"Consequently, we must also acknowledge the importance of public funding and the determination on the part of the Member States to provide such funding."
". If there are areas in which subsidiarity makes perfect sense, one of those areas, as I have said on many occasions, is culture."
"This is without prejudice to all efforts aimed at, , cooperation, co-production experiments and Community programming, and without prejudice to international efforts, which should be channelled into ensuring effective diversity in cultural content and artistic expression. In so doing, we must always ensure that creative freedom, one of the prerequisites of such diversity, is not undermined."
"The next item is the Commission Statement on the drought in Portugal."
". Mr President, the Commission is well aware of the severity of the drought situation in Portugal."
"It understands the concerns and is fully committed to assist Portugal."
"My colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, met the Portuguese Minister of Agriculture, Mr Silva, on 6 April 2005 in relation to this issue."
"There are three sets of instruments that are of particular importance in assisting Portuguese farmers."
"The first concerns market support and direct aid, where the Commission has already acted."
"It has adopted two decisions: one on 4 March to increase the advance payments for the bovine premiums for 2004 to 80%, and another on 7 April to allow the use of set-aside land for animal feeding in the affected regions."
"Three more decisions are currently in preparation."
"The first concerns a temporary derogation from the density requirements of the regulation on the conversion of arable land to extensive livestock farming."
"It introduces a corrective correlation coefficient to be applied to the number of livestock units recorded on the holding."
"Another decision will extend the use of set-aside land for the feeding of animals to the whole continental territory of Portugal."
"In this context, I also want to mention the Portuguese request for transfer of intervention stocks."
"Traditionally, the Commission is opposed to such transfers in light of abundant market supplies."
"Commissioner Fischer Boel has, in discussion with the Portuguese Minister of Agriculture, accepted the particularly difficult circumstances due to the prolonged drought in Portugal."
"She has asked the services of the Directorate-General for Agriculture to discuss the arrangements with Portuguese officials with regard to the disposal of the transferred stocks."
"A third decision will authorise, under certain conditions, the advance payment of a number of premiums."
"These include an advance of 80% of the amount of the suckler cow premium, and 50% of the sheep, goats and dairy premium for 2005."
"Under Article 28(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the single farm payment might be advanced as well, provided that it is not paid out before 16 October at the earliest and subject to controls being carried out."
"The second instrument concerns rural development."
"When natural disasters occur, re-programming is possible."
"However, this possibility seems limited as we approach the end of the programming period and resources are scarce."
"Portugal asked that farmers continue to receive rural development payments even if certain conditions cannot be met due to the drought."
"At the end of January 2005, the Portuguese authorities requested recognition of the drought as a under Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 and to accept derogations to certain conditions concerning the agri-environment measure."
"Application of a requires a number of objective criteria, in particular the severity of the drought and the quantification of the consequences on agriculture and the farming economy."
"Some reports are already available and paint an initial picture of the expected consequences."
"On the basis of the information available, the Commission has no objection to the Portuguese request."
"However, Portugal will be asked for a more comprehensive report."
"Portugal may decide to compensate farmers through state aid for income losses resulting from severe drought."
"They have to notify their plans to the Commission."
"The Commission will do its best to approve such plans quickly."
"However, it is essential to prove that the losses due to a climatic event reached a threshold of 20% or 30%; secondly, that there is a direct link between the losses and the adverse weather conditions; and thirdly, that no over-compensation occurs."
"The Portuguese authorities can also use the regulation on state aid."
"Over a period of three years, up to EUR 3 000 per farmer can be granted in aid without the Commission being notified, provided that, among other conditions, the total amount for the period does not exceed EUR 17 832 000."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we called for this debate, we were naturally counting on Parliament’s commitment, and, at this point, I should like to express my appreciation to all of the political groups for Parliament’s show of solidarity."
"The drought in Portugal is extremely serious, as we know, and as Mr Borg has just described."
"Only a month ago, on 15 March, around 88% of Portuguese territory was suffering severe, or even extreme, drought, and despite recent rainfall, much has been irrecoverably lost."
"According to available data, even with average rainfall over the coming months – and the forecasts do not suggest in any way that this will be the case – we could be facing a situation that only happens once every 40 years."
"Farming has been damaged, livestock is at risk, supplies to some communities have already been restricted and all of this in already habitually depressed regions."
"Indeed, as the situation becomes worse towards the summer, there is a danger that tourism, one of Portugal’s most important industries, will be seriously affected, and the effects of the drought will spread to many sectors and many thousands of Portuguese people."
"Immediate action is also needed to prevent a repeat of the devastating fires of two years ago, which were partly caused by a dry period, albeit not even approaching the scale of this one."
"The situation is therefore worthy of EU solidarity and the longer we leave it to show that solidarity, the greater the cost and the less effective the impact."
"We therefore hope that the impulse of Parliament’s adoption of the proposed resolution leads the Commission to take quick and effective action to follow up Portugal’s requests, and there is clear evidence here that they are prepared to do this."
"We also hope, should this become necessary, that the Commission will analyse and approve any plan for state aid – already mentioned here – with the aim of creating appropriations to compensate for losses, and of meeting the need to reinvest and restructure the debts incurred by farmers, whose survival is, after all, the reason why we are here today."
"– Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his speech and for the Commission’s openness in relation to the difficult situation that Portugal is currently enduring."
"As you know, there is a severe drought in my country at the moment, which is especially acute in the regions of the south of the country."
"Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude for the displays of solidarity and support from all Members to whom I have had the opportunity to explain the situation. I should also like to say how pleased I am to have had the opportunity to table this joint proposal, endorsed by the main political groups in Parliament."
"We are at the start of a new dry season in Portugal, after almost no rainfall in autumn and winter, which is normally the country’s rainy season."
"In some regions, ground water levels are less than 20% of the average of the past 40 years."
"Consequently, all stocks of animal feed have run out, and, given that neither grazing land nor arable farmland has been growing, and that the use already in reservoirs is still restricted, it will not be possible to deliver new supplies in sufficient quantities for next autumn and winter."
"Furthermore, it will be necessary to feed cattle until spring of next year, in view of the fact that normal rainfall is expected next autumn."
"This situation is utterly unbearable for both arable and livestock farmers and justifies a swift Commission response to the requests put forward by the Portuguese Government, which will have a negligible impact on the Community budget."
"After all, as Mr Borg rightly pointed out, the request is for advance payments and derogations from the rules of various regulations that would, in such circumstances, be impossible to comply with, whereby farmers will not be penalised, and for the granting of state aid to be authorised, especially for small farmers."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Portugal should constitute a warning for the future. We must therefore consider medium- and long-term solutions to this type of problem, such as setting up a protection system for safeguarding European farmers against risks and crises – a timely debate was held recently by the Commission on this issue – and, on a broader scale, reinforcing the Union’s role at the forefront of international efforts to address climate change and presenting practical proposals for strategic action beyond 2012."
"I feel that in the short time I have had at my disposal, I have provided sufficient reason for Parliament to give this motion for a resolution its overwhelming support."
"I therefore call on you to vote in favour, secure in the knowledge that, as the Commissioner just said, the Commission will be taking the matter seriously."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the initiative which has led to this urgent debate in Parliament on the drought in Portugal and begin by expressing all the sympathy and solidarity I feel with regard to this problem as someone who also comes from the Iberian Peninsula."
"It is clearly not necessary to be an expert in meteorology nor a weatherman to know that, if it does not rain in Portugal, it does not rain in certain areas of Spain either."
"I believe that is pretty obvious and that, therefore, with regard to the climatological dimension of what we are discussing here, the problem faced by Portugal is practically identical to that faced by a large part of Spain."
"There is no question that the specific economic effects in the country are different depending on the particular geography or territory in question, however."
"But the problem of drought, the problem of lack of water, is a shared problem."
"That is why we have introduced certain amendments into this motion for resolution, some paragraphs of which extend its scope somewhat so that it does not just effect Portugal, but also, in part, the whole of the Iberian Peninsula."
"And I believe that that is what we must do."
"Of course, my group is absolutely delighted that specific effects are highlighted, in some cases with very specific references to problems that affect Portugal in particular, and, specifically, the south of Portugal."
"But, as the previous speaker said, we should all begin to consider this issue in more depth, because this is not an isolated situation."
"The European Commission, therefore, has a responsibility for studying, anticipating and planning in relation to the consequences of climate change, which is not just an issue for great political speeches during great debates, but which has immediate and at times dramatic consequences for the economy of the countries, as we can see in this case."
"So that is the first thing I wished to stress: this is not an isolated situation, it is not a crisis that will pass, but it is something that warrants in-depth consideration and therefore requires medium- and long-term political measures."
"With regard to the resolution itself, which discusses very specific issues, I would like to stress two or three."
"The first is essentially the insistence that the economic impact is a general impact, which goes beyond agriculture; the impact of the drought, for example, directly affects tourism and its entire rural dimension, and that is something that must always be taken into account, especially when we are discussing this issue."
"Secondly, the reference to the drama that brings Spain and Portugal very close together, and I would go as far as to say Catalonia and Portugal as well: the issue of fires, of forest fires."
"That is an amendment that has been introduced and that does not just affect Portugal and, therefore, I would like to link the consequences of the drought with the extremely serious risk of fires and at the same time appeal for the possible application of the Solidarity Fund to deal with these issues."
"I believe this to be very important and that at the appropriate time it will probably require a resolution and debate directly dedicated to this issue."
"– We have been warning the Commission and Parliament since the beginning of the year about the seriousness of one of the severest droughts in Portugal, the social, economic and environmental effects of which are set to worsen as the summer approaches."
"In our question to the Commission in January, and our speech to Parliament in February, we said that urgent measures were needed to address the difficult situation in farming and that immediate steps should be taken to ensure that the water supply in various regions is not cut off."
"The situation for farming is giving cause for concern."
"The autumn/winter crops were lost and the spring/summer crops, such as tomatoes, maize, rice, fruit and vegetables are at risk; this is also the case with animal feed, and to the normal growth of autumn crops such as citrus and grapes."
"Some reforesting that was carried out after the 2003 and 2004 fires has been lost for good due to the lack of humidity in the soil."
"This situation plunges thousands of small and medium-sized farms into serious financial difficulty. Practical measures are therefore urgently required to support Portuguese farmers, such as those measures provided for in the resolution, or, as we proposed, the creation of a public farmers’ insurance fund, financed by the Community, which will enable farmers to be paid a minimum income in the event of a disaster, such as drought or fire; financial support to offset the increased costs and the drop in agricultural production; temporary exemption from social security contributions, with no loss of rights, for full-time farmers with an income of less than 12 Economic Size Units (ESUs) and the extension of interest-free loans for two years."
"Furthermore, short- and long-term measures must also be introduced, in order to guarantee that water – a public asset and a universal human right – is made available to the people in sufficient quantity and quality. We have therefore proposed an amendment emphasising the need to introduce practical measures to support local authorities in the parts of Portugal worst affected by the drought, whilst ensuring that the European Solidarity Fund is activated fairly."
"Lastly, this situation once again points up the need to implement the important objectives laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, in order to prevent global warming and the effects that this has on climate change."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Portugal is enduring an appalling drought, with crops being lost, animals dying without food or water, environmental deterioration in the areas affected, increased risk of more forest fires in the summer and populations already relying on water supplies coming in from outside."
"Mr Queiró mentioned earlier that 80% of the country is suffering from the drought."
"The agriculture sector has already incurred losses exceeding EUR 1 billion and that figure is set to rise."
"The hottest months are approaching, the temperature will rise significantly and no rainfall is expected been May and October."
"At this time when we are looking to foster European solidarity with those worst affected, there is support that the EU must provide, much of which has nothing to do with money or subsidies, as Mr Capoulas Santos mentioned, but good will and an understanding of the difficulties on the ground."
"Firstly, state aid; the Commission should authorise the Portuguese Government to grant state aid to support farmers who have lost their livelihoods, supporting the acquisition of animal feed and investment in water collection and distribution, and facilitating the restructuring of farmers’ bank debts; secondly, to make advance payment of premiums to which farmers are entitled – in full, not just in part, Commissioner; thirdly, to facilitate the transfer of cereal from Community intervention stocks arising from the surpluses in some Member States; fourthly, to grant derogations from various Community regulations, to which you referred, Commissioner, thereby authorising grazing in set-aside zones or on land planted with cereals already affected by the drought; fifthly, to release funds and mobilise resources to prevent a high number of forest fires this summer following the drought; sixthly, to look into the possibility of drawing on the European Solidarity Fund on such occasions; and seventhly, to reaffirm European positions on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the EU works best when it is closest to the citizens."
"The Portuguese citizens worst affected by the drought must also be made to feel that they are European citizens."
"– Mr President, my first word is solidarity."
"We must show solidarity with the people in the worst affected areas, particularly farmers in the south of Portugal and in the border area."
"The situation is at its most severe in the and regions."
"We must show that this solidarity does not stop at the border and I wish to reassure Mr Guardans Cambó that it naturally extends to the whole of the population of Seville, Huelva, Badajoz, Cáceres and so forth, regions that are indeed also suffering the impact of what can only be termed a large-scale natural disaster."
"No matter what the regulation says, this is the reality of the situation and this is why solidarity is a key word to use here, too."
"I am very pleased to see that nobody has mentioned the word ‘exaggeration’ – the situation has never been exaggerated, but has been described objectively and accurately. I am also pleased with the Commission’s commitment towards helping to tackle these problems."
"I should like to place particular emphasis, however, on aspects that are, indisputably, intrinsically linked with a forest strategy that of course depends on Member States’ definitions, but which the Commission must also define accurately."
"Accordingly, when I hear that, as part of the revision of the forest strategy, the period in which aid due to loss of income can be paid has been reduced from 20 to 10 years, it strikes me that in the European institutions we have still not understood the crucial importance of a proper forestation strategy to combat these instances of near desertification."
"It is absolutely vital that income support continue for decades as regards species that take dozens of years to grow, before which nothing whatsoever is produced."
"It is crucial that support for the forests in the south of the Iberian Peninsula be maintained and that that support be stepped up in relation to the alternatives."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to attach the highest importance to this aspect."
"– Mr President, as has been said several times in this debate, my country is dry and the situation for arable and livestock farming is verging on critical."
"Things are already disastrous, hence the major importance of the proposals on which we are voting today."
"They partially alleviate and offset the losses incurred by the farmers."
"Other measures are required, though."
"It is essential that water, which is a very scarce public asset in the southern countries of the EU, be managed sensibly."
"Our civilisation, and my country in particular, continues to waste a great deal of water and this must change."
"The same could be said of the current agricultural policy, which undervalues the Mediterranean countries, does not encourage sensible land occupation and does not foster sustainable ecology in the rural world."
"In August, when the fires inevitably hit again, we shall once again pay for this irresponsibility."
"Lastly, we need new European risk prevention instruments."
"Mr Capoulas Santos is right in this respect."
"One thing we must do is set up a European farmers’ insurance fund that can channel part of the farmers’ contributions into a disaster fund, a participatory fund on the part of the Member States and the Union, a fund that can be automatically mobilised in situations such as the one in Portugal and the South of Spain, and on other occasions, in whatever country that may be."
"Mr President, I wish to express my sympathy on account of the Portuguese drought and my support for the resolution."
"I would now like to speak of the phenomenon that is behind it, however: climate change."
"The subject relates precisely to what Finland’s leading university professors in the field of the environment were speaking about at a seminar held in Parliament here in Strasbourg this week."
"One of our themes was climate change."
"The seminar was also attended by a leading official from the Commission’s Directorate General for Research, who had been genuinely delighted with the contact between science and politics in Parliament."
"Such cooperation between scientists and politicians is welcome, but, obviously, we should not take it for granted."
"The world is not shaped in such a way that academic knowledge simply flows in the direction of politicians."
"Sometimes it takes application."
"Scientists have no pressing need to come and lobby us."
"Although society engages in scientific research, legislators are often unfortunately kept in the dark when it comes to knowledge of this kind."
"We often wonder if, for example, the drought of 2003 is an indication of climate change."
"Researchers say that the question has been put the wrong way and that there is no straight answer to that."
"If we ask whether more droughts can be expected, however, they answer yes; if heat waves are to become more frequent, they answer yes; and if modern society will become more and more vulnerable to extreme weather phenomena, they answer yes."
"Now is the time for action, then."
"We can no longer wait for more certain answers."
"The information we have now should be enough for us to take ever more effective action to avert or slow down climate change."
"That is one of our principle political priorities."
"An essential ingredient will also be adaptation policies, in which we need to make a determined effort to invest, by redefining our very policy areas and investing in research."
"We need, for example, a proper forestry strategy in this situation."
"Climate change, regrettably, cannot be entirely avoided, but it is now vitally important to minimise the extent of the human and material damage."
"– Mr President, as has been mentioned several times today, Portugal is experiencing possibly its most severe drought since 1990 or 1981."
"The figures are clear."
"As a consequence of this drought, the Alentejo and Algarve regions are at less than 50% of the maximum ground water capacity."
"It is April, and as things stand around 25% of Portuguese municipalities have implemented precautionary measures to offset the effects of the drought."
"If I mention these figures, and all those that we have heard here today, with particularly strong emphasis, I do so because these have been the most devastated regions of the Portuguese mainland in recent years."
"I mention this to you, because these were the areas that received support from the Solidarity Fund when it was activated following the fires in 2003, in which thousands of people saw their livelihoods and their possessions go up in smoke."
"I mention the 2004 fires, which ravaged everything that had stoutly resisted the raging fire of 2003."
"I mention the areas that are worst affected by the enlargement and that, in theory, became wealthy overnight due to the well-documented statistical effect."
"The people who have suffered most are all those who had for many years shown strength and resolve in the face of disaster after disaster, people who make a living from the land, from livestock, from forests, from tourism and from the environment, people of meagre resources."
"They have suffered from the drought caused by the weather and from the water shortage, because the reservoirs that ought to act as a safety net are already down to just 30 to 40% of useful capacity."
"Commissioner, this would not have happened, or would have been appreciably less severe, if at least in the south the Commission showed it was ready to settle its differences with Portugal over the Odelouca dam and the remaining reservoir network. This situation is dragging on and has led us into the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment."
"I therefore ask you, Commissioner, whether you are prepared – whether the Commission is prepared – to solve this structural problem, so that in the future the people do not have to see such disasters happening again and again."
"I naturally thank the Commission for all of the proposals that it has tabled here today as emergency solutions, yet as many Members of this House have said, what we need are practical proposals, some of which are on the table and simply need the Commission’s approval."
". Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their comments on the Commission statement."
"The Commission shares the concerns expressed here on the effects of the drought in Portugal."
"As I stated at the start of this debate, we will do what we can to assist those most affected by the drought, i.e. the agricultural community."
"These measures will, in turn, also help the affected rural economies."
"I have listened to your concerns and your information about the hardship on the ground."
"Certainly the Commission will demonstrate its solidarity by putting in place the measures that I listed earlier."
"My colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, is conscious of the problems and has done and is doing everything possible to address the situation."
"As for the idea of setting up a more permanent structure to deal with such situations, I will forward the information to my colleagues, who will doubtless give it careful consideration."
"Other ideas and suggestions have been put forward, which will be given due consideration by the Commission."
"A number of you mentioned the need to take a wider look at the issue and at the causes of this kind of drought, which range from climate change to forestry policy."
"I thank you for your suggestions and your proposals, which seek to take a longer-term and more coordinated approach to this phenomenon."
"They certainly give me much food for thought and demonstrate Parliament’s commitment to sustainable development, a commitment that is shared fully by the Commission."
"The Commission is very sensitive to this issue and to the hardship that it has caused."
"We will do what we can and will demonstrate our solidarity with those most affected by this drought."
"To end this debate, I have received four motions for resolutions(1) which we will vote on this afternoon following the debates."
"It is surprising that the European Union has yet to draw up and implement a short- and long-term strategy to combat drought and desertification, since, in the countries of the south and the Mediterranean, this is one of the main threats to economic and social sustainability."
"The lack of a joint plan between the countries and the Commission (Agriculture and Environment) is, however, all the more striking given that the European Environment Agency has recently stressed that the areas that will suffer most from the negative affects of the expected climate change are the Mediterranean countries."
"We therefore support a policy to combat drought in Portugal and any assistance to alleviate the impact of this water shortage on productivity, the market and cultivation itself."
"Furthermore, we are asking that it be extended to other countries of the south."
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Bangladesh(1)."
"Mr President, imagine that, in one of our Member States, bomb attacks were to take place against former ministers, journalists were to be killed and opposition politicians murdered, and people were to be imprisoned and tortured by paramilitary forces."
"Imagine if these things were to happen in your own countries."
"In that case, we should be debating them every day in Parliament, demanding immediate measures and tackling the problems as rapidly as possible."
"That is precisely what the government in Bangladesh has failed to do. It has not grappled with these problems in time and with sufficient vigour."
"This is all the more regrettable inasmuch as Bangladesh has for a long time been a country in which women have had a lot of freedom and the ability to exercise political power."
"In many ways, it has been possible to see Bangladesh as a good example of positive development in both economic and political terms."
"All this is now in danger of being destroyed if the Bangladeshi Government does not take vigorous action."
"I think we must do everything in our power to help solve the problems and improve the situation in Bangladesh."
"I find it sad that there are fellow MEPs in this House who want to weaken the resolution when we know how serious the problems are."
"I hope that we shall today obtain a majority in favour of maintaining the resolution, without it being weakened by amendments designed to describe the reality as other than it is."
"I am pleased that we have finally taken this initiative and are putting Bangladesh on the agenda."
"Its people need our support, and that is what we can offer them today."
"Mr President, Shah Kibria, a former finance minister of Bangladesh, had just finished a speech at an event of that country’s main opposition party, of which he was a member."
"There, upon the spot, he was blown to bits by a grenade; three other people were killed and fifty wounded."
"It is with attacks such as this that Islamic extremists have created a climate of fear."
"There are parts of the country in which public offices appear to be collaborating with them."
"This is an intolerable situation."
"Amnesty International and the United States confirm that members of religious minorities are being systematically intimidated, persecuted and are subject to arbitrary arrest."
"No satisfactory improvement has occurred either in response to the last resolution by this House, in November 2002, or to the last visit to the country by our SAARC delegation, in February 2003."
"Recently, though, the government has had two leaders of Muslim criminal organisations imprisoned and their bank accounts frozen."
"We call upon the government to be more vigorous in taking action against extremists."
"Bangladesh must also meet its obligations under the internal conventions on human rights that it has ratified."
"It must outlaw torture, guarantee press freedom and the free expression of opinion, and press on with the fight against corruption."
"Only if it achieves perceptible progress in these areas should the conditions of the 2001 EU/Bangladesh cooperation agreement apply, for it was and is founded upon respect for human rights and the maintenance of democracy."
"The differences that exist between the government and the opposition must not stand in the way of their at least agreeing to allow the parliament, currently suspended, to resume its functions."
"Both sides must then work to create conditions that do not allow radicalism, paramilitary activity and religious extremism to operate."
". Mr President, when, in 1947, the enormous British colonial empire in South-Asia was divided on the basis of the regions’ predominant religion, the east of the province of Bengal was apportioned to the Muslim State of Pakistan."
"It was an overpopulated and flood-prone area, which attracted the sympathy of the entire world, and, in 1971, it broke away from Pakistan, the faraway land in the west that had no interest whatsoever in helping to solve the problems of this eastern colony."
"The new state could have made a good start had it, for example, followed the Dutch example of building sea walls and draining populated areas which flooded during storm tides; there would have been more space for the inhabitants and their food supply."
"Instead, we witnessed in Bangladesh a grim, clan-based struggle between two parties that are fighting a feud while both denying each other’s right to exist."
"In addition, the country has for some time been dominated by the sort of intolerant religious fanaticism that hardly existed in other parts of the Islamic world until 20 years ago."
"This fanaticism leaves no room for religious minorities, including Ahmadiyya Muslims or Hindus."
"Intimidation and violent attacks by government supporters go unpunished."
"Paramilitary groups, which claiming to fight crime, commit acts of torture and murder."
"Bangladesh is at risk of sliding into a spiral of self-destruction."
"Widely supported though it has been, a statement denouncing intimidation, violence, torture, exemption from punishment and economic stagnation will do nothing to solve the problem; instead, it should be a starting point to determine how we in Europe can best deal with that unfortunate country in future."
"That presupposes, at the very least, solidarity with the victims."
"Mr President, about a third of this poor, over-populated but democratic country of 140 million people is landless and forced to live on, and cultivate, flood-prone land."
"Traditionally the majority Muslim population has lived peacefully with other religious minorities, and Bangladesh has a good record on education and civil rights for women."
"The majority BNP Government, in power since 2001, has particular problems with economic reform as it is often blocked by political in-fighting and corruption."
"Matters are not helped by the current boycott of parliamentary dialogue by the Awami League opposition."
"There have been attacks on opposition figures, that is true, but the authorities to their credit have arrested eight suspects, in spite of them being part of the ruling party coalition, and two radical Islamist groups have recently been banned."
"Bangladesh also protests at India’s understandable attempts to fence off the porous international border which is subject to contraband, including illegal drug smuggling."
"One encouraging note is that growth has been steady at 5% for the past few years, but Bangladesh now feels threatened by unlimited Chinese textile exports."
"We in the European Union need to be patient and give Bangladesh every political and financial support, encourage good governance and the fight against corruption and Islamic fundamentalism."
"I call upon the House to support my amendments to produce a more balanced resolution."
"– The state of Bangladesh was established in 1971 following a struggle for independence."
"This predominantly Muslim country is attempting to find solutions to daunting problems in the face of a very high population density, natural disasters and poverty."
"The resolution leads one to believe that very little progress has been made, and ignores the fact that successes have in fact been achieved; for example, the country produces enough food to feed its citizens."
"It is a great shame that Bangladeshi government and opposition representatives could not have been asked in advance for their views on the resolution, which highlights the modest progress that has been made in a number of fields and emphasises the need to continue moving in the right direction."
"The fact that they were not does not reflect well on the European Parliament."
"Our attempts to boost democracy in the country are welcome, but it is a pity that we failed to mention any positive signs of democratic developments in the joint motion for a resolution."
"Even though we disagree with a number of unproven statements in the resolution, we support the country’s progress towards democracy and hope it will continue, particularly with regard to preparations for the next parliamentary elections."
". Mr President, today is New Year’s Day in Bangladesh."
"It is my heartfelt wish that the blessing of the Lord may rest upon that country’s leaders and its inhabitants for the New Year."
"While there is room for improvement in Europe too, we also have a few suggestions for Bangladesh in terms of New Year’s resolutions."
"Although it is regrettable that the constitution has since 1998 declared Islam the state religion, it does allow other religions to be professed, practised and propagated, so it is odd that it does not protect the ‘right to convert’."
"Would it not be a sound resolve to better regulate the freedom of religion in the constitution and abolish state religion?"
"I should like to illustrate the need for this with a real-life example."
"On Monday 4 April, reliable sources confirmed that Dulal Sarkar, a Christian, was killed on 8 March of this year."
"He was the pastor of the Bangladesh Free Baptist Church in the village of Jalalpur in the south-western district of Khulna."
"This man was simply doing his job and was not offending against the constitution in any way."
"On his way home, he was attacked by ten armed Muslim extremists and subsequently beheaded."
"These Muslim extremists are reported to have links with the Jamaat-e-Islami, a political party currently forming part of the government coalition."
"Dulal Sarkar leaves behind his mother, his wife and five children, and at present, his wife and family are forced to move from house to house in an effort to avoid retaliatory action from Muslim extremists."
"The draft resolution that we co-signed is therefore extremely clear."
"We are indeed deeply concerned about growing Muslim fundamentalism with its paramilitary groups and the abuse of power by fundamentalist Muslim parties."
"I am at the same time emphatically opposed to moderating amendments that have been tabled in respect of this unambiguous draft resolution."
"I urge the Council and the Commission, in conjunction with the State Department referred to in citation 2(2), to fight these expressions of Muslim fundamentalism."
"This can be done by applying the penalties referred to in cooperation agreements to violations of democratic principles, all of this in a bid to improve the plight of the Bengali citizens."
"Mr President, Bangladesh is exactly 34 years and 19 days old, which means that it is a very young state."
"At the same time, it is a very poor state."
"Despite the fact that poverty levels have dropped by around 1% per year over the past decade, 50% of the population still lives below the poverty line."
"Every year 325 000 children die, or in other words 900 every day, and on average one woman dies every 20 minutes in Bangladesh, or 26 000 every year, due to childbirth-related causes."
"The proportion of low birth weight babies is between 30% and 50%, and 30% of the population has no access at all to clean water."
"On the positive side, access to sanitary facilities has doubled over the past decade, and now stands at 43% of the population."
"The debate we are holding today is political in nature, but I see it as an opportunity to highlight the tragic conditions in Bangladesh, which was formerly known as East Bengal."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has taken up this matter."
"Mr President, this motion is ridiculous."
"We are talking about a country of 143 million people."
"It is one of the poorest countries in the world still able to manage its own affairs."
"It has been a democracy for some time now."
"There are parliamentary elections, parliamentary democracy and governance."
"The country is about the size of Belgium but has 143 million people."
"They are managing to feed themselves for the first time after many years of independence and of course there are problems."
"In Sudan, 300 000 people were killed, but that does not relate to the issue about which we have just heard: the outrage at somebody being killed."
"A total of two ministers out of a government of fifty-six ministers does not make the government Islamist."
"We need to have proportionality in our debates otherwise the world will laugh at us."
"The European Parliament is supposed to be an important institution, but look at how many Members are here."
"There are no more than fifty Members in this Chamber and they are apparently so concerned about this."
"We must use these human rights debates to talk about serious matters affecting people and their human rights."
"Three hundred thousand people have been killed in Darfur."
"What are we doing about that?"
"Let us introduce some proportionality and balance to our debates and give the issues we discuss in these human rights debates some serious consideration."
". Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s initiative to draw public attention to the serious governance and human rights situation in Bangladesh."
"Today’s debate is very timely; it is being held against the background of a law and order situation that has suffered a serious decline since the last European Parliament resolution of November 2002."
"Abuses against human rights activists, journalists and minorities are on the increase."
"The governance situation is at an all-time low and political violence has reached a new climax, as sadly exemplified by the grenade attack in August 2004 and the tragic assassination of former Finance Minister Kibria in January."
"We share your concerns about the dysfunction of the country’s institutions, the culture of impunity, mounting fundamentalism, the human rights abuses of minorities and the escalating confrontation between ruling and opposition parties."
"All these factors, combined with mounting religious militancy, make us believe that Bangladesh’s democratic and secular foundations are in jeopardy."
"The European Community has been very vocal on these issues, not least in view of our development mandate and the human rights clause that provides the basis of our aid relationship with Bangladesh."
"Over the last months the European Community and the Member States have repeatedly called on the government to condemn the persecution of political opponents, intellectuals, journalists, NGOs and minorities."
"The European Union has reacted strongly to the attack on Mrs Sheikh Hasina and the assassination of former Minister Kibria by urging the government to restore justice without delay and to give clear signals that acts of terrorism are not acceptable."
"We are continuously stressing our concerns about the climate of impunity reigning in the country, the confrontational politics, the mounting attacks against the tribal people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Ahmadiyya Community and the extrajudicial killings in ‘crossfire’ by special police forces."
"Let me also note that the European Union showed great unity on Bangladesh at this year’s Human Rights Commission in Geneva, where the EU agreed to single out Bangladesh as one of five countries in its statement of principle on human rights in the world."
"The deteriorating governance situation has compelled us to enhance donor unity."
"In February the European Community, the World Bank and the US Department of State convened a meeting in Washington with all major international donors to discuss how we can foster key governance reforms."
"The exchanges confirmed that our concerns are fully shared by the international donor community."
"This donor unity has allowed us to define common priorities and to convey strong private messages to the government on the poor governance and the urgent need to deliver on reforms."
"The gathering in Washington had a clear impact on the country: it prompted the government to admit publicly the existence of an Islamic fundamentalist problem."
"Alas, the government crackdown on Islamic militants is already petering out, as demonstrated by charges being dropped against a prominent Islamic leader."
"For its part, the Commission will continue closely to monitor the political situation in the country and pursue these fundamental issues through our political dialogue with the government and close donor coordination."
"In that context we will also increase the focus of our attention on the next parliamentary elections in late 2006 and the conditions for free and fair elections."
"The political dialogue will be underpinned by our offer to support pressing institutional reforms in the next aid strategy which, if accepted by the government, would contribute to a meaningful change and thus to more progress and prosperity for the people of Bangladesh."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the debate on the five motions for resolutions on humanitarian assistance to refugees from Western Sahara(1)."
". Mr President, I was prepared to add my name to a list of speakers and not to begin a debate."
"In any event, it is the case that this joint resolution that we are going to approve on the situation of the refugees in the Sahara is self-explanatory and deals with a strictly humanitarian drama."
"When dealing with the situation of human rights in the world, we will find a paragraph on the situation in the Sahara."
"Moreover, the political situation in the Sahara warrants further consideration."
"The strictly humanitarian situation is what we are dealing with now, however."
"We are talking about around 200 000 refugees who have been living in refugee camps for almost 30 years and whose only resource is international humanitarian aid."
"That is what we are talking about today."
"That, moreover, is what is in jeopardy for various reasons, including some purely bureaucratic reasons affecting the European Commission."
"All of this is on the point of creating a genuine humanitarian crisis."
"That is what this motion for a resolution is intended to deal with, calling urgently on the Commission to adopt a series of measures to prevent a humanitarian crisis of unforeseeable proportions."
"Furthermore, certain very specific measures are proposed, such as better cooperation with non-governmental organisations on the ground and greater support for the Sahrawi institutions which, within the refugee camps, cooperate in the administration of that humanitarian aid, which, I would emphasise, is the only source of income for 200 000 people."
"There is no question but that this resolution only resolves and deals with part of the problem and that we cannot turn a blind eye to the fundamental problem."
"There is a serious problem on Europe’s doorstep, and sooner or later we will have to exert every possible political and diplomatic pressure on the various players involved in resolving this conflict so that we can put an end to the need for debates such as this one as soon as possible: how we can feed 200 000 people who, without us, will have nothing to eat."
"Mr President, the resolution we are presenting and voting on today relates to the increasing deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Sahrawi camps."
"We are talking about a commitment made by the parliamentary delegation that visited the camps a few weeks ago, and which we are now fulfilling."
"Assistance is running out, and we must respond urgently to this situation."
"Nevertheless, we must also be very aware that the humanitarian issue actually hides the real problem, which is a political one."
"Humanitarian assistance is necessary, because the Sahrawi people are obliged to live in camps, far from their homes, and cannot live normal lives in those circumstances."
"After thirty years with no solution to the conflict, patience is running out in the camps."
"Some voices are even calling for a return to an armed approach if the situation is not resolved soon."
"This is very worrying; the European Union cannot ignore this fact."
"The most worrying thing, however, is that the solution is on the table, it exists and is called the Baker Plan II."
"It is an imperfect plan, certainly, but it is a plan that the Sahrawi people have accepted, and they have given way significantly on some of their positions."
"Despite this, the other party, Morocco, refuses to sign it, however."
"Europe is looking to Spain, and the Spanish Government must therefore lead the process of resolving this conflict."
"Let us not forget that the Sahrawi population is in the camps today as a result of incomplete decolonisation, and the main culprit here is the Spanish Government."
"I would therefore urge President Rodríguez Zapatero to give Spain the kind of role played by Portugal in relation to Timor."
"After thirty years of being ignored, of silence and of broken promises, the time has come for the world in general, and Europe in particular, to stop turning its back on the problem and to face it head on."
"It is time for the Sahrawi people to be granted their fair and understandable request for a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara, in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter."
"Finally, I would also like to express my solidarity with the Moroccan journalist Alí Lmrabet, who has been unfairly convicted of defamation after stating that the people living in the camps are not prisoners but refugees."
"– Mr President, you are aware of the biblical story in which a people wandered in the desert for 40 years."
"There is much myth in this adventure and in fact it is our adventure."
"In the case of the Sahrawi population, we are not speaking about myths but about real events taking place in contemporary history."
"These people have been waiting for 30 years in the Saharan desert of deserts."
"They are not looking for the promised land, but simply wish to regain sovereignty over their land."
"Mr President, when I was a journalist I visited many refugee camps."
"In Ethiopia, I discovered that there is a fourth world, a place where the people walk, walk and walk, because walking is a way of surviving, but I have never seen anything like the Tindouf camps."
"Out there in the sands, there is no electricity, but solidarity has brought them solar panels; out there, there is not a drop of water, but the water that aid has supplied has reached each refugee equally, along with flour, sugar and olive oil."
"The Sahrawi people depend on aid but they are not beggars."
"Parliament therefore has an urgent responsibility, namely to restore levels of humanitarian support in all its facets, and an emergency that is a responsibility."
"Real aid is the type of aid that can put an end to aid."
"Europe must commit itself to a referendum on self-determination, not only in words but also in deeds, because while they, the Sahrawis, have time, we have the clock."
". Mr President, the reason why we have again, today, been discussing humanitarian aid for refugees from the Western Sahara is that their homeland was not decolonised in the way planned by the United Nations as long ago as 1965, but has instead been occupied for over 30 years by its neighbour, Morocco."
"At the beginning of March, a number of us MEPs visited the refugee camps, where the conditions are very difficult, and were able to inform ourselves about not only the political, but also the humanitarian, situation."
"As we know that their most important food reserves will be exhausted by the end of next month, we call on ECHO and the Commission not only to provide immediate aid measures, but also to give the amounts that were laid down in 2002."
"I believe that the change in ECHO’s policy, which now involves channelling aid through the World Food Programme, has brought problems in its train in so far as it now adds up to less aid for an increasing number of Saharan refugees and also less variety in the types of aid provided."
"This House must play its part in securing for the people of the Sahara not only humanitarian aid, but also self-determination, to both of which they are entitled."
"Mr President, this resolution is the result of the commitment made by certain Members of the European Parliament, including Mr Portas, Mr Romeva and Mrs Scheele, in the refugee camps in Tindouf, where we spent four days together experiencing the harshness of living in the middle of the desert."
"We spent a few days there witnessing the suffering of the Sahrawi people, because they have no political, peaceful or ordered solution to their situation."
"Like them, we lived without water or electricity."
"In addition to these harsh conditions in Tindouf because these 150 000 human beings live in the middle of the desert without any comforts they are faced, however, with a situation in which our humanitarian assistance is being reduced."
"The resolution we are proposing here talks strictly about humanitarian assistance, because we witnessed directly the humanitarian difficulties faced by the Sahrawi people as a result of a lack of assistance."
"The assistance they were receiving is being reduced."
"I do not know whether any particular Member State of the European Union is responsible for this."
"France’s position on this conflict is very clear... I do not want to talk about that, however, because what we are saying here is that it is important for the European Union to continue to provide the assistance it has been providing for these 150 000 Sahrawis who are trying to find a solution."
"Political problems are one thing, and we will have to seek solutions in this regard, and other resolutions will deal with them."
"We cannot, however, ignore the fact that, just a few kilometres from the European Union, we have 150 000 Sahrawis who are suffering because we are not sufficiently generous and because, by no longer sending flour or by reducing the quotas of food that we were sending, we are contributing to the deterioration of the living conditions in the refugee camps, which are quite difficult enough in themselves."
"The European Union also has a responsibility as the main donor of aid from the United Nations."
"We will have to make our voice heard there as well."
"– Mr President, it is about 30 years since thousands of nomads from the Western Sahara fled to remote areas of neighbouring Algeria in order to escape the conflicts which had broken out between the guerrillas of the Western Sahara and Morocco following the withdrawal of Spain from its former colony."
"Today the exiles, estimated to number between approximately 160 000 and 200 000 people, are living in the Algerian desert and are totally dependent on donations from the international community, on the humanitarian aid sent to them via the UN World Food Programme."
"An acute lack of humanitarian food aid and inadequate funding are threatening the old, isolated camps, which find it hard to withstand the savage desert climate."
"That is why we are calling for the granting of immediate emergency aid, which will guarantee satisfactory distribution of food and of the food distribution teams needed, without overlooking the need for proper shelter and education."
"We are calling on the Commission to keep aid at the same levels at least as ECHO and to coordinate donors and European non-governmental organisations which already have a great deal of experience on the ground in saving refugees."
"The international community has no right to remain indifferent."
"Its response must be commensurate with its responsibilities."
"The global dimension of the causes and extent and of the methods for dealing with numerous problems is no longer in dispute."
"The joint resolution gives strength to this conviction on our part."
"– In March,I spent three days, along with other Members of Parliament, in tents and I saw the appalling conditions in which people live there."
"We came home and they stayed there."
"My conviction grew that it is of pressing importance for the EU to work to free us from the duty to continue for many more years to provide for the Sahrawi people’s most basic needs. The Sahrawis know – and have shown that they know – how to work, how to organise themselves and how to survive in the most inhospitable conditions, were they able to go back and regain control of their land, which is illegally occupied by Morocco."
"Through humanitarian aid, the EU must not resign itself to appeasing the conscience of the international community and its Member States with particular responsibilities in the process towards decolonisation in Sahara, which has found its path blocked by obstacles."
"The EU must take action to give impetus to the search for a political solution to the process, under the auspices of the UN. Morocco has blocked the process, repeatedly vetoing the most up-to-date proposals made by James Baker, and this ultimately led to his resignation."
"The Member States, and in particular those on the Security Council, must not continue to overlook the nub of the issue."
"The conflict is directly linked to Europe and not only because of historical responsibility."
"European interests are at stake."
"Western Sahara could be a supplier to Europe, if its abundant natural resources of oil, phosphates, fish and others could be legitimately and sustainably exploited, something that is not happening under the illegal occupation. It is also the case that Europe’s very security is at stake."
"Western Sahara is on our doorstep, and we have an immediate obligation to understand the underlying problems that feed into international terrorism."
"What kind of anger is being passed on to new generations of Sahrawis in the Tindouf refugee camps involved in the resistance in occupied Sahara, if they are not taken from the arms of fundamentalist radicals, if the EU, the United States, the Arab world and the rest of the international community denies them an outlet for resolving their conflict, thereby condemning them to impotent despair in the face of injustice, violence and destitution?"
"I shall finish by saying that the EU must also make Rabat understand that it is in Morocco’s interest to end the illegal occupation of Western Sahara."
"– We feel that this resolution is very important, albeit inadequate, given the difficult humanitarian situation faced by the Sahrawi people in the refugee camps."
"We must show immediate and practical solidarity with these people in terms of food, health care and education, and must ensure that such support is maintained in the future."
"Solidarity and practical, immediate and effective action is also required to put an end to the unacceptable occupation in Western Sahara, to guarantee the Sahrawi people the right to self-determination and independence and to ensure compliance with United Nations resolutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is truly necessary for Parliament and the European Union to commit themselves much more than they have done so far in defence of peoples’ right to self-determination, particularly in such striking cases as that of the Sahrawi people."
"Although this matter has been dragging on since the time of Spanish decolonisation, little attention is paid to the Western Sahara: it does not involve large-scale interests or large-scale numbers, it does not interest bankers to any great degree and does not whet particular geopolitical appetites."
"Perhaps it is also because the Sahrawi people have not waged their own war for self-determination outside the desert, they have not resorted to degrading terrorist actions, and they have not served the interests of powerful allies formerly in conflict."
"Europe must therefore commit to immediate humanitarian aid for the Sahrawi, but above all it must impose sanctions on the Kingdom of Morocco, so that it will respect the self-determination rights of this decent and proud people."
"Mr President, forgetting is the great enemy of many situations of injustice in the world."
"It is therefore more necessary today than ever to draw attention to one of these situations: that of the Sahrawi people."
"After thirty years, these men and women survive in an entirely inhumane situation, deprived of the most basic needs and living in extremely difficult conditions."
"In spite of this, they offer an excellent example of organisation and work, which keep them united in great dignity, and in particular we should stress the courage of the Sahrawi women, who have been able to create a well-structured society out of nothing."
"We in Europe have a moral and political obligation today."
"We are talking about an extreme situation that demands an immediate response."
"The Sahrawi people would like to live from their own resources and their own work, but unfortunately they must rely on our solidarity."
"The Sahrawi people have demonstrated their capacity for organisation and for managing resources."
"What, therefore, we are calling for today in this Assembly is an increase in European assistance and faith in the ability of the Sahrawi structures to manage it."
"We cannot forget that the cause of this humanitarian problem originates from a political conflict which needs to be dealt with."
"We must be in a position to resolve the political issue, and the referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people must become a reality."
"We must be able to find a fair and definitive solution."
"Peace and freedom for the Sahrawi people."
". Thank you for your initiative, which gives me the opportunity to express the Commission’s views concerning the Western Sahara conflict."
"First of all, let me stress that the Commission would like to see this conflict resolved soon and its resolution is crucial for the stability, regional integration and development in the Maghreb and in the Mediterranean."
"From a humanitarian point of view, one cannot but feel concern regarding the dramatic conditions for the thousands of Sahrawi refugees, the ongoing detention by the Polisario of 408 Moroccan prisoners of war, the difficulties for the families divided between the refugee camps and the Western Sahara, and the fate of people unaccounted for on both sides."
"All these issues impress on us the need for an end to this crisis, which has been going on for nearly 30 years."
"As you know, the provision of humanitarian aid by the Commission respects the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence and is based on real needs."
"The Commission’s humanitarian office, ECHO, also acts in accordance with the criteria of non-discrimination and not subjecting policies to political objectives."
"This means that anyone affected by a humanitarian crisis is entitled to receive aid, no matter which side of the conflict they are on."
"In full observance of these principles and criteria, the Commission has provided humanitarian aid totalling EUR 108 million to the Sahrawi refugees since 1993."
"Thanks to these continuing efforts, the Commission has become the principle donor of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees."
"The Commission has never interrupted its assistance."
"It has, however, adapted the timing and the level of the most recent funding decisions to the situation on the ground."
"I would like to emphasise that, thanks to the essential role of the ‘buffer stock’, created and funded by the Commission in 2000, we have been able to avoid any interruption in food supplies."
"The current humanitarian situation in the camps has not deteriorated."
"However, it remains worrying."
"There is a risk of deterioration when and if the possible break in the food pipeline, as announced by the World Food Programme, is not compensated for in a timely and sufficient manner."
"ECHO intends to propose a funding decision next month to deal with this situation."
"The funding for 2005 will depend both on the needs of the Sahrawi refugees and on the conditions for the implementation of ECHO-funded projects."
"I would like to stress that the Commission has a dual responsibility."
"It not only needs to address the humanitarian needs of refugees in a timely and dedicated manner but it also has to protect the financial interests of the European Union."
"Its operations in the Sahrawi refugee camps are designed to carry out this dual responsibility effectively."
"That is why the Commission attaches such importance to the proper identification of beneficiaries and full transparency of its operations."
"With a view to properly assessing the humanitarian needs of the Sahrawi refugees, the Commission is continuing its discussions with the principal agencies and organisations, in particular the Algerian and Sahrawi authorities, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and non-governmental organisations."
"These NGOs have played and continue to play an important role as ECHO’s partner in the implementation of its operations in the Sahrawi camps."
"Beyond its purely humanitarian dimension, I believe that the international community’s assistance to the Sahrawi refugees helps to create and maintain conditions that are favourable to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"More generally, I would like to state for the record that the Commission and the European Union’s position on the political aspects of this conflict has always been to remain impartial."
"The European Union continues to fully support the United Nations’ efforts towards finding a fair and lasting solution in accordance with international law."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the debate on the five motions for resolutions on Lampedusa(1)."
"The collective expulsions of immigrants by the Italian authorities between October 2004 and March 2005 from the Italian island of Lampedusa to Libya are extremely worrying."
"Specifically, the High Commission for Refugees condemned the return of 180 people on 17 March and stated that it was not at all clear whether Italy had taken the necessary precautions to guarantee the safe return of those people to Libya, a country which can in no way be considered a safe asylum country."
"We therefore profoundly regret that the Italian authorities have not allowed UNHCR access to the holding centre in Lampedusa."
"For all these reasons, we wish to call on the European Commission to guarantee respect for the right to asylum in the European Union and to put an end to collective expulsions."
"Furthermore, we demand that the Italian authorities respect their obligations in accordance with European Union law."
"We are therefore calling for a delegation consisting of members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Human Rights Sub-Committee to be sent to the refugee centre in Lampedusa, and to Libya, in order to assess the scale of the problem and how it is being dealt with and, in particular, how the people are being treated, which in particular would involve investigating the final destination and fate of the people who have been expelled."
"In conclusion, we must be concerned about the fact that, in the field of asylum and immigration, cases of violations of the fundamental principles to which the European Union and its Member States are committed are becoming increasingly frequent."
"Lampedusa is simply one more of those cases, and we must ensure that there are no more of them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure and, secondarily, to Rule 167."
"In my opinion, the Lampedusa issueshould not have been marked down for debate because it is a matter of bilateral agreements between Italy and Libya and the enforcement of Italian laws that do not contravene the EU Treaties."
"It must be remembered, moreover, that Italy is not Burma, China or Guantanamo, but rather a Member State whose dignity people are seeking to disgrace, and whose institutions, armed forces and law enforcement agencies they are seeking to condemn out of hand On the contrary, the law enforcement agencies have, for many years, committed themselves generously and far beyond their institutional duties not only to the immense task of controlling the legal entry of non-EU nationals into Italy – and thus into Europe, according to the rules laid down in the Schengen Agreement – and not only to trying to arrest and expel slave traders,but above all to humanitarian aid work and to the extremely difficult – if not outright impossible – work of identifying illegal immigrants."
"I have personally witnessed what I am asserting here and I invite my fellow Members to verify it for themselves."
"I wish to express my strong outrage – and on this issue I also appeal to the sensibility of every Italian Member – at the vile attempt to offend Italy’s national dignity and cast judgment on our sovereignty."
"Mr Romagnoli, you have made your point of order, but unfortunately I cannot deal with it, for the simple reason that you should have raised this issue 24 hours before this debate."
"The debate was arranged at the Conference of Presidents, no point of order was raised 24 hours before, so I cannot deal with your point of order."
". Mr President, instead of being associated with joy and happiness, Lampedusa – a beautiful island basking lazily in the hot Mediterranean sun – has become synonymous with pain and human suffering of tragic proportions."
"The southernmost piece of EU land reaching out as though to link Europe with Africa is the graveyard of the hopes and sometimes the lives of thousands of immigrant men, women and children; desperate people who are either running away from torture and death or are just seeking to achieve a better way of life."
"Their only crime is that they had a dream, which they thought had a slim chance of becoming reality in the otherwise civilised Europe; a dream of being in a land where they would feel safe and be treated as human beings."
"A dream that for many of them soon turned into a nightmare, when they discovered that the strict allegiance to the principles of respect for human life and dignity, so eloquently and loudly pronounced on every possible occasion by some European governments, is just a big illusion when it comes to Lampedusa."
"The responsible authorities are ready, willing and able, in gross violation of international conventions and treaties and against widespread condemnation, to hand them back to those murderous totalitarian regimes in Africa from which they are so desperately seeking to escape."
"Let us not beat about the bush: Lampedusa is a bloodstain of shame for the Italian Government, for acting in such an irresponsible, inhumane and un-European way."
"It is also a bloodstain of shame for the Commission and the Council for not taking any effective action to remedy the situation and bring the Italian Government to order."
"As far as the Libyan Government is concerned, its deeply shameful behaviour in the Lampedusa affair is understandable, as we expect nothing less from an undemocratic regime."
"I strongly urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution."
". Mr President, for people who have had to leave their countries of origin as a result of oppression, war, disasters and poverty, the Mediterranean Sea is an important gate to Europe."
"If Europe fails to do enough towards easing the problems in Asia and Africa, an increasing number of people will take the risk of entering Europe using dilapidated dinghies and neglected ships."
"That is, of course, a problem for Europe and, above all, for the countries around the Mediterranean."
"This additional burden does not justify the infringement of human rights."
"These refugees are equally entitled to an individual assessment of their motives and the correct application of the 1951 Geneva Convention."
"The same cannot be said for the hundreds of refugees who have been sent from the Italian island Lampedusa to Libya over the past few months, because that country does not recognise the Geneva Convention, and the agreements Italy has with Libya are not public."
"Between arrival in Europe and possible return to the country of origin, European law should apply rather than the arbitrariness of a country with a non-transparent government."
"Adoption of the two amendments tabled by the Liberals and Amendments 2 and 3 from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will make that possible and will stress that these refugees have the same rights as other refugees and cannot simply be moved on to Libya without Europe taking any responsibility."
"Mr President, large numbers of migrants regularly arrive on the island of Lampedusa in Italy."
"These people have taken the painful decision to leave their countries, often because they are fleeing from political situations that are threatening their lives."
"On 18 March, the Italian authorities expelled 180 people from the centre on Lampedusa to Libya."
"The lack of transparency of and access to the centre and the conditions under which these people were expelled raise questions with regard to respect for the right to asylum and the Geneva Convention."
"The speed of the expulsions and the fact that the people expelled were sorted according to nationality show that their applications cannot have been examined individually and that the necessary precautions cannot have been taken."
"As a result, we cannot be certain that genuine asylum seekers have not been sent back to dangerous situations."
"We are also particularly concerned that the High Commissioner for Refugees is being prevented from fulfilling her responsibilities."
"She needs to have access to asylum seekers to ensure that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so and that their applications are examined carefully."
"These expulsions are all the more alarming because we are sending vulnerable people back to a country that does not allow them to be protected: Libya is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and has no asylum system."
"It consequently cannot provide international protection for those who need it."
"Finally, Libya itself deports refugees outside its borders to dangerous regions."
"We therefore call on the Italian authorities to give the High Commissioner for Refugees immediate unlimited access to the centre on Lampedusa."
"The expulsions must also be stopped until the centre on Lampedusa complies with Community and international law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must declare my outrage at the assertions made in this House– by people taking advantage of being seated in this House – with regard to Italy and its Government."
"As everyone is aware, there is no Community policy on immigration: each individual Member State tackles the problem according to its internal rules and with its own resources."
"A joint debate was begun only recently and, personally, I have had the opportunity to represent this Parliament many timesin the informal meetings of immigration ministers."
"It seems obvious that the attack launched against the Italian Government is political and is an attempt to exploit the situation at this particular moment in time."
"There is a law in Italy – the Turco-Napolitano law – introduced by a left-wing government and unchanged by the current centre-right government, Article 10 of which is being used to confront this issue."
"The Court of Justice has been called upon to give its opinion, and therefore it would be more desirable to await such a decision, and not to put on political trial a government which is facing a continued state of emergency, with the arrival of thousands of impoverished people in a small areawith limited accommodation options, with the not altogether remote danger of indirectly encouraging human traffickers and terrorists."
"Every possible rescue at sea is effected by the armed forces, every request and individual situation is assessed by the law enforcement agencies and competent associations."
"No one is mistreated, no one is imprisoned; indeed, although they come seeking asylum, they slip away from accommodation centres in their hundreds with extreme ease, disappearing throughout Italy and perhaps Europe."
"Anyone who denies the embarrassment of organisations such as the UNHCR for this attack on Italy is lying; the official acts of the Italian Ministry of the Interior prove the contrary."
"Why do we not visit every accommodation centre in Europe?"
"Then we can confirm the situation everywhere."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must tackle this problem seriously and from a European viewpoint, and avoid bringing hypothetical political charges against a legitimate government, when such charges could tomorrow be brought against any other Member State and any other government."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall keep this very brief as I only wish to reaffirm some of the ideas already present in the resolution."
"Whilst the right to counter illegal immigration is indisputable, it is equally true that such a right must be exercised with respect for human rights and international conventions, refraining from collective expulsions and from the indifference shown by some of the receiving countries to the future fate of these people, particularly when they are repatriated to countries that have not signed international conventions, such as Libya."
"These are the two points that have been raised on the Lampedusa case, not by those seeking to exploit the situation,but by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and by the Court of Strasbourg itself, which has asked Italy to clarify its position before the start of May."
"We are in a situation in which, to my mind, we, as Europeans, have an element of prestige that is also recognised by countries that do not respect human rights, which is precisely that we respect those rights, or strive to."
"Let us please not lose this element of civilisation."
"Mr President, what is the connection between the Western Sahara, the topic before last in our debate, and Lampedusa, which we are discussing now?"
"At the beginning of the 1980s, this House – on another Thursday afternoon – held an urgent debate on North Africa."
"The topic was the Western Sahara and Gaddafi’s influence in North Africa."
"This House was, on that occasion, forthrightly critical of Gaddafi, as was the then Italian government under its then Prime Minister Andreotti, and in consequence of that, Gaddafi had missiles fired at the little island, which was the first time that Lampedusa became known around the world."
"What that highlights is Lampedusa’s exposed position off the coast of Africa and the Libyan mainland."
"What is happening on Lampedusa is not about one or two immigrants landing on it here and there; what is going on there is systematic and brutal trafficking in human beings."
"People are quite deliberately being brought to Lampedusa via Libya and from there on smuggled into the European Union."
"As soon as they are on the European mainland, they can get to Munich, Strasbourg, The Hague or wherever, without once being checked up on."
"If we do not want this systematic traffic in human beings to continue, we have to act, and act together."
"This issue is, for that reason, too important for us to allow it to be downgraded to a cheap way of scoring points in an election."
"If we are going to talk as if we were fighting an election, then I would like to say that I was advocating years ago that we should lay down common quotas for refugees, sharing the burden between the Member States and bringing their standards for refugees and asylum seekers into line, arguing that what we needed most of all was fixed quotas in order to share the burden."
"Who or what was it that did nothing to achieve this?"
"The Commission, which was then under Mr Prodi!"
"He, then, the leader of the Italian opposition, should clean his own side of the street first."
"This is not about domestic policy on the cheap; instead, we should discharge our responsibility as Europeans."
"Mr President, Mr Posselt, we have to accept our responsibilities to ensure that the credibility of Parliament is defended in relation to human rights and humanitarian norms."
"We have an obligation to raise the question of Lampedusa and the appalling treatment of the hundreds of poor and weak people who are deported by the Italian Government to a regime which would not qualify for membership of this Union."
"If we are to have any credibility whatsoever in relation to human rights and international law we must insist that all Member States respect those norms."
"The Italian Government is not respecting those norms by any measure, and I would urge the Commission to insist that the Italian Government – and indeed any other Member State, if it is in breach of these norms – be hauled before the European Court of Justice to ensure that these laws are respected."
"I want to draw particular attention to paragraph 4 of this resolution, which refers to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, and also to paragraph 9."
"I urge the Commission to press the Libyan Government to stop arbitrary arrests of those whom they consider to be migrants, and to respect the Geneva Convention and the mandate of the High Commissioner for Refugees."
". Mr President, the Commission followed the events in Lampedusa very closely and contacts were made with Mr Pisanu, the Italian Minister of Internal Affairs in order to obtain certain clarifications."
"To date the Italian authorities maintain that all measures taken in respect of those that arrived irregularly on the island of Lampedusa were not in breach of international obligations."
"They have promised to send the Commission a detailed report on the events which took place, and also on the actions taken in order to guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of all persons concerned."
"The Commission has encouraged the Italian Government to adopt measures that guarantee the right of each individual to submit an asylum request, and not to expel anybody while a decision on the request is pending."
"I would like to mention the Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status, which aims to provide a level playing field common to all Member States."
"This concerns procedures to be applied to asylum-seekers and will be formally adopted by the Council after Parliament gives its opinion in June, thus paving the way for its transposition by Member States into their national legislation."
"I would also like to underline that, in the absence of Community legislation on the matter, the assessment of whether the Italian authorities have contravened their international obligations under the Geneva Convention lies with the national jurisdictions."
"Having said that, the Commission will continue to follow this matter very closely."
"I emphasise that addressing the pressures underlying forced migratory movements, particularly in the Mediterranean region, is a priority for the European Union."
"It is thus the Commission’s intention to continue working towards this objective, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of those in need of international protection are respected."
"The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed by NGOs and UNHCR on Libya’s respect of human rights, in particular as regards refugees’ protection."
"During the mission the Commission conducted in Libya at the end of 2004 concerning illegal immigration, issues relating to human rights and asylum were given particular importance."
"Meetings were held with the Gadaffi Foundation and UNHCR."
"The Commission considers that such issues should be part of any possible future cooperation with Libya on illegal immigration."
"I would like to emphasise that EU regional cooperation with countries generating migrants and refugees must be firmly grounded in the principles of respect for human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group."
"There has been a technical glitch."
"We had asked for the final vote on the other group’s motion on Lampedusa to be by roll call."
"That has gone astray for some reason."
"On behalf of my group, I ask you to conduct the final vote on the Lampedusa resolution by roll call."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 14 April 2005."
"It is a pleasure for Parliament to welcome a group of Members of the Parliament of the Federal State of Mecklemburg-Western Pomerania, who are visiting our institution."
"With the agreement of the political groups, I would like to propose the following amendments to the agenda of the current part-session which appear in the corrigendum which has been distributed to you."
"The Commission’s Communication no longer appears on the agenda."
"The debate on the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez on sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean is postponed to a later part-session."
"Following the debate on the report by Mrs Klaß we shall hold a debate on the report by Mrs Handzlik on the internal market in the new Member States, initially scheduled for the votes."
"I must also inform you that two requests for consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have been added to the votes."
"If there are no comments the agenda will be approved."
"Finally, I would like to inform you that, following the negotiations held in the trialogue, I have just received a request from the Committee on Development to delay the debate on the report by Mr Mitchell on the financing instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation, which was initially scheduled for this afternoon, until a later part-session."
"If there are no comments we shall accept this request and this report will be debated during a later part-session."
"With regard to the timetable for our work, I must point out that, since the Council is present this afternoon, the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance that we normally hold at the beginning of the sitting will take place following the Commission statement on the Roma in the European Union."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Coveney on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU's policy on the matter [2004/2151(INI)] (A6-0086/2005)."
"Mr Almunia is present for this purpose, replacing Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who is in Luxembourg."
"Mr President, I welcome the presence of the Council and the Commission, who are here to listen to our deliberations on an important report."
"It has been a fascinating and challenging experience for me to produce the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU’s policy on the matter."
"It is my first report in Parliament and I was glad to take on such a significant one."
"It was an honour for my party to be given the rapporteurship."
"The title of the report is very broad-ranging and the report itself correspondingly deals with very many issues and very many countries."
"Seventy countries are dealt with in this report, where we shine a light on human rights abuses."
"The report deals with 70 different countries and eight thematic issues."
"Therefore, I was determined from the outset to give the report a very tight structure so that people interested in different human rights issues and themes in different countries, could navigate it quickly and efficiently, as opposed to having a lengthy report with no headings, requiring people to read a third, half or indeed the whole report to find the area in which they were interested."
"The preparation process has been a detailed one."
"We debated this report in the Subcommittee on Human Rights on 23 November 2004, again on 31 January 2005 and on 17 March – St Patrick’s Day – 2005."
"The full Committee on Foreign Affairs has also had plenty of time to debate and contribute to this report."
"It did so on 17 January, 16 March and again on 29 March."
"The process has therefore been thorough."
"Consultation between the groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, has been constructive and positive and I wish to thank my colleagues in other groups for that process."
"From the outset I made it quite clear that I wanted this report to reflect the concerns of Parliament as a whole and not of any one group."
"I hope we have achieved that and that it will be reflected in a strong endorsement of the report tomorrow."
"I have no reason to believe that will not be the case."
"Now we get down to the real question: what has all this work been about; what useful purpose that can this report serve now and in the future?"
"Let me outline the contribution I believe it can make."
"Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, this report must set the agenda for Parliament and must be a guide for Parliament when it tries to influence both the Commission and the Council with regard to the direction they should be taking on thematic issues and the priority the European Union gives to human rights."
"The first thematic issue is a difficult one politically."
"It concerns human rights and the fight against terrorism, which in many ways seems like a contradiction in terms."
"However, we are living in a modern world, where there are real terrorism threats both to Europe and to other parts of the world, on which the European Union must take a position."
"At the same time, we must be true to our values in relation to respect for human rights and try to get the balance right."
"I would encourage the Council in particular to look at the first thematic issue in detail."
"I believe the report makes a balanced attempt to answer that difficult political question."
"The second thematic issue is children’s rights."
"I received a lot of lobbying on this issue, and mush attention was devoted to it."
"It is genuinely felt that the European Union has not responded comprehensively and could improve its policy in this area."
"Therefore, the report calls on the Commission to present, as soon as possible, a detailed communication on children’s rights, linking the issue with EU development policy."
"The third area concerns the impact that conflict situations have on women and children, leading to tragic consequences on a regular basis."
"It deals with issues such as rape as a war tool."
"Many thousands of women have been abused in the most horrific ways during conflict situations, as a tool of war."
"It also deals with the issue of child soldiers."
"Unfortunately, there are still tens of thousands of children who have AK-47s put into their hands and are sent out to war to kill other people."
"It deals with the psychological effects that has on those children as they grow older."
"I shall refer to the European Union’s response to that shortly."
"The next section relates to the death penalty, an area where the European Union has had a lot of success in influencing its neighbours through the Neighbourhood Policy and has brought about a moratorium on the death penalty in many countries."
"Indeed, we are working towards achieving a ban on it."
"The report also deals with trafficking in human beings, the role of international business and its responsibilities in the human rights field and, perhaps most important of all, the issue of impunity and the role of the International Criminal Court, which deserves the support of the European Union."
"It is my belief that in many parts of the developing world impunity is the single biggest contributing factor to continued human rights abuses, because people believe that they will not be punished or held to account for the horrific actions they either sanction or take themselves. This report very strongly supports the ICC."
"It also strongly encourages the European Union to persuade influential countries such as the United States to support the ICC."
"The report also deals with many individual countries."
"I have been encouraged by the growing influence that the European Union clearly has on many countries in the world."
"Many ambassadors and representatives from different countries have come to me concerned …"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Coveney on this excellent report."
"As he has just said, it presents a very broad and very full picture of the human rights situation viewed from a number of angles."
"More than ever, human rights are at the heart of the international debate."
"The sixty-first session of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights has just concluded in Geneva."
"In March, the United Nations Secretary-General published his report entitled: ‘In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all’."
"He has therefore in a way put the question of human rights at the centre of our concerns for the peaceful development of our world."
"You do a similar thing in your report."
"You paint a picture of the human rights situation in the world, an uncompromising picture which shows that we must continue to be concerned about human rights."
"It also calls for even more decisive, even more committed action in defence of human rights."
"The European Union has always been keen to defend and promote human rights; it is a key part of our external policy."
"In the light of the challenges of globalisation and in view also of the ongoing deterioration in respect for human rights in many parts of the world, the European Union needs to make greater efforts to promote and defend human rights, first of all internally with the governments, but also with civil society, non-governmental organisations, national parliaments and international bodies."
"Something else that must be at the very heart of our defence of human rights is a commitment to resolving conflicts, conflicts which are often the very source of contempt for the human person."
"You condemn a number of cases in your report, with your tragic review of human rights violations in many parts of the world."
"In this connection, I believe the UN Secretary-General’s report, reform of the United Nations system, the prominence given to human rights with a link between UN reform and greater respect for the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights are very important."
"May I simply say that the European Union is first of all a community of values, a community of values, incidentally, which is better rooted in the draft Constitution, especially through the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This community of values that we aspire to be requires us to defend the principles of democracy and respect for human rights in the world."
"These values are and must be our guide in choosing between the tools we have available for conducting our policy."
"You will understand, Mr Coveney, that I cannot reply in detail to all the issues raised in your report or to all the extremely useful and extremely rich headings it contains."
"I will therefore confine myself to a few of the questions you raise, while assuring you, on the Council’s behalf, that our services will continue to study this document and take account of the many suggestions you make there."
"I will therefore highlight a number of aspects whose importance justifies dwelling on them more particularly, beginning with dialogue."
"We try to raise the issue of human rights wherever we have the opportunity and with all our negotiating partners."
"That is also why human rights are always an integral part of every agreement we conclude with partners, even if they are mainly economic agreements."
"We have in that way begun a ‘human rights’ dialogue with China, making clear that human rights are not a luxury of rich developed countries but something that must go hand in hand with economic development."
"We have also started ‘human rights’ consultations with Russia."
"This is one aspect of the ‘four common spaces’ approach that we are hoping to capitalise on at the next summit with Russia on 10 May."
"At this very moment, too, an EU troïka is discussing ways of resuming the human rights dialogue with Iran."
"Human rights are also an integral part of our relations with Teheran on other important matters: respect for human rights cannot in fact be separated from the other fundamental questions on which we are working."
"This is long-term work, we know."
"Even if it is difficult, not to say impossible, to quantify the results gained from these human rights dialogues, we believe they are an essential tool for advancing the cause of human rights in the different countries concerned."
"The need to find common ground with our negotiating partners obviously does not mean that we need not make regular appraisals of those dialogues."
"Our aim is to improve the situation on the ground, and definite results like respect for the rule of law or the release of political prisoners are signs that we are having success with such dialogues."
"I would also like to strongly emphasise the support we give to human rights organisations in a number of countries, as you also do in your report."
"It is unacceptable that European Union funds devoted or allocated to human rights organisations in some countries should be blocked by their governments; I believe the President of Parliament brought this home forcefully when visiting one of those countries."
"I would also like to say a word about a subject that is close to our hearts: respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism."
"This is first of all a moral question and then one of effectiveness."
"Those who think they can weaken respect for human rights on the pretext of fighting terrorism are in a sense giving way to the terrible blackmail of the worst enemies of democracy, the terrorists."
"We cannot go down that road."
"The attacks of 11 September 2001 have indeed made terrorism one of the European Union’s priorities, but we have said, and we said it again recently before the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, that the efforts made to fight against terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Moreover, on 21 September 2001 the Council stated that the fight against terrorism should be inseparable from the respect for fundamental freedoms on which our civilisation is based."
"At the recent session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the European Union played an active part in negotiations on this subject, contributing to the adoption of a resolution on respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism."
"That resolution provides for the appointment of a special rapporteur and will therefore help to strengthen the protection of human rights in the fight against terrorism."
"The cooperation, to which you refer in your report, between the Personal Representative on Human Rights recently appointed by the Council's Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP and the EU’s Counter-Terrorism Coordinator is entirely consistent with our policy in the matter and we are keen to develop it."
"I would like to mention some other questions to which you attach great importance. First, the rights of the child."
"We always speak of the rights of man, but we should as a matter of priority pay attention to the often calamitous situation of the child victims of conflict and also of poverty."
"I believe the European Union has a special part to play here, and we shall have to see how we can step up our activities in support of children’s rights."
"In this connection, I would also like to point out that the draft Constitution makes explicit reference to the protection of children’s rights."
"I believe we should extend our activities to this end, at the level of our development aid and in the context of the Millennium Development Goals."
"There is also the question of the rights of women who are the victims of conflicts, and that of strengthening the European Union’s action to prevent all forms of trafficking in human beings, of which women and children are generally the main victims."
"This is an area where the European Union needs to step up its action."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to underline the freedom of information and the right to information."
"Your Parliament has done a lot to encourage this right."
"Journalists are often imprisoned, tortured, harassed in all kinds of ways and, today, taken hostage."
"This is a good time to spare a thought for those journalists who have been held hostage in Iraq for more than 100 days."
"Another issue you raise in your report is the future Fundamental Freedoms Agency and the risk of duplication resulting from the large number of bodies concerned with human rights."
"We decided back in 2003 that the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia should be reviewed and that we should consider making it into an agency."
"The Commission then embarked on a large-scale public consultation."
"The very large number of individuals and organisations that expressed their ideas on the future role of the Monitoring Centre and its conversion into an agency for fundamental freedoms and human rights clearly shows the extent to which citizens feel they are affected by human rights issues."
"We can only welcome that."
"Following this consultation, the Commission began to draft a proposal for a regulation based on the many ideas received."
"The proposal will then be examined according to the normal procedure."
"While it is therefore premature to discuss this agency here, I would nevertheless like to stress that, given the scale of the task, there will never be too many of us concerned with protecting and defending human rights."
"We are aware of the problems and we intend to strengthen cooperation between the various bodies concerned."
"Our aim is to strengthen all the instruments and all the bodies that serve human rights, working together and in coordination so that our action will be effective while avoiding any duplication, since that would be an irresponsible waste of our resources."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by apologising on behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who has not been able to come here today, and also by saying how pleased I am to be able to replace her to discuss an issue which is so essential to our model of society, of political and civic community, and to our European project."
"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins by pointing out that ‘recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world’."
"All of us, in carrying out our responsibilities and in our daily and private lives, have the duty to promote and protect the rights of all human beings everywhere in the world."
"The European Parliament’s report on human rights that we are discussing this afternoon makes an extremely important contribution and I would like to begin by paying a warm tribute to Mr Coveney on his excellent work, which illustrates once again this Parliament’s firm commitment to human rights."
"The report contains extremely important food for thought and many very useful recommendations; there are too many of them for me to respond in detail to all of the issues it raises, but, as usual, the Commission will follow up this debate by responding to every one of the report's recommendations in writing."
"Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to certain points raised by Mr Coveney in his report."
"Specifically, I would like to make some brief comments on three issues: firstly, on the rights of children, in particular in armed conflicts, secondly, on human rights activists and, finally, on the International Criminal Court."
"With regard to the rights of children, the Commission is pleased that the report places emphasis on this point."
"In recent years, the European Union has implemented an effective framework for integrating the rights of children into its policies and programmes, in cooperation with UNICEF, we have launched a specific training programme on the rights of children and, last September, we established an Interinstitutional Group on this issue."
"The Commission plays an active role in the application of the European Union’s guidelines on children and armed conflicts approved in 2003: we regularly raise the issue in our dialogue with third countries and with representatives of groups involved in armed conflicts."
"For example, during her visit to Sri Lanka in March, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had the opportunity to place particular emphasis on the importance of eradicating the use of children in these conflicts."
"The Commission supports a wide range of projects dealing with the different aspects of this problem and, following a thorough analysis, we have decided to direct funds from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights towards support and training programmes in third countries."
"The aim of these programmes and these resources is to make progress in the application of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols."
"Furthermore, I would like to point out that the group of commissioners on human rights places particular emphasis on this issue."
"My colleagues have reviewed the work of the Commission in this field and are currently considering the best way to prioritise this issue; one of the possibilities being considered is the approval of a communication, as suggested by Mr Coveney in his report."
"Secondly, I wished to refer to human rights activists."
"In his speech to the United Nations general assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that human rights activists are our eyes and ears and that they represent our collective conscience."
"They are a crucial source of information on the events taking place in third countries."
"We, therefore, the European Union, depend on them, on human rights activists, to provide us with information."
"This means that we have an immense responsibility to protect them, we must focus on improving the follow-up and communication of information and, in this regard, a firm commitment on the part of the European Union's missions and the Commission's delegations in the world."
"The Commission is determined to play an active role in implementing the guidelines on human rights activists."
"To this end, our campaign prioritises ‘promoting a culture of human rights’, which is one of the four key elements of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Furthermore, we place particular emphasis on supporting local human rights organisations in third countries."
"The programming for that Initiative for this year and next year provides for more than 50 European Commission delegations to implement a microprojects plan that will represent more than 30% of the total budget."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to refer to the International Criminal Court, an institution of vital importance to the international promotion of peace and justice."
"The Commission considers the Court to be one of the fundamental components of a regulated international order."
"Thanks to this Court, those guilty of mass violations of human life and dignity know that the international community is going to call them to account and we all hope that this will reduce the frequency of these crimes, but in those places where they take place and where national systems do not wish or are not able to act, the international community now has a complementary system of criminal justice, enforced by means of the Court, which must distribute justice in an impartial, transparent and effective manner."
"This is the only way to ensure that it is seen as a legitimate institution and to ensure that many other States sign up to the Rome Statute which established the Court."
"The European Union believes that there are three fundamental principles in relation to the Court."
"Firstly, the principle of the Court’s universality, and to that end we are campaigning throughout the world to increase the number of ratifications of the Rome Statute, and I am pleased that, in March, 77 ACP countries jointly agreed to include a commitment to ratification of the Statute in the new Cotonou Agreement, which will be signed soon."
"Secondly, we believe that the principle of the Court’s integrity, which has been attacked by some countries, is fundamental."
"For example, the bilateral immunity agreements proposed by the United States undermine the very concept of the Court."
"The Commission is also concerned about the system of sanctions imposed by the United States on those countries that refuse to sign those agreements and we are continuing to express our concern about these issues in our dialogue with the United States."
"Finally, the third principle of the Court is complementarity with national judicial systems; international justice is not a replacement of national justice."
"We therefore support the reconstruction of legal systems in those countries in which the judiciary has not been able or has not had the will to tackle mass violations of human rights."
"The adoption on 31 March of a United Nations Security Council resolution on the situation in Darfur, which refers for the first time to the International Criminal Court, makes us very hopeful."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that the large number of countries and issues dealt with in the report will be an immense help when we begin our work soon on the European Union’s annual report on human rights."
"I would therefore like once again to thank, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, Mr Coveney and the European Parliament as a whole for your excellent work and to point out once again that we are always prepared to cooperate with Parliament in this task."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Coveney, on his tireless work in defence of human rights demonstrated in his report and also on his tireless quest for a consensus in order to overcome the many problems and conflicts of interest this report raises."
"This report on human rights in the world clearly demonstrates the inescapable and total commitment of the European Union, in general, and this Parliament, in particular, to the cause of human rights, which must not be preached to any one region, country or continent, but which must be of global or universal significance."
"I believe that we in Europe must demonstrate intellectual modesty when approaching this task, and that we must take the view that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house."
"In applying this reference to human rights, which the European Union implements by means of the democratic clause in the association and cooperation agreements, we must not show double standards and we must apply them equally to all countries, large, medium or small."
"I believe we must be rigorous in our demands for respect for human rights, that we must be precise, that we must not indulge in exaggeration and, Mr President, we must take a generous view of the progress being made by many developing countries in their legislation and their real situations."
"Because the European Union’s action, Mr President, must be geared towards promoting these processes, stimulating them and providing incentives in order to ensure that human rights eventually take hold in every region of the world."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to three of the many important aspects presented by Mr Coveney in his report that have attracted my attention in particular."
"Firstly, the reference to the case of Somalí Mam and to the work she has been doing to combat child prostitution and to defend the 91 girls kidnapped from one of the reception centres in which she carries out her social work."
"It is also worthwhile focussing on certain cases relating to the application of the death penalty in countries such as the Philippines."
"I would also like to take advantage of this forum, Mr President, to refer – and I believe this is relevant within the context of this discussion of human rights – to the Spanish citizen Carlos Ayala, a European Commission official based in Bogotá, where it appears he has been kidnapped in strange circumstances."
"I would like to draw the attention of this House to this case, and to ask that the consequences and causes of his disappearance be clarified and, of course, call for his release."
"I shall end, Mr President, by congratulating the rapporteur and expressing my hope that this Parliament will vote for this report tomorrow morning by the large majority it deserves."
". Mr President, I would like to refer to just four points in this comprehensive and far-reaching report."
"Firstly, on children and armed conflict, we welcome the emphasis on children’s rights."
"We have specifically sought to widen the definition of child competence to include messengers, spies, cooks and porters, because children in all these roles are vulnerable to risk."
"On the issue which divides this House, we insist that rape is a tool of war and therefore, access to full reproductive health rights has to be one of the human rights we defend in this report."
"Second, on human rights and business, a major faultline has been identified in our debates between the promotion of corporate responsibility by companies themselves and public authorities using our responsibility to ensure the principle of corporate accountability."
"The UN norms on business and human rights form the best basis from which to develop a set of global standards for the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations and we must support them."
"Third, on terrorism, the report is right to condemn terrorism in all its forms, as well as to insist that all actions to combat terrorism fully respect international human rights and humanitarian law."
"But the references in the report to targeting the democratic process and to the relationship between fundamentalism and terrorism go too near, we contend, to equating Islam and the Muslim peoples of this world with terrorism."
"I accept that is not Mr Coveney’s personal intention, but we wish to see that wording withdrawn to avoid any confusion."
"Muslims are as committed to peace and non-violence as all other religions – and none – in this world."
"Finally, we have sought to ensure that paragraphs 210 to 230 of the report address the specific instruments to promote human rights that we have as a European Union: the human rights dialogues, the human rights clause in our agreement with third countries, our representations in Geneva and New York, the actions and implementation of the guidelines and the European initiative on democracy and human rights."
"I invite other political groups in Parliament next year to join us in focusing more exclusively on holding the Council and the Commission to account on how effectively these instruments are used."
"I invite the Council in its response this afternoon to say that it will submit its own annual human rights report to this Parliament so that this report next year can be a response to it."
"I thank Mr Coveney."
"His compliments to the shadow rapporteurs are more than returned."
"He has done an excellent job and it is a very good report."
". Mr President, the 2004 human rights report has turned out to be an honest and balanced document, and I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts."
"Initially, though, it was to be feared that this report would be marred by the same lack of consistency and coherence as the human rights policy of the Council and the Member States that very often demand sanctions against poor countries from the south but turn a blind eye to serious human rights violations in more economically interesting countries."
"It would have been unacceptable if Parliament had once again agreed to human rights being made subordinate to economic or commercial interests."
"Thanks to the rapporteur’s openness and willingness to listen, however, the report as it stands does not evade the more delicate points."
"All problems are tackled, irrespective of the size or economic interest of the countries involved."
"It is high time, I think, that the Council and Member States followed the same course; if not, the European Union is at risk of rapidly losing its credibility as protector and guardian of human rights worldwide."
"This was once again evident recently during the 61st meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, where no resolutions were submitted on China, Russia or Iran."
"There is, I believe, a clear need for better coordination, more circulation of information and less ambivalence."
"I am pleased that the report takes note of positive developments, including in a number of developing countries, particularly in Africa, despite the major political and economic problems with which the black continent still has to contend. The successful reconciliation process in Rwanda, Burundi and in other countries illustrates that progress is definitely possible."
"Africa is at a turning point and the European Union must continue to support the fragile, early successes on that continent."
"The Coveney Report is right to press for closer cooperation with the International Criminal Court in the fight to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished."
"After all, democracy and reconciliation go hand in hand with justice."
"Quite a few developing countries, however, are under enormous pressure from the United States to undermine the Criminal Court’s good work."
"If the European Union and the Member States are really serious about the ICC, they must give those countries that refuse to bow to US threats economic and commercial compensation using all the means at their disposal."
"The ICC has meanwhile launched inquiries into the situation in Congo and also Northern Uganda where the population continues to suffer at the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and their terrorist activities."
"Entire villages are being massacred and burnt down; children are abducted and used as soldiers or sex slaves, yet it would take only a small-scale, limited military effort to put the LRA out of action for good and to put a stop to the most serious human rights violations in the world."
"Unfortunately for the population who have to experience the cruelties on a daily basis, Northern Uganda has no oil, coltan or other raw materials that might induce the international community to take an interest in it."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has tabled a limited number of amendments, one of which stresses the need for enforcing the arms embargo against China until such time as the Chinese Government demonstrates that new anti-secession laws do not entail any aggression in respect of the Taiwanese population."
"If this amendment is approved, my group will support the Coveney report with even more conviction."
"Mr President, it is customary to congratulate rapporteurs in this House where we all try to outdo each other in being kind."
"This time, however, we really must express our admiration for the work Mr Coveney has done; he has listened very hard and worked meticulously to produce what really is a full, clear and fair report."
"We can all see that successfully appraising the human rights situation country by country is not an easy thing to achieve."
"I would therefore like to add my own sincere congratulations to all those that have been addressed to him."
"This report contains a tremendous number of positive points and my Group is particularly pleased with the balance it achieves in the matter of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism."
"That is a subject which I believe is attracting a lot of attention internationally, at European level and in this House, and what we are seeing today – I mean what has just been decided following the UN session – will, with the rapporteur’s help, enable us to make very significant progress in the matter."
"My group also welcomes the extension of civil and political rights to economic and social issues with an important chapter on the social responsibility of business."
"When we consider the amendments tomorrow, I would like us also perhaps to recognise the right to development as an inalienable human right, as the UNDP’s work on the degradation of ecosystems and the effects of pollution on our ability, on a world scale, to achieve the Millennium goals invites us to do and as was stated in a United Nations declaration in 1986."
"The Johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights."
"I will be inviting you to consider these questions tomorrow."
"Having said that, I believe the most important thing about this report is probably the ability, an ability we can continue to develop in the years ahead, to analyse the European Union’s instruments for protecting and promoting human rights and democracy in the world."
"I believe that is an extremely important chapter."
"Everyone today can see to what extent the European Union’s credibility, people’s expectations of it and what it will become with the hoped-for adoption of the Constitution are focussed around the question of human rights and democracy, and I do not believe we will be able to get a European way of doing things accepted in dialogue, in credibility and in equity if we are incapable of making considerable progress internally, between our institutions."
"If we really want all our mechanisms to be monitored and evaluated, the European Parliament must be involved, and kept informed about, every action decided in accordance with the guidelines and with the structured human rights dialogues and be involved in all the measures taken by the Commission and the Council."
"Our policy will be more effective and more coherent if we have better interinstitutional dialogue."
". Mr President, whilst I acknowledge the very substantial efforts made by Mr Coveney I must, unfortunately, add that the results fall well short of expectations."
"It is, in reality, an extensive report, full of statements with which we can agree, which are simplistic at times and marked by a certain desire to please."
"At the same time, however, the report is very careful – and on this point I disagree with Mr van Hecke – to avoid disgruntling the European Union’s economic and political partners."
"It can be argued that this report is very weak towards the strong and, all too often, very negligent towards the weak."
"Many examples can be cited: no mention is made of the tragic situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey, which is yet to join the European Union and thus should have been included in such a document."
"There is an unwillingness, however, to upset relations with Turkey."
"With regard to Iraq, there is a reluctance to single out US responsibility in the treatment of prisoners: virtually nothing is said on the subject of Abu Ghraib."
"Regarding Colombia, again no criticism is made of the role of the government and its relationship with the paramilitary forces."
"The Israeli Government is asked to stop building the wall, but is not explicitly denounced for it."
"Aside from that, no reference whatsoever is made to the lack of respect for freedom of information in Algeria."
"I would therefore say that, in some ways, this document has not made the best of the opportunity presented and that, if it remains in its current state, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will not be able to lend their support to it."
". Mr President, I can fully identify with the appeal in paragraph 22 of the Coveney Report."
"The new Palestinian leadership must put a stop to terrorist acts directed against Israel."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament should also endorse this urgent appeal; if they do not, we might as well give up all hope of a resumption of the peace talks."
"Meanwhile, the forthcoming Palestinian parliamentary elections present the European institutions with a serious and urgent problem, in the shape of participation by Hamas, the Islamic organisation that features on the EU’s terror list with good reason."
"In fact, Hamas is expected to achieve good results in the ballot."
"How do the Council and the Commission intend to respond to that?"
"Israel’s Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, fears that, after the parliamentary elections, the European Union will no longer consider Hamas a terrorist movement, and he is prepared to continue talks about a peace deal only as and when the Palestinian militant groups are completely disarmed and dismantled."
"If I remember rightly, the European Union made the same demands of the Palestinian Authority years ago."
"What will the Council and the Commission say to the Israeli Prime Minister?"
"Whatever the case may be, you cannot tell this House that the inclusion of political parties with a military arm, in other words terrorist units, would be of any benefit whatever to the democratisation process in the Middle East, a region in which I would urge you to act consistently."
"A clear and principled European position of this kind will help the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a reasonable political settlement on human rights and human lives in that region."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great many aspects of this report meet with our approval."
"Nonetheless, we believe there are parts of it that could be improved, and the matter of the arms embargo against China is undoubtedly one of the latter."
"If I may, however, I should like to focus on a number of amendments to the report which were rejected by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and which have now been tabled again in plenary."
"We have heard certain Members invoke reproductive health rights during almost every debate in the House in recent months on issues such as measures to combat AIDS, women’s rights in Europe and throughout the world and our humanitarian policy objectives."
"Bearing in mind the WHO’s definition of reproductive health rights, the implication is that we are being asked to vote on abortion."
"I am prepared to believe that all the Members of this House, and indeed all of us in Europe, are acting in good faith, yet I find it impossible to understand that abortion can be alluded to so frequently and with such flippancy, when it is something that a great many people all over the world believe to be morally inadmissible and cruel."
"This is the reasoning behind a great many of the amendments to this report."
"Even if not all of us are certain that human life is present at conception and during the first stages of pregnancy, there is surely no one who would argue rationally that we can be 100% certain that human life is not present during those first days, weeks and months of pregnancy."
"No one can be sure of such a thing."
"In this day and age, no one can rule out the possibility that abortion is an attack on innocent and defenceless human lives."
"The fact that we cannot be certain means that we should ask ourselves whether it is worth taking a risk when the stakes are so high."
"Do we want to be viewed by future generations in the same way that we now view those who were racist or who supported slavery?"
"Do we want to be viewed as a society that realised it was unfair to discriminate against people on the basis of their race or origin, but that was entirely oblivious of the fact that it did itself discriminate against people on the basis of their stage of development?"
"In order to prevent the risk of this happening, we should avoid making any reference to abortion or reproductive rights in our documents."
"I am quite sure that every single one of the objectives of our humanitarian policy could be achieved without any mention of abortion and reproductive rights, and this would allow us to act with a great deal more unanimity and solidarity."
"I thank you for your attention, and I would ask you not to view my comments as a statement of political confrontation."
"I am speaking in good faith as someone who believes in European unity, and who believes that Europe’s task is to pursue moral policies that do not attempt to impose on the rest of the world solutions to issues upon which we ourselves are divided in Europe."
"Mr President, for years, this House has – as is only right and proper – taken a sympathetic line on the cause of human rights worldwide."
"When this report then establishes that Moldova’s competing parties did not have equal access to the media in the previous ballot result and could not count on impartial coverage about the campaign, I am pleased that the rapporteur is concerned about such values as free expression of opinion and an independent press."
"In countries such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, too, those values, according to this report, are trampled underfoot on a massive scale."
"This report, though, is very selective – after all, you do not talk about rope in the house of a man who hanged himself."
"Indeed, it could have occurred to the rapporteur that Belgium, which is, after all, the country in which this Parliament is based, suffers the same ailments as Moldova, Algeria and so many other countries."
"In my country, VRT, the public broadcasting corporation, which is funded by all Flemish taxpayers, has, in totalitarian fashion, decreed that it will not invite the largest party in Flanders, the , to appear, which amounts, in effect, to censoring it."
"So it is that Flanders’ only opposition party is formally denied access to the public broadcasting corporation and gagged in the best tradition of the former East Germany."
"From now on, a politburo of left and far-left editors-in-chief, not unlike the Soviet Union’s former People’s Commissioners, will decide whether reports about my party can be broadcast; only those that depict the party in a bad light will be."
"No greater obsequiousness and venal sycophancy in respect of the establishment has ever before been displayed in the EU by publicly-paid journalists."
"The freedom of expression and the right to information from varied sources has become a joke in Belgium; this is completely at odds with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I would urge all my fellow MEPs, irrespective of their party political allegiance, to sign the written declaration which we submitted today to lodge their concern about this of the media in my country and to denounce the totalitarian attitude of Belgian radio and television."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coveney on his excellent report."
"I have always supported the highest civil and political rights and good governance for all states."
"Democracy is the ideal form of government that enables the full consent of the peoples involved."
"Nevertheless, the world is a complex place and a number of issues remain relative rather than absolute."
"For instance, a balance must be struck between a state’s right to defend itself against terrorist action and the need to ensure civil rights for prisoners."
"This is illustrated by the Guantánamo Bay situation."
"The United States felt that its national security was threatened after the 9/11 attacks and therefore had to detain large numbers of suspects until the lack of danger could be proven."
"Now of course many have been released."
"Another case is the reference to the condemnation of the security fence built by Israel, which has dramatically reduced the number of Palestinian suicide bombers who cross into Israel to kill innocent Israelis."
"Yet many of my colleagues here believe that the fence represents an annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel, although the final borders will be settled only through a land-for-peace deal."
"Another issue is impunity, which of course we all rightly condemn."
"It is also a tricky issue as we have seen in countries such as Algeria, or, in the past, South Africa."
"The parliament of Algeria is currently debating an amnesty for all those guilty of crimes against detainees, in the interests of peace and reconciliation and turning over a new page."
"Regrettably perhaps, sometimes the carrot of amnesty is the only way of guaranteeing a lasting peace."
"I have been also involved in the report on Uzbekistan and the question of a carrot-and-stick approach to this Central Asian republic which has no traditions of human rights or democracy and is now taking firm steps in that direction, something that must be encouraged."
"This House must also look more closely in general at the human rights clauses in the EU Association Agreements in countries such as Syria, which continue to be one-party dictatorships."
"In the case of Syria, there is also the issue of support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah."
"Lastly, I remain deeply sceptical of the need for an EU human rights agency within or outside our borders."
"This would duplicate the work of other bodies such as the United Nations, the OSCE or the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, Mrs Flautre, who is generally scathing in her comments, has congratulated the rapporteur. I would not dare do otherwise, therefore, and I thank him in my turn."
"I would, however, like to say that the report on human rights is a virtually impossible exercise."
"There are in fact at least three traps into which it can fall."
"The first is for there to be no consistency between one human rights report and the next."
"I would like to tell Mr Szymański we voted in favour of the right to reproductive health as a human right last year: I hope we will do the same this year."
"The second trap is that of double standards."
"I am, for example, amazed to find a whole paragraph on Morocco, which has made constructive efforts on human rights, but to find only one line on other countries that are blatantly violating human rights."
"It is the law of the genre."
"A third trap is perhaps lack of transparency."
"We have in fact compromised in some areas, and as they stand some paragraphs suggest we have been less critical of great powers than we would have liked."
"I will say no more about that; it is somewhat inevitable in an exercise like a human rights report."
"More seriously, I would like to say that it is clear that there are some paragraphs which my party will not accept, paragraph 78 in particular, which condemns the Council for lifting sanctions against Cuba."
"I would like to tell the Council that I welcome this act of openness."
"I do not think that economic sanctions have ever helped democracy; on the contrary, they have served to completely harm and weaken nations."
"There are therefore some paragraphs, some amendments to which my Group will be particularly sensitive and which will determine its vote at the end of the day."
"That has, however, nothing to do with the qualities of the rapporteur, whom I thank once again."
"Mr President, I wish to concentrate my observations on two areas of this report in particular."
"The first is human rights abuses in Kashmir and the second is the fight against terrorism."
"I wish to start by discussing paragraph 49 on Kashmir."
"I would firstly like formally to thank Mr Coveney for his approach in dealing with this matter and the way in which he has been open to considering representations made by my colleague Mrs Lynne and myself."
"Through a process of dialogue between our respective offices, paragraph 49 is now an adequate recognition of the position."
"Of course I welcome the dialogue between Pakistan and India, but we must not forget that the people of Kashmir are also stakeholders in this process."
"We cannot expect real lasting peace in the region unless they are able to play their full and proper part in the dialogue."
"Equally, I welcome the recognition of the role of the Indian military and police in carrying out abuses and call upon the Indian Government to do all within its power to end such abuse immediately."
"Equally, I urge the wider world to recognise that this burning issue between two nuclear powers deserves external input to facilitate dialogue between the stakeholders."
"On the issue of the fight against terrorism, I welcome paragraphs 101 to 108 as they deal directly with issues pertaining to the current situation in many countries, including some European states, where citizens who follow the Islamic faith are being targeted in a systematic fashion for no reason other than the fact that they choose to follow the Islamic faith or they are perceived to be Muslim."
"This has been explicitly admitted by government ministers at a national government level and is something against which we must take a stand as a parliament."
"I am therefore encouraged by the above paragraphs, as we are taking a stand on the issue of the unnecessary and disproportionate erosion of civil liberties undertaken by governments against their own citizens under the guise of the prevention of terrorism."
"Finally, I wish to highlight paragraph 111, to draw attention to the use by some states of torture by proxy and the potential reliance on evidence obtained by such means."
"I am saddened to say that there are reports of prisoners being removed from within the EU to outside countries, for evidence to be extracted by the use of torture."
"As a parliament we are duty-bound to disapprove of such activities."
"Mr President, we have always said that the main value of European integration is respect for and promotion of human rights."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Coveney on this report that deals with a sensitive area in which the European Union’s credibility is at stake."
"Within the context of the proliferation of the trade and association agreements that the Union is promoting, therefore, we must not allow human rights to become a lesser requirement, but rather they should be the very essence of those agreements."
"Let us look at some examples."
"With regard to China and before lifting the arms embargo, we must take advantage of the dialogue on human rights we have set up with that country in order to promote internal political changes leading to greater democratisation and improvements in the institutions and justice systems, placing particular emphasis on the so-called three Ts (Tiananmen, Tibet and Taiwan), as well as the abolition of the death penalty."
"With regard to Morocco, we must also take advantage of our privileged relationship as neighbours to condemn the repeated violation of press freedom, which, amongst other things, would involve Rabat lifting the sentences handed down to journalists such as Alí Lmrabet, observing international law and promoting the Baker plan as a framework for a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara."
"Mexico is another case in relation to which we must insist, on the basis of the association agreement with that country, that the Mexican authorities tackle violence against women with greater determination and political will."
"Furthermore, we must express regret at the increasing persecution suffered by certain indigenous groups and anti-globalisation activists as a result of their public criticisms of the government."
"With regard to Colombia, the European Union must reiterate its concern at the constant violation of human rights in that country and the growing threat faced daily by human rights activists."
"We must therefore urge the Colombian authorities to protect these people."
"Finally, the European Union must promote a series of binding regulations for companies in order to make them responsible for the possible negative impact of their activities on the environment, the social and employment situations of people and peoples and human rights in general."
"– Mr President, given the importance of this report to Parliament’s credibility, I should like to make three comments:"
"Firstly, charity begins at home, and in the countries that will one day be part of that home."
"It is therefore wrong that countries applying to join the EU should be exempt from the assessment."
"The Kurds and the Turkish democrats do not welcome that exemption."
"Secondly, the spectre of double standards looms large over the report."
"For example, the report rightly welcomes progress made in Morocco, yet omits the fact that journalists can still be put in prison for referring to the Sahrawi people in Tindouf as refugees and not as hostages."
"My third and last point concerns terrorism."
"I welcome the fact that the report cites hunger and poverty as contributory factors to terrorism and that the fight against terrorism has often eroded the very values that could actually defeat it. The rest, however, remains unsaid."
"There is not a single word on ongoing military and colonial occupations and the way in which they result in violence against innocent people."
"Can there be any doubt that Israel’s pursuit of both the fence and the settlements mortgages any lasting solution for peace and human rights in the region, or that the result of the notion of pre-emptive war is, tragically, there for all to see in Iraq?"
"This is why I shall be abstaining tomorrow, despite the fact that this report raises a number of important points."
"We have a duty to do more and do better."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Coveney for his extremely comprehensive and well written report."
"I particularly liked the fact that he not only clearly identified human rights abuses, he also identified and praised efforts to end such abuses where these efforts are being made."
"I trust this report will receive widespread and deserved approval."
"Will we give an equally positive response to the people who, through courage or desperation, flee these human rights abuses and arrive legally or illegally at our borders?"
"I hope so."
"I say to the Council that, unfortunately, the EU countries’ response to victims is often to close the door."
"There is the case of two Ukrainian doctors who risked their lives to expose local Ukrainian businesses that market organ tissue from 20-week-old babies, purchased, birthed and kept alive during the painful harvesting process."
"After attempts on their lives, the doctors escaped to Ireland last September."
"They are still in a holding centre with no assurance of being granted asylum and facing the possibility of deportation and death."
"I will not support proposed amendments that would change this constructive report by introducing yet another human rights abuse – abortion – into the already abusive situation of war."
"One abuse cannot justify another."
"A woman who has been abused by a rapist needs help and protection, not more death and destruction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as citizens of the new Member States we are fortunate enough to be able to say that we are no longer directly affected by the problem of human rights, which is a major issue and the subject of our debate today."
"Human rights are no longer being violated in our countries in the way they were for 50 years, firstly during German occupation and then under a Communist regime."
"Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that human rights are still continually and grossly violated all over the world, and this is something of which we should be thoroughly ashamed."
"The motives behind these violations are quite basic, yet they are intolerable and there should be no place for them in the world today."
"One of these motives is religion, with Catholics being persecuted in a great many countries."
"In modern-day China, for example, Catholics are deprived of any rights, and the same is true in a great many other countries."
"The burning of churches and related events in Indonesia must surely still be fresh in your minds."
"Another motive is nationality."
"I find it astonishing that a country like China can persecute people it calls its own citizens, especially given that these people are not in fact Chinese citizens."
"The people of Tibet are actually entitled to a country of their own."
"I find it equally astonishing that the world can stand by and watch, and that there have even been calls to lift the embargo against China."
"This embargo has no real effect, of course, but it testifies to our moral beliefs, and we should act in accordance with such beliefs in this instance."
"As far as Chechnya is concerned, I find it incomprehensible that Russia can now be considered a political partner like any other, when this is a country that not only murdered a moderate Chechen politician, but also acted in a barbaric manner by refusing to give up his body, and said that he had been buried in an unmarked grave because he deserved nothing better."
"Similar instances of countries acting like outlaws by persecuting their own citizens can be seen in Cuba and Belarus."
"This was also what happened in Darfur, and yet the world does virtually nothing in response to events of this kind, although I am of course aware that these issues have been discussed in this House."
"Persecution of this kind is equivalent to hunting Pygmies with the sole aim of treating them like common game, and it is an extremely serious problem."
"In colonial times, countries took responsibility, to a greater or lesser degree, for ensuring that order prevailed in their colonies."
"Today, however, we are frequently confronted with what amounts to conspiracies between entrepreneurs."
"The latter corrupt local rulers in order to exploit the former colonies in a way that surpasses even the exploitation they suffered in colonial times."
"These entrepreneurs are not subject to any kind of checks by their home countries."
"In fact the opposite is true, as they have the backing of these countries."
"In view of this, I would ask for an investigation to be opened into the following case, which has been covered by the press."
"A case has been filed with the Paris Military Court regarding the complicity of French soldiers in the genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda in 1994."
"Institutions such as the European Parliament have a duty to act as guardians of fundamental human rights, and to monitor the world’s largest countries in order to ensure that they are not collaborating in these gross violations of human rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, human rights are a live issue in Europe, not only in Africa, Asia and Latin America."
"This is a point we must stress in connection with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, because human rights are being violated in countries that border the EU."
"These violations are not going on in remote and exotic places."
"They are going on next door to us, in the very same Europe we live in."
"A second key issue is the fight against terrorism, as the latter is the greatest real threat facing the international community."
"What is needed is solidarity between EU Member States, yet this is currently lacking, for example with regard to the ‘black list’ of terrorist organisations."
"This is one instance where there is a real need for the united Europe to speak with one voice, instead of the large Member States of the old EU looking out for their own interests."
"In my opinion, the report should have highlighted the fact that religious minorities, and especially Christians, are being persecuted in certain African and Asian countries."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking our colleague, Mr Coveney, for all his hard work on our Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004."
"A remarkable part of this report is dedicated to the countries in Eastern Europe that might in the future become members of the EU family, namely Ukraine, Moldova and even Belarus."
"I wish to stress some points which are of great importance for improving human rights in that region."
"As part of the European Parliament’s delegation, I had an opportunity to observe parliamentary elections in Moldova."
"Although the election results have been recognised by the international community, it is clear that the elections did not meet certain obligations with respect to a fully competitive electoral process, especially in relation to fair access to the media and impartial coverage of the campaign."
"In addition, arrests of opposition MPs and other actions against peaceful demonstrations constitute clear violations of fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression, association and assembly."
"Even a meeting of international observers with the President of the country and ‘number one’ on one political party’s electoral list was used for his party’s campaign."
"Another important point is to call on Ukraine and Moldova to crack down on smuggling to, from and through Transnistria and to develop effective anti-corruption programmes for the customs, border guard and tax services, as well as the police."
"On the election day, we observers from this House were not allowed to enter Transnistria, but it was clear that people in Moldova and Transnistria in particular had to face all the negative implications of that situation."
"Last, but not least, we should again remind Russia to withdraw its so-called peacekeepers and ammunition from Moldova and specifically from Transnistria, as without this precondition our recommendations to fight corruption, organised crime and the illegal export of weapons will remain gestures of our goodwill but will not become a reality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing a new wave of democracy in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Africa."
"The elections in Ukraine demonstrated the huge potential of civil society in the countries bordering the EU and in those in which the European Union serves as a basic point of reference in political, economic and cultural matters."
"Evidence of this democratisation can be seen, , in the adoption of a constitution and the holding of elections in Afghanistan, in the free elections in Palestine and Iraq and in the major public demonstrations in Lebanon, as well as in the steps that have been taken towards liberalisation in other countries."
"In Belarus, which is one of the EU’s neighbours, the public is rebelling against authoritarian forms of governance, and a democratic breakthrough can be expected in this country too in the near future."
"One of the European Union’s current priorities should be to help civil society in Belarus in its struggle for fundamental human rights and democracy."
"We are seeing improvements in the human rights situations in a number of countries."
"In December 2004, Uzbekistan issued a decree granting an amnesty to 5 400 prisoners."
"In August 2003, Uzbekistan’s Parliament, the Oliy Majlis, adopted amendments to the penal code which mean that torture and other forms of inhuman treatment are now deemed to be crimes for which individuals may be prosecuted, at whatever stage of the criminal process they are committed."
"At the same time as demanding the release of all remaining political prisoners, the European Parliament should call for the independent judiciary to be strengthened and for further reforms to be carried out in the field of human rights, whilst acknowledging the efforts Uzbekistan has made in terms of measures to prevent torture and to improve the situation of detainees."
"We should also welcome the fact that steps have been taken to end press censorship in the country."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my respect to the rapporteur for the report that has given a detailed account of the human rights situation in the world in 2004, and the position of the European Union on the issue."
"Today, many people turn with confidence to such important global institutions as the EU or the UN when they feel to be victim of or witness to abuses."
"Let me, however, stress that in those situations where people’s rights are the most flagrantly violated, the victims often lack the strength or the resources to be able and know how to defend themselves or point attention to them."
"This is why it is so important for the European Parliament to follow, in cooperation of its various committees, not only the drafting of the conventions and their ratification status, but also their implementation."
"The Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed and ratified by almost all the countries of the world. I am, however, convinced that there are a number of European countries where the rights of children do not receive adequate attention."
"Yesterday, at the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I made an attempt to insert a reference to Article 32 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to Mr Bowis’s report on patient mobility, but my suggestion was not supported by my distinguished colleagues."
"Can someone tell me how the situation really is with the implementation of important documents?"
"Mr Coveney’s report exudes strength, is balanced, and, if Europe wants to prove its reputation in the world as an exporter of human rights, it will do well to adopt this report in its entirety as its key asset in foreign policy and also for the coming conference in Geneva."
"I should like to mention three points from it: first of all in my capacity of Vice-Chairman for the delegation in Central Asia."
"The report is right to put its finger on the sore spot in a number of countries, Uzbekistan, in particular."
"I know that the Uzbekistani Government claims there are no political prisoners, but you can also get politicians behind bars on a different charge, which has happened, and has not been resolved as yet."
"This is, in fact, also evident from the Council of Europe’s report further to the most recent parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan."
"The second point which illustrates that international pressure can be effective, is the situation in Kyrgyzstan."
"What matters now is for that region to be taken seriously and monitoring to be continued."
"The third point concerns the freedom of the press in Kazakhstan."
"Only recently, Irina Petrushova was locked up on account of possible offences completely unrelated to her work, except that she happens to be the most prominent journalist for the opposition newspaper in Kazakhstan."
"We in this House must continue to put countries like those under pressure, because we have a great deal in common with them; they can take a step forward and we can help them achieve this."
"My final point concerns the situation in Iran and that country’s way of dealing with people who do not adhere to the main religion, in this case Islam."
"It was found once again recently that Hamid Pourmand, a former army colonel, had been sentenced to death, his only offence being that he is a Christian."
"For that reason, he should not have served in the army, although his religious conviction was known."
"An appeal from this House, in this specific case where a death sentence is pending, is of the utmost importance."
"I should once again like to congratulate Mr Coveney, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will take this report very seriously as an asset in our foreign policy in the field of human rights."
"Mr President, as the European Parliament is the chief guardian of human rights, it is necessary to examine what issues the report deemed important and worthy of consideration."
"I welcome the approval of the amendment which ensured that human rights issues in the Western Balkans were dealt with under a separate heading."
"As the leader of the Hungarian Socialist delegation and as the president of the Intergroup for historical national minorities, constitutional regions and regional languages, I find a major shortcoming in the report’s treatment of national minority rights abuses which are not given due emphasis despite their importance."
"Although national minority rights abuses are observed in a few instances, in the case of the Western Balkans, they are not even mentioned."
"It is absurd to think that problems in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia can be settled without assuring national minority rights."
"I see two fundamental problems: one of perception and approach, which simplifies national minority rights to human rights."
"Although we cannot speak of minority rights without human rights, the assurance of human rights in itself does not guarantee national minority rights, which require additional rights as well as special modes of practice and preferential treatment."
"Another predicament is that the EU lacks minority protection standards and an adequate monitoring system, as these are not part of the ."
"The position is paradoxical, since, in the case of the new Member States, the situation of national minorities was part of the 1994 Copenhagen political criteria for joining."
"Continuous monitoring of the national minority situation by the Union had a very positive effect on national minority issues in the new central European Member States."
"Why do not we do the same with regard to this report?"
"Why is not there a separate section for national minorities among the thematic issues?"
"I therefore suggest that a whole chapter is dedicated to national minorities in next year’s annual report."
"Mr President, the European Union can be proud of the fact that it places such a high premium on defending human rights throughout the world, and in fact this is one of its main calling cards."
"In days gone by, while we were still behind the Iron Curtain, we would listen eagerly to the voice of the free world."
"This voice reached us over the airwaves thanks to radio stations such as Radio Free Europe, the BBC, France International and the Voice of America, and it gave us hope that one day we would witness the dawning of freedom and civil liberties."
"In the same way, our wish now is for all those suffering persecution for their views or their religious beliefs, and all those held in bleak prisons by dictators under various pretexts, to hear that they have not been forgotten by this House, which lies at the very heart of Europe, and that we are demanding their release and an end to persecution."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"At the same time, however, there are a few comments I should like to make on the report."
"Paragraph 12 calls on Moldova and Ukraine to resolve the Transnistria issue, yet it is obvious that no final and complete solution will be found to the problems surrounding this self-proclaimed republic unless Russia is involved, as the latter is backing Transnistria."
"A number of Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor have been in jail in Libya for five years following absurd accusations that they knowingly and intentionally infected 450 children in a Benghazi hospital with HIV."
"The Commission should demand the release of these prisoners, who have been sentenced to death and whose appeal is due to be heard in a month’s time."
"I should also like to call on the Commission to pay particular attention to the discrimination suffered by Christians and Christian churches in Muslim countries."
"Eritrea is the only country mentioned in the report as a place where Christians are persecuted, and no reference at all is made to their fate in Sudan."
"I propose that the Commission should prepare a detailed report on the situation of Christian churches in the Middle East, Africa, China and Turkey."
"Mr President, I agree with the view that this is the arduous story of an impossible report, which relates to an issue of increasing interest, both to the citizens and to the international bodies, and I would like to refer expressly to the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in his report ‘In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all’."
"This is the story of an impossible report, and we must express our gratitude to Mr Coveney, of course. It is impossible because it will always be unbalanced — it deals with the entire world — inconsistent — we only have to look at the paragraph on Venezuela for example — and furthermore, every year it is original — because we are not consolidating any of the positions this Parliament has adopted in previous reports."
"Its usefulness is very relative, Mr President, but nevertheless, this report says some very important things."
"I believe we must redefine the European Parliament’s position on this report: many of the positions adopted by Parliament in other reports and resolutions have no connection whatsoever to our annual report on human rights."
"Our parliamentary work must focus mainly on making contributions to the report already produced by the Council and in that way it would be possible for us to influence the human rights situation in the world effectively."
"Finally, and despite the fact that we have been through a very long and very complicated process of achieving a consensus amongst the political groups, I would like to address the Members on the right of this House to ask them to show consistency or responsibility, or if they like, simply compassion, and to support our position on women and girls who are raped, victims of abuse during situations of war or conflict, who need protection before and after they are attacked, and many of whom are made pregnant by their attackers and who must have access to voluntary termination of the pregnancy."
"Do you not think so, ladies and gentlemen?"
"Mr President, I would like to make a few remarks on dual standards and practices in the European Union institutions."
"EU standards mean the erosion of standards as principles."
"In many important cases it is difficult to conclude what has higher priority in our spectrum of common values: real respect for human rights or cheaper gas, gas that is likely to erode our principles and, in the end, Europe."
"To the repeated remarks of my colleagues that Russia is very important, my response is: yes, but the truth is more important."
"I am not going to criticise the great work done by Mr Coveney."
"I congratulate him."
"I am only concerned that the common mood of erosion has given rise to gaps or appeasing manoeuvres in so many of our documents."
"There is often a conscious or subconscious concern not to be too explicit, not to be too hard, not to irritate people even if they are wrong."
"Is anybody here concerned about the 40 000 Chechen children killed during the Russian military operation?"
"Do colleagues appreciate the barbaric humiliation inflicted on the body of the assassinated legitimate president?"
"We do not dare to state simple facts: that Russia is not yet a country of shared values, that it is a country whose government allows unfair business practices in its desire to join the WTO."
"For many of us, the priority of peace in the Caucasus became a principle indirectly promoted by Russian diplomacy: the integrity of the cemetery."
"We are in favour of it not giving any chance for the candidates for the cemetery to avoid such an enforced happy end."
"Mr President, nearly everyone has offered their congratulations to the author of this report and I can only add my own."
"In reality, it is logical that within such an extensive report, which addresses issues in 70 countries, there may be ideas about which people will not be in complete agreement."
"In contrast to what has been said by a succession of Members from the European left, however, I should like to point out a few brave positions adopted by the rapporteur with regard to major economic and political powers, towards which this Parliament all too often adopts an ambiguous and diplomatic stance, in a cynical attitude of , it could be said, to protect foreign trade."
"I am referring to China: the Commission and the Council have announced their willingness, if not actually their intention, to abolish the arms embargo."
"It is true that some progress has been made with regard to human rights, and it is true that China remains a prominent figure in the fight against terrorism, and that it is exerting useful pressure on North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons."
"That is not enough, however, and the report recognises it."
"Above all, I should like to add that there is no need to allow China to exploit existing disagreements between the European Union and the United States on that issue."
"I am also referring to Russia, which, in the tragic Chechen crisis and in its running of the country in general, cannot resist adopting measures that have little in common with our own vision of democracy."
"The report also adopts a clear and precise position on this issue."
"I will conclude by wholeheartedly endorsing the idea that, in my view, lies at the heart of this excellent report: no economic or commercial consideration should ever lead the European Union to deny or downplay the existence of human rights violations."
"Thank you, Mr President. The reason why this House’s reports on human rights are important political statements is not that they are binding in law, but that they make a political impact and that conclusions can be drawn from them."
"Much of what is in this report – and this is what is weak about it – cannot absolutely be described as having to do with human rights issues."
"Let me give a number of examples."
"We all regard Kyoto as an important issue, but it does not exactly have much to do with human rights."
"Social rights are important, but they belong in another category. They are not human rights in the traditional sense of the word."
"The right to an abortion is not a human right; it is a violation of a human right."
"More to the point, it is not for the EU to tell any country what to do about it; the rule of subsidiarity applies."
"Let me take this further by quoting Brecht."
"In his ‘The resistible rise of Arturo Ui’, he wrote: ‘The womb he crawled from is still going strong’."
"By that he meant the anti-Semitism and racial hatred preached by Hitler and the Third Reich."
"We cannot be indifferent to anti-Semitism in Russia, particularly when it is propagated by the political class."
"When 20 members of the State Duma call for Jewish organisations to be banned from Russia, we have to respond, and, likewise, we have to understand that Russia has also been behind the terrible fighting and violations of human rights in Chechnya, and that politics underlies much of what appals us in Beslan and elsewhere."
"While suicide bombings are indeed murder, they are also carried out in response to political circumstances and causes."
"We must not expect too much of reports on human rights, even of those originating from this House."
"It is an unfortunate fact that human rights alone will not bring about the political solutions that are needed."
"Not only that, but nor must we apply double standards."
"It is not acceptable that we should refuse to allow a country like Croatia to enter negotiations with the EU because of its lamentable failure to arrest a general who is suspected of human rights violations, while at the same time opening negotiations with Turkey, which – as we can read in press reports – is continuing to be extremely dilatory about implementing the Copenhagen political criteria."
"I do not want to hold the Turkish Government responsible for the country’s most popular reading matter turning out to be Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’ – of all things – but you do have to wonder what is going on."
"Mr President, this is a remarkable report: broad in its sweep and penetrating and positive in so many of its observations."
"The tragedy is that its very breadth confirms how widespread human rights problems still are throughout the world and how vital it is that those of us who care about such issues must make sure our voices are heard and that they prevail."
"I wish to highlight just one issue as raised in paragraph 49, on human rights issues in Kashmir."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has worked with all political groups on this sensitive subject."
"I am happy to accept his compromise wording but I would still like to have seen references not just to the region of Kashmir but also to the sufferings of the people of Kashmir."
"This is after all a people issue."
"The previous paragraph, number 48, makes clear that the largest functioning democracy in the world is India, a country that I much admire."
"In my judgement, this should inspire India to assume greater moral leadership in the subcontinent and this means working not just with Pakistan, but with all stakeholders to ensure that human rights abuses are resolved with urgency."
"Yesterday the President of Azad Kashmir came to the Parliament to open an exhibition at the start of EU-Kashmir week, the first time there has been such an occasion."
"As a Vice-President of the all-party group on Kashmir in the European Parliament, I said then and repeat now that the people of Jammu and Kashmir should take great heart from the fact that this group is genuinely all-party and genuinely represents all nationalities, and that this Parliament remains committed to ensuring that their voices can be heard loud and clear here in this Parliament."
"We must all look forward to the day when, with our support, the voices of the people can be heard equally loudly and equally clearly in the land of their fathers."
"Mr President, I should like to focus on the paragraph in the report that relates to Belarus, a country which, according to the report, increasingly resembles an island in the midst of Europe."
"Members of the opposition have been kidnapped and murdered, elections rigged, demonstrators imprisoned and the press gagged."
"On top of all of this, the authorities have recently banned citizens from studying abroad without their consent, and imposed restrictions on trips to work legally in other countries."
"Polish citizens are also being given the opportunity to experience the ‘blessings’ of this kolkhoz-style Communism at first hand, as several of them have had their lorries and cars confiscated for transporting three cartons of cigarettes."
"I find it quite astonishing that we can stand idly by, and even draft European principles of cross-border cooperation, when not a day passes without us hearing of fresh violations of human rights in a country that is a direct neighbour of the EU. Only yesterday, more than 40 demonstrators were arrested for attempting to commemorate the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster."
"The efforts of the Commission and the Council have merely served to hold back the process of transformation in Belarus, as nearly six months have passed since Parliament’s resolution on the matter, and precisely nothing has happened."
"Projects intended to promote civil society have got stuck at the stage of analysis, discussion and ordered debates at countless seminars and summit meetings."
"The Commission does not believe that funding radio stations to broadcast from neighbouring countries would provide added value."
"In other words, it does not perceive any benefit in values such as freedom of the media, or in providing a source of information other than the Belarussian propaganda."
"There is now talk of pursuing a common policy on Belarus with Russia."
"In this connection, I would ask what kind of human rights we would be able to protect in Belarus by cooperating with Russia, and how we would be able to protect them."
"Would this entail waiting until the hysterical dictator has wronged even more of his fellow citizens?"
"Alternatively, should we leave it to the Americans to come up with a solution to problems in a country bordering the EU, merely because we are more interested in what is going on in Madagascar?"
"Mr President, like the report, your debate confirms and illustrates how very sensitive your Parliament is to the problem of human rights."
"It in fact reflects the great sensitivity of the vast majority of Europeans to this problem."
"Many Europeans are actively involved in promoting human rights, in fighting to defend them wherever in the world they are violated."
"Young people especially are particularly interested in promoting human rights."
"I therefore think that the message you are sending with this report, and also with this debate, must first of all be a message to young people to show them that the Europe that is being built is a Europe that conveys its human rights values to the world."
"I believe Europe’s image in the world is closely associated with this human rights message."
"I also agree with those who have said that in themselves human rights alone cannot be the answer to every political problem."
"A human rights policy cannot replace a foreign policy."
"Any foreign policy worthy of the name, however, one that is based on values, must give an important place to the defence of human rights."
"As President-in-Office, that is the message I take from your Parliament, from your report, and I think all the Member States, like the Council, will be attentive to what you have to say."
"It is true that there is no single solution and there is no easy solution."
"We cannot treat different situations in the same way, but the basic message remains the same everywhere and the Council must also make that message, which your Parliament has expressed, its own in the policies it puts into effect."
". Mr President, I too would like, on behalf of the Commission – as Mr Schmit has just done on behalf of the Council — to congratulate the rapporteur and the European Parliament once again on this debate, which has demonstrated to those of us who have attended and participated in it the immensity of the challenges facing us today in terms of defending and protecting human rights in the world."
"The issues we have dealt with have ranged from the fight against terrorism to the violation of the rights of minorities, and they include a whole series of violations of human rights at many levels."
"You have mentioned many countries and many regions of the world, from practically every continent, and we all agree that we have a great responsibility as representatives of the European institutions and of the will of Europe’s citizens to do our duty and to realise our desire to protect human rights and incorporate their defence into all of our policies, and, in particular, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, into our foreign policy."
"I would therefore like to confirm the Commission’s commitment, and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner’s commitment in particular, to intensifying the dialogue with Parliament and with the Council, with a view to consolidating the approaches set by European policy in this field and by the suggestions and recommendations expressed by Parliament in its report, and would repeat that, in relation to each and every issue that requires a response, the Commission will do so in writing and its response will be available to you as soon as possible."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
". – This report contains a great deal of hypocrisy and a number of untruths."
"There is no shortage of examples, such as the way in which the report omits the persecution suffered by the Kurds and the Turks and the breaches of the fundamental rights of the people of Western Sahara, and the way in which it refers to Venezuela and Cuba."
"I should particularly like to highlight Venezuela and Cuba, in light of my recent experience in these countries."
"I went to Venezuela on two occasions last year, and was there at the time of the recall referendum, won by a landslide by President Chávez. It was clear to me that the Venezuelan Government had had difficulty in gaining access to the media, in particular to the various private, opposition-controlled television stations; indeed, the European Parliament delegation was a victim of this."
"Point 84 of this report is unacceptable, given that it is, in fact, the Venezuelan Government that is seeking cooperation with its neighbouring states."
"I also visited Cuba recently, along with a delegation of Members of three different political groups in Parliament. It is appalling that point 78 of this report does not contain one word about the US blockade of Cuba and that it singles out this country for special treatment and overlooks all of the consequences of the permanent US blockade."
"– The next item is the Commission statement on Roma in the European Union."
"Honourable Members, the Commission wishes to thank the European Parliament for having included this item on its agenda, and to acknowledge the key role Parliament plays in protecting the rights of minorities, including the Roma."
"The presence here today of MEPs that belong to the Roma community serves to highlight the importance of this role."
"The fundamental rights upon which the European Union is founded include the principle of non-discrimination."
"The Roma must be given the chance to participate fully in economic, social and political life, and so we must work together to overcome the centuries of prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion they have suffered."
"This is an immense task, and it will require us to take coordinated action in a number of fields, in particular those of education, employment, housing and social services."
"The responsibility for finding a solution to these issues will mainly lie with national bodies and with regional and local authorities, as the latter are where the Roma are most likely to be represented."
"Although both civil society and the Roma themselves have an important part to play, the situation of the Roma is a European issue that calls for an EU solution."
"This solution may take various forms."
"The Commission is actively monitoring the situation of the Roma in both the European Union and the candidate countries."
"As part of the preparations for accession, the situation of the Roma and of other minorities is assessed in relation to the political criteria."
"The Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre pays particular attention to this issue when carrying out research into manifestations of racism and xenophobia in the European Union."
"A binding legal framework has been established by the EU with the aim of combating discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin, and Community regulations currently in force prohibit direct or indirect discrimination in employment, education, social protection, property matters and services."
"The Commission is working to ensure that these regulations are transposed into national law, and it also backs cultural and educational measures, including special measures for organisations working with the Roma."
"The European Union provides substantial funding for measures promoting inclusion of the Roma community."
"During preparations for accession, over EUR 100 million was allocated under the PHARE programme to projects targeted at the Roma, and the Commission actively helps national bodies to utilise structural funds to promote inclusion of the Roma and other disadvantaged groups."
"Several other Community programmes encourage exchanges of experience and support specific projects in the fields of employment, education, vocational training and research within the EU and in a number of third countries."
"The Commission is keen to ensure that the situation of the Roma is taken into account in all EU programmes and policies that could be significant in this context."
"To this end, a group has been set up comprising representatives of all the relevant Directorates-General, with the aim of exchanging best practices, coordinating policies and engaging in dialogue with participants from outside the institutions."
"At the group’s latest meeting, an exchange of information took place with an MEP from the Roma community."
"The Commission also cooperates with other international organisations working to promote inclusion of the Roma, and is in regular contact with the Council of Europe, the OECD, the World Bank and other major players."
"The European Union set itself ambitious goals in the Lisbon Strategy relating to the creation of more jobs, social cohesion and sustainable development."
"The fact that a large number of our fellow citizens are socially excluded because they belong to the Roma community threatens our ability to achieve these goals."
"Combating the social exclusion of the Roma in the name of fundamental rights, social cohesion and the social and economic development of the EU is a task for all of us."
"The Commission wishes to thank Parliament for its support and efforts in this connection."
". Mr President, Roma people living inside and outside the boundaries of the EU have been exposed to daily discrimination for centuries."
"Pervasive anti-Roma sentiment in Europe and daily discrimination thwart our full and equal participation in the social and economic life of Europe, and of the countries we deem our homeland."
"Several international organisations have launched programmes within the last few years with the aim to reduce anti-Roma discrimination and to help the Romas’ full social integration."
"However, there has not been a standard European guideline or answer to these pressing issues."
"The European Parliament’s five-party motion for a resolution and Commissioner Vladimir Spidla’s current standpoint on the subject establish milestones in this regard."
"This resolution witnesses various political forces united in mutual commitment to jointly combat the prevailing anti-Roma sentiment and structured discrimination, it urges equal opportunities in the fields of work, education, housing, healthcare and participation in political life."
"Following EU accession, social discrimination against the Roma continues in the new Member States, even as it does in the existing ones."
"This alone confirms that the EU institutions need to continue their roles of constant monitoring and examination of human rights."
"The forceful manifestation of Roma rights in Europe must mean that the Copenhagen political criteria are uniformly implemented in the existing and the new Member States and also in the Candidate Countries."
"One of the most pressing issues facing the disadvantaged Roma minority is finding employment."
"Reintegration of the Roma workforce is of great importance, and short-term, introductory measures must be taken in order to expedite Roma employment."
"Fifteen percent of the recently increased EU population is affected by poverty, and 9% live in long-term and extreme privation."
"These indicators reveal a much worse situation in the case of the new Member States."
"It is also apparent that there is a significant number of Romas among people living in long-term extreme poverty and the rate of unemployment in the Roma population often hits or even exceeds 80%."
"Achieving the strategic goals of Lisbon would undoubtedly have a positive influence on the life of Romas and conscious, determined political integration would definitely promote the success of the Lisbon strategy as well."
"The Lisbon strategy will not attain its goals unless definite steps are taken and real effort is made to advance Roma integration into mainstream society."
"The European Commission’s stronger and stronger political commitment must manifest itself in real action guided by professionalism, and also in the establishment of a coherent minority protection system, which promotes, in every aspect, the integration of the European Roma population."
"The European Parliament must act as a minority-oriented institution, and along with civil organisations and the governing bodies of the Member States, it must work conjointly with the Commission as its primary ally."
"We hope that the EP resolution on the situation of the Roma people in Europe will serve as a professional basis for the European Commission and also for national governments taking measures in this regard."
"Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues from all five parties and our advisers and civil organisations for taking an active part in drafting this resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Roma have been present on European soil for many centuries, since they arrived in Greece in the fourth century."
"Although no census of this population has been made, their number is estimated at around eight million scattered throughout Europe."
"The Roma are victims of discrimination, marginalisation and segregation in all fields of public and private life, including access to the civil service, education, employment, health services and housing, not to mention when crossing borders and in access to asylum procedures."
"That discrimination is no longer a problem for the Roma alone, but is of concern to all Europeans, and we must show solidarity to improve their living conditions."
"We must of course strongly condemn all discrimination to which the Roma are subject, but we must also allow them access to decent housing, education, medical services and social protection."
"We really must do everything possible to see that they are not forced to leave their countries because of the deplorable living conditions they have to endure there, which may go as far as persecution."
"Europe must recognise the Roma minority as such so that it can give them the means to fight against all forms of discrimination."
"That is why we are asking the Commission for an action plan that will make clear recommendations to the Member States and the candidate countries for a better economic integration, yes, but also social and political integration of all the Roma in Europe."
"We have been talking about it for a long time and it is high time for action."
"The situation has gone on for long enough."
"The rights of the Roma must go beyond access to decent living conditions."
"Europe is the cradle of multiculturalism."
"The promotion of Roma culture will play an important part in the fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia."
"They must be able to remain at home if they want to, they must not be chased along the roads; that is important, it is essential for all of us."
"It is our duty to act and to act quickly."
"."
"Mr President, we are about to witness a historic moment: for the first time in Europe, the European Parliament is in a position to pass such a resolution, and we shall cast our votes tomorrow."
"The European Union, the European Parliament and every other body that controls, passes and amends regulations often criticises human rights outside the EU’s borders."
"On the other hand, it is a historic moment, because this is the first document that criticises human rights within the EU, with regard to Romas."
"This type of political mood, developing in Parliament for the first time in its history, is significant because discrimination against the Roma within the EU no longer needs to be a taboo subject."
"Today, the disability index is 60% on average in the twenty-five Member States."
"This means that on average, 60% of children who are declared mentally disabled are Roma."
"We have not only forfeited the child’s chance of further education, but also put him or her in a situation that he or she will never be able to get out of, and thus we practically seal the child’s fate at age seven."
"Housing problems, dislodgement, compulsory sterilisation, segregated labour rooms, and numerous other means of discriminatory cases that even the resolution lists in various paragraphs, are not at all surprising within the EU and I deliberately do not mention specific countries here."
"Promoting political participation is another important role of the Union, the deficiency of which is dealt with significantly in some paragraphs."
"Today, Roma population in the EU is approximately 7-8 million with only two representatives here in Parliament based on our ethnic origin."
"I am very proud of my country, as both of us come from Hungary."
"However, there are no other Roma political representatives from any other country in the Commission, or in any other EU institution."
"This participation gap must be closed, not only in the EU, which is mainly our task, but also on the level of national governments, so that in addition to EU directives and guidelines that define the strategic policies of individual countries in this matter, the national governments should also feel that this responsibility is shared by every part of society in all of Europe."
"It is not up to the Roma to solve this issue, since it is not they who consider that their children are disabled; it is not Roma women who want to have their ovaries cut out."
"According to public opinion polls, it is in Europe where Romas feel most European."
"This statement is not at all surprising, as Roma people are no longer able to believe their own government in any country, especially in Central Eastern Europe."
"Term after term, different political parties keep replacing each other, but none of the governing political parties have been able to provide a solution to this problem and eliminate discrimination, for instance."
"The only hope of the Romas lies in the European Union and European Parliament, where we all sit, trying to pass a resolution with tomorrow’s vote."
"I trust that our decision regarding the situation of the Roma will set a real standard for human rights."
". Mr President, with the enlargement of the European Union, the number of Roma citizens has increased from 7 million to 9 million."
"Since enlargement is an ongoing process, in future the EU will host up to 12 or 15 million Roma."
"For thousands of years the Roma have been living in diaspora, but being united in the EU they become our fellow citizens."
"The European Union means an end to years of war and the beginning of cooperation."
"But how can we cooperate when people are excluded?"
"Mostly, the Roma issue is connected with unemployment and a lack of education, healthcare and housing."
"However, the core issue is racism against Roma, more specifically anti-Gypsyism or Roma-phobia."
"Can we accept a situation where millions of our fellow citizens lack basic human rights and suffer from police harassment, where thousands of school children remain illiterate and the unemployment rate exceeds 70%, where attempts are made at ethnic cleansing by poisoning people and trafficking in women and children, including in western EU countries, which, contrary to the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees, also expel Roma refugees?"
"The Roma also face a lack of political participation, as a result of which there are not enough Roma representatives to draw attention to their issues."
"Today’s practice is not only a human tragedy: the Roma have been turned into a political tool."
"What happened to the millions of dollars and euros donated by the US and the EU to Eastern European countries for Roma projects?"
"Structures set up for the purpose of helping the cause of the Roma often use this cause as a pretext."
"In reality most of the money is spent on salaries, trips and on buying citizens, administrators and politicians."
"This process is defined as corruption, but actually it is manipulation."
"There are people in this world who do not want a dynamic Europe; they practice a policy of divide and rule by maintaining poverty and establishing control over Eastern European countries."
"The Roma, Europe’s largest and most vulnerable minority, are, against their will, victims and participants in this global game."
"It is therefore also necessary from a purely political point of view to reinforce the Roma population."
"Their political participation in elections is important."
"We have to target Roma as voters and as candidates at all political levels."
"The Roma-to-Roma approach, as developed by the OSCE, is another effective way of consolidating the Roma’s position."
"All European organisations should start hiring Roma for Roma and non-Roma related jobs – I have a Roma assistant."
"Anti-Gypsyism is a shame and a threat to the EU."
"Mr President, whilst we are discussing an extremely important resolution, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, news arrived a few hours ago that, yesterday, in the province of Naples, a cabin in a Roma camp caught fire, resulting in the death of a young boy and the discovery of his father and another young boy in a serious condition."
"A delegation of Roma from several Italian cities – who have been here for two days to meet Members and increase awareness among them – told me the news as soon as they heard it: they were saddened but stated that, unfortunately, such events continue to occur."
"Where do they occur?"
"In Italy, in the heart of Old Europe, where these people – the majority of whom have not been Travellers for some time – are concentrated in camps without water, electricity or services."
"One of them said today, ‘The first time I ever slept in a container was when I arrived in Italy;"
"I had a house where I came from.’"
"The rights of the European Union end at the edges of the Travellers’ camps, and the Italian Government continues to rid itself – that is the term to use – of the Roma population through collective expulsions."
"In such a situation it is impossible to educate the children and to make them attend school."
"There are young people 20 years old who were born in Italy and who do not have an Italian identity card."
"Recently, other children born in Italy have been considered to have a Yugoslav nationality, without knowing which one, as it no longer even exists."
"Many Roma citizens residing in my country have an identity card – when they do have one – that bears the address of the Travellers’ camp and, in parentheses, ‘Roma Camp’."
"It is obvious that they will not succeed in finding work and that they will be increasingly discriminated against, when they are in that situation."
"I will conclude by saying that tomorrow’s vote is extremely important, but that it will be all the more so if it is put into practice, particularly by the European Commission."
"Let us not forget that the commissioner who should be attending to this issue is an Italian, Mr Frattini, although in my view he is very much like the monkey that used to say ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.’"
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party(PSI) in support of the legitimate demands of so many Roma whom I have had the good fortune to meet in my years of social and political engagement."
"The hope of the socialist members of the new PSI is that 8 April, the date scheduled as International Roma Day, will be not only a time of celebration, but above all an opportunity to increase public awareness of the problems currently faced by the largest ethnic minority in Europe."
"I should like to point out just one aspect that, in our opinion, is particularly important: in spite of the commitments undertaken by the Commission, including those of recent times, we must nevertheless note that in some Member States and candidate countries young Roma are often segregated in schools for the mentally disabled or sent to classes for children with learning difficulties."
"This obviously increases their sense of unease and social marginalisation."
"On the contrary, provision must be made for full access to the ordinary education system, since schools are a prime means of promoting full social integration."
"The current situation is an unjustified hiatus totally at odds with those principles of equality, tolerance and respect that lie at the heart of the fellow feeling fostered by the EU."
"Everyone, within their own area of expertise, must endeavour to turn words into deeds."
"The Roma issue belongs among the most complicated social and political issues within the space of the European Union."
"The implementation of various concepts has failed to bring a successful solution to the so-called Roma problem."
"All the attempts to address it as a social problem ran aground due to cultural differences."
"The efforts to integrate the Roma community often ended up in the attempts at its assimilation, which also failed."
"Because of its complexity, the Roma issue is clearly at the intersection of social, ethnic and/or minority problems."
"No doubt, the problem is not equally severe in all the countries."
"Thus, there are no Roma in the Baltic countries, but in the southern part of the European Union and in the new Member States, the problem quite often exceeds the capacity of a single country to tackle it."
"It is apparent that in many countries the transformation to market economy has not created a win-win situation for the Roma."
"A substantial proportion of this minority have joined the ranks of those who did not manage and found it impossible to adjust to the new circumstances."
"Their unfavourable situation, extreme poverty and high unemployment cannot be accounted for by racial discrimination alone."
"The problem is very often much broader."
"It begins with the lack of education."
"Clearly the worst is the situation of those who live in remote localities, segregated settlements, often without access to school, electricity or running water, and in the regions with very high unemployment."
"Slovakia was mentioned a few months ago in connection with the Roma – alleged forced sterilisations of Roma women."
"I want to repeat what our Deputy Prime Minister said before the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities – that a thorough police investigation proved that these forced and unlawful acts did not occur."
"At the same time, however, it also revealed that the legislation in this field is outdated and lacks clarity."
"Concluding, I would like to express my support for the resolution since there are a number of myths about the Roma and their situation, and perhaps even more prejudices, but a lack of real understanding."
"I am convinced that the Roma problem transcends the boundaries of individual states and that it must be addressed as a European problem, just as Commissioner Špidla put it."
"It is truly necessary to make use of the best experience of individual countries and to channel structural funds to addressing the problem with the participation of Roma themselves – this is really the key point in this regard."
"I believe that this resolution is an appropriate and necessary step in that direction."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I take great pride in the fact that there are many Members in my group who are very committed to promoting the cause of the Roma and to following the latest developments in this field."
"I am also very glad that we have plenty of like-minded friends in the other groups, which makes it possible for us, tomorrow, to join together in writing a new chapter in the history of their integration."
"What prompted me to press for us to discuss this issue now was a visit I made, as part of a delegation from this House, to Novi Sad, where, in the course of our investigations into the situation of the Hungarian minority, we saw, on the edge of the city, a district that was home to Roma who had been driven out of Kosovo, and where conditions defied description."
"It is an unfortunate fact that, in all our past conflicts, the Roma were often the first victims."
"Even in the absence of such conflicts, though, they are in a far from satisfactory position, and that not just in the new Member States – where they are present in greater numbers – but also in many of the old ones."
"If we want to point the finger at other countries and give them advice on how to treat their minorities, then it is vitally important that we in Europe treat our own minorities accordingly – particularly the Roma, who are the largest of them – by giving them the opportunity to integrate and break the terrible vicious circle that sees many of them less well-educated, sometimes forced into segregated schools, with this lack of education meaning that they have less chance of getting a job and that their earning capacity is reduced."
"In turn, lower incomes mean more health problems, and so the vicious circle goes on."
"Together, we have to break it."
"Some time ago, I proposed the appointment of a Commissioner with specific responsibility for minority issues and for the Roma’s problems in particular."
"Although nothing has been done about this, I am confident that the Roma issue is safe in Commissioner Špidla’s hands."
"I would follow Mrs Roure in asking him to include, in the Commission communication for which we are calling, not only a description of how things are, but also of how they could be, of what improvements might be made even without much in the way of power at European level."
"You very rightly said, Commissioner, that this is a European problem and that we have to find a European answer to it, not only at European level, but also, of course, in the nation states."
"If our cooperation in this House helps us, tomorrow and by way of this resolution, to give some impetus to the process of finding one, we will have taken an important step."
"It is your help, Commissioner, and that of the Commission, that will enable us to achieve a real and perceptible improvement over the next 10 years in the integration of the Roma and Sinti in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, to date, unfortunately, we have paid too little attention to the tragedy of Europe’s Roma, Sinti and other tribes."
"It was at one time possible for people to move freely around Europe, with a lifestyle and culture of their own free choosing."
"The 20th century, alas, was marked by the attempted wholesale extermination of certain peoples."
"During the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia there were two concentration camps for Roma, one at Lety in Southern Bohemia, and the other at Hodonin, near Kunstat in Moravia."
"Considered in terms of human rights, politics, morality and simple humanity, a pig farm strikes us as an absolutely unworthy occupant, for the past 40 years, of the site of the former concentration camp at Lety."
"A place where many thousands of people, many of them children, suffered, and where hundreds of them died, must no longer be allowed to be the scene of such degradation."
"Of the approximately 6 000 Roma and Sinti who lived in the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in 1942, only some 600 returned home in 1945 from the concentration and extermination camps."
"That amounts to one tenth of them."
"It is because this is now no longer merely a problem for the Czech authorities, but rather a problem for Europe, that we are calling for this piggery to be relocated and for a memorial worthy of the victims of Nazism to be erected on the site of the former concentration camp."
"This was the theme of an exhibition we mounted last week in this House."
"I have documentation on the subject with me now."
"I would ask you to back this call, and thank all the groups in this House for their cooperation."
"Mr President, I ask for your patience because I am about to say something at odds with what has been said."
"Like every ethnocultural minority in the Union – whether native minorities, such as the Sardinians, Corsicans, Basques or Gaels, or legal immigrants – the Roma ethnic group also deserves every consideration."
"Precisely like the communities mentioned, however, the Roma community must also be subject to the rules of social coexistence and of mutual respect for the social order."
"I do not know, at least from personal experience, whether or not and in what way Gypsies are integrated in Romania and Bulgaria."
"They are in my country, however, where the police cannot enter Travellers’ camps, where the health authorities cannot give treatment or carry out inspections, and where it is impossible to tackle non-attendance at school, conduct a census of the residents, check children’s living conditions and the legitimacy of parental authority, or supervise respect forgender differences and human rights, and I could go on for hours."
"The Commission wants measures to provide jobs for the Roma community."
"These and other intolerable privileges are supported by five motions for resolutions tabled by all the groups, from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to the extreme left."
"With the certainty of representing millions of European Union citizens at least in this matter, we reject both the Commission’s declaration and the motions for resolutions, which are idiotic, stuffed full of rhetoric and racist towards the people of Europe."
"You Members who tabled these proposals should explain to the people why you demand that they fulfil duties and only secondarily let them enjoy rights."
"You should explain to them why you do not give them priority for homes or jobs or grant them impunity."
"Owing to the taxes levied on the pockets of properly registered citizens, we are called upon here to represent first the interests and feelings of these European citizens and then, and only then, to pontificate on imaginary acts of discrimination."
"Mr President, one of the pressing issues on the EP agenda this week has been the question of basic human rights, more specifically the situation of the Roma minority in Europe."
"I think the question of the Roma minority reaches well beyond constitutional state borders and their situation must be resolved at a European level."
"Yesterday afternoon a forum was convened, the European Parliament Roma Forum, attended by Roma people who are regularly at a disadvantage and face discrimination, who live locked behind barbed wire, or have no water, gas or electricity in their homes and who are not able to have their children educated."
"Many members of the European Parliament and some representatives of other authorities, who believe that this situation of continual discrimination must be resolved with joint effort, participated in this extraordinary European Roma Forum."
"We decided to establish a European monitoring and follow-up system on discrimination and also to introduce a database which contains instances of prejudice against the Roma."
"We would like to ask for the Commissioner’s help in setting up such a discrimination monitoring system so that this forum can influence public opinion accordingly."
"We think that the EU, civil organisations, private persons and representatives have made a great deal of effort, but very often a lot of these efforts have not been coordinated."
"It is very important that the Commissioner and Parliament coordinate these different types of effort, which are not necessarily in parallel, in order to act more efficiently and effectively, and in order to provide some form of human rights protection for Europe’s largest minority in a more efficient way."
"Mr President, I am proud today to be sitting in the same Chamber as Mrs Járóka and Mrs Mohácsi, although not so proud that so few Members of this House or staff of the institutions belong to an ethnic minority."
"This is brought into sharp relief in this debate on the Roma."
"We have a situation where this group will certainly be the biggest minority after the next enlargement."
"There is consensus – apart from with the last speaker but one perhaps – that something must be done."
"So what must be done?"
"Mrs Bauer talked about the deep complexity of this problem."
"The fact is that we in this House are already able to point to those things that we can do, but that Member States will not do."
"For example, there is the race equality directive."
"I have seen cases of Roma people bringing employment discrimination cases in their own countries, but there are so few as to make this meaningless."
"We have in this House legislation already on the table that is not being implemented by Member States."
"It is certainly not being implemented in the new Member States."
"With Mr Agnoletto this morning, I met members of the Roma community from Italy."
"As is the case of my own country, the United Kingdom, the diaspora of the Roma in so-called Old Europe are suffering as much if not more than in the new countries, because they are suffering the extra degradation of being immigrants and Roma."
"We must address both issues."
"This is a unified struggle and – apart from one speaker with whom I and many of us absolutely disagree – I want to place on record that the problem is so complex that there should be an all-party move on this resolution, signed and supported by all parties, that we cannot live in a European Union where children from one ethnic minority are segregated in school, sent to school with people who supposedly have mental disabilities."
"That is not the European Union I want to live in and we have the instruments in this House to ensure that Member States start to act."
"I look forward to hearing whether the Commissioner will take urgent action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, debates and speeches on the Roma, commonly known as gypsies in Polish, are something I have grown accustomed to since my election to the European Parliament."
"Who are the Roma, and what do we mean by this term?"
"Are they an ethnic group, as stated in the motion for a resolution, or a stateless nation?"
"If we agree that they are an ethnic group, consisting of citizens of all the EU Member States, then the solution to these problems is relatively straightforward."
"After all, each Member State has to ensure that its citizens enjoy the same rights and are treated equally, without being subjected to discrimination or xenophobia."
"We should bear in mind, however, that as well as rights, citizens also have certain duties, towards both the country they live in and the other people who live there."
"If we understand the Roma to be a stateless nation, then things start to look a great deal worse, if not hopeless."
"We must ask ourselves who is to defend this nation, as the answer to this question would be a starting point from which we could find a solution to the problems."
"The debate on this issue has recently become more heated because two new countries, Romania and Bulgaria, are in the process of joining the European Union."
"Romania is generally considered to be the Roma’s main homeland, although they originally come from the distant land of India."
"For over 600 years, the Roma have either not wanted to or not been able to assimilate into society in the countries in which they live."
"Feelings of mutual animosity have become more pronounced during this time, rather than less so."
"Even though many different measures have been taken to narrow the gap in development, education and standard of living that exists between the Roma and the rest of the population, this gap is in fact widening."
"Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, fellow citizens in the public gallery, ladies and gentlemen."
"Like everyone else, I welcome the debate on the Roma in the EU."
"I also welcome all Roma as members of the EU."
"In spite of the ban on discrimination in the first article of the UN Charter, 12 to 15 million Roma are in a vulnerable position."
"The EU’s seven to nine million Roma, a number equivalent to the Swedish population, are to be found in the majority of EU Member States, but no country properly recognises the group as its largest ethnic minority."
"Worryingly enough, discrimination is also on the increase."
"Since the year 2000, when Sweden ratified the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Roma group has been recognised in Sweden and the Roma language, Romany, is a recognised minority language in Sweden, but that is not enough to end the Roma’s exclusion."
"The whole of the EU must protect the Roma’s position and, in particular, the vulnerable position of women and children."
"We must join with Roma women in integrating them and their children into our gender equality policy, particularly as it relates to the protection of reproductive and sexual health, promotion of family planning, education for children and girls and increased participation in political decision-making."
"I listened to Commissioner Špidla’s report, for which I thank him. Given that matters relating to the Roma are the responsibility of the whole of the EU, I should like to ask him, as the Commissioner responsible for equality, if there is anything more we can do specifically in terms of women’s and children’s rights and in terms of combating exclusion."
"I applaud the resolution."
". In my opinion, the debate we have just held was an exceptionally wide-ranging one."
"It covered such issues as the status of the Roma as an ethnic group, discrimination against this group and the social and political position of the Roma from a number of angles."
"I believe that we heard a very broad spectrum of opinions, or rather points of view, and that this will provide us with a sound basis for further considerations on the resolution tabled by this House."
"The issues raised during the debate highlight the importance and urgency of measures to promote the social inclusion of the Roma at European, national and regional level."
"The backing of Parliament – and I regard your initiative as extremely important – will help us to mobilise all stakeholders and to drum up the necessary political will."
"The fact that members of the Roma community are present in this Chamber as MEPs is of particular benefit, as this provides us with a starting point of sorts for a European debate on the real lives and circumstances of Roma communities."
"The Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that all the relevant policies and programmes are conducted in a coherent and effective manner in order to promote inclusion of the Roma and of other disadvantaged groups."
"We must carry out a more in-depth analysis of both the real needs of the various groups and the areas where action at European level can provide added value."
"In my opinion, it would be helpful for the Commission to be given advice on such matters by a group of leading figures and experts, and I will give some thought to the best way in which such a group could be set up."
"I will also suggest to President Barroso that a debate on the situation of the Roma should be held at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Group of Commissioners on fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equal opportunities."
"2007 will be declared the European Year of Equal Opportunities."
"A number of measures will be implemented by the Commission, and the Roma issue will obviously also be given its due weight."
"Today’s debate has given rise to a number of historical reflections and asides."
"In my opinion, it would be fitting to remind ourselves that the history of the Roma in Europe has been one of persecution, and that this persecution has frequently been inconceivably cruel."
"According to a decree issued by the Austrian Emperor Leopold I in the late 17th century – and I paraphrase – any Roma who crossed the boundaries of a village should be killed, and this also meant children."
"Punishment awaited anyone who failed to take such drastic action."
"Europe’s history is a very cruel one in this respect."
"One of the speakers said that the European Union is the Roma’s only hope."
"I do not believe that I would have used the word ‘only’ myself, as there are unquestionably a great many other organisations and political endeavours."
"Nevertheless, we can be proud of the fact that the European Union has set an example in the field of equal opportunities and human rights, in spite of all our imperfections and inconsistency, and in spite of all the work we still have ahead of us."
"I have received five motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, Mr Roszkowski and I requested that Parliament should commemorate and pay tribute to the officers that were brutally and deliberately murdered in Katyn in April 1940 in an act of terrorism by the Soviet NKVD, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs."
"We received an answer from the President of Parliament saying that we must never forget dates and tragedies of this kind that are part of our history, and I am much obliged to him for this."
"At the same time, however, he informed us that the Bureau had decided not to hold a minute’s silence for the victims of this crime, and I find this most regrettable."
"Before I make a proposal to the House, I should therefore like to use ten seconds of my speaking time to pay tribute to the officers who died in Katyn and to their families."
"Other Members may wish to join me in observing this silence."
"Mr President, I propose that Parliament proclaim 5 March the day of the fight against all kinds of totalitarianism."
"Stalin’s gang took this barbaric genocide decision on 5 March 1940."
"Mr President, most people know that 1 May is International Workers’ Day, but I wonder how many people know that tomorrow, 28 April, is International Workers’ Memorial Day?"
"That is the day we remember those who have been killed in the workplace or by illnesses related to their work."
"Health and safety at work has of course improved over the last few years in the European Union, partly due to the legislation we have adopted ourselves."
"However, the ILO estimates that there is still one death globally every 15 seconds at work, that is 6 000 people dying every day, and it is said that work kills more people than war."
"By remembering those who have died, we can do more to prevent accidents at work."
"A local campaign in my constituency, organised by Herbert Styles, tried to persuade governments to do more by formally recognising International Workers’ Memorial Day."
"That is why I am asking colleagues and our President, whose own country, Spain, recognises International Workers’ Memorial Day, to try to have that day formally recognised, so that we think about accidents at work."
"Mr President, two days ago a four-year-old girl was killed in my constituency after being hit by a car in front of her mother."
"The enormity of the grief that such a catastrophic event can bring to a family is difficult to comprehend and impossible to describe."
"Unfortunately, such tragic occurrences are happening daily and in great numbers in one part or another of our Union."
"Road traffic accidents are in fact the commonest cause of death of children in Europe today."
"This is a shameful and totally unacceptable statistic for a civilised society such as ours."
"The slaughtering of our children on the roads must be stopped."
"Mr President, can I call upon you to personally contact all the European Heads of State and use your persuasive powers to impose upon them the urgent need to involve themselves in a serious, continuous and effective crusade to improve road safety, especially for children?"
"I also suggest that efforts be made to establish a widely publicised blacklist of shame, in which the 25 Member States are ranked according to the number of children killed on the roads per head of population each year."
"Mr President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the South Caucasus, I very much hope that the European Parliament commemorates the 90th anniversary of the Armenian genocide."
"They represent ninety years that have seen the Armenian people living haunted by the past and awaiting recognition of this genocide: recognition by the world as witness, as our European Parliament did in 1987, and recognition by the perpetrators as culprits."
"This recognition is a long time coming, as we are dealing with the realm of pure emotions and extreme sensitivity."
"I remain convinced, however, that this moment will come, and it is the responsibility of the Union to encourage it."
"In the framework of accession negotiations with Turkey, the Union must help the Turkish people and authorities to begin their memorial work, as Germany did in seeking forgiveness from the Jewish people."
"We must prevail upon Turkish society to recognise the Armenian genocide of 1919."
"I am hopeful, particularly today thanks to the agreement by the Armenian authorities to participate in an intergovernmental committee with Turkey on the genocide."
"I am truly convinced that Armenians and Turks will be able to find the road to reconciliation so that they may live together as good neighbours."
"Mr President, I should simply like to draw the attention of the House to a very serious matter: 40 Kurdish citizens have reached their 30th day on hunger strike because they are appealing to be allowed to stay in Belgium, on the grounds of a request for political asylum."
"Some of these people are in an extremely serious condition."
"I have sent an open letter to the Ministry of the Interior asking it to provide subsidiary protection which, partly through the third European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights of 15 December 1980, could allow these people to remain in Belgium for the time being, even without political asylum."
"A delegation from Parliament will be going to the tomorrow at 9.30 to show their solidarity with these 40 Kurds who are risking their lives."
"Mr President, even when my home country, Poland, was under Communist rule, encouraging children to drink was frowned upon."
"Those parents who gave alcohol to their underage children, either for the sake of a bit of peace and quiet or because they were oblivious of the consequences, came in for much criticism."
"Most of the families involved were socially disadvantaged, and unaware of the harm caused by alcohol and other addictive substances."
"The end result of addiction will always be a cycle of destruction and self-destruction that causes enormous physical and mental suffering."
"This is true at any age, but particularly in the case of young people."
"I therefore find it reprehensible and utterly disgusting that companies are producing various alcoholic drinks targeted at children, such as ‘alcopops’ that look like orangeade, or powdered alcohol in sachets."
"During one of the meetings of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we heard that the Commission tolerates such products in its role as guardian of the free market."
"Yet the fact that our markets have been liberalised cannot be taken to mean that companies are free to encourage children or young people to get drunk."
"We are therefore calling on the EU institutions, , to comply with EU legislation, and for strict penalties to be imposed on anyone who breaks the rules on underage drinking, or who breaches the ban on producing ingenious alcoholic drinks that are targeted at children and young people and intended to get them addicted to alcohol."
"Mr President, 21 April saw an important vote held in the Committee on Budgets."
"It had to do with the EUR 90 million calculated at the time to be available to Parliament from the EU Budget."
"An oral amendment was moved to the effect that, from this amount, EUR 60 million should be tucked away in the reserves."
"Being a member of the Committee, and entitled to vote in it, I spoke to oppose this oral amendment."
"In line with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure, it ought then not to have been voted on, but that was something that Mr Lewandowski, who was in the chair, chose to disregard."
"I now call on you to use your powers as President to get this vote reversed and to stop the report on the subject reaching the plenary."
"A similar written request has already been sent to the Bureau."
"Mr President, for the next few weeks, throughout Europe the attention of the media and also of various conferences will focus on what experience has been gained from the first year of the EU’s historic enlargement."
"For the 100 million citizens of the ten new Member States, May 1 is not only associated with Labour Day, but also marks our return to and reuniting with Europe, and this is what we will celebrate in my home country, Hungary, on that day."
"We came with enormous expectations, and I admit, the day we gained full membership rights to the EU was anticipated with a bit of scepticism."
"This one-minute speech does not allow for any deliberation on what experience was gained during the first year following the enlargement."
"On behalf of the 106 new representatives, however, I would like to take this festive moment to thank the long-standing members for their friendship, helpfulness, tolerance and solidarity."
"Your help has greatly encouraged us to take an active and responsible part in our united work today in the interest of our countries, parties and in the interest of every citizen of the EU."
"Mr President, I would like to express my concern at the kidnap in the Republic of Colombia of a European Union citizen, of Spanish nationality, Carlos Ayala Saavedra, an official of the Commission’s delegation in Bogotá."
"We are not aware of the circumstances of his disappearance but it would appear that he has been kidnapped, and since we are talking about an official from one of our institutions, I believe it would be appropriate for Parliament to demonstrate its solidarity in some way, both with the citizen in question and his family and with our sister institution, the European Commission."
"Mr President, I must protest most strongly at the alarming censorship carried out by the European Parliament in preventing the screening of the film in the Press Room on 20 April."
"I consider this to be an unacceptable act."
"The very same film has, for months and months, been the subject of censorship enforced by means of terror by Islamic fundamentalists, to whom we owe the assassination of the film director, Theo van Gogh."
"I call on the President of the European Parliament to lift this ban, which does no credit to our Parliament and which conflicts with the principle of freedom of expression."
"In particular, it conflicts with the principle of freedom of artistic expression, upon which, I believe, our coexistence and the legal order of the European Union are founded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as representatives of the new EU Member States, we have been somewhat disturbed by the latest news on the Luxembourg Presidency’s proposals concerning the European Union’s budget for 2007-2013."
"These proposals will place the new Member States, in particular the Czech Republic and Hungary, but also my country, Poland, at a disadvantage."
"This is mainly a result of proposals to reduce the share of GDP paid into the EU budget by the Member States and to lower the aid ceiling to below 4% of GDP, which would be particularly unfair."
"I should like to make it very clear that this would amount to nothing less than unilateral amendments to the treaties on accession concluded with Poland and the other new Member States."
"Is this all that remains of the much-vaunted European solidarity we heard about before the accession referendums in our countries?"
"Is this the best example we can set of European cohesion?"
"These are the questions you should be asking yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, and the questions to which all of us in this House should provide an answer that is both honest and sincere."
"Dear colleagues, I still would like to come back to the history of the Romany Gypsies."
"The present and its problems always have a connection to the past that we need to know."
"In particular, when it is about human tragedies, which followed the greatest Jewish tragedy, that are, however, forgotten, since they are the tragedies of smaller nations, such as the genocide of the Romany or Chechen-Ingush people carried out during the Second World War, and the Chechen genocide last year was acknowledged by the European Parliament."
"A week ago I visited a small exhibition in our Parliament that moved me."
"It seems this has already been discussed here."
"That was the former Romany concentration camp, Lety, in the present Czech Republic, at those times under Nazi occupation."
"Few exhibits, but they cannot leave one untouched."
"For example, that picture which is here – tens of small, lovely and merry children, obviously, black-haired and black-eyed, who are most probably condemned to death."
"And in the former camp buildings there is neither a museum nor a memorial place to respect the sufferings, but a piggery."
"Nobody would dare to treat the barracks of Auschwitz in this way; therefore, here we have unequal opportunities as well, even if we talk differently."
"I ask my colleagues from the Czech Republic to do their best to change the present situation at Lety."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, something is not quite right."
"How can it be possible?"
"I hear from Mr Agnoletto that a minority of Kurds are here in serious difficulties and are claiming asylum in Belgium."
"Is it not true, however, that the Kurds, like the surviving Armenians – if there are still any of them left – are a Turkish minority?"
"If they are being persecuted, how can the Union have begun Turkey’s accession process, in violation of the foundations of the Treaties?"
"I call upon the Commission and the President to be vigilant and to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey."
"Mr President, I am aware that, when elections take place in various parts of the world, the European Union and our Parliament send observers to see that they are fair. I should like to invite the President of Parliament to ask the European Commission and the Council whether they do not see fit to send observers to the forthcoming elections of the Italian Parliament, which will be held in May 2006, because we are the first who should observe the rules of democracy."
"You are aware that the last elections held three weeks ago in Italy were, according to many Italian courts, marred by irregularities and fraud in the preparation of electoral lists."
"I should not like to see that repeated and I should very much welcome a response, bearing in mind that the fraud was perpetrated to the detriment of the current Italian Government."
"Mr President, I would like to raise an urgent matter concerning the operations of a Turkish-owned bank in the Netherlands known as Finansbank."
"It has facilitated the laundering of up to EUR 30 million from a Turkish construction company located in the Republic of Ireland."
"This money belonged to the 800 or so Turkish workers working for this company in Ireland."
"The money was transferred without the knowledge of the workers concerned."
"It was subsequently transferred by Finansbank to another company called Ryder Investments."
"As far as I am concerned this is money laundering: the illegal transfer of money not belonging to Gama to another bank in the Netherlands and subsequently to another bank."
"We have to investigate the operations of Finansbank, we have to investigate the operations of Gama, and we have to tell the Turkish authorities that companies incorporated in Turkey must comply with European law when they operate in the European Union."
"I am in favour of the Turkish Republic joining the European Union, but this kind of activity will undermine its efforts to do so."
"It is also important to recognise that Gama is currently in the process of seeking to dismiss the workers who blew the whistle on this scam."
"Gama is, in my view, in breach of the anti-discrimination directives."
"It is also in breach of the directives that oblige the company to inform the workers of its intentions."
"I would appreciate it if the President would convey my comments to the Commission President."
"I am happy that Commissioner Špidla is in the Chamber at the moment and I hope he has taken note of my remarks because they are serious: they are not made lightly."
"These investigations have to be carried out."
"That concludes the one-minute speeches."
"The next item is the report (A6-0085/2005) by Mr Cabrnoch on modernising social protection and developing good quality health care [2004/2189(INI)]."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to present Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Commission report on modernising social protection and developing high-quality health care and long-term care."
"The Commission presented this report to the European Council, Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee last spring."
"Its main aim was to identify the principle challenges to be overcome by all the health care systems in all the Member States, and to propose joint objectives that could be used as guidelines by the Member States when developing or, potentially, reforming these systems."
"The open method of coordination is used in identifying common challenges, committing to joint objectives, exchanging views and experience and carrying out joint evaluations of the success of developments in care systems in the individual Member States."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which both discussed the Commission report, took a keen interest in it, as can be seen from the fact that over 100 amendments to my motion for a resolution were tabled."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs discussed the motion for a resolution in late March and voted on all the amendments that had been tabled, and the motion we have before us today is the end result of that process."
"In any event, only five amendments have so far been tabled, all of which propose changes that were tabled and rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I am firmly convinced that the House will vote in favour of my motion for a resolution."
"If I may, I should now like to make some brief comments on the issues that we discussed."
"Problems relating to health and long-term care are of central interest to all the EU Member States, and a lively debate on the health care system and its future is taking place in every one of them."
"Furthermore, I can state without hesitation that health care reforms are either underway or on the drawing board in each of the Member States."
"Health care affects every member of the public, and that obviously also includes politicians."
"The provision of high-quality health care that is accessible to everyone who needs it, irrespective of age, status or wealth, is in the public interest, and is therefore a task for politicians."
"Something else that is in the public interest, and hence also a task for politicians, is maintaining a stable health care system, and by ‘stable’ I mean not only financially stable, but also stable in other respects, for example in terms of staffing, which is a key issue."
"The Commission identifies three main challenges in its report, namely the ageing of the population, new technologies for preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic care and the growing expectations of a public that is increasingly aware of health care choices."
"To these can be added the rising age of health care workers, the fact that these workers are leaving certain countries to work abroad, the increased movement of EU citizens between Member States and the growing levels of immigration from third countries into the EU."
"The main objectives proposed by the Commission are high-quality care, accessibility to all and long-term financial sustainability, which would obviate the need for state funding from other budget headings."
"When the Commission report was discussed in committee, consensus was reached on these challenges and on the joint objectives."
"Another issue that was highlighted was the question of subsidiarity, the implication of which in the field of health and long-term care is that national governments are fully responsible for developing and reforming health care in the Member States."
"We would also stress that prevention is the most effective way of improving public health."
"The role of patients as clients of health care services is of great significance to Parliament, as patients have the right to decide freely on their health and the care they receive."
"Following on from this, they also have the right to receive detailed and easy to understand information on health and illness, as well as on health care and its outcomes, possibilities, alternatives and risks."
"New communications technologies represent both a major challenge and a significant opportunity, as information comes at a premium in the field of health care, and we will be able to achieve higher quality care and a better use of public funds if this information can be shared between individual patients and their doctors."
"Something else we would highlight is the key role played by patients, as well as their right to decide and the responsibility they bear for such decisions."
"Information is an essential requirement for decision-taking, as is cooperation with doctors, even though the latter will always have an advantage in terms of information."
"This does not, however, give them the right to take decisions for patients."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my report and the motion for a resolution I have tabled will be endorsed by the vast majority of Members."
"."
"Honourable Members, I should firstly like to thank Mr Cabrnoch and his colleagues for this report."
"It contains a great many proposals and recommendations, and the Commission will pay due attention to all of them."
"I was particularly glad to see that the report argues in favour of stepping up cooperation in order to improve health and long-term care for senior citizens in the Member States, and that it takes the open method of coordination as its basis."
"At the end of this year, the Commission will adopt a communication setting out proposals aimed at rationalising and simplifying the open method of coordination in the field of social protection."
"As noted in paragraph 32 of the report, these proposals will cover health and long-term care, as well as social integration and pensions."
"We regard health care as one of the key aspects of the strategies to be developed by the Member States over the next few years with a view to solving the problem of demographic ageing whilst maintaining a high level of social protection."
"Your report has therefore come at a very opportune time, and will be of great help to us in drafting these proposals."
"The same is true for the national reports on health and long-term care that we are in the process of receiving from the Member States."
"A crucial part of our work schedule will be to identify opportunities for interaction with the current and future European public health strategies and with the relevant Community action programme."
"Both Commissioner Kyprianou and myself and our departments will continue to cooperate closely to this end."
"At the same time, of course, we will not lose sight of the fact that the Member States bear the primary responsibility for health and long-term care, and that the European Union’s job is to support political bodies with decision-making powers at national level."
"Your report discusses a wide range of issues relating to social protection and public health, as well as those relating to the free movement of persons and services on the internal market."
"All these fundamental issues must be addressed using the appropriate instruments, which include the legislative powers we hold with regard to the internal market and freedom of movement, as well as the action programme for public health and the open method of coordination."
"The Commission will seek to ensure maximum coherence between these individual instruments, whilst at the same time continuing to promote an integrated understanding of health care in terms of efforts to provide appropriate and fair health care to all citizens, whether in their own countries or in other EU Member States."
"Honourable Members, this is an extremely wide-ranging and thorough report, and I should merely like to comment on one of its paragraphs."
"According to paragraph 7, Parliament regrets that the Commission views the modernisation of social protection with regard to health care essentially in terms of the requirements of the Stability Pact."
"In my opinion, this is not entirely accurate."
"Mr Cabrnoch has already said that the threefold aim of accessibility, quality and long-term financial sustainability lies at the heart of all debates on modernisation."
"This means that although long-term financial sustainability is of considerable importance, it is not the only guiding principle for all of our decisions."
"As I said at the start of my speech, this report has come at a very opportune time, and the points covered in it are such that we will undoubtedly give consideration to them in our future work."
"I thank you."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Cabrnoch on his report, which is a very good one."
"Benchmarking, and the dissemination of the best practice resulting from it, is very much to be welcomed as an approach, particularly in the healthcare sector."
"It is an approach codified and institutionalised by the open method of coordination incorporated into the Lisbon Strategy, a method which requires the participation of the Member States in line with the Commission’s timetables."
"The best-case scenario is that this makes the whole process more dynamic."
"In the worst-case scenario, the result is an avalanche of data, with which the authorities concerned cannot cope."
"It is unfortunate that we do not yet have the experiential data, collected over many years, that would enable us to carry out accurate assessments of this very complex area."
"Their absence seems to be a fact of life, particularly in the healthcare sector."
"If the people on whose work the system depends are to be won over to the idea of inner-European exchange in the health sector, I think the open method of coordination needs, in the first instance, to be introduced carefully and progressively."
"Under no circumstances must data be collected in such massive quantities that the authorities would then be unable to process it."
"The dynamics of the process as a whole would seem to make a mandatory timetable by far the most sensible option, although computerised data collection cannot be started everywhere at the same time."
"In the health sector, I regard the cautious and progressive introduction of statistical returns, hand in hand with in-depth feedback from the personnel involved, as the right way ahead."
"It must be possible, for the sake of efficiency and the long-term acceptance of the open method of coordination, to create an ideally efficient portfolio of data by doing away with the less important returns."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, at a time when the European social model is under discussion – and when some are indeed calling it into question – this House is looking at modernising social protection and developing good quality health care."
"I wish to start by saying that I support, in full, the priorities set out by the Council, which will lead to access for all to good quality health care, provided in a context of long-term financial sustainability."
"Although health and social protection policy continues to fall under the Member States’ competence, the EU has rightly taken a step forward by applying the open method of coordination in this area, thereby strengthening cooperation between national policies."
"In this regard, the open method of coordination is undoubtedly the most effective instrument in the current circumstances, although we are aware that measures of this kind are mainly geared towards the citizens as health care consumers."
"Unless there is a climate of confidence between the citizens and the health care services, none of this will be anything more than good intentions."
"As in all relations between consumers and suppliers, a climate of confidence is essential, and this is especially true of the health care sector."
"In some Member States, the citizens’ confidence in the services falls well short of what one would wish to see."
"For the system to be able to work, it is crucial that the citizens have confidence in the services at their disposal, yet for this to become a reality, no information should be kept from the users of health care services."
"It should be made absolutely clear that patients’ rights are paramount and first and foremost among them is the right to information on their state of health, on the possibilities available to them in terms of health care and long-term care and on the level of quality of the care offered on the market by individual providers."
"The prime objective, which is at the moment still a utopian dream, is to provide every European citizen unlimited access to good quality services, regardless of age, sex, nationality and financial status."
"For this to happen, however, Member States must accept that reforms must be carried out to ensure the system’s financial stability. Accordingly, they will need to introduce the principle that the patient pays for certain health care expenses."
"The Member States must face the fact that every service comes at a price, although with regard to payment by patients, the person’s economic situation must be taken into account, with the onus naturally falling on the State to help the poorest sections of society."
"Member State governments have sovereignty in this area, but this initiative must be seen as an important step towards the construction of a social Europe."
"I therefore welcome it wholeheartedly."
". Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by congratulating the rapporteur on the balance of his report."
"The development of high-quality health care inevitably entails rising costs, and if policy takes no account of this fact, we cannot help ending up with first and second-class medicine."
"History shows us who gets less care under those circumstances."
"We can expect to live longer, and, when I say it is fortunate that there are more and more older people, I mean that in the sense that major issues always bring with them new ideas and innovation, so it may well be that the EU of 25 or 27 will thereby be turned into a humane society founded upon solidarity."
"It is for that reason that this report makes the specific point that particular care needs to be taken to maintain equity if the poorer members of society are to bear an ever-greater share of the cost of healthcare."
"Within the EU – by which I now mean the EU of 27 – health provision varies from one extreme to another."
"In terms of costs, this means that countries’ expenditure on healthcare varies from 4% to 9% of their gross domestic product."
"Of the new Member States, the poorest spend the least and also have the worst health provision."
"That is a fact."
"It does not, however, simply mean that spending more adds up to better performance."
"That requires more efficient management and particular attention to the type of care and the demand for it if health provision and long-term care are to be funded in the long run."
"This calls for a European benchmark and open coordination."
"The last point I want to make about cost is that the United States spend nearly 14% of their gross domestic product on health, and make a poor job of sharing it out."
"We cannot aim to do that, and nor should we."
"We do, on the other hand, have to take account of the fact that, at present, medical knowledge doubles every five years."
"Although that means more costs, everyone has the same entitlement to care, and that is something to which we have to give priority."
"Hence the need not only for benchmarking, but also for solidarity."
"There is no shortage of problems to deal with."
"The new Member States are still combating corruption in many areas of their health systems."
"It is where the lack of provision is most glaring that corruption is at its height and older people are poorest, and their poverty is increasing more than elsewhere."
"Those, in essence, are the social challenges we face."
"Believe me, older people are most afraid when they believe they will be inadequately cared for when ill or that it will no longer be possible to care for them."
"It is in the new Member States, as a result of budgetary pressure, that public funding is least secure."
"Although I have listed just a few problems, there are others that are becoming apparent; health workers are relocating from the new Member States to the old Fifteen, to the benefit of the healthcare systems there."
"So let me repeat that this is a sensitive political issue, and improved coordination and cooperation are absolutely vital."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise the need to consider this report in a wider context, in association with the following events and facts."
"Firstly, it has to be considered in the context of the pressure that the Lisbon process puts on health care and on the social insurance systems in order to turn them into services capable of being marketed throughout Europe."
"Secondly, when considering it, we have to bear in mind the fact that the services directive will make health care subject to European competition rules and to the country of origin principle."
"Thirdly, as is emphasised at various points in the report, one consequence of population change is that, in many Member States, healthcare systems are regarded as an intolerable burden on the national budget, and this has had a markedly detrimental effect on the working conditions of healthcare personnel."
"The Commission’s latest proposals give backing to this trend."
"The report plays a crucial part in preparing for a fundamental choice between what has been proposed by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other."
"The question at issue is whether health care and social protection systems should remain wholly within the sphere of services of general interest or whether they should be made subject to the competition rules of the internal market."
"Parliament’s response, in no uncertain terms, to this is that health care must continue to be considered as a service of general interest, and universal access for all – regardless of their purchasing power – must be guaranteed."
"In this report, moreover, this House makes it quite clear that systems of financial solidarity must be neither abandoned nor reduced to empty shells."
"I hope that the Commission will, in its future proposals, take on board the detailed amendments in this report, which constitute a clear and alternative response to the challenge we face."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Cabrnoch, on his report."
"Although I believe that the key principles adopted by the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left are reflected in his motion for a resolution, I have tabled a number of amendments that emphasise our group’s priorities."
"Firstly, I am delighted that the rapporteur’s proposals stress that health care should be provided to EU citizens in accordance with the principle of solidarity."
"The right to health is after all considered to be a fundamental right in all the EU Member States, and one that is conferred on the basis of solidarity."
"My amendment was intended to ensure that this is in fact what happens."
"Secondly, it is surely the case that as well as safeguarding the freedom of movement of workers, we should also safeguard their right to receive appropriate, high-quality and accessible health care in all EU Member States."
"It is for this reason that I have tabled further amendments aimed at improving training for health care workers, in order to achieve a comparable level of training in all Member States."
"I firmly believe that this training must be funded from the EU training budget, and that the Member States must not be left to deal with this matter on their own."
"Thirdly, I welcome the rapporteur’s comments to the effect that the health care services should focus on prevention, and I believe that the Commission should encourage the Member States to step up all preventive measures, not only with regard to health care provision, but also with regard to working time and health at work."
"Our aim should be not only to increase the flexibility and competitiveness of the workforce, but also to protect the health of workers."
"Fourthly, I agree with the rapporteur when he says that although medical science offers new diagnostic and therapeutic options, health care systems must also be financially stable."
"In my opinion, health care cannot be viewed only in accounting terms, and I would therefore find it regrettable if such an approach dominated our understanding of health care reform."
"I would be unable to lend my support to such an approach."
". Mr President, the provision of guaranteed health care is one of the state’s most important duties, and it derives from the basic rights of individuals."
"Every country should be required to maintain and fund essential health care services."
"The liberal approach, which consists of privatising services and imposing market conditions upon them by means of various pieces of legislation will not safeguard the provision of care in areas such as preventive medicine, mother and baby care, diseases of civilisation and geriatric and palliative care."
"Even though these areas are all loss-making, they are essential and crucial for public health."
"It is a well-known fact that investing in health means investing in people, as is the case with education."
"As I only have a few minutes’ speaking time, I should like to focus on what we see as the most important points."
"There needs to be a public health service, and this health service must continue to develop and remain accessible to all, both to those who can afford treatment and to those who cannot."
"No ideal system has yet been found for either organising or funding health care services."
"There are advantages and disadvantages inherent in every system, including both systems based on insurance contributions and what could be termed state-funded systems."
"The best solution is therefore probably a mixed system."
"At the same time, however, the social rights of health care workers and patients must be properly safeguarded."
"State funding must be available for public hospitals, preventive medicine and all other loss-making areas."
"A great many lofty sentiments have been expressed, particularly in EU legislation, on the subject of modernising social protection in order to develop and improve health care, yet they are often contradictory."
"The sole result of this is to aggravate the situation with regard to social and health care, even though it is already difficult enough in many countries as a result of increasing costs, bloodthirsty capitalism and a failure to observe moral principles."
"A good example of this is the contradictions that arise from the fact that the Member States have seemingly been placed in charge of organisation and funding, yet medical services have been included in the services directive."
"If we wish to guarantee the provision of high-quality care, we cannot regard health as a productive sector of the economy, or health services as normal commercial services."
"By way of example, one company expects to make as much as CHF 13 billion from sales of an anti-cancer drug after gaining permission to sell the drug in Europe."
"I have sometimes heard it said in this House that a poor Europe cannot afford to provide long-term care, and that instead we should practice euthanasia, or in other words get rid of the problem by putting people to death."
"This should not be what is meant by modernising social protection in order to develop and improve health care."
"The only answer to an ageing population is to change our attitude to conceived life."
"We should protect this life and do all we can, by which I also mean observing moral principles, in order to improve not only the quality, but also the functioning of health care services."
"Furthermore, we will not improve health care services in any way whatsoever through extensive administrative machinery, corruption, bureaucracy and by publishing ever more regulations, reports, opinions, declarations and identical or similar lists."
"This merely increases costs and wastes the time of both the authorities and the doctors and nurses, whose job is to help the sick."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Cabrnoch, the report reminds us that health care accounts for only 10% of an individual’s state of health."
"The remaining 90% is determined by many other factors, such as social situation, the lack of jobs and feelings of insecurity amongst those with no means of making a living."
"Even though the Member States are responsible for public health care, I therefore believe that the European Union should draw up a set of minimum social standards."
"This would guarantee a minimum of social protection in all Member States, whilst still allowing the richer countries to provide better welfare and health care systems."
"In my opinion, the European Union should have the right to be informed of the minimum levels of social benefits in the individual Member States."
"In Poland this figure currently stands at EUR 100, although our dream is to achieve EUR 250."
"The EU should also be informed of the situation with regard to health care."
"Polish doctors earn EUR 400 a month at present, and rely on bribes to supplement their income."
"Mr President, the right to health is a fundamental one, and it is the Member States’ responsibility to make it real for their citizens, who are absolutely entitled to choose their own healthcare provision and long-term care – anywhere in the EU, and irrespective of their own income."
"It has to be said, though, that the accessibility and quality of health provision and care diverge to a considerable degree."
"An EU action programme to help promote public health has been in place since 2003, and it provides a sound basis on which our Member States can step up their cooperation."
"We need to arrive at common objectives, and specifically national strategies can then be devised to deal with the challenges of more mobile patients, rising costs for new treatments and – thank heaven – increased life expectancy."
"Far too little, though – as the rapporteur has pointed out – is being invested in the preventive care that stops people becoming ill in the first place."
"The healthcare sector has considerable potential for employment. It is rightly seen as being likely to become more important in the future, not only in terms of the money that will be spent on it, but also of its potential for innovation."
"I am thinking of such things as home care services, for which there is an ever-increasing demand, and which make it possible for old people and the sick to be cared for in familiar domestic surroundings, something that is psychologically important and plays an important part in helping people to live longer and more healthily."
"Rising life expectancy gives people a chance to make a personal contribution to society, in the shape of their own experience, which is so vital to it."
"There are many obstacles standing in the way of job creation in the health sector, and they will be difficult to overcome – one thinks, for example, of the high cost of social insurance in Germany, my home country."
"The European Union’s healthcare systems must be organised in such a way that the public can afford them and businesses can be freed from excessive costs and thereby encouraged to create jobs."
"The rapporteur emphasises the need for preventive care, improved long-term treatment, and on the need to help patients by improving the much-needed exchange of information between Member States, and I agree with him in this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"In the year 2000, when the report on modernisation of the social protection systems was being debated, I myself was the rapporteur."
"The first time that we debated the open coordination method, together with healthcare, pensions and other issues was when we were drawing up the relevant strategy."
"The organisation and funding of health care are a national issue that, in certain countries, is dealt with at regional level, as it should be allowed to be in the future too."
"The issue is that of whether there is added value for Europe in cooperation, and the answer is yes, because these are common challenges that we face."
"You pointed out some of them, two of which I want to address."
"Technical development, enabling us to do more, is of course a positive development meaning that more people can be cured. It also places greater demands on future priorities, however."
"We are also living longer. That is a good thing, but it also puts a bigger strain on health services."
"An exchange of best practice in this area is possible."
"As many have pointed out, it is important to invest in preventive health."
"In this connection, I myself pushed the issue of our needing a developed occupational health service because many illnesses and other problems arise in working life."
"Being familiar with the working environment and able to intervene early is important for health care."
"I see those who have to make use of health services as being, in the first place, patients rather than customers."
"This is connected with the view that health care is not a commercial service but a service driven by need. I do not think it belongs in the Services Directive, a view also expressed by a number of other people in this House."
"The Services Directive is, in the first place, about commercial services, while this is a service of general interest and should be debated in that context."
"– Mr President, let me start by making a brief comment on what Mr Mann said."
"If he wants to highlight the need for costs to be cut in healthcare provision, he ought not to ignore the part played by the pharmaceutical industry."
"I regard the failure to address this as a defect in the report we are discussing."
"I want, though, to draw your attention to something else – the link between the lack of doctors in EU Member States, to which the report refers, and the Working Time Directive, which is currently under discussion."
"Doctors in many German hospitals complain of poor working conditions and intolerable working hours, and the criticism levelled by the women among them is that deliberate mobbing makes it more difficult for them to balance work and family."
"This often adds up to overworked and stressed-out doctors, who may move to other countries or even leave the profession altogether."
"Those who bear responsibility for the misguided health and personnel policies of recent years are now trying to make the workers pay for their failures."
"They do this by drawing a distinction between active and non-active on-call time, the latter of which they refuse to pay for, claiming that thousands of new healthcare posts would be needed if they were to do so."
"The employers’ association of the German ,and individual ministers in the ,have given us examples of what they mean by non-active on-call time: time spent on general visits, changing dressings, time outside ordinary working time spent doing infusions, injections, and routine chores such as dealing with correspondence."
"I see this as a whole new kind of exploitation, and I ask Members not only to support our amendments, but also, when considering the Working Time Directive, to see to it that what the Commission has drafted does not go unchanged."
"Mr President, this is an excellent report from an excellent rapporteur."
"It is a perfect example of one of the benefits of enlargement – of our welcoming ten new Member States – that we have representatives with such strength and wisdom to improve the quality of our discussions."
"I am sure both the President and the Commissioner would agree with that remark."
"I particularly welcome the comment that whilst healthcare is a matter for Member States, nonetheless we can all learn a great deal from each other."
"That is absolutely true, and the more we can learn the better for each of us."
"I also commend the comments about the importance of having proper healthcare for elderly people such as myself."
"I have one comment for the Commissioner, on which I will ask for his advice and particularly his nod of approval in a moment."
"I have written to him concerning a possible scam that is appearing in various EU countries."
"Tourists who unfortunately fall ill are suddenly taken from their hotel and deflected to private hospitals where they are then landed with a hefty bill."
"Even if they happen to be conscious when they are taken away and protest that they are entitled to equivalent free healthcare, they are nonetheless whisked off to a private hospital."
"I accept that this a matter for Member States, but I ask the Commissioner whether there is there anything he or we can do about it."
"Is he aware of the extent of the problem and does he accept, as this report states, that citizens have the right to equivalent healthcare in every Member State and that this needs reinforcing?"
"What can he do to reinforce it?"
"I would ask him to be so good as to reply in English saying what can be done, so that I can send this reply to my constituent in the West Midlands."
"Health is a fundamental social right and one of the cornerstones of the European social model."
"Confidence that health care can be provided is a precondition of the individual being able to operate properly in society."
"It provides security."
"Work therefore needs to be done on harmonising and improving the quality of the health care Europeans receive."
"The ageing of the population will create problems in relation to the national health systems’ capacity to secure access and quality in the future."
"In spite of their different healthcare arrangements, all the Member States face this problem."
"Modernisation is required."
"Resources within the health sector therefore need to be used better, but it is important for this not just to mean rationalisation and greater efficiency."
"We have to remember that prevention is the most effective form of health care."
"In the Europe of the future, health must not be seen as a cost but, rather, as facilitating a competitive economy."
"The mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy also emphasises the need for the social pillar."
"The social dimension is quite simply a necessity if Europe is to achieve growth and employment."
"If we are to go on securing a well-educated and skilful labour force, we must be able to offer effective and universal health care."
"The Member States must therefore become better at making use of the open coordination method and the opportunity it provides for exchanging good practice."
"More should also be done to improve our working environment so that we prevent accidents at work and work-related illnesses."
"An improved environment will generally also have a beneficial effect on general health and will thus make for healthier people, which will again release resources for health care."
"Health, growth and employment are inextricably linked."
"– Mr President, in order to guarantee social inclusion, we must ensure the existence of a public social security system founded on the principles of democracy, solidarity and universal access and a health care system that is similarly public and universal. These systems must operate on the basis of non-discrimination, benefiting people on low incomes, guaranteeing equal access for all to good quality public services and safeguarding human rights."
"We are therefore opposed to the proposals paving the way for the privatisation of public services in these essential areas. We object for example to the Bolkestein proposal for a directive intended to set up an internal market for services and to the proposal for a directive on certain aspects of the organisation of working time, which, by undermining health professionals’ working conditions, also jeopardises the health of people using the services in question."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having myself once drafted a report on this subject, I am of course particularly pleased by the considerable continuity that is still evident between Mr Cabrnoch’s report and our previous resolutions."
"For that, I would like to say how grateful I am to him."
"The Council’s eventual agreement, in October of last year, to the use of open coordination in health provision and the care of the elderly is another success chalked up by this House."
"I am confident that the PROGRESS programme, on which I am the rapporteur, will soon provide us with an instrument for organising the exchange of best practice, which is so urgently needed, and for pushing through a reciprocal and mutual process of learning from one another."
"At the end of the day, the Member States need to be helped to undertake reforms aimed at modernising and strengthening health systems, in which process particular importance must be attached to social cohesion and the principle of solidarity."
"If the Member States want to ensure, in future, continued universal access to their systems for health care and the care of the elderly, to guarantee their quality and secure their funding, what is needed above all is more prevention and greater transparency."
"Transparency is itself indispensable if quality is to be maintained and if the resources available to the healthcare systems are to be used in the best possible way."
"Assessing the quality of medical services must be made much easier; paying out large sums of money for poor-quality service must come to an end."
"Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and they must be more involved in future decisions on health policy."
"All the Member States wanted to go further by adopting a Patients’ Law or Patients’ Charter."
"They all also face major challenges where the care of the elderly and long-term care are concerned."
"We should join together in seeking strategies for improving the interaction between healthcare provision and treatment, in order to be able to improve care for patients in their homes and to provide sufficient care facilities."
"– Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report misleadingly entitled 'Modernising social protection and developing good quality healthcare', because it contains reactionary assessments and objectives for further promoting the commercialisation of healthcare, swelling the private business groups which control the healthcare sectors and drug production and increasing their profits."
"This has painful consequences for public health and leeches the income of the grass-roots."
"The patient is a customer."
"Basically, there is no health policy."
"Health and safety at work regulations are primitive."
"On an annual basis, 40% of healthcare services provided are covered by workers' wages."
"Health is increasingly being integrated into the more general anti-grass roots policy of the European Union."
"Responsibility for the protection of health is being individualised and the healthcare services market is being fully liberalised, following the sweeping changes in industrial relations and in social insurance, such as the organisation of working times, the increase in the retirement age, the reduction in pensions and so on. Healthcare should not be a commodity."
"It should be a free, quality service provided on an equal footing to everyone by the state alone."
"The pharmaceutical and biomedical technology sectors, production and marketing should belong to the state and should be controlled by society."
"Mr President, whilst I judge the general philosophy of this report positively, and whilst this text may be an acceptable foundation for upwards harmonisation of the rights of European citizens with regard to social protection linked to healthcare, it also presents some serious shortcomings."
"It remains too general, does not set any timetables, and is not sufficiently focused."
"Well, on this issue, incantations are not enough."
"Let us be ambitious for this social Europe every one of us wants to see, and let us take healthcare and social protection expenditure from the Stability and Growth Pact, as this expenditure does not represent costs; it is an investment that creates wealth and efficiency for society as a whole."
"Two significant matters absent from the report are the issue of financing a pioneering social protection system and mass unemployment in Europe."
"Both issues are of major importance."
"Without shared financing and without financial income contributions to the solidarity effort, it will be impossible to achieve the desired goal."
"With regard to unemployment, it is a long-lasting strain on the sum of revenues required to finance social protection and healthcare."
"By way of conclusion, let me add these two precise responses to the precise needs of the European people."
"In striving too hard to reach a limp consensus, which in the end leads to nothing, we are only intensifying Eurosceptism."
"."
"Honourable Members, this debate has demonstrated something that I believe will also become apparent from subsequent debates on health care, namely that this is a remarkably complex subject."
"In a certain sense it pushes us to our limits; after all, no one can fail to be moved by anguish, suffering and death, and these are all part and parcel of health care."
"It emerged clearly from the debate that the open method of coordination is regarded as a suitable way of coordinating health care systems in the European Union, and this is something I very much welcome. Speakers also warned that consideration must be given to questions of administrative and technical management whenever this method is used."
"This is undoubtedly true, and I have taken note of these warnings."
"I am no fan of collecting useless information and creating systems that are incapable of delivering results."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is no longer present in the Chamber, asked a question that I imagine relates to a specific incident."
"If I understood what was said correctly, the gist of what had happened was that someone had suffered health problems and was presumably treated in a clinic against his will, whereupon the clinic demanded payment for services that were not covered by his insurance."
"It is by no means the Commission’s intention that eventualities and instances of this kind should prove to be commonplace or likely, and I will look into this incident in order to obtain more detailed information on it."
"Once again, honourable Members, our debate has shown that this report is an extremely valuable document, and I should like to quote one last paragraph from it."
"According to paragraph 9, Parliament takes the view that the ageing of the population constitutes a challenge and should also be taken as an opportunity to involve people with long and valuable experience more closely in society and enterprises as a part of active ageing."
"I believe that this paragraph demonstrates that the report is both well thought-out and well-balanced."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0092/2005) by Mr Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 establishing a European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (COM(2004)0050 – C6 0014/2004 – 2004/0014(CNS))."
". Honourable Members, I should like to start by reminding the House that the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was established by the European Union in 1994, in order to respond to the growing need for information on how to prevent work-related accidents."
"The Agency’s mission is to improve people’s working lives and to foster the exchange of technical, scientific and economic information between all parties affected by issues relating to safety and health at work, whether these be Community bodies, Member States, employees, employers or safety engineers."
"In 2004, the Commission set out its proposals for amendments to the regulation establishing the Bilbao Agency, with the aim of responding to the needs of an enlarged European Union and streamlining the way in which the 78-member tripartite Administrative Board works."
"The new regulation formalises the role of the Bureau, as well as maintaining and strengthening the tripartite structure of the Administrative Board, which is made up of Commission representatives and representatives from the governments, from the Member States and from employer and employee organisations."
"The new proposal also reinforces the role of the social partners and strengthens the links between the Agency’s mission and the objectives of the Community strategy on health and safety at work, as well as underlining the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Parliament has proposed a number of amendments aimed at making the original proposal clearer and more precise, and has also put forward certain amendments proposed by the Council."
"The fact that amendments have been proposed to the way in which appointments are made to the Bilbao Agency did however come as something of a surprise to the Commission, as the implication is that the Commission should have closer control over the Agency."
"Ever since the latter was established, its Director has been appointed by the Administrative Board, on the basis of a recommendation from the Commission."
"Given that this is the procedure currently followed by the majority of agencies, it would be a pity if it were to be changed."
"I should like to thank the House for having given the draft regulation such a positive reception, and for the new provisions it has proposed with the aim of making it clearer and more precise."
"I thank you."
". Madam President, it is significant to me that tomorrow, the day we will vote on this report, is International Workers’ Memorial Day."
"That is the day that commemorates the 60 000 workers per year who die globally from job-related injuries or illnesses and the many millions more who are injured."
"For the European Union 15, the figures have been steadily improving over the last decade, but there is still nothing to be proud of."
"Some 4 500 workers die each year as a result of accidents at work and many more from work-related illnesses."
"Over four million still suffer significant injuries at work each year."
"This is the important backdrop to our debate today on the Bilbao Agency."
"As I have said, the figures for the EU 15 have improved over the last decade and I am convinced that the key health and safety directives that we have put in place, and the work of the Bilbao Agency itself, have made an important contribution to that improvement."
"As the Commissioner has said, we are discussing the review and updating of the regulation governing the operations of the Bilbao Agency."
"That review was called for in the original regulation."
"It is a little later than it might have been, but that is because there has been a full external evaluation and a full consultation of all stakeholders, which has informed the Commission’s proposal and indeed the recommendations from the Council."
"As the Commissioner has also said, the other imperative for change has been the enlargement of the European Union, which has meant an increase in the Board of the Agency from 48 to 78 and has therefore necessitated a streamlining of administrative and management processes."
"The amendments that we have proposed fall into four main categories."
"The first are intended to clarify the objectives and tasks of the Agency, improving the link with the priorities of the Community strategy, strengthening the Agency’s capacity for data analysis, focusing more on the needs of SMEs and providing accessible and comprehensible information to final users."
"Secondly, there are amendments intended to take account of the enlargement of the Union, clarify and improve the functioning of the Governing Board and strengthen its strategic role and the executive role of the Bureau."
"Thirdly, there are those intended to reinforce the role of the social partners in the Agency’s network in the Member States – a very important point – and those intended to reinforce cooperation with other Community bodies in the social policy area."
"We have also, of course, tabled amendments to try to ensure a proper gender balance in the management structures of the Agency."
"I shall pick out one or two of the more important ones."
"First, I would like to say that I am grateful to Giovanni Berlinguer and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an excellent opinion."
"I have taken up a number of their suggested amendments, for example Amendment 2, which underlines the need for the Agency not only to collect and disseminate information, but also to analyse that information, identify risks and good practices, and promote preventive action."
"It also underlines the role of the Agency as a risk observatory."
"Amendment 4 concerns gender balance and the governing and management structures of the Agency."
"Amendments 5, 6, 7 and 8 concern in different ways the added value the Agency should bring to the data it collects and collates through analysis, evaluation, identification of best practice and dissemination of that information and best practice to where it is most needed, particularly with small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Amendment 7 also underlines the need for the promotion of the harmonisation of statistics on work-related accidents and illnesses, a crucial point."
"A series of amendments then look at a number of technical and administrative matters concerning the composition of the board and Bureau and their respective roles and responsibilities, and the interrelationships between the two bodies."
"We think these amendments will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Agency."
"The final point is the one the Commissioner mentioned."
"That is Amendment 23, dealing with the appointment of the director."
"I know the Commission is not happy with it, but it reflects the procedure followed by the other agencies in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ remit."
"The Commissioner has also intervened recently in the appointment of directors at certain agencies."
"Therefore maybe the amendment better reflects current reality."
"In short, the report seeks to strengthen the role and function of the Agency, which has already done excellent work."
"I commend the report to the House."
". I agree with the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur and very much welcome the efforts of the Bilbao Agency."
"The rapporteur has cited some figures, but the reality is that a large number of work-related accidents and illnesses are preventable and that they particularly affect the most vulnerable people: immigrants, temporary workers, illegal workers and the unskilled."
"Furthermore, they affect people that receive less protection from trade unions, which do not reach large numbers of workers."
"I would add that there is some danger of the situation worsening, as a result of the political options presented to the European Union."
"If competition between countries, rather than encouraging safety and innovation, meant a relaxation of safety measures and an increase in working hours, that would increase the number of accidents and illnesses."
"If the Bolkestein Directive on services brought in social dumping by means of the country of origin rule, the number of accidents and illnesses would be compounded."
"There are important amendments in Mr Hughes’s proposal, above all the involvement of the social partners, that is to say the workers themselves, who are, on the one hand, the victims, and on the other, the proponents of safety and health in the workplace."
". I should like to start by expressing my admiration for the rapporteur’s work, and in particular for the fact that the correct procedures were followed when the report and the motion for a resolution were discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"As a new MEP and a representative of a new Member State, I find the very existence of the Bilbao Agency a matter for concern."
"I have yet to be fully convinced that there is any genuine and legitimate need for a separate EU body dedicated to the matter of health and safety at work, given that this is such a narrow, albeit important, field."
"I will continue to review the arguments that speak in favour of the existence of this institution, as well as any that suggest that it would be preferable for problems relating to health and safety at work to be tackled in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, or in other words at national level alone."
"As things stand, however, both the motion for a resolution that has been tabled and the rapporteur’s report serve to make the Agency’s work more transparent, and I can therefore endorse the motion for a resolution drafted by the rapporteur."
"I thank you."
". Madam President, I welcome the report on the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work and I congratulate the rapporteur on work well done."
"The key elements of this Agency are its research and distribution of best practice to Member States in relation to standards concerning health and safety at work."
"Legislation governing the health and safety of workers throughout the EU is a prime example of how the EU has made and can make a positive contribution to raising the quality of life for millions of the Union’s citizens."
"But legislation is just one part of the equation; enforcing that legislation is another."
"Health and safety in the workplace can only be maintained where adequate monitoring is conducted at workplace level."
"While I am not familiar with the situation in other European countries, I know that in Ireland we do not have an adequate number of inspectors and monitors to ensure the health and safety of our own workers."
"A notable case in Ireland recently has been the exposure of the Turkish multinational company Gama, which has deprived workers of earnings through paying substantially below the minimum wage and endangered their health and safety by requiring a substantial number of its workers to work up to 80 hours per week."
"This is extremely damaging to the health and safety of those workers."
"In the potentially dangerous construction industry, accidents are much more likely to occur when people are required to work such long hours."
"Of course, it is not just the company that has a responsibility."
"We have the legislation in Ireland, we have the minimum wage, but we are not properly enforcing that legislation."
"This is a high-profile case in Ireland at the moment, but there have been a number of cases in recent times where workers’ rights, particularly immigrant workers’ rights, have been trampled on."
"Turkey is currently applying for membership of the EU and I support that move, but part of that process will have to be a requirement that major companies like Gama respect and protect workers’ rights within the EU."
"I believe the onus is on the Turkish Government to ensure this happens."
"So, while we welcome this excellent report today, and indeed commend the work of the Agency, we all need to be vigilant in our own countries to ensure that workers’ rights are upheld."
"In particular, we need to be vigilant where workers are exposed to dangers and to risks and where they are less well represented by trade unions."
"What we are talking about here are immigrant workers, under-age workers, temporary workers, and so on."
"Finally, I wish to make a comment on Amendment 7, which underlines the need for reliable information and comparative data and the need for a systematic collection of data across the Member States in the field of health and safety at work, with the support of Eurostat."
"We need accurate information across all 25 Member States, collected in a uniform way, so that we have good-quality, reliable and relevant information to underpin all policy decisions."
". Madam President, this agency is an important EU institution; in the just over ten years that it has been operating in Bilbao, it has already had a tangible and beneficial influence on working conditions in Europe."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is right behind this report, and I wish to express my appreciation to Mr Hughes for drafting it."
"We see it as very important that the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao should, as far as possible, enjoy the same legal status as the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Thessaloniki, and that it should be equipped with a constantly improving range of instruments."
"Today, Europe needs these agencies’ input more than ever, for it is often apparent that two of Europe’s three pillars – the social and the environmental – are threatening to give way."
"Other speakers have already mentioned such things as the Bolkestein directive and REACH, and I realise how unstable a pillar social Europe rests upon when I hear employers heaping derision on the prospect of a directive on protection against optical radiation, which would lay down minimum standards for workers."
"Safety at work, the prevention of accidents and preventive health care must be treated as matters of high importance if workers are to be more than factors in capitalists’ production calculations."
"Fine-sounding declarations of principle are not enough; what is needed is research and instruments, developed by this agency in order that standards may be arrived at and legal measures drawn up, and in order that it may be possible to monitor whether the rules we lay down are actually adhered to."
"We in the Group of the Greens therefore expect the agency in Bilbao to be allocated the resources that it needs in order to do its job efficiently."
". Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Hughes for his report, and I would like to congratulate the Agency for the 13 per cent reduction in accidents in the workplace."
"However, I would like to mention the fact that the administrative board finds itself overburdened with the administration to the point that it cannot concentrate on strategic planning."
"This is a pity, because I would like it to strategically plan so as to be able to look at the workers that are not included in the Agency’s vigilance for health and safety."
"I refer to these as ‘home carers’, and will continue to do so for the rest of my time here."
"They make up the largest workforce in Europe; they often lift beyond their weight and work around the clock, year in and year out."
"There is nobody monitoring their health and safety."
"It can sometimes be quite ludicrous: as a home carer myself, for a short period of time I had someone sent in by the state to give me a few hours’ help a week."
"This helper could not lift, could not put his hand above his head, could not in fact do anything that a carer had to do."
"I had to let him go because there was no help he could give, all on the basis of health and safety."
"I, however, could do anything, no matter how dangerous, because I was a home carer."
"Madam President, I do not underestimate the importance of health and safety at all, but I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that European Union regulations are undermining personal responsibility and, in many cases, the application of common sense."
"We are now told, for example, that teachers must be protected from noisy children."
"Gliders are grounded because perfectly safe winches no longer meet new specifications."
"What business is it of this House to tell a builder that he must use scaffolding to refix a roof tile?"
"It really is about time that the people of Brussels discovered how irritating this interfering trivia could be."
"Surely the health and safety of lorry drivers requires a new regulation: to dig up all the cobble stoned streets of Brussels and replace them with concrete."
". Madam President, I wish to apologise for missing my slot earlier."
"I am afraid I ran out of my office with the wrong file under my arm and had to go back for the correct one."
"It happens to us all."
"I would like briefly to refer to Mr Mote’s comments: he might be a bit more sanguine about the health and safety regulations if he had once had to gather up the remains of an unfortunate worker who had slipped off a roof and ended up dead on the street below because there was no scaffolding available during his work, and had then to go to the family of that unfortunate man and explain why he was dead."
"There is nothing in the health and safety regulations that is an undue burden on business."
"After all, the human cost of the deaths on building sites – which are quite appalling – and the injuries – which are also quite appalling – cannot be measured by the inconvenience of having to put up a bit of scaffolding."
"I would like to address two points here."
"First and foremost I should like to thank Stephen Hughes for his report and indeed for seeking to raise the whole issue of gender balance in the boards of the Health and Safety Authority."
"I would also briefly like to mention Mrs Harkin’s European Foundation report, which unfortunately is not being debated in the House, but is being voted on tomorrow as well."
"That dealt with perhaps a much more complex problem because of the staffing situation there – it being a much older foundation."
"The Commission and the Council sought to change the status of the workers in that Foundation and we had to negotiate considerably to try and find a solution to that."
"While this Parliament is only consulted on this issue, I believe we have found good common ground between the staff of the Foundation, the management and indeed the Parliament here."
"I know that the Irish presidency initiated discussions on this during its time in office and it helped to encourage the Luxembourg presidency to take on board the recommendations that this Parliament is making."
"I hope that the report is adopted without difficulty here tomorrow."
". Honourable Members, the European Coal and Steel Community, which was the origin and starting point of the European Union, not only pursued the aim of economic integration, but also established a legal basis for measures relating to safety and health at work."
"The bulk of the European Union’s legislative activity in this field builds on this legal basis."
"Although we have undoubtedly made progress in this area, there can be no question of us ever ceasing in our efforts."
"The incidence of work-related accidents has fallen by 13%, yet the figure is still too high, and certain jobs are still unduly dangerous."
"I am delighted that the Bilbao Agency has received an overwhelmingly positive assessment, as this is a view I share."
"I expect tomorrow’s debate on the amendments that have been tabled to be brief and to have a positive outcome, as the individual amendments provide a logical and well-balanced response to the changes that have taken place."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0087/2005) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the current state of integration of EU financial markets (2005/2026(INI))."
". Madam President, I should like to start by apologising to my Dutch fellow MEPs for speaking, not in Dutch but in English, which is, after all, the language of the financial markets."
"There is also the added benefit that I can address the Commissioner in a language he understands."
"Madam President, when the Commissioner’s predecessor Mr Bolkestein started his term, he met with a well-prepared, ambitious set of proposals for the internal market for capital."
"He presented them in 1999 as the Financial Services Action Plan – FSAP."
"Commissioner, I have the impression that you are less fortunate with the heritage concerning the internal market for services that Mr Bolkestein left for you when you came here to Brussels, and which carries his name, or perhaps an ominous nickname."
"But that is not our subject for today; we will have plenty of time to discuss this further."
"I would like to praise Mr Bolkestein for having diligently steered the FSAP through during his term in office."
"Commissioner, I am very much looking forward to the follow-up plan in the Green Paper that you are to present next week."
"In the report before you and in the debates that we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we take a positive view of the way the FSAP has been dealt with, but of course we are aware that many of the intentions laid down in the rules still have to be proven in practice."
"Major attention should be focused on the implementation and enforcement of the almost 40 sets of rules that have been adopted."
"Unfortunately, there were some misunderstandings about my report in the form in which it has been presented to the plenary today."
"Although a broad consensus was reached in committee and we had good compromises, some imperfections slipped in during the committee vote."
"Since they concern the main thrust of the report, I would like to discuss them first."
"The most annoying mistake is paragraph 2 of the text before the House today."
"It suggests that we should go along with the plea of some lobbyists and journalists that Brussels legislators should commit themselves to a regulatory pause."
"But that is really not my cup of tea."
"This paragraph 2 absolutely does not fit into a report that points to so many developments in a dynamic financial market that may pose serious systemic risks and endanger a safe and efficient internal market for financial services."
"Therefore, I am clearly against tying our hands with a moratorium on legislation."
"We should stay alert and the Commission should be very proactive."
"Of course, this new legislation should be thoroughly assessed as to its necessity, its costs and benefits and its wider impact, but less regulation is not always better regulation."
"Let me turn to some other elements of the report, such as the Lamfalussy Process."
"With the well-known disclaimers that you are used to from the European Parliament, the report is quite positive about the Lamfalussy Process."
"I tend to see the Level Three Committees of regulators in particular as allies for the public interest and the protection of consumers and expert users."
"I note that they are more and more aware of their important role in harmonising the technical rules and the supervisory practices between regulators in different Member States."
"The Himalaya report presented by CESR asks for an improved toolbox."
"We say in the report before the House today that this is a good starting point for further debate."
"Some important issues have to be resolved in the coming period."
"Then there is European-level supervision."
"In the report we speak positively about a move towards consolidating supervisors."
"The industry wants to reduce the need to comply with many different supervisors, but on the other hand I can understand the hesitation of regulatory authorities in host situations to give up their competences and to rely completely on foreign supervisors."
"That is why I insist on taking a further step."
"Seeing the growth in cross border activity and the concentration of large players in the financial markets, it is time for integrated supervision at European level, possibly via a two-tier system with European-level supervision for large cross-border players without prejudice to the level playing field between cross-border and local players."
"Not everyone agrees with me on this, but at least in the report we agree that this should be an option that the Commission should also consider further."
"Then there is the issue of consumer protection and involvement."
"Here we stress that the protection of consumers and the guaranteed availability of basic financial services to all consumers should remain a basic condition."
"I do not think that we should aim at complete harmonisation in relation to retail financial products and service provision, because consumer protection is too different in the various Member States."
"In the report I propose looking at the option of a 26th regime for pan-European financial products, such as mortgages or insurance products."
"They may meet the needs of internationally mobile people to work with the providers they are used to in another Member State."
"Mrs Berès, the chairwoman of our committee, will speak on the issue of better cooperation in a global setting."
". Madam President, it is already clear the coming five years will be extremely challenging in this particular area."
"The smooth functioning of financial markets is essential and has a huge influence on the prosperity of each and every one of us."
"Financial investments underpin jobs and growth; the value of our savings; our pensions; the cost of our mortgages."
"Deep, liquid, dynamic European financial markets will ensure the most efficient allocation and provision of capital and services throughout the European economy, and beyond, in the global capital market."
"In the last six years we have seen major progress."
"Most of the necessary rules outlined in the Financial Services Action Plan have been agreed on time and are now being put in place."
"European decision-making and regulatory structures have become more rational and efficient."
"Continued systematic cooperation has developed between the European institutions and market participants."
"All institutions and a very large majority of the market participants agree we need to continue our efforts, because our job to integrate the European financial markets is far from finished."
"Our key priority for the next 12 months is to complete unfinished business in the area of financial services."
"We still need to deal with the remaining elements in the negotiation phase before this House and the Council, as well as the key measures now under preparation by the Commission."
"For example, we still need to allow more risk-sensitivity in the capital requirements for banks and investment firms (Basel II); strengthen statutory audit (the eighth Company Law Directive); fight money laundering and terrorist finance; cut down the costs for clearing and settlement; establish a European framework for reinsurance; modernise rules on insurance solvency; and create a European legal framework for payments."
"In other words, the regulatory measures currently under preparation are already extremely demanding for all of us."
"However, I am confident we can achieve a lot in the coming year."
"In the area of financial services, the Commission commends the good work done in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs over the last years, and, more particularly, the report we are discussing today."
"There is a considerable degree of convergence between our own thinking and the thinking in the European Parliament."
"Many of the main themes included in the report presented today by Mrs Van den Burg on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will also be reflected in the Commission’s Green Paper on its future financial services policy."
"We address similar priorities."
"In a way there is no surprise there, as we have both been very transparent in our approach and preparatory work."
"I do not wish to dwell on all the recommendations set out in the report, but let me highlight some which I believe are particularly important."
"Firstly, there is a clear need to coordinate transposition by the Member States, strengthen enforcement and increase supervisory convergence."
"I broadly endorse the views expressed in the report."
"Particularly, I think paragraph 14 gives the right nuance as some form of integrated supervision will only be beneficial if regulation is no longer fragmented."
"Convergence will not occur if an integrated supervisor still needs to interpret and apply 25 different sets of regulations."
"Therefore, the Commission endorses a step-by-step approach, building on the European regulatory and supervisory committees in the area of financial services."
"Secondly, the better regulation agenda is important."
"The Commission agrees that future measures must be targeted and evidence based; impact assessments will be thoroughly applied."
"Basic pan-European framework rules are needed so that businesses can develop European strategies and consumers can benefit from enhanced integration without artificial barriers."
"However, overlapping, contradictory and duplicative requirements create a burden and must therefore be withdrawn."
"Thirdly, effective consultation is key."
"We all have listened very carefully to all different stakeholders: industry, large and small; regulators; supervisors; investors; workers and consumers."
"We have taken their constructive ideas on board and we have listened to each other."
"There is broad support for our common approach; a degree of consensus which is so crucial at the start of a new phase."
"I personally hope this convergence of thinking, the good contacts established and the open way of policy-making will guarantee a swift launch for our policy programme of ‘consolidation’ for the next five years."
"Effective delivery of our common programme must be mandate of the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"This week’s adoption of Mrs Van den Burg’s report will therefore be an important step forward."
". Madam President, I should like very sincerely to thank and congratulate Mrs van den Burg on her report."
"I thought we worked well as a committee to reach a reasonable and balanced template for the future of Europe’s financial markets."
"The industry and all three European institutions have undergone a stressful five years of legislation in this area, and the most stressful stage, for the industry at least, is probably still to come."
"The result is certainly not perfect, and it certainly does not please everyone."
"However, in our Group we are all agreed that breathing space is now required to see these 40-plus directives properly implemented by transposition into national legislation, and to build up experience of their operation."
"Furthermore, the industry needs time to digest these often substantial changes to its ways of doing business."
"This will inevitably take time: it would be foolhardy to rush into further changes until we see how these work out in practice."
"After completion of the few remaining Financial Services Action Plan matters, there may be one or two other areas which need legislation – asset management may be one."
"Nevertheless, the Commission and this House need to be very careful that any such legislation really is necessary, justified by cost analysis and can be delivered usefully."
"Whenever possible, non-legislative improvements would be our preferred route."
"The Lamfalussy process has a key role in ensuring that the FSAP legislation works for the benefit of both financial services companies and their customers."
"It is vital that transposition be implemented on-schedule and accurately, and we will expect the Commission to keep an eagle eye on this, because we will be keeping our eagle eye on the Commission."
"We will not hesitate to use our rights of challenge under the Lamfalussy process if we see the need."
"We have made major strides towards an integrated European financial services market."
"In time this will be of great benefit to our economic prospects by providing the competitive capital market that Europe needs and which we are striving to achieve."
"There are not many other projects that will contribute as much towards achieving the Lisbon goals."
"It is now our duty to see that these matters are honed and perfected as they come into operation."
"It is now our duty, the duty of the Commission and the duty of the Member States to see that the financial services industry is given our full support in providing the essential ingredients of a successful European economy."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we find ourselves at a gathering which, I believe, we must also examine in the light of our global strategy: the Lisbon Strategy."
"In reality, if we want this strategy to succeed, we require financial markets capable of financing the needs of our economies."
"That is the challenge we face; that is why, for the past five years, we have been striving to implement this Financial Services Action Plan; and that is why we believe we must go forward."
"Many have said it and many continue to say it: we require a break in legislation."
"Commissioner, I am aware of your attachment to this undertaking."
"Everyone agrees, however, that there are two or three issues that we will obviously need to take further. Amongst these issues, I note that Mr Purvis has just raised that of asset management."
"Allow me to mention two others with which you are well acquainted."
"First, the issue of the database and all the difficulties that lie in implementing a genuine database that respects consumers’ rights; that is one of the key elements if we want to see our efforts in this area crowned with success."
"After having legislated on investments, there then comes the issue of the post-market situation, which, I imagine, will keep us extremely busy in the coming months."
"That said, I should like to make two observations."
"The first concerns the rights of this Parliament."
"We have accepted the Lamfalussy Process."
"Should this Parliament have a call-back right, we will require measures for implementing this right at level 2."
"In addition, we will need to monitor movements at level 3 because we are well aware that the situation could go adrift at that level, something we will need to be able to denounce when it occurs, if that proves necessary."
"I should like to say a word about the situation of the regulators, as this is a debate that we have not resolved entirely within our Committee."
"We are on track, picking up with the Himalaya Report."
"I should, however, like to point out to you what we learnt when we officially met the CESR and its officials for the first time, in Paris."
"They told us very clearly that if we want a regulation to be implemented on a European scale, it will take more than benchmarking between national authorities, as the effect of this alone will not produce a sufficient level of harmonisation between the powers of different national regulators during the step-by-step process we are in."
"That is an element that we must take into consideration."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, the measures contained in the financial services plan have already been implemented, or are well on the way to being so."
"So far as one can tell from today’s standpoint, the financial services plan can be described as a success."
"The question now arises of whether it needs to be followed by a successor, a ‘Post-FSAP’, in other words."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has considered this issue in an own-initiative report."
"It is vitally important that this House should make its opinion known at this early stage."
"The European internal market in financial services is still a long way from being complete, lagging well behind the internal market in goods."
"What we do know is that it is particularly in the retail markets that much more remains to be done, while the question has been repeatedly raised as to whether the financial services industry might not be entitled to a break from regulation after making such efforts."
"It is also raised in the own-initiative report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, although the rapporteur has today answered it firmly in the negative."
"The text agreed on by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is largely balanced, and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports it."
"I have, though, critical comments to make on two aspects of it."
"The first is that although the work of CESR is, in wide-ranging fields, doubtless something to be welcomed, it must comply with clearly-defined ground rules."
"There must be better consultation and interaction between CESR and the democratically-elected European Parliament; as its decisions have a considerable impact, the relationship with Parliament, which should be consulted in good time, should be a close one."
"Secondly, although the big banks are making the case for deliberate and far-reaching harmonisation, it still needs to be clarified to what extent this applies to all sectors of the financial services industry."
"The Commission should give some thought to this."
"In this connection, the Liberals and Democrats support the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which is open to various interpretations."
"Overall, we can endorse most of the rapporteur’s amendments, and I extend warm thanks to Mrs van den Burg for the work she has put in."
". Madam President, ‘transparency’ is a much-used word in Mrs van den Burg’s report, but there is nothing transparent about the great jumble of committees and processes that she also describes."
"First, a committee of wise men was set up on the regulation of European securities markets."
"What wisdom did it bestow?"
"A four-level regulatory approach and the creation of two more committees!"
"Then the Commission appointed four expert groups to mark the first step in the action plan review process."
"That was in October 2003, long before all of the action plan had even been implemented."
"If that were not enough, there was input from a monitoring group and four other committees."
"Who said ‘when in doubt, hold a committee meeting’?"
"Only a report from an EU institution could say with such a straight face that this is a powerful recipe for success, at least in terms of delivering legislation."
"The EU is very good at churning out laws: is transparently obvious."
"However, I have a warning for ordinary people out there in the real world, like those in our visitors’ gallery: it is transparent to me that more regulation is coming, thus there will be more laws to break; there will be more interference in pensions and insurance matters; more European-level supervisory bodies that will override national ones; and more back doors through which the EU intends to interfere in national taxation policy."
"The report notes the existence of overlapping directives that might lead to contradictory and duplicate requirements."
"In the real world, this would be seen as a work of fiction, not a serious proposition."
"So, the EU confuses itself, but in the confusion, I should like to repeat one transparent certainty: if the EU is the answer, it must have been a very silly question."
"A few years ago, American financier George Soros deplored the billion-dollar losses of his companies carrying out financial operations, and urged the governments of the most powerful countries of the world to address the organisation and the introduction of clear rules and order in the world financial markets."
"Operations on the world financial markets and, in particular, trade in derivatives recorded a literally explosive growth in recent years."
"Their volumes and growth of dynamics exceed many times those of classical financial operations involving real production, services and consumption of products."
"Any fluctuation in or, at worst, a collapse of even one part of these markets may have serious consequences for the world economy, not to speak of the fact that every negative development on financial markets has repercussions for personal finances and fates of ordinary citizens."
"In this regard, I appreciate the presented material and good work of rapporteur Ieke van den Burg as another contribution to devising a conceptual solution in this field not only within the European Union, but with the ambition of an intercontinental approach."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her constructive and good cooperation."
"She has produced a balanced text that takes a look at the European internal financial market – to which, over recent years, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has devoted a great deal of attention – and, while doing a good job of analysing our present situation, also looks towards the future."
"To be sure, having had a great deluge of legislation, we must now consolidate; we must ensure not only that it is properly implemented, but also that we learn from our initial experience with it, and that we tackle the next legislative project piece by piece rather than with gusto, as we did before."
"We should also – contrary to what certain participants in the European market would like us to do – handle the topic of maximum harmonisation with a great deal of care."
"I can imagine those who currently write to us demanding maximum harmonisation in consumer protection matters saying – yet again – that we are taking harmonisation too far with the Consumer Credit Directive; that is why they should be very careful when calling for such a thing."
"This House has, for some time, been quite clear about where it stands on CESR; although we are in favour of the Lamfalussy procedure, we want transparency and participation, and there is a very, very great deal of room for more of that in CESR."
"Our expectation is that what happened with ‘Clearing and Settlement’ will not be allowed to recur."
"I also call on Commissioner McCreevy to apply the same sensitivity to pressing for international standards in a field in which international bodies keep introducing more and more standards for large companies, which are then applied by small and medium-sized enterprises as well."
"This is where democratic control is called for, and this is where the Commission and Parliament must join together in developing the institutions for this purpose."
"Let me end with a comment on European supervision."
"I regard the approach taken by ‘Basel 2’ – that of approaching this with very great care – to be the right one for a draft."
"We should take care not to be too hasty in creating a Europe-wide level playing field, thereby ignoring the regional and national level playing fields that we already have."
"The one must not wreck the other."
"That is why I favour a bottom up approach, so that, while focusing on European regulation and supervision, we build them up slowly, starting from the bottom."
"That this should be enforced from the top down is intolerable."
"– Madam President, the creation of a single market for the financial services sector is a key factor in completing the internal market and in fostering further economic and social development in Europe."
"In this context, the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP), adopted in 1999 and strengthened at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, is an indispensable tool."
"It is now universally acknowledged that the FSAP has been a success, given that 39 of the 42 legislative measures have been adopted."
"It is premature, however, to issue a definitive verdict, because many of these measures have yet to be implemented."
"Efforts must now, therefore, be channelled into ensuring that the necessary implementing measures are transposed into national law, and, in particular, that the operation is monitored, transparently and effectively, for a certain amount of time."
"Monitoring the FSAP will enable us to gauge the impact of the legislation on the smooth running of European financial markets and on the development of promotional, supervisory and anti-discriminatory measures. Monitoring of this kind should be an urgent priority for the Commission and the Member States."
"Among the various points raised by the rapporteur, in compliance with the proposed guidelines, I should like to highlight, if I may, in view of its major importance, the call for the Member Sates to transpose, quickly and effectively, the directive on Occupational Retirement Provision, so as to increase the opportunities and alternatives for savers and offer them the best possible return on their investments."
"The overriding message of this report is that the Member States must adopt ‘the principles of better regulation’, opportunely adopted by the Commission, and that there must be greater convergence of national supervision practices relating to the measures incorporated in the FSAP."
"I also wish to highlight the point that any future legislative measures aimed at remedying market failures must include a cost-benefit analysis of implementing them, in comparison with not implementing them."
"Mrs Van den Burg’s report addresses the whole question of financial services sensibly, coherently and intelligently and I therefore feel that Parliament should support it."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"While talking about the integration of financial markets, we have to consider several aspects."
"Firstly, the recommendations of Parliament concerning improvement of these market activities are important not only for professionals, but also for every citizen of the European Union, and we often forget that."
"In one way or another, by obtaining insurance policies or using bank services, we all participate in the financial market."
"In addition, to take account of the investments into the market of the pension funds would lead us to understanding that lately the quality of life is increasingly dependent on the activity of the financial market; in case of disorderly performance of at least one institution, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of citizens can suffer losses."
"However, effective management of the financial market cannot be achieved by implementing a particular regulation, since I can tell you from the experience in my country that such administration is costly, hard to implement, and, after all, does not protect investors and merely restricts market development."
"Secondly, we cannot expect progress within the European single market if the national legislation differs."
"We have to provide conditions for the inflow of capital to the European market from different countries of the world, and this capital cannot come because of the national barriers in the European financial market."
"Therefore, great attention has to be paid to the national legislation that has an impact on the financial markets; also activities of various working groups have to be encouraged."
"Thirdly, current regulation of the financial market lacks completeness and is fragmentary, and I do not approve the suggestion to stop adoption of new legislation regulating the activity of the financial market."
"I think it is important to replace fragmentary laws with all-inclusive and well-drafted directives."
"Otherwise, local institutions will initiate those legal acts, as it happens in the case of clearing and settlement."
"Therefore, we have to create favourable conditions in Europe not only for big players, but also leave some room for the activities of national businesses (small companies) and individual citizens at the national level."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I wish to make a few comments on the resolution before us."
"There has been a very great deal of legislative activity in recent years – in my view, almost too much."
"I should like to say that the costs to the financial sector of transposing all these new laws is quite high and is growing."
"Just introducing the whole of the Basel II Directive is costing the banks a very great deal of money."
"I therefore wish to limit legislative ambitions in future and slow down the process to some extent."
"For example, I welcome the fact that we did not come up with legislative proposals in the area of clearing and settlement. Competition should be allowed to operate."
"There is no risk of monopoly. Technical development is taking place so quickly that competition from new players is breaking down the old monopolies."
"One area in which I definitely do not want to see new legislation is that of corporate governance or the way in which companies are run."
"Allow the market to be self-regulating in this area."
"If Germany wants its own rules for corporate governance, it should be allowed to have them. If Britain wants its own rules, it too must have them."
"The financial market will in time decide which system inspires greatest confidence."
"It will attract investors’ interest."
"I believe in institutional competition."
"There should be no devising of a common code, regulated by some directorate of the European Commission."
"Too much legislation will lead to rigidity in the system."
"What has once become law becomes almost impossible to change."
"There is a great risk of our obtaining a financial market full of legal disputes, proceedings, advisory court judgments and yet more legislative measures to plug the gaps in the legislation."
"The terms harmonisation and level playing field have been the gateway to a suffocatingly legalistic system."
"Scope should be provided for the mutual recognition of each others’ systems."
"Responsibility for supervising the financial market should not fall mainly to the EU. Instead, better cooperation between the local, national supervisory bodies is needed."
"I do not wish to see a new super-finance inspectorate in the EU."
"Mr President, past years have seen a relatively large number of middle class people falling for the attractions of financial instruments, the use of which was formerly reserved for a very small elite."
"People believed they could increase their own wealth quite quickly, only to wake up filled with utter bitterness."
"I have two suggestions to make. Here is the first."
"Is it not possible that the EU institutions might explain to the European public, in very comprehensible terms, precisely what, in the way of such instruments, is currently available, at the same time assessing the risks involved in them?"
"Secondly, can we not follow the example of the USA, which is now, at least, bringing transparency and a whiff of control into the world of hedge funds?"
"Europe is in urgent need of it."
"Hedge funds are the ones that pull out the lot, the ones whose enormous leverage can achieve some massive dividends, but also massive losses, and which, in fact, over and over again, move the whole of Europe’s economic structure in their direction."
"That, I think, is something we should tackle as a matter of priority."
"Mr President, this report on the Financial Services Action Plan comes at an important time for the integration of financial markets in Europe."
"As you have heard, Parliament is unanimous on this issue and the vote in committee was almost unanimous."
"The past few years have been marked by much law-making."
"There are clear indications that markets now need time to digest what has been decided."
"As legislators, we should be extremely sensitive to this concern and focus our efforts on what is essential and beneficial."
"For its part, I hope the Commission assumes a twofold strategy."
"First, in its capacity as a prime mover of Community legislation, it is vital that the Commission concentrates on non-legislative means to carry out measures in the financial markets wherever possible."
"Apart from legislation currently under way, rigid laws should be considered only when absolutely necessary, i.e. after a comprehensive impact analysis shows that the intended objectives cannot be achieved through non-legislative means."
"This approach should take due account of evolving market practices and the principle of subsidiarity."
"Secondly, in its role as EU executive, the Commission should take a rigorous approach to enforcement."
"Thirty-nine out of the 42 FSAP measures have been adopted."
"However, many implementing measures have not, and transposition into national law is only beginning."
"The Commission should start a benchmarking review of implementation in the Member States with the aim of completing the EU financial architecture as agreed."
"The pace of integration in the financial markets has been far better than in many other areas."
"Much of this is due to the expediency and flexibility inherent in the Lamfalussy Process."
"As we move beyond the FSAP, however, the process itself should take into account the new environment in order to ensure that the appropriate balance of legislative and horizontal measures, structures of transparency, parliamentary control and stakeholder consultation improves further."
"For instance, structured dialogue between the EU and the US and other global capital markets could thus be better fed into the process, thereby strengthening both the European financial playing field as well as these relationships."
"As for the convergence between supervisory practices, we need to be realistic."
"The report before you sets out a useful strategy for creating lead supervisory practices in the EU."
"With a longer term perspective, provided that the parliamentary accountability of any new body thus created is guaranteed, we can see the benefits of moving towards a more uniform supervisory regime for financial markets."
"One possible option is a 26th European regime for supervision of global actors."
"All these options should be left open and used if the Commission thinks it is necessary."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that we believe that both the services directive and the internal market in finance are safe in the Commissioner’s hands, thanks to the good cooperation between the Commission and this House."
"Let me say, secondly, that the action plan for financial services in the period up to 2005 is a success; with 39 out of 42 measures already having been adopted, it is a success on the road that leads to the internal financial market, and it is successful as a result of the work Parliament has done."
"Necessary although these measures are, there are too many people who regard the great number of new and necessary regulations as excessive."
"They are wrong to do so, for the package of measures needs to be implemented in a very short space of time, and the internal market is not yet complete."
"So let us consolidate instead of over-regulating, and implement instead of making excessive demands."
"When, moreover, we assess the way we implement these regulations, we have to ask ourselves three questions."
"What added value has the European Action Plan provided for the European Union?"
"What problems have become apparent?"
"What action do we need to take?"
"The answers to the last question are obvious: as yet, not all the Member States of the European Union have the euro as their common currency; that weakens the internal market."
"Fiscal policy is dealt with at the national level and requires unanimity; that weakens the internal market."
"Cross-border payment transfers are not yet fully developed."
"Basel 2 is not yet in force, and ‘Clearing and Settlement’ is waiting to come in."
"Our problem is supervising the national supervisory authorities and getting them to cooperate with us."
"Although we are in favour of Lamfalussy, it must not be allowed to result in a loss of democratic control, of democratic legitimacy and of clarity in the reaching of decisions and the formation of opinion."
"The time for action to be taken is dependent on when we will have completed implementation and know precisely what steps we next have to take together."
". Mr President, as I indicated earlier, this report marks the start of a new era in financial services."
"I thank Mrs van den Burg for her very stimulating report and the considerable effort that has gone into producing it."
"Based on this report and our consultation with other stakeholders, next week, on 3 May, I intend to present to the College of Commissioners a Green Paper on financial services policy for the next five years."
"I will present this paper to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in more detail on 9 May."
"The Commission’s Green Paper will be open for public consultation until 1 August."
"Our final policy conclusions, deriving from all this work, are planned for the end of this year."
"A number of issues were raised and I will try to respond to some of them."
"Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Kauppi referred to the ‘Himalaya’ report."
"The Commission thinks integration needs to be accompanied by matching supervisory structures: the more integrated the markets, the more integrated and convergent the supervisory structures must also be."
"For the time being, I consider the Lamfalussy structures to be sufficient, but they need to be closely and continuously monitored and adapted, or further developed if needed."
"Only after careful assessment might future initiatives be necessary, with strict application of the subsidiarity principle."
"A number of speakers, including Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Kauppi, mentioned the so-called 26th regime."
"That regime may sound attractive in its simplicity, but in practice it will require some degree of harmonisation across the board, whether legal or in terms of tax, language, etc. The benefits of those 26th regime schemes remain to be proven, and reaching an agreement on optional European standards designed for only certain products will be difficult."
"However, I take note of the current debate and will respond to the call to explore such 26th regime schemes further, as explicitly expressed in the van den Burg report."
"Both Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Berès mentioned retail markets."
"We agree that there are important barriers to integration of retail financial services markets."
"The integration of retail markets is complex and demanding."
"However, this should not be the conclusion but our starting point."
"Product characteristics, distribution systems, consumer protection, contract law, differences in consumption, culture or other economic or structural realities play a prominent role in the retail area and create considerable complexity for cross-border supply and demand."
"These barriers, however, have their origin in the fragmentation of the European market for historic reasons."
"The Commission does not accept the argument that, as European integration increases, this fragmentation is there to stay."
"In ten years from now, the retail market will look completely different to the market of today."
"Our role is to anticipate and facilitate this development and not shy away from new initiatives."
"Mr Purvis and Mrs Berès raised the question of asset management."
"We will look to act only after the issues have been identified and potential solutions found."
"Where objectives can be achieved by non-legislative action, we will obviously choose this route."
"We might also need to address this question of legislative changes if they present the only way to secure single market freedoms in the area of investment funds."
"Mr Radwan raised a number of issues, including one on the standards issued on clearing and settlement."
"I must point out that the Commission is not bound in any way by the ESCB CESR standards, and any policy decisions which might be enshrined in a future directive on clearing and settlement will take precedence over the ESCB CESR standards."
"Mr Radwan also raised the question of the democratic governance and political accountability of rule-setters."
"Last week I was in the United States."
"You will note that we are working hard to influence the reform process under way within the International Accounting Standards Board."
"We are looking carefully at the arrangements proposed for the International Accounting and Auditing Standards Board, which will elaborate national standards and auditing."
"During that recent visit to the United States, we made good progress in some of these areas."
"Mr Wohlin raised the question of the new framework for capital requirements."
"They offer a range of approaches."
"For those banks moving to the simplest approaches, the changes from the existing standards of Basel I are not huge, so the costs of implementation are reasonably small."
"Banks moving to more sophisticated approaches will have to spend more, but they will do so only if this is a sensible business decision and the benefits will outweigh the costs."
"Members raised other points, which I hope will be taken up in the time ahead."
"In conclusion, I refer to what I said earlier: there is a considerable degree of convergence between the thinking in the European Parliament, the Council, industry, consumers and the Commission."
"I am convinced the coming five years will be extremely challenging."
"As the foundations for good collaboration between the institutions have been laid, I am sure we will be successful."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0065/2005) by Henrik Lax, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as regards the reciprocity mechanism (COM(2004)0437 – C6-0097/2004 – 2004/0141(CNS))."
". Mr President, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur for his report and for his overall support for the Commission’s proposal."
"The origins of this proposal relate to a two-fold observation. On the one hand, reciprocity is an essential principle when considering visas."
"On the other hand, the mechanism laid down in Regulation 539/2001 to ensure respect for reciprocity is unsuitable, essentially on account of its inflexible and automatic nature. As a result, the mechanism has not been used in more than three years, in fact not since the Regulation entered into force, even though situations of non-reciprocity continued with regard to old Member States and the number of cases of non-reciprocity increased at a remarkable rate with the arrival of the new Member States."
"The Commission has therefore proposed a more flexible and more realistic mechanism, which is more credible and effective as a consequence."
"Every situation of non-reciprocity will be the subject of notification."
"The Commission will play an active role with regard to third countries that enforce visa requirements."
"It will draft a report to Council on the situation of non-reciprocity thus created and, if necessary, it will propose the reintroduction of the visa requirement for citizens of the third countries concerned."
"The amendments proposed by Mr Lax pursue three different objectives."
"The first objective is to extend the mechanism to a set of situations that do not exclusively relate to visa exemptions, but also to the conditions for issuing visas."
"This extension stumbles at the obstacle of the Regulation’s legal basis."
"Furthermore, in seeking to incorporate a whole series of issues which are in reality of lesser importance, it runs the risk of weakening the reciprocity mechanism, which must remain focused on an essential issue, identified as such by the citizens, namely the continued visa requirement by third countries that are themselves exempt from this requirement by our Member States."
"The Hague Programme confirms that therein lies an issue to be resolved as a matter of priority."
"The second objective is to prevent situations of non-reciprocity from continuing indefinitely, and to include the possibility of reacting by means of measures in the field of external relations."
"I am anxious to point out to the rapporteur that I share the general approach of this amendment and I must also tell you that the political orientation that emerged at the JAI Council of 24 February takes the same line."
"I cannot, however, accept the binding of the Commission’s power of initiative as far as proposing provisional measures is concerned, nor, for reasons of legal basis, the extending of the Commission’s right of initiative within the present contexts to proposals for measures relating to areas other than that of visa policy."
"Finally comes the third objective: to include the European Parliament in every stage of the process."
"The necessary transparency must of course be ensured, but the reciprocity mechanism must remain a flexible instrument which can be accessed quickly, and which – and this is the key point – must allow provisional measures."
"The temporary restoration of the visa requirement for third countries is, in actual fact, situated in a plan other than the transfer of a third country to a list of countries subject to the visa requirement, which is annexed to Regulation 539/2001."
"A transfer of this type consists of an amendment to the Regulation and as such, it is of course decided by the Council, upon consultation of the European Parliament."
"Finally, with a strengthened reciprocity mechanism, the Commission will be equipped to respond to the formal invitation of the European Council of 4-5 November: to continue with our efforts to ensure that, as soon as possible, citizens of every Member State can travel without a visa, for short journeys, to all of the countries whose citizens undertake visa-free travel within the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"As we have just heard, enlargement of the European Union has highlighted the issue of the EU’s visa policy in a new way."
"Citizens of quite a few of the new Member States require visas to travel to the United States, in spite of the fact that American citizens do not need visas to travel to the new Member States."
"In these cases, there is a breach of reciprocity between the countries."
"It is easy to understand why people assume that the EU should make vigorous efforts to promote freedom of movement, especially since visa policy is harmonised and falls completely within the Commission’s area of competence."
"The Commission should therefore act as an ice-breaker."
"A few months ago, Poland’s former President, Lech Walesa, spent the night in a tent outside the White House in Washington in protest against the American visa requirement – a good example of just how loaded the issue is."
"The EU has a weapon for cases such as this, namely the reciprocity mechanism."
"For example, Poland and Greece can issue a notification to the Commission to the effect that, in their cases, reciprocity is not being respected by the United States."
"Finland can do the same in connection with Venezuela, etc. A notification should lead to the whole of the EU introducing a visa requirement for citizens of the third country concerned, but the mechanism has not been used even once because the consequences have been regarded as too far-reaching and difficult to deal with."
"My report, which has been approved by the committee responsible, proposes that the Commission should have a wider range of tools at its disposal."
"The EU should have recourse to other sanctions and not just automatically introduce a visa requirement."
"The report gives the individual Member States three months – a longer period than that proposed by the Commission – in which to negotiate with the third country."
"Moreover, I propose more stringency once the Commission has taken over the matter."
"It must not be possible to delay decisions concerning sanctions."
"Citizens of the Member State concerned must have a guarantee that their cases will be referred to the highest level and that this will result in a decision."
"A very broad majority of the committee was in favour of this policy."
"A number of MEPs preferred the present mechanism, however, and considered that it would make for a better result."
"I myself believe that the report’s recommendations will lead to greater efficiency and better results, strengthen the Commission’s negotiating position in respect of third countries and, through the European Parliament’s involvement, give people more insight into the process."
"The report also has a new element, and one that I believe the Commission and the Council should ponder carefully."
"There are countless cases, mainly at the EU’s eastern border, in which a third country has, with very little warning, tightened up the conditions for issuing visas."
"There are examples of travellers being required to have travel insurances with only Russian insurance companies."
"Lithuanian motorists have been required to have special motor insurances in order to be able to drive over to Kaliningrad, and they have had to register with the local authorities within three days."
"In the same week that a shipping company was to begin operating ferries to Saint Petersburg, the visa rules were altered, with the result that the shipping company had to withdraw the service."
"Our students at Russian universities are not automatically given a visa for a year, and anyone who has his or her visa stolen ends up on an exorbitantly expensive bureaucratic merry-go-round."
"To give just one example: even small children have to present the results of an HIV test in order to obtain a Russian long-term visa."
"From a Brussels perspective, these issues may appear trivial, but they cause a lot of inconvenience and financial losses for those affected."
"A very large majority of the committee believed that the Member States should be able to refer such cases to the Commission if the requirements introduced led to substantial limitations upon people’s opportunities to travel."
"In actual fact, these cases almost always involve a lack of reciprocity."
"Because the EU has to operate in the interests of our citizens, it is, as Commissioner Frattini asserts, extremely important that these problems be taken seriously, even though they may appear less serious than the main issue of whether or not there is a visa requirement."
"When Parliament – presumably with a clear majority – now approves the report, this will be a clear signal to the Commission and the Council of Ministers to begin outlining a mechanism that takes account of people’s everyday needs when there are visa requirements."
"My report contains a proposal that may serve as a point of departure."
"If this matter had been brought to our attention at the beginning of the year, the codecision procedure would have applied."
"In spite of the fact that the consultation procedure is now being applied, the Council and the Commission have cause to ponder the significance of the fact that account is being taken of Parliament’s amendment."
"What is also important is that the Commission quickly initiate a review of the consular instructions so that the common visa rules are applied in the same way in all the Member States."
"The furore surrounding Germany’s Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, emphasises the need for this."
"In saying that, I still wish to thank all those who have helped with the work, including my fellow MEPs and the Commission’s and Parliament’s officials."
"I am looking forward to the debate that is now to follow."
". Mr President, the reciprocity mechanism that has applied to date under the European Union’s visa policy meant that extremely harsh sanctions could be imposed on third countries if a country reported that the mandatory use of visas was placing them at a disadvantage."
"On 7 July 2004, after the ten new Member States had joined the EU, the Commission relaxed the rules contained in this regulation in such a way as to do away with the reciprocity mechanism that had featured in the draft regulation."
"This resulted in an absurd situation whereby 9 of the 10 new Member States were forced to accept citizens of third countries, for example the USA, without visas, whilst citizens of the Member States in question needed visas to travel to these third countries."
"I believe that Mr Lax has drafted what is, on the whole, an excellent report, but although this report introduces a number of additional procedures and deadlines that can be enforced by diplomatic means, it does not oblige the Council or the Commission to impose more stringent sanctions."
"The report leaves it up to the Commission to decide whether to introduce mandatory visas for the citizens of a third country or to impose other, much less effective, measures."
"In my opinion, allowing the Commission to decide in this way shows a lack of resolve, and would mean inadequate protection for the citizens of the new Member States."
"Such an approach would send out a clear signal that mutual solidarity between EU Member States and towards third countries has been thin on the ground since the accession of the new Member States."
"Since the latter joined the EU, dual standards have been applied, with one mechanism for the 15 old Member States and another, in which solidarity is rather less apparent, for the EU of 25."
"The end result of this is that the difference in status between the citizens of the new and the old EU has become even more pronounced, as citizens of the new Member States are subject to additional restrictions when travelling outside the EU."
"In view of all this, I find it astonishing that people can talk of a new concept of European citizenship, when some of the EU’s citizens will enjoy entirely different rights and duties to the rest, who are regarded as less worthy."
"Seen from the new Member States’ point of view, the costs of enlargement have outweighed the benefits by far."
"We were obliged to bring our legislation into line with the EU’s visa policy, which proved extremely expensive, and to introduce visas for our eastern neighbours."
"The benefits we have derived, however, have been few and far between."
"We are still unable to issue Schengen visas, and we cannot count on the EU’s help as far as visa reciprocity is concerned."
"Furthermore, the EU Member States demanding that we implement the common visa policy are the very ones that are experiencing problems with the implementation of this policy, for example Germany."
"Commissioner Frattini, I should like to make it known that if the amended mechanism comes into force, we will insist on the Commission discharging the duties incumbent upon it."
"I should also like to receive a clear answer to the question of whether we can expect the Commission to present an action plan setting out clearly defined deadlines for the achievement of objectives relating to the abolition of visas for travel into the USA, and using the Schengen assessments of the new Member States as a frame of reference."
"This would be in the vital interests of all the citizens of the new Member States."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first wanted to thank, in particular, Mr Lax for our excellent collaborative effort."
"Parliament is about to establish its position on a crucial issue: the reciprocity mechanism on visas."
"Behind the dryness of technical terms lies, in fact, a very vital reality: that of giving substance to, and advancing, in a tangible and positive way, cooperation between Member States, in the face of the complex relations of an enlarged Union with third countries on the subject of visas."
"We are dealing here with something that lies at the heart of what constitutes the richness of Europe, namely respect for the law in all its forms in rediscovered peace and harmony."
"We are attempting to build a harmonious space between Europe and the rest of the world, where borders are not walls rising up between one party and another, dividing people and nations."
"We must ensure that Europe is a recognised space, where it is possible to come and go without interference, on good terms with third countries near or far."
"It is also an act of confidence towards our 420 million citizens."
"It has, furthermore, become necessary, in moving in this direction, to completely review a method that favours a too inflexible approach."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report that I call upon you to approve takes a fresh look at the amendments required for inclusion in the Regulation in force since 2001."
"In this context, I express my full interest in the principle of pushing aside the systematisation of sanctions currently implemented in the event of a lapse from one side or the other, between the European Union and the third countries in question."
"These reprisals often arise, either from a technical, or even an administrative, issue, or from inappropriate political decisions, which diplomatic efforts must crucially seek to resolve in the first instance."
"In its current state, reciprocity of sanctions is neither desirable nor appropriate as a response to often complex issues occurring on a day-to-day basis."
"In the last resort, in fact, it is our citizens who pay a high price for it by not being allowed to travel freely, not to mention the very costly inconvenience that that causes."
"That is why, in accordance with a sensibly drafted plan, a forum for discussion corner needs to be created, where Parliament has its full place."
"Our legitimacy as elected representatives of the citizens is also at the heart of this report that, in the course of the work in committee, has attracted a very large consensus on the new method for consideration."
"In particular, we must succeed in guaranteeing all European citizens free, unimpeded movement outside the borders of the Union."
"Parliament must, as a consequence, be closely involved in this process, as it is clearly the legitimate guarantor of transparency in assuming the rightful democratic responsibility it has been accorded by its electorate."
"This in no way reduces the prerogatives of the Commission, whose role emerges very noticeably strengthened so that it may appear a credible negotiator to the third countries concerned."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is why I call upon you to vote in favour of this text tomorrow. It represents a successful combination of the roles of the European legislative and executive powers, which are united in the service of the citizens and the project we hold dear: that of building a solid European Union upon the values of freedom, security and justice."
". Mr President, the reciprocity mechanism was introduced four years ago, but not even once has it since been applied."
"This alone prompts us to consider renewing and amending it."
"On the one hand, the system was too rigid; on the other hand, it has not been used, because it has not substantively violated any Member State’s interest."
"However, things have considerably changed with the enlargement."
"The reciprocity mechanism is not applied in the case of nineteen countries."
"My colleagues have mentioned the United States, but there are other countries as well, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among others, where reciprocity is not applied."
"Discrimination between EU citizens is simply unacceptable."
"The basis for this mechanism – as well as the whole of the EU – is solidarity, but this solidarity has not worked so far."
"We hope that adopting the new regulation will contribute to a more efficient application of solidarity."
"If you talk to citizens of the new Member States, and I do not mean politicians, as they are not really the ones affected by this problem, but ordinary citizens, you will learn what an administrative and financial burden it is and how much time and energy is wasted in the process of obtaining a US visa – and that is if the applicant is lucky."
"There are thousands of cases when people are turned down without any substantive reason, their cases are simply rejected."
"It is high time the Commission acted firmly in the name of the Community on the basis of solidarity between the Member States and I hope that Mr Frattini will seize this opportunity and take appropriate measures."
"This report serves as a timely basis for it."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Lax on his excellent report and I would like to highlight three of its essential proposals that must be adopted."
"It proposes an increase in the notification period from 10 to 90 days to allow for direct negotiations between the individual Member States, but after 90 days, the reciprocity mechanism must come into effect."
"It is also important that it draws Parliament into this process not only because it emphasises the authority and importance of Parliament, but it also improves democratic transparency."
"Another important point is that it not only talks about visa obligations, but also of any kind of procedure that becomes an obstacle to free movement."
"We hope that with the adoption of the new mechanism and its amendments, the Commission will use its full authority in cases where the fundamental interests of the Member States are violated and today, the basic interests of the nine new Member States are violated, and we hope that the Commission will complete successful negotiations with regard to this new resolution."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of reciprocity as a fundamental principle of visa policy and we feel that a common European policy on visas should always be founded on the principle of solidarity."
"What is needed is a mechanism designed to ensure that European citizens do not have to obtain a visa in order to enter those third countries whose nationals do not require a visa to enter EU territory."
"A number of third countries, however, require visas from EU citizens, and this runs counter to the principle of reciprocity."
"The existing mechanism has not been invoked since it was set up in 2001 and Mr Frattini has rightly acknowledged that it suffers from being too rigid and unworkable."
"Apart from the fact that the mechanism can only be invoked if requested by a victim Member State, the almost automatic nature of reinstating the visa requirement has had a discouraging effect; externally, because of the high risk of causing a crisis in relations with third countries, and, internally, because of the lack of solidarity if the Council blocks the process."
"Victim Member States, such as my country, Portugal, have always held back from using it."
"The situation has deteriorated since the enlargement."
"It has already been mentioned that, for example, the United States requires a visa of nine of the ten new Member States and Canada seven."
"Consequently, we agree that there needs to be a more flexible mechanism in order to ensure greater interoperability and more effective implementation, thereby enhancing solidarity between the Member States. The Commission will also have a crucial role based on its competence in the area of visas."
"Hence my support for this proposal and for the proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr Lax, whom I congratulate on his excellent work."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Lax for his work, which has made it possible for us to discuss the reciprocity mechanism and to take decisions on the matter."
"I should merely like to draw the House’s attention to an issue addressed by Mrs Kudrycka, and which Mr Lax in fact also mentioned a short while ago."
"There is a risk that the various Member States and their citizens will not be treated equally, particularly with regard to the granting of visas to enter the United States."
"In principle, proposals to award the Commission and the Council powers in this field are an eminently good idea."
"At the same time, however, the Member States’ competences should also be extended somewhat, as otherwise they are likely to feel hard done by."
"I should like to reiterate a point made by a number of other speakers, namely that this is one of the many instances, and indeed perhaps the most important, where we should invoke a founding principle of the European Union."
"I refer to the principle of solidarity and equal treatment for all Member States and their citizens."
"After all, the latter are all citizens of the European Union, and as such on an equal footing with each other."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the concept of reciprocity is as old as the history of international relations."
"It has its roots in the tradition of mutual respect and equal treatment for citizens of different countries."
"Until 1 May 2004, this was an obvious principle for the old Member States and was not open to question."
"After the 10 new Member States joined the EU, however, people’s attitudes towards this principle suddenly began to change."
"They began to practice , which essentially means watering down one’s principles so that they correspond to reality, rather than changing reality so that it fits one’s principles."
"In my opinion, the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the reciprocity mechanism is a further example of ."
"These amendments are unacceptable to Polish citizens for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, Poles have always regarded the lack of reciprocity in visa arrangements with certain countries, in particular the United States, as unfair."
"Secondly, they had every right to expect that when we joined the European Union, which is a community of nations, this community would take on some of the responsibility for defending Poland’s interests, in line with the principle of subsidiarity in its broadest sense."
"Once again, however, their expectations were dashed, and the musketeers’ magnificent cry of ‘one for all and all for one’, something I am sure we have all heard before, was consigned to the realms of fiction."
"This is another reason why I cannot vote in favour of this report, even though, or perhaps precisely because, I hold both Polish and American citizenship."
"On a loosely related note, I cannot help but wonder what has happened to the integrity of the European Union’s policy."
"I would ask the Commissioner and the President how the international European Community can be expected to wield any power on the international scene if we make such far-reaching concessions in a matter such as this, which appears to be quite straightforward."
". Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have taken part and, once again, the rapporteur."
"The Commission is fully aware that the issue faced today is a real issue for citizens, and that it is an issue leading to wasted time, expense and, above all, a sense of injustice."
"It is a political matter that we take very seriously and the Commission will certainly take into account the decisions made by Parliament."
"We are convinced that what is needed is speed and effectiveness."
"You are aware that if this initiative is approved, as I hope it will be, and after the Member States have been notified, the matter will pass automatically to the Commission for negotiation, with greater speed and effectiveness than at present."
"The principle of solidarity will be implemented and this too is an important political point."
"As Mr Coelho has so ably stated, political and diplomatic responses are needed, and that is the road that the Commission intends to follow."
"I can assure you that we have already established relations and contacts at a political level precisely with the non-EU countries that you have mentioned – the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – in order to arrive at a system that will guarantee all Member States, whether old or new, free movement without a visa."
"We will propose concrete action, as has been requested, in addition to firm deadlines."
"Furthermore, we are making efforts for every new Member State to join the Schengen area by 2007."
"You are aware that evaluation on a case-by-case basis will be necessary, but we are striving to help all the new Member States to be in a position by then to join a European area without internal borders."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0084/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders as regards access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles (14238/1/2004 – C6-0007/2005 – 2003/0198(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Coelho)."
". – Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we all want to combat theft and the illegal trade in stolen cars."
"This is a growing form of crime, with more than 1 million cars stolen per year, of which fewer than 40% are recovered."
"This is an alarming problem, not solely from an economic point of view, but more importantly because of its links with other forms of crime such as drug-trafficking, arms trafficking and the trafficking of human beings. It is also a highly lucrative activity, which has become very attractive to organised crime networks, as it does not entail too much risk."
"Fresh measures to combat crime of this nature must therefore be taken. In a Europe in which internal border checks have been scrapped, a response must be found that involves effective action at Community level."
"The purpose of this proposal is to provide the public vehicle registration authorities direct access to certain categories of data contained in the Schengen Information System (SIS) and, in turn, to restrict private vehicle registration services solely to the right to request indirect access through a public authority with access to the SIS."
"The aim is thus to enable the SIS to be an even more important instrument in the fight against crime."
"It is necessary to check quickly and efficiently whether vehicles presented to them for registration have been stolen, misappropriated or lost."
"We have also improved the functioning of the internal market by strengthening the principle of free movement and, in so doing, we have fostered the gradual creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, along with the implementation of the common transport policy."
"This direct access will ensure that cars stolen in one country cannot be registered – and thus made legal – in another, a process that sometimes takes less than 24 hours."
"There are two reasons for introducing this measure: firstly, efficiency – there are millions of vehicles registered in the EU and direct access will make it possible to check the legal status of a vehicle quickly and easily; and secondly, transparency – at the moment, the various Member States have different ways of checking whether a vehicle has been stolen, at the moment when it is being registered."
"All of these ways are, to a greater or lesser extent, opaque and complicated."
"The proposed solution, within the scope of the Schengen Convention, is transparent and offers more guarantees than the current situation."
"We want to maintain data protection and our citizens’ privacy."
"We have therefore restricted the type of data that can be accessed and have proposed that access to data relating to identity documents and to blank official documents be removed, in line with the opinion of the joint supervisory authority."
"The range of data to which the competent vehicle registration authorities will have access is clearly laid down and limited in terms of what is necessary and appropriate."
"I should also like to point out that Directive 95/46 on personal protection data is applicable here, along with the specific rules of the Schengen Convention on data protection."
"We should like to be sure that these rules are being effectively complied with and monitored."
"The authorities in charge of data protection must therefore have sufficient resources at their disposal to carry out their work and the Member States must be firmly committed to upholding the fundamental right to data protection."
"My report, which tabled ten amendments to the Commission’s initial proposal, was approved at first reading in April 2004 and the Council common position was adopted in December 2004."
"I wholeheartedly welcome this common position, and I am delighted that, in accepting seven of the ten amendments put forward, it largely took on board Parliament’s recommendations. As for the three amendments not accepted, I shall first mention Amendment 4."
"I have dropped this amendment, because it is no longer relevant, given that on 24 February 2005, the Council finally adopted the initiative by the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Decision concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, in particular in the fight against terrorism; secondly, Amendment 11, an attempt to amend the rules of data protection for the SIS, but I agree that this question should be addressed within the scope of the legal proposal on SIS II, the second generation of SIS; and thirdly, Amendment 10, which requested an annual report on the implementation of the proposed access for the authorities concerned."
"I must stress that only if Parliament receives a report enabling it to assess the system will it be able to carry out its duties as a legislative body and a budgetary authority."
"I propose a slightly different wording, which I presume the Council would be in a position to accept, following an informal meeting with the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The conditions are thus in place whereby this legal act can finally be adopted and this useful measure can enter into force."
"Accordingly, Mr President, we can help to fight crime and to make our citizens feel safer."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his report."
"Our aim is to prevent and combat the illegal trade in stolen vehicles and improve the functioning of the internal market."
"The proposal we are discussing today also offers a better use of the largest European database on stolen vehicles, the Schengen Information System."
"The financial interests at stake are huge since annually millions of cars are registered and every 10 or 15 seconds a car is stolen, which has also been underlined by the rapporteur."
"Since vehicle theft is one of the foremost crimes to affect citizens directly, our working together to reduce it will have an immeasurable impact on their security."
"We propose that under certain conditions national vehicle registration authorities should be allowed to consult the SIS data registers on stolen vehicles and stolen vehicle documents, prior to registering a vehicle that is already registered in another Schengen state."
"This information will make it more difficult to sell stolen vehicles in other Schengen states."
"At the same time, it will increase victims’ chances of reclaiming their lost property."
"This is an excellent way in which Europe can serve its citizens and promote concrete operational cooperation."
"Our proposal will also make the law enforcement process more manageable by facilitating access to information."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the current situation is far from transparent."
"In view of the millions of cars that are presented for registration each year, authorities lack resources to check all cars in accordance with current requirements."
"Our proposal will grant this access on the basis of a transparent and common set of rules and data protection principles."
"Compliance with the rules will be monitored in a manner similar to other searches in the SIS."
"Data protection considerations made us differentiate between access arrangements for public and for private vehicle registration bodies."
"Finally, the Commission welcomes the amendments proposed by the European Parliament, in particular Amendment 3, which allows for a reporting system with a view to collecting reliable data."
"Obviously when the SIS II is in place a systematic reporting system will be guaranteed by the Commission."
". Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to the productive working relationship we have in general with Mr Coelho."
"I was keen to point this out."
"The proposal that we are examining today at second reading gives national vehicle registration authorities access to certain categories of the Schengen Information System."
"The clear objective of this ruling is the fight against organised vehicle crime, which we all fully agree is one of our priorities."
"We are, however, more reserved with regard to unlimited access to European databases."
"In actual fact, we must assure ourselves that personal data are stringently protected."
"In order to allow a balance between the fight against organised crime and the protection of the private lives of European citizens, every decision taken, moreover, must respect the principles of proportionality and finality."
"I believe that we are very much in agreement on this matter."
"I regret that the Council has been unable to incorporate all of our amendments at first reading into its common position."
"In actual fact, registration of the people carrying out the research and people targeted by this research would, I believe, have allowed these abuses to be avoided."
"In the spirit of compromise, we support the rapporteur’s stand in bringing in only one amendment that was not adopted by the common position."
"An annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the implementation of this regulation is an absolute prerequisite, in order to assure the representatives of European citizens that the principle of finality is genuinely observed."
"I should finally like to point out that my group was opposed, at first reading, to direct access to the Schengen Information System by any authorities other than those responsible for law enforcement."
"I must add that we remain committed to this principle with the prospect of further discussions to come on the Schengen Information System II, which will therefore be a matter for codecision."
"Whilst European databases can prove useful in the fight against organised crime, they must, in reality, be rigorously controlled."
"Our priority is the effective fight against organised crime in Europe, but in observing the rights and freedoms of European citizens, it is not always a pointless exercise to reaffirm it."
"I made some rather sarcastic remarks about this proposal at first reading and, as a lawyer, I have objections to its being defined as an aspect of transport policy when, in reality, what we have here is an arrangement that extends what, fundamentally, is dangerous access to very extensive information systems and the most comprehensive system of police supervision and control we have, namely the Schengen system."
"If it were a case of the supervisory authorities’ access to these systems helping to prevent crime in this area, it would be worth thinking about."
"Even if that were so, however, there are such major reasons for concern about extending the access in question that we in our group shall vote against the proposal, irrespective of the fact that we very much appreciate the rapporteur’s very commendable efforts to have an obligation imposed to report on whether the system is of any use."
"We have these reservations about the supervisory system because we see it as a further extension to a system of police supervision and control that, in all probability, will have no useful effect at all."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the question by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Commission, on the Commission’s strategy for the first Conference of the Parties on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) (O-0042/2005 – B6-0171/2005)."
". Mr President, with your permission I will also be representing Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"He should have been leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but cannot join us this evening so he has ceded his time to me in addition to my own time, so thank you for your patience on that."
"The oral question before us was tabled by my colleague Mr Florenz and we also have a motion for resolution further to that oral question on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the EU strategy for the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants."
"For the record, next week the first Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on POPs or Persistent Organic Pollutants, takes place in Punta del Este in Uruguay."
"POPs are organic chemicals that break down very slowly in the environment and accumulate in our bodies; indeed they are in the tissues of every human being on the planet."
"They are spread through the air and through the food chain very far from their sources, even to regions where they have never been used or produced."
"They include insecticides such as DDT – perhaps the best-known POP – industrial chemicals such as PCBs and indeed the unintentional by-products of industrial processes such as dioxins and furans."
"Once POPs are released into the environment it is almost impossible to predict where they will end up, so we have to apply the precautionary principle, but most importantly take steps to restrict their use and their placing on the market generally."
"It is important, however, that the needs of developing countries are taken into account and that our response is proportionate and that we allow controlled exemptions."
"I am thinking primarily of the use of DDT against malaria because, despite the best efforts of scientists and their redoubled efforts to find an effective vaccine, this is still many years away."
"So our approach must be proportionate, particularly when we realise that every minute two children in Africa die of malaria."
"Every day over 3 000 children in Africa die of malaria."
"The mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria has proved extremely resilient to the various methods of dealing with it down the years."
"To date the only effective method of killing the mosquito is by the use of DDT."
"Although it is a very toxic substance, the benefit still outweighs the risk when your child is less likely to die of persistent organic pollution poisoning than of malaria."
"So if we can save a child’s life, until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mosquito in question, we will have to allow controlled use."
"However, we must double our efforts to find an alternative to DDT because huge damage is being done to humans – it is biocumulative – and to our environment by our need to look after the children who are here today."
"We have nothing else to replace DDT to eliminate malaria and the mosquito involved."
"I should like to put a few specific questions to the Commissioner."
"Commissioner, you will probably be familiar with the resolution that is before you."
"I should like to draw your attention to paragraph 9, which says that Parliament ‘believes that the Members of the European Parliament who are part of the EC delegation have an essential contribution to make and expects, therefore, that they will have access to EU coordination meetings in Punta del Este on the basis at least of observer status’."
"The motion goes on to say ‘with or without speaking rights’."
"I should be quite happy with observer status without speaking rights."
"Commissioner, I say this regardless of precedent or quoting interinstitutional agreements, because I would like to say yet again on the record that, just a few weeks after you were appointed, Commissioner, at the conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in relation to climate change, COP 10, you made great strides in including the Members of the European Parliament, both before and after various meetings, in terms of full briefings."
"You even went so far as to ask us for our opinion on different issues."
"That was very much appreciated by all of us across the Groups in this House."
"I know you cannot join us in Punta del Este, but I would ask that you make it very clear to those honourable people who will be representing you there that you would like the precedent you created last December to continue."
"It is one step less than we would like, because we want observer status and we request that."
"There is little point in sending Members of Parliament half way across the globe, to be part of a Commission/Council/Parliament delegation, a Community delegation, if one third are kept outside the door albeit with briefings when the business is done."
"Let us take it one step at a time, let us at least have observer status at the coordination meetings and at the meetings where the real work is done and of course be part of any press conference and press briefing that may wind up the week."
"It is the first COP – I accept that – and perhaps we will not have as much to report as we would like because we are only developing structures and strategies to deal with this most important issue."
"Those are my points."
"At this hour of the night there is no point in underlining yet again how important a job the Stockholm Convention has to do."
"I would like in conclusion to ask you, Commissioner, about the goals and the timetable for the addition of extra organic chemicals to the list of POPs as set out under the Convention, which were discussed last August."
"The Commission suggested that seven new substances should be added to the list for eventual exclusion."
"Somehow over the autumn and over Christmas and the New Year, by the time of the Council conclusions on 10 March, the seven had dropped to up to three additional substances."
"We had gone from a worthy ambition of seven last August to up to three, plus of course Penta BDE, the Norwegian proposal, which might be a fourth one."
"But up to three could be none, one or two as well as three."
"I would just like to know where the Commission stands on this."
"The European Community and the Member States wanted to forward an extensive list to be considered if possible before the first COP next week, but in any case in time for examination by the first meeting of the POPs review committee."
"Are we going to have it before next week?"
"Why has it not happened?"
"What has happened to the goals and the timetables that were clearly set out?"
"Maybe you could tell us, Commissioner, what has happened between 10 March and today?"
"It is rather disappointing that our ambitions of seven to be added last summer have been reduced to up to three at this stage."
"To me it sounds as though the urgency and the ambition that were initially there have evaporated."
"It is almost as if air is being let out of the tyre of enthusiasm in relation to it."
". Mr President, I agree with almost everything Mrs Doyle said and I should like to say that, with the entry into force of the Stockholm Convention, twelve of the most dangerous substances in the world will gradually be abolished."
"Nonetheless, if this Convention is to come up to our expectations, it must be applied correctly and must gather momentum by including new substances as time goes by."
"Numerous important issues will be discussed and decided at the first conference of the parties, which will also lay the foundations for the future development of the Convention."
"The general objective is to ensure that the decisions taken by the first conference will allow for the effective application and further development of the Convention."
"Of course, if we are to succeed, the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee must first be set up, so that it can start examining new proposals for the addition of other organic pollutants to the list."
"The Commission has already determined other substances; as Mrs Doyle said, they were confined to three and, as far as I know, this has not changed since."
"In all events, the debate is continuing on the timetable and for submitting proposals and I believe and hope that the European Union will table good proposals during the first conference of the parties."
"Secondly, and most importantly, greater progress is needed with the gradual abolition of the use and release into the environment of the twelve persistent organic pollutants on the current list, especially DDT, which you quite rightly said is still needed to combat malaria in certain developing countries."
"However, the first conference must find ways to help limit the reliance on DDT, such as by promoting research into alternative means and providing technical and financial support."
"Similarly, the first conference must set further measures in motion in a bid to restrict the risks from the use and availability of PCBs, on the one hand, and to reduce and prevent the release into the environment of derivative organic pollutants, especially chlorinated dioxins and furans, on the other."
"The third basic objective of decisive importance for the first conference is to complete the institutional framework needed so that the Convention can be applied in practice."
"In particular, substantial progress needs to be made in developing suitable compliance mechanisms and procedures."
"With regard to point 9 of the resolution, I think that it is the Commission's duty to include Members of the European Parliament in this sort of delegation and may I say that, from my own personal experience, we have cooperated excellently in two instances, once in Buenos Aires and once at the conference on sustainable development in New York last week which was also attended by Members of the European Parliament, where we managed through exchanges not only of views, but also of advice, opinions and, in particular, political judgments on certain issues, to promote the issues to which these conferences were devoted."
"At the same time, we succeeded, with the three institutions, in projecting a very good and united image of the European Union to the outside world, mainly by using press conferences at which we appeared together and seemed united and unified in our opinions, thereby improving the image of the European Union."
"In other words, we had both positive material results and results from the point of view of communications."
"That is why I consider, therefore, that the participation of Members of the European Parliament is essential;"
"I always think that it is absolutely crucial and I also recommend it to my other colleagues in the European Commission."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, world public opinion has slowly been waking up to the new problems that we face."
"Environmental quality is not a luxury item; as a prerequisite for sustainable development, it should be a political priority."
"Governments are, to a greater or lesser extent, coming to realise that the world has changed and that policy must change with it."
"They are all coming to the realisation that attacks on the environment jeopardise the future of this generation and generations to come and do irreversible damage to people’s quality of life."
"Environmental problems and health concerns must be addressed as a matter of urgency."
"The ignorance of the past and the negligence of the present have come at a high price – environmental costs, financial costs and costs in terms of human lives."
"Remedying the current situation is necessary, but taking preventative action is an even more pressing priority."
"The chemical industry currently produces more than 1 000 compounds, some of which are very persistent, that is, highly resistant to environmental degradation."
"Some of them are biocumulative, which means that they accumulate in the tissue of living organisms; they are also toxic."
"The most prevalent of these toxic compounds are the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which have been linked to various health problems such as cancer, endometriosis, cognitive disorders and learning difficulties."
"POPs are also responsible for reproductive disorders and hormonal dysfunctions."
"Being resistant, POPs are passed down from generation to generation and contaminate the food that we eat, the air that we breathe and the water that we drink."
"Being biocumulative, POPs accumulate in the environment and in the organisms of living beings."
"With these characteristics, POPs can travel long distances and can be found in places as far apart as the Antarctic, in penguins, and in the Arctic, in polar bears."
"There is therefore no point in Brazil stopping mirex production if Argentina does not follow suit; similarly, there is no reason for the EU to ban DDT if China continues to produce it and use it."
"Accordingly – and I wish to stress this point – efforts must be coordinated worldwide."
"It is also important to note that many of these substances did not exist 50 years ago."
"In 1995, negotiations began to control the use, production and release of POPs."
"12 pollutants were identified."
"The Stockholm Convention, held in 2001, set out a range of targets and measures aimed not only at better management of POPs, but also at eliminating them and at promoting clean technologies."
"Against the background of the decisions taken by the Stockholm Convention, which, as I said, took place in 2001, and of the aims and agenda of the first Conference of the Parties to that Convention taking place in Uruguay on 2 to 6 May, we should like to ask the Commission what its objectives are for that conference."
"I should also like to ask what it hopes to accomplish and how much progress it feels can be made. Furthermore, given that everything has its cost, I should also like to know, Commissioner, what financial resources will be available to help those countries that most need to ban POPs."
"I shall not be going to Punta del Este to take part in the conference, but I should like to say that I share the concerns expressed by Mrs Doyle and that I agree with everything she said as regards Parliament’s delegation, which should be there on the basis of observer status."
"It does not make sense if elected Members of the European Parliament are not able to take part in all initiatives, all conferences and all meetings."
". Mr President, we could of course promote financing with regard to the Millennium Development Goals and the possibilities this provides."
"On POPs, the Commission’s proposal was ambitious, but so far the Council has not agreed to it."
"We wanted a Council decision under Article 300 of the Treaty, i.e. by qualified majority."
"The poorer result of the Council conclusions of 10 March is due to the fact that these were adopted differently, through unanimity."
"The Commission regrets this approach."
"However, the process will be a long one."
"There are political, economic and social considerations to be taken into account, but we shall pursue our line of argument."
"At the end of the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0061/2005) by Mrs Klaß on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the protection of groundwater against pollution."
". Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament, and especially the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, for their contribution to this report at first reading."
"Groundwater is an important resource, which is used for drinking water, and by industry and agriculture."
"It also has an important environmental value, given that it interacts with surface water and wetlands and, as such, forms an important part of the water cycle, which needs protection."
"The protection of groundwater from pollution has been the subject of Community legislation since as far back as 1980; most recently, in the Water Framework Directive passed in 2000."
"Nonetheless, there are still some gaps."
"There are no clear criteria for defining targets for the environmental quality of groundwater; more importantly, there are no good chemical status targets."
"In addition, special measures are needed to prevent and control the pollution of groundwater."
"This was acknowledged when the Water Framework Directive was approved, article 17 of which calls on the Commission to submit proposals to address the relevant requirements."
"Within this framework, and following extensive consultations with the interested parties, the Commission submitted the proposal being debated today, which includes the main following elements:"
"- a compliance procedure for assessing good groundwater chemical status, in order to limit the number of pollutants, where Community standards already apply;"
"- criteria for assessing the chemical status of groundwater on the basis of environmental quality standards, which need to be adopted by the Member States at the appropriate national, regional or local level, depending on variations in natural groundwater conditions, the pressures identified and the chemical substances connected with pollution;"
"- criteria for determining deterioration in the quality of groundwater and for reversing pollution trends and"
"- measures to prevent or limit the direct and, more importantly, the indirect discharge of dangerous substances into the groundwater."
"The proposal contains clear specifications which will ensure that the environmental targets of the Water Framework Directive are met in respect of groundwater."
"Similarly, the proposal strikes a satisfactory balance between issues which need to be addressed at Community level and issues which should preferably be left in the hands of the Member States."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is life, and groundwater is our main source of fresh water and hence also of drinking water, providing as it does 60% of the latter."
"Groundwater is, though, not just a vital resource for the extraction of our drinking water; it is also essential to agriculture, industry and our eco-system."
"However hard we try to keep our water – and our groundwater in particular – clean, and to restore its purity where it is already polluted, we must, not least at European level, strike a sensible balance between the requirements of the water industry, the needs of agriculture, the eco-systems and the resources available for maintaining and restoring the purity of water in the Member States."
"As the re-purification of polluted groundwater is very difficult, very time-consuming and, in particular, very costly, prevention and the protection of the groundwater eco-system are particularly important."
"On the European continent, at any rate, groundwater bodies, like rivers, know no borders."
"It is for that reason, and also because differing requirements in the Member States inevitably lead to distortions of competition for industry and agriculture, that the protection of groundwater is a task for Europe."
"Fortunately, though, we are not starting from nothing."
"This proposal from the Commission is derived from the Water Framework Directive, which has been in force since the year 2000, and was meant to be transposed in all the Member States from the end of December 2003."
"The primary task imposed on the Member States by the Water Framework Directive was the inventarisation of all waters by 22 March 2005."
"If all the Member States have met that deadline – and perhaps Commissioner Dimas can tell us whether or not they have – then every one of them ought, by now at the latest, to know in what condition its waters and groundwater are."
"The Water Framework Directive lays down quality and quantity targets for all Community waters, including groundwater, and specifies the means whereby they are to be achieved."
"This daughter directive is intended to deal with two points that remain outstanding, firstly the criteria by reference to which groundwater is to be categorised as ‘good’ or ‘poor’ and, secondly, the point in time at which action must be taken if deterioration is established."
"We must also determine whether there is a need to enact rules on the indirect introduction of pollutants from point sources and diffuse sources."
"We must consider in their context all the relevant directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Priority Substances Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive."
"The costs incurred in administering and implementing them, and in monitoring their implementation, must be tolerable, without making it less likely that groundwater will be maintained in a good chemical status in all 25 EU Member States, for that is our objective."
"We would, though, risk missing this target if we were to adopt the so-called compromise amendment 94 to Article 6, which has been tabled jointly by the PSE, the Liberals, the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group, and which would alter the fundamental direction not only of my report, but also of the Commission proposal and of the Water Framework Directive."
"It seeks to overburden the Member States by drawing up new lists of what it describes as hazardous substances and by imposing tasks to be regulated by the chemicals policy now in REACH."
"It proposes a new category of groundwater bodies mandated with the certification of safety zones with the chemical status of ‘very good’, and calls for an array of new examination, reporting and supervision requirements, the additional costs of which would be borne by the Member States and by municipalities."
"The amendment is also couched in very vague and repetitious terms."
"It goes as far as to do away with all the derogations from Article 6(2) that water experts regard as necessary and that are also contained in the 1980 Groundwater Directive."
"We must not accept this amendment; the laboriously-achieved compromise in the Water Framework Directive must not be altered by a daughter directive on groundwater."
"There are two other amendments proposing uniform European standards on the quality of groundwater for important indicators and pollutants."
"I think it very important, if we are to avoid distortions of competition and have a comparable standard of groundwater protection throughout our Member States, that we in this House should call for uniform European categories of this kind for the evaluation of groundwater as ‘good’ or ‘poor’, and so, with this in mind, I ask you to support Amendments 111 and 112."
"We also have to draw a clear distinction between pollutants and indicators."
"I have tried to separate them completely, for sulphate, chloride and aluminium are not in fact pollutants, but rather important indicators of the chemical status of the groundwater and of the possible presence of certain impurities and pollutants."
"It is ultimately impossible to constantly monitor every conceivable pollutant, for there are hundreds or even thousands of them."
"Let me conclude by asking the House to support Amendments 89 and 90, which divide the list into indicators and pollutants."
"I ask you all to ensure today that our waters will, in future, be well protected by a Europe that acts together."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of difficult legislation."
"However, groundwater is one of our most important resources."
"Its protection should be taken seriously: indeed, wars are being increasingly fought over water resources."
"I believe that this proposal for a directive to protect groundwater should come into force despite its shortcomings."
"As has been mentioned, it will complement the Water Framework Directive."
"This will be a difficult issue throughout the Union."
"In my country, Finland, there are thousands of small groundwater areas, none of which will be sources of contamination in the near future, but which now need to be investigated."
"We nevertheless agree with this law, even if it is not necessary for us."
"I believe that it is now our turn to reach a reciprocal agreement."
"Groundwater in Central Europe covers large areas, and these are being threatened by various chemicals."
"The problem with the aquifers on the Iberian Peninsula is often to do with seawater."
"We on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy managed to draw up a statement in a congenial atmosphere, for which I thank my colleagues."
"Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the committee responsible for this issue, did not agree to support compromise proposal 94 as the other groups did."
"This directive is needed."
"The first reading is only an intermediate stage, as the Council’s joint position is very different."
"It is worth making a combined effort to ensure that groundwater is properly protected."
"It affects our quality of life, it affects agriculture, and it affects human happiness and health."
". Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Klaß for the good cooperation I enjoyed with her."
"As far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned, two points stood out in particular, and it will not surprise you to learn that the essential one, to which previous speakers have already referred, was that the Committee on Agriculture is also, of course, in favour of clean water."
"Since something has to be done about this, we can, in principle, support the proposals in this groundwater directive."
"We consider it vital, though, that different measuring methods be introduced in Europe which reflect climatic and soil type differences."
"The situation on clay soil is different from that on peat, or sandy soil, and one soil type can also differ from Finland down to the heel of Italy."
"This will need to be taken into consideration when we measure the 50 mg."
"Secondly, the Committee on Agriculture wanted to take existing legislation into account."
"With regard to nitrate, it looks like two directives will be in place soon: the existing nitrates directive alongside the groundwater directive."
"If, for example, a farmer somewhere in Europe complies with the groundwater directive and is, with 30 mg, for example, below the 50 mg threshold, he will still be bound by the nitrates directive, and it is possible that a farmer with three cows per hectare will fail to comply with the provisions of the nitrates directive but will be complying with those of the groundwater directive, because if we measure the nitrate level, we are below 50 mg. It is then illogical to my mind that we have to ask that farmer to reduce the number of cattle units per hectare."
"It is one or the other."
"That is why the Committee on Agriculture has proposed to assess the need for the nitrates directive in 2008."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rejected two amendments in this connection; the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has subsequently re-submitted them, and I would now like to warmly recommend them to you."
"Thirdly – and in this last minute, I am speaking on behalf of the ALDE Group – I go along with the idea that clean water should be available, but what we should take into consideration is the cost involved. What are the socio-economic consequences if we introduce certain legislation?"
"This is also the subject of a number of amendments tabled by the ALDE Group, which, needless to say, I should like to see adopted."
"It strikes me as being absolutely logical that the introduction of directives is not at the expense of everything else."
"We must have a timeframe in which things are kept realistic and affordable."
". Mr President, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much welcome this Directive."
"Nevertheless, from the outset, we found ourselves, at least in certain sectors within my group and certain countries, in a particularly uncomfortable situation, because the directive did not fulfil all the objectives we had hoped for."
"For example, it did not deal with one fundamental issue relating to the control of aquifers — quantity — and focussed solely on quality, although, in reality, the water directive, in its respective annexes, talked about controlling quantities — volumes of water — and controlling quality at the same time."
"The failure to link quality and quantity in a government measure, a management measure, is something we cannot understand."
"Furthermore, there is no insistence on the need for control either on the part of the Member States or on the part of river basins, which is what the water Directive lays down for the management of water; it does not provide for control by means of river basins but rather by means of countries."
"Furthermore, the artificial refilling of aquifers is not considered either, despite the fact that this is an essential phenomenon."
"Finally, we must point out that we believe that many of Parliament’s amendments make the situation worse, because they are intended to standardise all aquifers and all controls of substances, although we are well aware that European geology is very diverse and that the concept of Europe's geological diversity must be a fundamental consideration of this policy, because sustainable development must be appropriate for each location."
"Furthermore, we believe that some of the amendments would be impossible to implement, such as Amendment 94, because a State cannot guarantee what enters its aquifers, since in many cases they are shared."
"If Amendment 94 is approved, therefore, we are going to vote against the directive because it would be incomplete and would not provide for control of quantities of water."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, and all the honourable Members for the work they have done to complement the provisions on the protection of groundwater established by the framework directive with a view to preventing and controlling the pollution of groundwater and establishing criteria for assessing the chemical state of that water."
"We must therefore take the view that, given that the possibility of purifying an aquifer is very limited, control and prevention are absolutely essential in order to ensure that polluting substances do not build up in groundwater."
"We must not forget that groundwater is the European Union's most sensitive and important water resource and, in particular, it is the main source of public drinking water supply."
"Furthermore, and given that the measures to prevent or restrict the introduction of pollutants into groundwater are a vital element of the proposed directive, it is very important, despite what the previous speaker said, that we approve the compromise amendment on Article 6, which we have presented jointly with other Members, in order to ensure that Member States control indirect dumping on the basis of best environmental practices and techniques that are sufficient to prevent such dumping."
"Commissioner, I would like to point out that, in its proposed annex of polluting substances, the Commission has not taken sufficient account of the fact that, due to the geological nature of the existing sub-soils, there are certain substances, such as chlorides and sulphates, that occur naturally in many of the European Union's aquifers, and that, from a scientific point of view, it is arguable whether these salts should even be classified as pollutants."
"I would also like to say that the proposal presented to us is not very ambitious, since it is limited to the minimum requirements of the framework directive, but, despite that, I am confident that the work of all of us will lead to a better directive."
"Mr President, I agree with the Commission’s view that nitrates and pesticides, as listed in Annex I, should remain the two substances for which we have EU-wide standards. We then should allow Member States to establish threshold values for a range of other substances."
"In the longer term, in the light of experience and information as a result of implementing the framework Water Directive, we may then be in a much better position to translate threshold values at national level into EU-wide groundwater quality standards."
"In my opinion this is a more reasonable and pragmatic way forward, but critically it is workable and achievable."
"And when do we amend legislation in this Parliament?"
"It is essential that it is workable across 25 countries and it is essential that the subsidiarity principle is enshrined in our legislation so that we can achieve high standards that work at national level."
"I am happy to agree with the opinion put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which suggests that the Commission should analyse whether the Nitrates Directive can be repealed from 2008."
"I agree with this in the context of what I have just said."
"Legislation should be adequate and workable, but most importantly it should achieve its stated objectives."
"The Nitrates Directive is certainly not doing this with 12 of the 15 Member States being taken to court over wrong or inadequate implementation."
"But the essential points are that it does not take soil or climatic conditions into consideration and, most critically, that the goal of the Nitrates Directive should be defined at Community level but not the mechanism to achieve that goal."
"Yesterday evening I went to see the exhibition hosted by the Joint Research Centre."
"One of the exhibits informed me that there are 28 different soil groups all over Europe and six of these soil groups are present in Ireland."
"How can a one-size-fits-all directive, like the Nitrates Directive, work efficiently in these circumstances?"
"Moreover, it is not just soil that matters; it makes an important difference whether the area is grassland or ploughed land."
"As to the issue of climate, all I can say is that in Ireland we do not have a climate, we have weather."
"And if Irish farmers were to follow the letter of the directive and spread slurry when allowed, they would cause pollution rather than prevent it."
"We all want clean water but the legislation we put in place must be adequate to achieve it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Klaß’s report on groundwater is an extremely complex one."
"However, the question we could ask today is whether the objectives of the Water Framework Directive and the objectives of preventing and controlling groundwater pollution will be achieved by the proposals contained in the report."
"The protection of groundwater is indeed a crucial issue, since it relates not only to our own water resources today, but also to those of future generations, and to the aquatic ecosystem as a whole."
"We know how complicated the study of groundwater is, and we also know that, once a body of water is polluted, it remains so for years."
"Today, these resources are threatened by a wide variety of forms of pollution."
"Some aquifers have already seriously deteriorated due to the effects of intensive farming, with massive use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers, including nitrates."
"The precautionary principle requires us to give a higher priority to the prevention of pollution than to the remediation or cleaning of groundwater, even supposing we could seriously contemplate easily cleaning an aquifer."
"If we are to prevent groundwater pollution, our most urgent priority must be to eliminate sources of pollution."
"However, certain amendments lead us to fear that, no doubt for reasons to do with sectoral interests, the urgent need to take a more radical approach to the prevention of pollution has not been grasped."
"Specifically, certain indirect discharges have been excluded: fertilisers and plant treatment products used in accordance with good agricultural practice."
"In fact, this comes down to official acceptance of agricultural pollution, which is unacceptable, particularly as we know that the main culprit in groundwater pollution is, of course, agriculture."
"The position proposed in Amendment 45 must be rejected out of hand if we want to achieve results with regard to protecting our water resources."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, already disappointed that the Commission’s initial draft did not go far enough to actually protect the quality of groundwater, is worried that this report is further weakening even the Commission’s position."
"If some of these amendments were adopted, this draft would amount to a licence to pollute and would, of course, in the end make European consumers pay the price of drinking water that would have been polluted practically legally."
"In our view, Article 6 and the compromise put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and ourselves are the most important, because they require a clear prevention policy that bans the most dangerous chemicals and strictly limits other pollutants."
"That is why we call on Parliament to support this compromise."
". – Groundwater is a unique natural resource of tremendous value, which is why it must be protected effectively."
"In our opinion, we need clear criteria for examining the qualitative status of water and a common European denominator, so that these criteria are comparable."
"We therefore support the need for the gradual elaboration of a common European policy for protecting groundwater, which will, however, also take account of the specific characteristics of each area."
"We attach exceptional importance to the compromise amendment which we have signed together with other political groups on Article 6, in which we state our wish for intensive protection."
"The scope of Article 6 must not be confined merely to indirect discharges to groundwater."
"We also support the need for a list to be created by the Member States, which will include the pollutants which are of specific concern in a river basin district."
"As there is no European definition of the best practice for farming, we call on the Member States to take additional measures to prevent pollution in this sector."
"At the same time, farmers need to be supported in their effort to achieve a cleaner environment through rural development programmes, so that the objectives both of the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive can be achieved."
"We also propose that the Member States list and conduct a midterm assessment of measures taken to prevent pollution."
"In this way, prevention can be strengthened and irreversible consequences avoided."
"The emphasis on prevention, the strict protection of groundwater and measures to prevent its deterioration are both necessary and an investment for future generations."
"That is why I totally fail to understand those who say that they have no money to invest in the future, in the environment or in our children."
". Mr President, in the eleven years I have been a Member of this House now, I have rarely come across a rapporteur who himself presented a minority view on a report."
"In all honesty, I find it a bit strange that Mrs Klaß did exactly that."
"Her point is that the amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety leave too much room for Member States’ own policy."
"I can only stress at this point that I consider the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to have done the right thing in adopting these amendments; after all, groundwater is mainly a national issue."
"When the framework directive on water was discussed, it was acknowledged that groundwater should be treated separately."
"Not least because of the subsidiarity principle, there can be no legal basis for this daughter directive other than Article 175(1)."
"Groundwater is an endangered natural resource; we do well to give it our attention by exchanging best practice and encouraging better protection, but this is not the place for rigid Europe-wide standards."
"We already know that it is extremely difficult to measure the content of a substance in groundwater objectively for a region, never mind a Member State."
"For example, the concentration level of chloride can vary between 20 mg/l and more than 10 000 mg/l within a 10 km radius."
"Finally, I should like to briefly draw the Members’ attention to the issue surrounding the ban on dumping."
"Amendment 43 is crucial in this respect."
"Due to the way in which drinking water is extracted in some of the Member States, namely via infiltration of surface water, it is extremely important not to introduce an absolute dumping ban."
"I would therefore ask you to vote against Amendment 43, while Amendment 103 of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is acceptable."
"I eagerly await the outcome of the forthcoming vote, although I cannot guarantee that I will be very pleased with it."
"That will depend on which amendments this House adopts."
"Mr President, groundwater pollution is caused by percolation from the surface, as a result of the use of chemical substances in agriculture, as a result of organic and inorganic pollution due to surface flows of waste water and sewage, whether free or channelled, and lastly, but no less importantly, as a result of the inadequate lining of waste disposal sites."
"Illegal discharges, which unfortunately take place in various regions of the Union, both in the new accession countries and in the older Member States, like Italy, cause severe and uncontrolled groundwater pollution."
"Introducing threshold values for pollutants at the discretion of the Member States is a serious step backwards as regards the protection of the environment."
"Maintaining a gradual approach on this issue, as the Commission plans, does not in this case mean respecting the rights of individual countries, which is something that we would welcome in many other cases, but will result in harm to the environment and to consumers."
"By looking at the labels on bottles of mineral water, consumers can perhaps judge whether or not to buy the product, but they cannot do the same for vegetables and cereals."
"I therefore hope that, in the course of the legislative process, we succeed in amending the directive and establishing identical threshold values for pollutants for all the Member States, so as to guarantee the same levels of toxicity for human beings and the environment."
"Mr President, it would seem, then, that there are more lists in circulation, but I hope that you will not point the finger at Mrs Herranz García for not having taken the trouble to warn me."
"I should like to echo the words of thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Klass, because although I know that she was of a different opinion on certain things, she had a constructive input and was prepared to help support positions that Members from other Member States saw as important."
"This directive is important, because it is about achieving an ecological balance."
"Moreover, groundwater is important for agriculture, industry and for drinking water."
"In the framework directive, we have opted for a basin-led approach, which has a bearing on the assessment of the groundwater directive."
"It means that it is impossible to apply uniform standards to certain substances, but that uniform measuring methods, and such like, must be established."
"On a different note, I have tabled Amendment 110 in relation to indirect discharges, with which Article 6 of this directive concerns itself."
"You may well ask what my intention was in doing so."
"I am from a province which has to contend with floods on a regular basis."
"As we are in the process of clearing space for rivers, we will have them widened and use some of the sediment in order to raise their banks."
"If we adopt this framework directive on water, and certainly compromise amendment 94, which has been tabled by the Group of the Greens, that means that everything that is dug out of these rivers would have to be left beside the rivers for the sake of safety of the province and the Netherlands, and that it would have to be wrapped in foil. The cost involved for the small region I come from is EUR 100 million."
"Since that cannot be the intention, I am urging you to vote in favour of Amendment 110 and reject Amendments 43 and 94."
"Mr President, today sees us facing a major political challenge."
"It is our duty to prevent natural resources from being polluted and exhausted, and, as groundwater accounts for 60% of drinking water in the Netherlands, this is sufficient reason to do all we can to prevent pollution."
"We must prescribe strict standards for the quality of our groundwater, but how strict should the threshold values be?"
"Should we impose them at European level or should we leave this up to the Member States?"
"There is quite a bit of concern in the Netherlands about European regulations, which often have repercussions for farmers, builders and companies."
"The quality of air, manure and the protection of the environment are all areas covered by directives with major consequences and difficult to explain to somebody who can see their building project grind to a complete halt because of abstract European rules."
"‘This is yet another example of Brussels interfering’."
"The Dutch Labour Party is clear in its own mind: we do not want common threshold values for our groundwater."
"Major differences, brought about by natural circumstances, in the chemical composition of groundwater in the Member States make harmonised threshold values undesirable."
"Threshold values that are too strict can lead to human activities being banned in certain areas."
"The Dutch Labour Party does not say that the Netherlands should be behind lock and key, nor is there any political backing for rules that are all too obtrusive without there being any need for them."
"That is why we are opposed to Amendments 111 and 112."
"Rest assured, though, the Dutch Labour Part is as green as ever."
"What we are in favour of, though, is an emphatic common conduct standard intended to prevent or limit the contribution of polluted substances in groundwater."
"That means that each incidence of groundwater being polluted with a number of well-defined substances is inadmissible."
"We also want the ‘polluter pays’ principle to be taken seriously."
"My amendment to translate the costs of pollution by herbicides into a levy has received broad support, which I welcome, because many town councils consider manual weeding too expensive."
"To date, the cost of pollution has not been included in chemical control."
"If that were the case, the use of harmful substances would drop."
"Finally, I should like to mention a few amendments related to nitrates and the manure issue."
"It is beyond me that precisely at a time when various Member States put a lot of work into the nitrates directive, a message is being sent that this directive might be superfluous."
"That is why we do not back those amendments, although we will be happy to support Amendment 110 tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, groundwater is a basic and valuable resource which we need to protect."
"Groundwater pollution affects rivers, lakes and valuable ecosystems, increases the cost of drinking water and threatens its secure supply."
"The Commission proposal on the protection of groundwater needs to be improved, especially as cleaning up groundwater may take decades."
"As far as prevention is concerned, our objective is to protect groundwater with preventive measures, not to try and simply improve the status of polluted water."
"We need a proposal which protects from pollution with defined criteria and limits, while the Member States need to be forced to submit periodic reports on the status of their water and the effective measures which they have taken."
"Amendment 94, which proposes preventing and limiting substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and introduces a procedure for controls by the Member States, is a positive effort to improve the report."
"According to the European Environment Agency, 87% of European groundwater does not meet the criteria for nitrates, while 10 out of 11 countries report a risk of water pollution from pesticides."
"We need strict criteria for nitrates and pesticides and I therefore call on you to vote in favour of Amendments 101 and 102."
"Another point is the ecosystems in groundwater."
"The microscopic flora and fauna help to improve the quality of groundwater and the quality of drinking water."
"Amendments 96 and 98 introduce groundwater protection zones, while Amendments 95 and 100 call for more research into groundwater ecosystems, which is why I call on you to vote for them."
"The issue of protecting groundwater against pollution in connection with supplying homes and industry is a serious one for every country and conurbation."
"Concerning the draft directive on protecting groundwater from pollution, it would seem that further work is called for, in particular as regards listing the pollutants that represent the main threats to the environment."
"It is also necessary to set threshold values for those naturally occurring substances identified as active ingredients of biocides and whose natural concentration is higher than the values proposed."
"Account should also be taken of the fact that these substances impact on the physiological activity of live organisms."
"Monitoring and research are therefore needed to establish their impact on human beings."
"I also feel it must be made very clear that in the interests of protecting groundwater, preventive and educational measures should be taken to make the population aware of the facts relating to water pollution, and to provide information on methods of protection and their implementation."
"Water should not only be protected through payments for its use, but also through penalties for wasting and polluting it."
"Furthermore, implementing measures such as legal rules and regulations need to be practical and workable."
"Mr President, the Nitrates Directive deals expressly with nitrates in groundwater."
"Why, therefore, is it necessary for this groundwater directive also to deal with nitrates?"
"It is wholly unsatisfactory to have two directives addressing the same issue with different approaches and mechanisms and, for the hapless farming community, dual enforcement."
"Either the Nitrates Directive should be repealed or compliance with one should remove the other from the equation."
"The combined effects of this directive and the Water Framework Directive will make the Nitrates Directive wholly superfluous."
"Under this directive there is a requirement to put in place trend reversal measures once pollution levels reach 75 per cent of the decreed quality standard."
"This is more demanding than the standards required under the Nitrates Directive in the nitrate-vulnerable zones."
"Again, we have conflict, contradiction and dual standards."
"We need cogent, slimmed-down regulation, not costly duplication."
"Mr President, when Mr Dimas replies to the debate in a moment, I would like to ask him if he can specifically reply and give us the opinion of the Commission on Amendments 111, 112 and 94 and the amendments that the previous speaker has just mentioned about nitrates?"
"It would be very interesting for all of us to have the opinion of the Commission specifically on those."
"I would like to focus quickly on 111 and 112, the two amendments which the rapporteur appeared to endorse in her opening speech, which deal with the application of the universal standards through the groundwater directive."
"As she knows, this idea was rejected in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in favour of the framework approach of the Commission on the basis of river-basin management."
"Are those of us who oppose universal standards correct in saying that river-basin management or local management of the groundwater directive would mean that you do not need universal standards?"
"Many speakers have commented on how important it is to recognise that it would be crazy to try to implement universal standards."
"Forty per cent of European groundwater is already well over the standard set in the Florenz amendments."
"I am sorry that as rapporteur Mrs Klaß used her time as speaker to endorse amendments that she knew the committee had rejected."
"Just a quick second point. The origin of the groundwater directive is really the impact of landfill sites on groundwater quality."
"Can the Commissioner reassure us that the Commission really is following up the landfill directive?"
"We are told that there are still thousands of illegal landfills in France, Italy and other countries."
"If this is the case it makes nonsense of our trying to get better standards for groundwater when the origin of the trouble is still in place."
"Mr President, after the many criticisms that certain Member States have levelled at the rapporteur, it is time for some more praise for her, and from the mouth of an Austrian Member at that."
"I believe she has done a very constructive job of work, and the issue with which she is dealing is one for which it is not only necessary to get a majority in this House, as the dividing lines really do run between the various groups."
"I believe it to be important that these uniform standards, as proposed in various amendments, should apply to the most important pollutants right across Europe in order to avoid not only distortions of competition, but also environmental dumping."
"Article 6 of the Groundwater Directive contains additional provisions on the protection of groundwater bodies, for the Water Framework Directive has nothing to say about how the indirect introduction of pollutants is to be addressed."
"In that respect – and as regards the way in which it enables us to send out a very penetrating and clear signal about the protection of the environment – I regard Article 6 as very important, and I also hope that this House will reject any attempts at watering it down."
"Amendment 45, which envisages a general derogation for good agricultural practice, I regard as counter-productive in terms of groundwater protection."
"Despite the provisions on adherence to good agricultural practice, which have been in force for years, the agricultural sector is still the most significant source of impurities in groundwater."
"According to the latest report by the European Environmental Agency, every groundwater body in the EU exceeds the threshold values for nitrates, and these make up 87% of the groundwater in agricultural areas."
"Although some Members – it appears to me to be a large number of them – have come to the conclusion that the Nitrates Directive is superfluous, I believe that conclusion to be false; what is superfluous, in my view, is today’s debate."
"Today, we are to vote on a directive designed ostensibly to protect and improve groundwater in the EU."
"That is something it may, in some places, achieve, moreover, by means of limit values on the quantity of, for example, spray pesticides in the water."
"In Denmark, a decentralised system supplies us with groundwater that has not been chemically purified and that we drink directly."
"For us, it therefore seems wrong to allow poison in groundwater."
"We need to react not only when a limit value or upper limit has been reached."
"We must react as soon as we can measure the fact that a pesticide or its breakdown product has penetrated the root zone of the earth’s crust."
"Pesticides should only be approved specifically on condition that they cannot penetrate the top stratum of the earth and so reach the groundwater."
"When we can measure the pesticides and their breakdown products in the water, it was a mistake to have approved them, and they must immediately cease to be used."
"In Denmark, we have by far the most bans on the use of pesticides, but the EU now wishes to lift some of these. This shows that, despite the Constitution’s talk of a high level of protection, the most stringent protection can be removed."
"It also shows that the so-called environmental guarantee is, for the most part, propaganda. Groundwater is, of course, one area in which special rules in Denmark can be justified, because we drink non-purified groundwater."
"Not even in the light of this will it, however, be accepted that we are entitled to special consideration. How are we supposed to prove that Danes are more vulnerable than Germans to, for example, allergy-producing and carcinogenic substances."
"The June Movement’s amendment is designed to ensure that intervention takes place as soon as there is a measurable level of pollution. If this amendment cannot be adopted, I would call upon the Commission to declare that countries in which non-purified groundwater is drunk directly can introduce a higher level of protection."
"Thank you, Mr President, even though there is not so far a very great deal to say thank you for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though two thirds of the Earth is covered with water, we can still use no more than 1% of it for drinking – that we know."
"We find clean water from the tap the most obvious thing in the world, but elsewhere thousands of children are dying every day as a result of waterborne diseases."
"What that clearly shows is that drinking water is first among all foodstuffs, and that we must, of course, protect our groundwater throughout Europe, so that we do not end up in future turning our own tap off and sentencing future generations to a similar fate."
"Although the quantity of water in the world remains unchanged, the quality of groundwater is impaired by pollution from agriculture, building work, landfill sites, residual contamination and increased traffic."
"It follows that it makes a great deal of sense to lay down uniform standards and measuring procedures for groundwater quality throughout the EU, and, inadequate though this report is in my view, it is for that reason that I, too, will be voting in favour of it."
"As the report itself observes, impurities can become apparent as long as decades later, and so it is absolutely vital to handle these living resources with care."
"The increased value attached to organic agriculture as a consequence of the reform of the CAP was a step in the right direction, but if we promote such things as transport or trans-European convoys or the intensive use of insecticides in the cultivation of maize or tobacco, for example, we are also making it more likely that groundwater will be polluted."
"In the light of this, we should therefore take a critical and penetrating look at our support schemes."
"For me, as a Member from Austria, a country with large reserves of drinking water, which are vital and precious to us, careful handling of water, particularly of groundwater, throughout Europe is important."
"If we do not, it is inevitable that many more people will be casting covetous eyes in the direction of our water, and that is something we want to avoid."
"Mr President, the first thing I would like to say is that the problem that has arisen in relation to speakers is solely and entirely due to an error within my group’s whip services, and it is therefore their responsibility to explain the situation to the Members affected."
"Turning to this report by Mrs Klaß, I would like to point out that farmers will probably be the sector most affected by the Directive on the protection of groundwater that we are discussing, and that, despite this, their opinion has not been taken into account when producing the draft we have on the table."
"In many European regions, agriculture guarantees the existence of plant mass that prevents the desertification of the land, a phenomenon that leads to a significant increase in the natural pollutants in groundwater."
"The drastic reduction in this agricultural activity, which some people apparently want to see, would therefore run counter to the very objectives of the Directive that we are debating today."
"Secondly, I would like to express my disappointment at the lack of interest shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in the amendments presented by this Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in particular those that call for ‘quantity of water’ to be taken into account when establishing the factors that contribute to the pollution of groundwater."
"The smaller aquifers, such as those often found in many southern regions of Europe, particularly during dry seasons, reach higher salinity levels and hence greater concentrations of sulphate;"
"I would insist that this salinity is closely related to volumes of water, and this has not been taken into account in the report we are dealing with."
"I also reject the establishment of Community standards to replace national thresholds with quality standards, since that would introduce a static element which is incompatible with the diversity of soils and waters in many European regions."
"Furthermore, the farmers will be the main victims of these measures, because the tolerance levels of certain substances, in particular sulphates, which are generated by nature itself in many areas, depend on the characteristics of soils and crops, and there are examples of crops, such as rice, which endure higher levels of sulphates than other plant species."
"Therefore, to establish Community standards for this type of substance, which at no point endangers the health of consumers, could lead to unjustified halts in irrigation."
"Mr President, groundwater is a priceless natural resource, not a national resource, and it should be treated as a resource without which humanity cannot survive."
"Consequently we have no right to compromise on the quality of water or to cut deals here on the quality of water."
"We must err on the side of precaution, not on the side of cost."
"I have no confidence at all that Member States will maintain or indeed establish adequate standards."
"They have failed to do so up to now."
"They have allowed thousands of illegal dumps right across Europe, including in Ireland."
"Ireland has not yet implemented the 1992 Nitrates Directive."
"Thirteen years later it still has not implemented that directive, not because it is not necessary – it is absolutely necessary in Ireland – but because it is afraid of the Irish Farmers Association."
"I want to conclude by saying that we must not only set stringent standards, we must set strict and severe penalties for those Member States which fail to meet those standards and we should not hide behind the principle of subsidiarity, which is simply escaping from our responsibilities."
"Mr President, groundwater can be polluted in a great many ways and the man in the street is unaware of most of them, hence the importance of measures concerning education and prevention."
"Schools need to be targeted, and also the main users of water, who are intent on poisoning the environment as if they themselves were immortal."
"It is crucially important for the Cohesion Fund to remain at the level initially proposed by the European Commission, as it is supporting the enormous task of protecting the waters of the new EU Member States."
"We should not skimp on building infrastructure, sewage systems and treatment plants, because this is the only way of evening out the enormous differences between the various countries."
"The natural environment of Central and Eastern Europe was abused by heavy industry working to meet the demand for armaments."
"It is vital that the Member States meet the deadline for submitting data concerning the condition of groundwater, as such an overview is essential for precise and efficient monitoring in the future."
"Parliament has raised the issue of the quantitative status of groundwater."
"The draft directive sets out to deal exclusively with the chemical condition of water, with reference to Article 17 of the Water Framework Directive, so this is not the right time to introduce provisions concerning the quantitative status of water into the draft."
"Amendment 7 and Amendment 10 should therefore be rejected."
"Amendment 54 concerns new provisions for the protection of spas and medicinal water sources."
"It should be supported, as to date EU legislation has not dealt with the protection of these special high-quality waters."
"Provision does need to be made for them, and I would ask the Commissioner and the European Commission as a whole to pay particular attention to this matter."
"Mr President, the proposed directive is intended to ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and evaluated across Europe in a harmonised way."
"The proposed approach to establishing quality criteria is both flexible and iterative, taking account of local characteristics and allowing further improvements."
"This directive responds directly to Article 17 of the 2000 Water Framework Directive, and we have been waiting for it for some time."
"The approach of the Commission is to establish groundwater quality standards at EU level for nitrates and pesticides – on which many colleagues have commented – and to allow Member States themselves to establish threshold values for a range of other substances such as arsenic and cadmium, a minimum list of which is set out in the directive."
"I agree with that approach, as there is no need for any further harmonisation across Europe."
"We must respect differences in climate and soil type."
"I shall go one step further."
"Eventually that approach, which allows Member States to decide on the basis of river-basin management plans – which under the Framework Directive will eventually manage all freshwater sources once they are put in place – will also allow Member States to manage their nitrate and pesticide pollutants."
"We should eventually take this approach to everything."
"The Nitrates Directive has been mentioned."
"Farmers also need and want clean water."
"Nobody can be allowed to pollute our groundwater or freshwater with nitrates or anything else."
"However, a one-size-fits-all policy has proved extremely difficult, as colleagues have said, with 12 out of 15 of the older Member States currently in court for non-transposition or improper transposition of the Nitrates Directive."
"It was never a comfortable directive."
"It never fitted properly, because we did not respect the differences in Member States and we did not trust Member States to monitor their own pollution in that area."
"I wish to ask Commissioner Dimas specifically why he continues to allow the Irish Government to add a pollutant, fluoride, to our public drinking water supply."
"I know it is not directly an issue for the Commission, but how can we stand up here and wax eloquent about water safety and about water being essential for life – on which we all agree – if we continue to allow a Member State to pollute the public water supply with fluoride?"
"I ask the Commissioner to do something about that urgently or all this legislation – framework directives, water directives and so on – will come to nought."
"Mr President, just a few days after April 22, Earth Day, it is perhaps no exaggeration to claim that water, which covers most of our planet, and is the largest component of all living organisms, and which can also be found in solid form in the polar regions and in gaseous form in air, is the most important component of our life and our greatest resource."
"This directive is aimed at protecting one of the most important treasuries of this resource, groundwater, and although we have a common goal, our solutions differ."
"It is my belief that norms need to be established at a Community level, as the good quality of continuous bodies of water, that reach beyond state borders, can only be guaranteed if neighbouring countries are all bound by strict provisions."
"Of course, when we talk of qualitative norms, the different natural characteristics of the soil and bodies of water must be taken into consideration."
"Naturally occurring substances in water must be examined when setting limit values; the high arsenic content of groundwater in the Southern Plains region in Hungary is a good example."
"The proposal for a directive continues to prohibit direct discharge of pollutants into groundwater."
"In the case of permitting indirect discharge, I find it crucial that the presence of other pollutants encumbering the given environment is taken into consideration."
"I was glad to find that my relevant proposal for amendment was welcomed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Another valuable part of the report is that it promotes the definition of protection areas for aquifers which supply medicinal water sources."
"In order to improve the quality of groundwater, current agricultural practice must be changed, contamination from disused waste disposal plants, for instance, must be dealt with, and action plans and resources are needed."
"Let us clearly define now how vital these issues are so that Member States will take this important environmental task seriously."
"Finally, let me congratulate Commissioner Klaß on this excellent report on the proposal for a directive, that after its adoption, will play a crucial part in the protection of groundwater after 2003."
"Mr President, everyone agrees with the objectives of this proposed directive."
"Differences exist as to how we are going to achieve those objectives: the optimist in me says we are almost halfway there."
"Groundwater is a major national resource."
"In Ireland groundwater and aquifers provide one quarter of our drinking water."
"Monitoring of Irish groundwater by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that there is no widespread contamination of individual aquifers."
"Most samples taken by the agency reflected unpolluted conditions."
"This is as it should be and it is good news, but we need vigilance."
"We need uniform measurement techniques across the EU, but we do not need common threshold values other than for nitrates and pesticides."
"Soil and subsoil types are important considerations in characterising the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination."
"These vary considerably throughout the Union."
"Equally, however, allowing for different threshold values in Member States to take account of these local natural conditions must not lead to unacceptable differences in the protection level or distortions in competition and trade."
"As we have already heard, experience with the Nitrates Directive has not been good and it should guide us in how we frame the groundwater directive."
"The Nitrates Directive fails to take account of climate or soil conditions in Member States."
"It prescribes a very rigid regime of farming by dates: not exactly as nature intended."
"It may well do more harm than good."
"The debacle over nitrates does little to endear the Commission to EU citizens."
"A similar fate must not befall the groundwater directive."
"Mr President, I too should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for her commitment."
"Good though it was that she should be so committed from the start, the report now produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety appears to tend towards tightening up the Commission’s original proposal;"
"Amendments 43, 103 and 94 to it certainly do."
"I wonder how Parliament intends to deal with those."
"Acceptance of those amendments will once again result in an increase in the burden and cost, particularly for European agriculture and horticulture – two areas that are self-evidently bound to benefit from clean water."
"Although the proposal, fortunately, also leaves sufficient room for subsidiarity, it cannot be denied that when the budget for European agricultural policy is reduced and the markets become more deregulated, it will drive up still more the cost price for European agriculture and horticulture."
"It is unacceptable that this House should on the one hand increase the burden and on the other hand deregulate the markets even further, it thereby puts the European countryside in an impossible position."
"I would like to urge this House in any event not to make the Commission proposal any more stringent, and certainly to vote against Amendments 43 and 94."
"I should also like to back Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s Amendment 110, which would make the groundwater directive considerably more workable with regard to river policy in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I, too would like to join in thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, who was very cooperative in drafting this report."
"One of Europe’s greatest treasures flows in our innumerable springs, streams and rivers, and so it is our responsibility to protect our water resources."
"It is for that reason that the protection of groundwater must be among the Community’s foremost environmental priorities."
"We also have to bear in mind the fact that it is much harder to remove impurities from polluted groundwater than from surface waters."
"It is also often used to provide drinking water, and, if it is polluted, those pollutants can be a hazard to human health, which will in turn impose a burden on our healthcare systems."
"By adopting the Water Framework Directive, we agreed that Europe’s waters should be of good chemical status by 2015."
"These daughter directives which we are now to adopt must lay down procedures and parameters whereby this high quality standard may prevail throughout the Community."
"Amendments 111 and 112 are intended to enact annexes stipulating the level of these parameters."
"Were we not to lay down such values, this Water Framework Directive would be toothless and hard to apply."
"We are not, however, trying to apply the same standards to everything in the Community, but rather to ensure a high standard of quality in groundwater for the good of the public, while very definitely taking account of local and regional differences, particularly geological conditions."
"It is for that reason that we have tabled Amendment 91, which takes account of differing conditions throughout Europe."
"What we need, though, is precise procedures and not the vague approaches that the Commission has proposed, if we are to be able to lay down these parameters."
"I therefore reject the Commission’s proposals for this."
"As for the demand for the revision and possible suspension of the Nitrates Directive, which is what is sought via Amendments 108 and 109, I am opposed to this principally on legal grounds."
"What agriculture throughout Europe needs is not distorted competition, but a level playing field."
". Mr President, the Commission believes that, given the current lack of knowledge about the environmental quality of groundwater and the huge variety of natural conditions which exist in Europe, it is not technically feasible, nor is it desirable to introduce on this basis new standards for a more comprehensive list of substances at the level of the European Union."
"That is why the Commission proposed a small number of quality standards at European Union level and took care to ensure that the Member States would adopt appropriate threshold values for other dangerous substances which are considered to be a risk to groundwater."
"The term 'threshold value' was used purely and simply to distinguish the national standards in question from the standards at European Union level."
"Nonetheless, we accept that the adoption of the term 'threshold values' may cause confusion."
"That is why we are prepared to accept in principle Amendments 17 and 57 and the related Amendments 30, 31 34, 69, 70 and 71."
"Using the term 'groundwater quality standards' throughout the text clarifies at the same time that, for certain substances, the quality standards in question will be adopted at European Union level and that, for other substances, the standards in question will be adopted by the Member States."
"The Commission likewise welcomes Amendment 65, which calls for the adoption of a common methodology in the proposal, so that groundwater quality standards are adopted on the basis of common criteria."
"As far as the compliance procedure is concerned, the Commission is in a position to agree in principle with Amendments 28, 29 and 58, in order to allow some degree of flexibility when the good chemical status of groundwater is defined."
"However, greater flexibility cannot mean compromise as far as environmental targets are concerned, and the text must be absolutely clear on this point."
"Amendments 1 and 2 propose that it should be clarified that the directive concerns the protection of groundwater against chemical pollution and deterioration, a proposal which we can support."
"Nonetheless, the references to parameters relating to drinking water, as defined in Amendments 3 and 4, would appear to be off the mark, given that the proposal focuses on environmental targets relating to groundwater, while the measures for drinking water are satisfactorily covered by Article 7 of the Water Framework Directive."
"As regards Amendment 94, which numerous speakers referred to today, I should like to clarify that the Commission cannot accept it."
"The proposed changes may cause confusion and water down the arrangements which already exist in the Water Framework Directive."
"Similarly, I am not in a position to accept amendments touching on matters which are already covered by the Water Framework Directive."
"This applies to Amendments 7, 10 and 15 relating to the quantitative aspects of groundwater management, Amendment 16 referring to the characterisation of groundwater and Amendment 52 referring to the 'polluter pays' principle."
"Amendments 21 and 22, relating to the new definitions of deterioration and background concentration, are acceptable to the Commission."
"However, acceptance of Amendments 23 and 49, which propose a new definition and separate system for historical contaminated sites, cannot be supported, given that management of the sites in question does not come within the scope of the present proposal."
"As far as monitoring is concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendments 14, 41 and 43 on the need to tighten up demands in relation to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive relating to the harmonisation of measurement methods and the compatibility and pertinence of the related data."
"As regards preventing and limiting discharges to groundwater, the Commission is in a position to accept in principle the majority of the clarifications proposed in Amendments 19, 20, 43 and 48."
"As regards determining and reversing trends in the quality of groundwater, the Commission agrees with Amendment 37 on the attention which needs to be given to increases in concentrations as a result of human activity."
"Other amendments, including Amendments 38 and 39, concerning the reference to baseline concentrations and the special assessment of trends in relation to point sources of pollution, are accepted by the Commission."
"Finally, Amendments 74, 75 and 79 concerning technical specifications are acceptable to the Commission, whereas others, such as Amendments 76 to 78 and 83 to 85, are acceptable in principle but require further clarification."
"Amendments 108 and 109 on the possible review and repeal of the directive on nitrates cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"The directive on nitrates has helped to reduce pollution from farming and will continue to help in future."
"The Water Framework Directive, the directive on nitrates and the present proposal for a directive on groundwater are complementary and mutually supportive."
"In reply to the question asked, I wish to emphasise that the directive on nitrates only covers zones which are sensitive to nitrates, while the directive on groundwater will apply to the whole of Europe."
"Amendments 111 and 112 are not accepted by the Commission, because they introduce standards at European level for various pollutants, which the Commission believes should be left, for the time being, to the Member States."
"To close, I should like to emphasise that many of the amendments are useful in clarifying the proposal and improve how it stands in relation to the Water Framework Directive and the previous directive on groundwater."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission is in a position to accept 31 amendments in full and a further 44 amendments in principle or in part."
"Nonetheless, 48 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission."
"I am giving the Bureau a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments(1)."
"Finally, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur for her efforts."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"The Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle Amendments 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 97, 103, 106, 113."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 16, 18, 21, 23, 27, 40, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 62, 80, 88, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123."
"The next item is the report (A6-0068/2005) by Mrs Handzlik, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the internal market in the new Member States: situation, opportunities and lessons to be learnt."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all those whose valuable remarks helped to improve the quality of my report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your interest in this issue, which has been apparent from the amendments you have tabled and the numerous debates and conversations that have taken place, has made it clear that the subject of my report is of great importance to many of you."
"It is worth mentioning that this report did not simply involve data collection and the analysis of statistics; it also drew on my personal experience."
"I have managed medium-sized enterprises for the last 15 years, and learnt at grass roots level what conditions are required for the sustainable growth and development of such enterprises."
"The internal market must become a single economic entity and a driving force for the economy, and this will only happen when all the Member States fully implement the directives concerning the internal market and all the others aimed at improving its operation."
"A situation in which certain countries move forward by transposing and implementing directives, whilst others drag their feet, is simply unacceptable."
"The success of the internal market is closely bound up with cooperation between countries, and a concerted effort is the only way of achieving the results we all long for."
"With this in mind, the European Council suggested a 1.5% limit for the transposition deficit of directives to apply to all Member States."
"Research contained in the report concerning transposition of the directives by individual Member States, and in particular by the new ones, is surprisingly encouraging."
"At the beginning of November 2004, the lowest deficit concerning transposition of directives was 2.1%."
"This was actually recorded in the new Member States, and contrasts with the average for the Union as a whole, namely 5%."
"Information returned a month later, at the end of November 2004, showed failure to comply in the new Member States had fallen to 1.8%, and the average for the whole Union had fallen to 3.6%."
"The statistics quoted clearly indicate that the situation regarding transposition is improving."
"This improvement came about after just one month of effort and commitment."
"Only when all the countries have transposed and implemented the directives will it be possible to lift the remaining barriers to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital without delay, thus making the internal market a reality."
"This is why I am making the following proposals. Firstly, the special procedure introduced by the Commission for dealing with cases of infringement of Community provisions applicable to the new Member States that failed to undertake transposition should become standard for all, and apply to all Member States."
"Secondly, the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard should be upgraded to become an official European Council document."
"It should be recognised as the main point of reference regarding the status of transposition in conjunction with data on the state of transposition of directives made available by all the Member States and updated regularly."
"Thirdly, the Scoreboard should be used to name and shame all Member States lagging behind in the transposition process."
"Fourthly, proper financial support for the out-of-court conflict resolution instrument from SOLVIT must be ensured, as that method of dealing with problems has already proved a success."
"In addition to transposition and implementation of directives, account should also be taken of the additional factors contributing to the development of the internal market, and consequently to the growth of the European economy."
"In this connection, it is essential for the new Member States to invest more in research and development, as their investment is currently below the European average."
"These new Member States should also create an environment that is more conducive to links between research institutions and business."
"As a citizen and former entrepreneur from one of the new Member States I am also aware of the need to create a more effective system of education and training."
"In addition, more information on how the Union works and on its legislation should be made available in the new Member States."
"A survey of entrepreneurs confirmed this view."
"In many of the new Member States, the education system is out of date."
"Students are taught subjects and trades that are not appropriate to the needs of the market."
"It is important to bear in mind that the better society is educated and informed, the better the quality of work provided will be."
"Simplification of current Union legislation is called for too."
"This will promote the development of businesses, trade and services, and stimulate the growth of the European economy."
"The services directive is also essential to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"In the context of the economies of both old and new Member States, a good services directive will amount to an opportunity to reduce unemployment and regional disparities."
"It will lead to the creation of new jobs and to greater competitiveness, as well as to higher quality services and more opportunities for consumers to exercise their right to choose."
"It is therefore best to rid ourselves of the emotions and fears generated by this directive from the outset."
"What is actually needed is constructive action to ensure that the most appropriate version of this directive comes into force at the optimum moment for us all."
"As I conclude, I should like to thank Mrs Kallenbach for her involvement and for the draft amendment she has tabled."
"Nonetheless, I propose that her amendment be rejected, because discussion of the services directive is ongoing and we do not yet know what form the directive will eventually take."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that the solutions and suggestions I have proposed will meet with your approval."
". Mr President, nearly a year has passed since the ten new Member States acceded to the European Union."
"Since 1 May 2004, the European Union has been by far the biggest internal market in the world, with 25 countries and more than 450 million people."
"Before May 2004, certain critics stated that the European Union was being enlarged at an excessively fast pace and without adequate preparation, that the candidate countries were still not ready and that everything would end in disaster and tears."
"In the end, the cataclysm did not happen on 1 May 2004."
"Enlargement was prepared properly and I should like to add that the new Member States demonstrated a positive stand, efficiency and dedication during preparations for their accession."
"Today, almost 12 months since the enlargement of Europe, we find that the European Union, and the ten new Member States especially, have made particularly impressive progress."
"There are numerous aspects and numerous instances of the development of the internal market in the new Member States that one could mention."
"The Commission is sure that the delegation of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection which is visiting Poland could also cite numerous other such successes."
"The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for this important own initiative report."
"We are particularly satisfied with the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the internal market in the new Member States."
"Almost one year after the enlargement of the European Union, the report by Mrs Handzlik comments, we are satisfied to note, with a particularly penetrating eye, on the – to a large degree – positive image of the operation of the internal market in the new Member States."
"The analysis and recommendations contained in the report summarise the achievements and the objectives which will ensure that the internal market operates as smoothly as possible."
"Allow me to refer briefly to certain points of the report."
"The proper transposition of Community legislation is prerequisite to the smooth operation of the internal market."
"The Member States must perform their duties; some do so very well, others are lagging behind."
"However, what is truly impressive in the new Member States is the targets which have been attained over the last two years."
"In particular, the new Member States have done very well in transposing Community legislation into national law."
"According to the most recent information, Lithuania is top of the league of the 25 Member States, with a transposition deficit of just 1%."
"Certain old Member States have not done as well."
"The Member States must address more seriously the 1.5% target, which was agreed at various meetings of the European Council."
"They must also make a greater effort to ensure that directives on the internal market are transposed correctly and on time."
"The conclusions of the resolution are absolutely in keeping with the Commission's position including, for example, on the need for more intensive administrative cooperation between the authorities of the Member States, as is already happening in the SOLVIT problem-solving network."
"These procedures for resolving differences amicably satisfy the market players and make a positive contribution to the operation of the internal market in Europe."
"It is clear that the new Member States are not confining themselves to pronouncements; on the contrary, they are particularly willing to improve their performance and to create the right conditions for the development of innovation, which is most encouraging."
"This is precisely the approach that guarantees the success of the internal market."
"We must not forget that the smooth operation of the internal market is one of the basic preconditions to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives."
"However, I should like to add that the Commission will need, in turn, to do its job."
"Instead of producing more and more legislation, we will now need to take advantage of the opportunity to focus on doing less but better work."
"This includes the simplification of legislation, in close cooperation with the new Member States and with the old Member States, and providing better information and guidance in connection with consumer rights and the opportunities citizens have to work and establish in an enlarged Union."
"In coming years, we must make the European Union a more attractive location for business activity and investment and the creation of a modern and successful internal market certainly constitutes an important first step towards achieving this objective."
"We are relying on the support of the European Parliament to face this challenge."
"To close, I should like to say this: we are optimistic and believe that the new Member States bring new momentum to the European Union and are a breath of fresh air which benefits us all."
"for the . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to congratulate rapporteur Mrs Handzlik on her very successful first report in the European Parliament and to thank the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection for its initiative to prepare this important report."
"With the latest enlargement, 10 new states became members of the European Union as from 1 May 2004, but only in the legal meaning of the word."
"In reality, our countries will have to carry out a lot of work in various areas in order to gradually become fully fledged Member States."
"One of these areas is the transposition of directives and other Community acts to their national legal systems with a view to building a functioning, barrier-free common internal market."
"The report gives a concise overview of the state of the transposition of European legislation in individual Member States."
"Although my country – Slovakia – often called the ‘central European tiger’ under the competent leadership of Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda – belongs among the EU Member States that do not have the best track record of the transposition of European legislation, economic reforms have enabled the country to make big strides in implementing the medium-term economic strategy."
"To eliminate the remaining obstacles in the internal market, it is absolutely necessary to consolidate and improve the European legislation."
"The Commission should start revising the existing Community legislation with a view to its simplification."
"I am firmly opposed to bureaucratic directives that regulate and prescribe everything."
"We should, in conformity with the subsidiarity principle, let the Member States do what they can do with greater flexibility and effectiveness."
"On the other hand, we need the directives that have liberalising effects."
"Let us not be afraid to expediently adopt a new service directive, maybe similar to the one of Bolkenstein, that will breathe new life into the revised Lisbon strategy."
"I firmly believe this and I think so do many of you."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, in the name of the European Socialists, I welcome the report; its contents are accurate and contain feasible recommendations."
"I am especially glad that we are debating this report almost exactly on the first anniversary of the accession."
"According to the report, the has not only been fully implemented by several new Member States to the required extent, but often even with extra rigour that most of the existing Members have not yet applied."
"Interestingly enough, instead of improving the Internal Market, it partly distorted it at the same time, for the following reasons: succeeding the political changeover, the countries have only made partial progress in economic reforms."
"98% of the business structure is characterised by small and medium enterprises that struggle with capital deficit and their access to information is limited."
"The prolonged costs involved with adopting the will still remain a burden for new Member States for several more years."
"On the other hand, enlargement with these ten plus two Members brought about some less frequently emphasised general changes as well as those which existed earlier."
"The nearly 150 million new members make up one third of the EU’s population."
"Around the time of accession, the economies of the existing Member States, unlike those at previous enlargements, are less prosperous and they are awaiting reforms themselves."
"It is a good thing with the current enlargement, that there no longer exists two world systems."
"Politicians carry a great responsibility."
"Politicians, who regard the EP as an international stage for national political debate – even though originally it was not their intention – become obstacles to solving EU problems."
"A European politician strives to create a framework for solution at an EU level, where all Member States may find the crutches that they need in order to take their next step at home."
"I hope we all belong to this group."
"What should we do?"
"We need a political style that is clear, factual and calms emotions, instead of stirring them up."
"We need to restore quickly the balance of the Internal Market, which is most definitely guaranteed to limit the movement of the labour force."
"For the new Member States, completing the Internal Market means proper functioning of the administrative system, while in the case of the majority of existing Member States, it includes meeting their own target of the 1.5% deficit limit."
"Future European legislation must not lead to the distortion of the Internal Market (like the Service Directive did, for example), nor should it encumber the economy with enormous costs (see Directive on Rice, for instance), especially affecting disadvantaged parties."
"It is the responsibility of politicians and of the whole institutional system to put law into daily practice governing the life of European citizens."
"A good example of this is the department of DG Enterprise that supports small enterprises, including the European Information Centres, which are so successful in Hungary and other countries."
"A negative example, however, is that the forms used to differentiate between enterprises are still not available in all the languages of the Member States."
"A politician once said, ‘people are not prisoners of their fate, but of their opinions’."
"We must do our best in order to bring about change, instead of political bluffing ..."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to say something about this outstanding report by Mrs Handzlik, to whom I would also like to express my gratitude."
"Along with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we visited the businesses in her Chamber of Commerce. She must be a paragon of how people in the new Member States view the Internal Market and I think that her report also reflects this and draws on it."
"I would like to congratulate her on this, and to say, in this connection, that the new Member States have sacrificed a great deal in order to be able to meet Europe’s conditions."
"They tightened their belts for years and, as the report states, have in many cases, been even more efficient than many old Member States in introducing the ."
"It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to be given more scope for imposing sanctions, thereby facilitating the enforced implementation of directives, because that will only stimulate, improve and optimise the free market even more."
"The internal market has brought us economic prosperity, which, in turn, guarantees political stability, which leads to peace, and I think that was why it was decided at an early stage to add a large number of new Member States to the European Union."
"I am pleased that Mrs Gebhardt has somewhat broadened the discussion on the Services Directive, because services are one of the key areas which have not been liberalised as yet."
"I think it is necessary to have a good discussion so as to end up with an excellent result for this Services Directive."
"I think that the debate thus far sends a very weak message to the new Member States."
"Indeed, it would be detrimental if we gave the new Member States the idea that despite their many sacrifices, and despite the fact that the old Member States welcome new markets with open arms, we do not appreciate any extra competition."
"We Liberals take the view that competition leads to innovation, which, in turn, leads to new jobs."
"It is impossible to keep the cheap workforces in Europe."
"Unfortunately, we have to establish that they go off to China."
"I therefore believe that innovative jobs with added value are beneficial to the market, and I hope that we, in that respect, can wrap up the Services Directive in a positive manner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Mrs Handzlik, for your report, and for your efforts in identifying the challenges faced by the new Member States, in particular, in the process – as yet unfinished – of completing the internal market."
"Cooperation with you has been good, and we owe you thanks for having taken on board a number of our suggestions, but, despite that, our group has nonetheless voted against this report in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"We have done this not out of some sort of opposition to an open and truly functioning European internal market – quite the contrary, in fact, for it is one of the most important conditions for the European Union to grow together."
"Nor do we have any objection to many of the passages in the report, but we do have misgivings about some of its conclusions."
"Almost a year ago, we rejoiced with the new Member States, for it was more than a matter of necessity for most of them that, after more than 60 years’ separation from it, they should regain the position in Europe to which their cultural history self-evidently entitled them."
"Our group does, however, wish to express its opposition to the unhindered operation of what are termed market forces."
"We have no desire to see unfair competition engaged in to the detriment of highly motivated and dedicated workers from the new Member States."
"We do not want them to be fobbed off with the lowest wages that employers can get away with paying and to have inadequate access to support from trade unions and social partners."
"We want quality standards and social factors to continue to be built in all 25 Member States, with the environment and consumers still being protected."
"As we are at the moment particularly concerned with the Commission’s proposed services directive, we have again tabled an amendment on this subject, which expresses our implacable opposition to the country of origin principle."
"While I am aware that this is contrary to the rapporteur’s thinking, I would nonetheless ask for your support."
". – Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is truly greatly surprised by the reference in the report to the undeniable economic success of the internal market and the assessment that it has been a driving force in the promotion of economic cohesion and the progressive removal of regional disparities."
"I agree absolutely with this assessment, if and insofar as the reference to economic success concerns businesses."
"Without doubt, it has indeed been a huge success for them."
"However, we were under the impression that the internal market was part of the efforts of the European Union to remove regional disparities and offer a better quality of life to all European citizens."
"From this point of view, the internal market has failed, just as the Lisbon policy has failed and just as all the policies based on the neoliberal philosophy will continue to fail."
"We need radical restructuring and to again make the citizen the centre of interest of the Union; we need a strategy that focuses on people."
"What we need today is to achieve real convergence in the quality of life of all the citizens of the Union, not convergence of local economies in numerical terms, convergence which contributes to the prosperity and smooth operation of the free market system, but not to the prosperity of European citizens."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Handzlik, the rapporteur, for her all-encompassing research, and I have to say that the report shows that, one year after they have become part of the European Union internal market, all in all the situation in the new Member States with regard to the adoption of legislation does not seem any worse than in the older Member States."
"We can see an almost equal proportion of positive and negative examples in both the older and the new Member States."
"Business people in the new Member States are still having difficulties in acquiring the operating mechanism of the internal market, particularly in sectors which are not harmonised."
"In the harmonised spheres, however, the infrastructure for conformity assessment is not always accessible to them in their own countries for the products which they produce."
"I could go on enumerating separate problems, but these cannot eclipse the achievements of the European Union’s internal market."
"However, even relatively recently, we heard concerns being expressed in all the countries that were then still EU applicant countries that the free movement of goods might be disastrous for economies experiencing the shocks of a change of economic system."
"Industry that was still weak would not be able to withstand the competition of powerful producers in EU Member States."
"Certainly, many businesses in the new Member States that had not consolidated their position in the market went bankrupt as a result of competitive pressure from businesses in the older Member States, but business activity has of course not decreased."
"Quite the contrary: the increase in competition has activated the market, and consumers have, of course, gained from this."
"We can observe a surprising degree of similarity between the opinions of that time about the threats the European Union common market might pose to the new Member States and today’s debates about the possible threats posed by the European Union services directive to the older Member States."
"The most striking similarity in these debates is the way consumers’ interests are being ignored."
"The consumer is not being listened to."
"It is the opinion of businesses who are worried about a possible increase in competition that is being expressed."
"The first amendment tabled on today’s agenda, to reject the country of origin principle for services in the internal market, is in point of fact equivalent to a proposal to reject the internal market."
"The country of origin principle is the ruling principle in European Union internal market legislation, and the decisions of the European Court of Justice have confirmed this."
"In those service sectors where competition currently exists, the market gains from additional competition and, of course, the consumer also gains."
"Currently, even successful small and medium-sized enterprises in Member States are prevented from crossing the borders of their own countries in order to offer services in other Member States because of the high financial and bureaucratic costs."
"The application of the country of origin principle to the provision of services would open up the European Union internal market to the most important service providers in the Member States, that is small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Arguments about the threat to the European social model are completely rebutted by the directive adopted almost ten years ago concerning the placement of workers in the services sector."
"Consumers wish to obtain goods and services of the highest possible quality and for the lowest possible price, but the best way to ensure this is a competitive market and the European Union internal ..."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Handzlik for drafting such an interesting report on the situation of the internal market in the new Member States."
"I should also like to share with you two thoughts on the report."
"The average citizen of poorer societies assesses the internal market mainly in terms of the changes in the price of goods and services following accession to the Union."
"Prices of many basic products and services increased dramatically, and there is no economic justification for this."
"Mechanisms designed to ensure competitiveness and systems of consumer protection failed."
"In Socialist times we were supposed to be cheered by the news that the price of locomotives was down even though the price of bread was up."
"What grounds for optimism are there in the present situation?"
"My second observation concerns the problem of market monopolies."
"Many concerns have seen their profits double, not because of increased productivity, but also as a result of price policy."
"There are a great many examples of this, notably fuel."
"It seems to me that solutions are urgently called for."
"The Union constitutes a large and attractive market."
"This should be exploited with a view to regulating …"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by thanking Mrs Handzlik, and congratulating her on having drafted such an interesting and important report."
"Mrs Handzlik is a fellow member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and a compatriot of mine."
"Her report is important for us not only because, if I am not mistaken, it is the first report drafted by a female Polish MEP, but also because it concerns a particularly important issue, one that is crucial to the economic development of the European Union."
"I refer to the functioning of a truly common and free market for services within the European Union."
"If we consider that services account for 70% of the Union’s GDP, the importance of this issue can be readily appreciated."
"So too can the importance of developing the market for services within the EU."
"At this time, when there is much debate on the Constitutional Treaty in a number of European countries, the subject of the services directive and of a truly free, open and competitive market for services in Europe constitutes one of the key issues in the debate."
"There are strong misgivings about opening up the European market for services fully to cooperation."
"Many fears have been expressed too concerning the possibility of businesses and service providers from the new Member States being able to operate within this market."
"These views were reflected in some of what Mrs Kallenbach said just now."
"I should simply like to refer to one important piece of news provided by none other than President Chirac in the course of the important debate currently under way in France."
"President Chirac stated that as a result of enlargement, exports from France to new EU Member States in Eastern Europe had quadrupled."
"This translates into something close to EUR 10 billion, and 130 000 new jobs in France."
"Such then are the consequences of operating a truly broad and free European market."
"There is no reason to fear enlargement or genuine competition within a market like this."
"Mr President, thank you, Mrs Handzlik, for presenting this report, which adds up to a really good piece of work."
"Many thanks, too, for the frankness you have shown in cooperating with the other groups."
"That, I think, is what our cooperation here in this House should be like."
"I know that I will be disappointing Mrs Kallenbach when I say that our group will not be able to support her amendment."
"As she said, we are fundamentally very much in favour of a services directive being drafted, and of the services market being opened up; we do not, however, want it to happen any old how, but in a truly socially acceptable manner."
"We are able to support Mrs Handzlik’s report, which contains some very important statements. In paragraph 5, for example, it is stated that the new Member States have implemented the mutual recognition principle in their legislation."
"It is also stated that they have adopted the highest standards as guidelines to achieving harmonisation, which is a crucial objective of the internal market."
"These things are what matter to the public in the European Union, and I think that is what we have to achieve."
"The Committee came to an agreement that there would be no place in this report for the provisions to be worked out for the services directive, and that we would, instead, discuss these issues in the report on that directive, which is where they belong."
"We have kept to that agreement, as has Mrs Handzlik, and I think that is only right and proper."
"We Social Democrats have our own particular reason for endorsing this report, for, in paragraph 14, we agreed that, desirable though a market in services is, we do also take the view that efforts to that end must not prejudice social cohesion in the EU, and that consumers must enjoy a high level of protection."
"Such is the task we in this House have set ourselves where the services directive is concerned, and we will continue to work at it in future."
"For that reason, too, I congratulate Mrs Handzlik, and I congratulate this our Parliament on having produced this report on the current state of play in the new Member States, and on the imminent report on consumer protection."
"At the same time, though, I do hope that this is the last time that we shall do so."
"I hope that future reports will take as their subject the whole European Union, making no distinction between ‘old’ and ‘new’, but depicting it as a whole."
"Mr. President, one year has passed since the largest phase of the enlargement of the European Union."
"Ten new states which had gone through the painful experience of Soviet occupation and were just recently called countries in a transitional market economy, joined the European Union internal market with the four essential freedoms of the market: free movement of persons, services, goods and capital."
"After one year of work experience in the conditions of the internal market, the statistics of the new states on transposition of the directives related to the internal market proves that the newcomers quite successfully implemented their commitments."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the progress of Lithuania, the country where I have been elected to the European Parliament."
"Lithuania is the best amongst the new Member States and better than most of more experienced old Member States at implementing the of the internal market."
"One such successful indicator was the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products, recommended by the European Commission to the candidate countries as an instrument for preparation to work under the conditions of the internal market."
"Many countries successfully implemented the directives of the new approach a year before EU membership, but here we talk about the successful implementation of the free movement of goods."
"A different situation occurs while implementing the movement of services and persons."
"Revisions of the directive on services, having eliminated the principle of origin, impede the development of the internal market of services."
"It remains fragmentary, restricted and protected."
"Talking about the free movement of persons, I would like to remind you that according to the request of the old Member States the transitional period of seven years is applied to the new Member States."
"Only a few states have opened their labour markets since the enlargement."
"Therefore, I invite the Parliament, the European Commission and especially the Member States, without postponing the decisions for an indefinite time, to create a fully functional internal market and thus provide real possibilities for implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me as the coordinator for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to welcome my colleague Mrs Handzlik and her first report and my colleagues from Poland and Slovakia who spoke so eloquently."
"One of the reasons for drafting this report was the fact that the new Member States are already teaching all of us a lot about how to deal with the internal market."
"By happy coincidence the Committee on the Internal Market went on a mission to Poland a few weeks ago."
"We went to Mrs Handzlik’s home town and we met the businesses in her Chamber of Commerce."
"There are businesses there, large and small, who are really frustrated about the way that some of the existing Member States are still hampering their access to the European market."
"Believe me, the new Member States have a lot to teach us."
"If you look at the reports on the internal market you will find that in many cases the new Member States are at the top of the list for transposing internal market directives."
"Is it not extraordinary that after all this time it is the old Member States that are lagging behind?"
"That is why we wanted to draw up this report, because the new Member States have so much to teach us."
"Inevitably there has been discussion this morning about the services directive."
"As the shadow rapporteur I would like to say the biggest problem we face in Europe at the moment is unemployment."
"Since 1999 the majority of new jobs in Europe have been created in the services business."
"We have to create an effective and functioning new market for services."
"We have to get a directive that works satisfactorily."
"We can deal with the problems that are being raised, but we have to do the job properly."
"On this side of the House we will lead the way in delivering an effective services directive and continuing the transformation of the European economy, with the new Member States coming with us."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Handzlik on drawing up the first report by a new Member from a new Member State in a new committee."
"As the chairman of that committee, I think her report has been a commendable initiative."
"It is right to emphasise today what the new Member States have achieved instead of to carp at the difficulties and challenges they might pose."
"In the old Member States we see anxieties and sometimes a state of denial about what the expansion will mean to us. That is playing out now in some of the debates about the Constitution."
"It is playing out in some of the rhetoric about the fear of what immigration from the new Member States may do."
"My own view is that it is a task for this Parliament to welcome the expansion of the European Union in the fullest terms."
"Recently, I have had the opportunity not only to go with the delegation to Poland, but also to go to Hungary in a business delegation with representatives of my own region."
"We have heard today in the voices of Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Pleštinská and all our friends precisely what their ambitions are and why they should be supported."
"The internal market needs to free up services in a manner consistent with empowering consumers as well as entrepreneurs and in a manner that combines social and economic goals."
"They cannot be separated out."
"I must say to our friends in the new Member States that to believe that raw capitalism will give you all you need and will be your servant is an error."
"All these elements need to be in balance."
"I would say to those who came to my country, the United Kingdom, from the new Member States: you are welcome."
"I am proud to say in the middle of the British general election campaign that we are right to have given free entry into our market to people from the new Member States."
"We will prosper, our capital accumulation will prosper, our culture will prosper, our cuisine will prosper!"
"We welcome you, and I am delighted to be able to say that."
"I hope Mr Harbour will go back and tell the Conservative Party in Britain that it should take that same welcoming view."
"Mr President, only a few short years ago most of the countries that joined the EU in 2004 were trapped in a different political system."
"We differed from the rest of Europe in nearly every respect and had very little in common with it, other than being located on the same continent."
"Even that was not always seen in a positive light."
"Today we are debating details of our life together, the removal of barriers, and overcoming difficulties."
"Mrs Handzlik’s excellent report identifies the problems faced by all the Member States, and ways of overcoming them."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts and for all the work she has put into drafting the report."
"It is to be hoped that all 24 points will be implemented as quickly as possible."
"Many successes have been recorded, but the bitter words uttered in the course of various debates, such as the debates on discrimination in the internal market or on the methods of reciprocity suggest that much still remains to be done."
"Nothing is perfect, and there is always room for improvement."
"It is also important to be aware that even the best of provisions are not an instant solution to problems."
"Member States need to make the necessary efforts to implement provisions if they are to be effective."
"The record on this varies considerably."
"Attempts to circumvent directives or to burden the European Union with decisions detrimental to the interests of consumers are an everyday occurrence."
"Sometimes we seem to be acting as if we had forgotten where we are heading and what the Constitutional Treaty states."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your comments and questions which I will pass on to my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy."
"Regarding the amendment tabled by Mrs Kallenbach on the proposed services directive, I would just like to say that we should not use this excellent report as a vehicle to intervene in the current work on the services proposal."
"This weekend we will be celebrating the first year of the European Union of 25 Member States."
"The adoption of this report is therefore very timely and it shows that there is good reason for optimism about the internal market."
"We note that there is still some work ahead of us."
"This will always be so but overall we see a very positive picture with the ten new Member States performing well, and in a number of cases outperforming the others."
"The move from an internal market of 15 to an internal market of 25 is providing a new dynamic."
"We should use this dynamic to move ahead in removing barriers and create further opportunities for our companies and our citizens."
"I would again like to thank Mrs Handzlik for her excellent report."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place in a moment."
"Mr President, on a point of order, last night we held a debate in this House based on two parliamentary questions tabled by the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in relation to the EU delegation to the POPs Conference to be held in Punta del Este next week."
"The questions and the resolutions supporting them were put to the Commission and the Council."
"Despite the fact that the Council had adequate notice, no-one from the Council turned up last night to respond to these questions."
"The Commissioner himself was here."
"I would like an explanation as to why parliamentary questions tabled by the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety were ignored by the Council."
"There is nobody here from the Council to reply, Mrs Doyle, so we will forward your comments to the Council."
"I am sure it will be able to reply in due course."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr. President, a very good remark that it is necessary to talk about smuggling into Trans-Dniester."
"However, I believe that right here, at the edge of Europe, there is another source of smuggling, that is, the Kaliningrad region, from where large amounts of smuggled goods come into European Union countries."
"So far, they come in very large quantities to Lithuania and Poland."
"I really do not exclude the possibility, on which the experts also agree, that this contraband can also reach the old Member States of the European Union."
"First of all, this is contraband of excise goods."
"Therefore, our suggestion is to also include in paragraph 12 the Kaliningrad region as a particular risk, thus urging a stop to the flow of contraband from this territory into the countries of the European Union."
"Thank you."
"Perhaps it would help if I read the oral amendment."
"It simply adds the words ‘as well as Russia to crack down on smuggling from the Kaliningrad regions to Lithuania and Poland’."
". Mr President, this oral amendment is merely to ensure that there is consistency and accuracy in the section on Morocco."
"I propose that the end of paragraph 13 should read: ‘notes that a moratorium on the death penalty exists in Morocco and calls on the Moroccan authorities to abolish the death penalty’."
"Mr President, with regard to the proposed reference to the Baker plan, you probably all know that it has disappeared from the new proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General."
"That is why I tabled Amendment 3."
"I will also request a split vote on Amendment 15 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to delete the reference to the Baker plan."
"I am advised that if we approve General Morillon’s oral amendment, it would remove the references to the Baker Plan from all amendments."
"Is that correct, General Morillon?"
"No, because we would then have to vote on Amendment 17, which itself relates essentially to the Baker plan."
"If Amendment 17 is not adopted, this will relate to Amendment 15 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Colleagues, I should like to ask the rapporteur for some advice on this."
". Mr President, as rapporteur, my advice on this particular section is not to accept an oral amendment in relation to the Baker Plan."
"I think the PSE Group has a balanced amendment in this case – i.e. Amendment 15 – and my advice is to accept that one."
"You lost that one, General!"
"Mr President, may I ask whether you were in the habit of addressing Ian Paisley as ‘Reverend’ in the days when he was a Member of this House, and whether the reverend gentleman would have been expected to stand when addressing the Chair?"
"Mr Wieland, I am not sure I understand the point you are making."
"Would you mind repeating it?"
"Mr President, there were inaccuracies in paragraph 43 concerning revisions in the 2003 Criminal Code of Uzbekistan, and those revisions essentially said that torture and maltreatment of prisoners is a criminal act."
"Therefore, I suggest revising the text that has been presented in the original paragraph."
"‘Calls on Uzbekistan to liberate political prisoners and to outlaw torture and ill-treatment in custody’"
"to replace by text"
"‘Welcomes amendments to the Criminal Code for outlawing torture and ill-treatment in custody and persecuting their use made in 2003; calls on Uzbekistan genuinely to implement these changes and to liberate any remaining political prisoners.’"
"I shall now ask the rapporteur for a comment on that."
". Mr President, in my view this text improves the accuracy of the report and as rapporteur I am happy to strongly support it."
". Mr President, I fear I am attempting the impossible here, but we will see how it goes."
"I am proposing an oral amendment as a compromise amendment to Amendment 8."
"If it were to be accepted paragraph 131 would read: ‘Recognises the impact of mass rape in making women and girls vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS; urges the EU to ensure that the provision of full medical attention be made available immediately to all women and girls who have been raped;’."
"Mr President, I would like to put forward an oral amendment."
"I ask that the words ‘and countries seeking accession’ be added in all the paragraphs in which action is demanded on the part of the Member States, the candidate countries, or the Council, as Recital H makes explicit reference to Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"This would make no sense if these regions were themselves not called upon to take action."
"I will want to bring in another oral amendment when we get to Recital H."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we intend to table an oral amendment to paragraph 17; we have already notified you of this."
"Mr President, we have an oral amendment to paragraph 17."
"I will read the paragraph: ‘Urges Member States and candidate countries to introduce special scholarship and trainee programmes for disadvantaged Roma students’."
"We propose inserting: ‘and for all other disadvantaged students’."
"Mrs de Groen-Kouwenhoven wishes to move two oral amendments to insert new paragraphs after existing paragraphs 18 and 20."
"Mr President, I wish to table two oral amendments to add two paragraphs to the resolution."
"As all five groups supported these important paragraphs, there should not be a problem."
"The text of those paragraphs should be on your desks, but, if you prefer, I could read them to the House."
"You must read them, otherwise they would not be oral amendments!"
"Mr President, I thought there were no illiterate people here but I will obey the Rules."
"The first paragraph is: ‘18a."
"The second paragraph is: ‘20a."
"Mr President, I have another oral amendment to move, and it has to do with Recital H. I simply do not think that the original version of this, as it stands, does justice to the facts of the situation by stating that the Roma in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be victims of ethnic cleansing."
"I propose that this recital be amended, for the sake of clarity, to read as follows, and will now read it out in English."
"‘whereas a large number of Roma were victims of war and ethnic cleansing and continue to be victims of persecution in parts of regions of the former Republic of Yugoslavia’."
"The PSE Group proposes that the text of Amendment 4 be inserted at the end of existing paragraph 25, rather than forming a new paragraph."
"Was that your point, Mr Purvis?"
"That was my point, Mr President."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the following text should be added to the end of paragraph 25: ‘Further asks the Commission to prioritise amendment or removal of any legislation that is detrimental to the smooth functioning of European financial markets’."
"That would replace paragraph 26, which should be deleted."
"Are there are any objections to Mr Purvis’ oral amendment?"
". Mr President, there are two proposed additions to paragraph 25."
"We have to vote first on Amendment 4 by the Verts/ALE Group and then on the oral amendment by Mr Purvis to take the original paragraph 26 also as an addition to paragraph 25."
". Mr President, I have an oral amendment."
"It is to change the wording relating to ‘banking’ as follows: ‘Requests that the Commission provide a comprehensive study of retail financial services with a special emphasis on banking services in the various Member States’."
"This puts the emphasis on banking, but does not restrict the study to banking services only."
"Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 38, which will also replace Amendment 1: ‘Considers that Member States have long and diverse traditions in consumer protection; notes that the [one word deleted] call from part of the financial services industry is for minimum harmonisation, whereas certain practitioners, notably the banking industry, advocate targeted harmonisation in order to achieve a true level playing field; therefore, urges the Commission to organise a discussion about the fundamental structure of the EU financial services market, bearing in mind consumer and practitioner interests and European global competitiveness;’."
"If Amendment 15 is adopted, the PSE Group proposes that the amended text be inserted after paragraph 25."
". Mr President, this is also an oral amendment and it is to replace the words ‘regulated competition’ with ‘fair competition’."
". We voted in favour of the report concluding the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Brazil, in view of the interest on both sides in developing cooperation in various fields."
"The most pressing areas on which the agreement is based are public administration, economic cooperation, social development, research, technology and the environment."
"In this context, it is proposed that cooperation be developed in areas such as biotechnology, information technology and communications, bio-information, space, micro-technologies and nano-technologies, materials research, clean technologies, the sustainable management and use of environmental resources, health and medicine, aeronautics, metrology, standardisation and conformity assessment, and human sciences."
"The agreement also mentions that the parties intend to establish cooperation in the area of scientific and technological research, so that cooperation will be increased in various areas and that both sides, the EU and Brazil, will enjoy the economic and social benefits of this cooperation."
". I voted in favour of concluding the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Federative Republic of Brazil."
"I believe that appropriate instruments must be created with a view to substantially extending the current level of cooperation, within the framework of the activities that fall under the sixth framework programme for international cooperation with developing countries."
"Parliament must therefore continue to foster the creation of cooperation mechanisms in scientific and technological innovation."
"The European Research Area is the perfect environment in which to enhance and step up cooperation between Brazil and the EU, given the importance of science and technology in economic and social development and given the desire on both sides to broaden and strengthen cooperation in areas of shared interest."
". The Agreement for scientific cooperation between the European Community and Mexico is a crucial instrument for improving and stepping up cooperation between Mexico and the EU in science and technology."
"I believe that appropriate instruments must be created with a view to substantially extending the current level of cooperation, within the framework of the activities that fall under the sixth framework programme for international cooperation with developing countries."
"Parliament must therefore continue to foster the creation of cooperation mechanisms in scientific and technological innovation."
"The European Research Area is the perfect environment in which to enhance and step up cooperation between Mexico and the EU, given the importance of science and technology in economic and social development and given the desire on both sides to broaden and strengthen cooperation in areas of shared interest."
". According freedom of movement to some of the EU’s citizens and not to others goes against the EU’s principles of equal treatment."
"Its system of quotas enables Switzerland to counteract any eventual adverse consequences arising from increased free movement of persons."
"Despite having voted in favour of the protocol, I wish to point out that what was termed the ‘visa affair’ in Germany has now taken on a new dimension."
"The ‘if in doubt, opt for freedom of movement’ ruling resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of visa applications by third-country nationals that were approved, to the extent that the number more than doubled, with many ‘tourists’ taking up employment in the black economy or ending up in prostitution."
"Such generosity, the consequences of which are as yet incalculable, might well fuel some Swiss people’s fears and misgivings to such a degree that the protocol will fail to be approved by the referendum that may be held in September."
"The eventual upshot of that would be that the EU would have to decide whether or not to withdraw from the Agreement on the free movement of persons rather than offend the new Member States."
". The agreement between the EU and Switzerland on the free movement of persons following EU enlargement in May 2004 was not automatically extended to include the new Member States."
"Switzerland, like EU Member States, is benefiting from the recent enlargement, through greater political stability in its geographical neighbourhood and through the newly enlarged internal market."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation, because I feel that this agreement will make it much easier to send Swiss staff to the new Member States, where many Swiss companies are already active."
"At the same time, citizens from new Member States can now be more easily recruited by Swiss companies."
"In the long run, all citizens from EU Member States and Switzerland will benefit from free movement."
". I voted in favour of Mr Coelho’s recommendation for a second reading on ‘access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles’, as it reflects the need to combat vehicle theft, in an EU in which internal border checks have been all but scrapped."
"In light of the figure published by Europol that 1 149 114 cars were stolen in the EU in 2002 alone, I believe that the EU must, as a matter of urgency, take action to combat the trade in stolen vehicles."
"We believe that the stated legal basis for the current regulation is mistaken."
"Extending the Schengen Convention so that the bodies responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles in the Member States are given access to data in the Schengen Information System cannot be based on common transport legislation."
"This is a third pillar issue concerning legal and police cooperation."
"It is for the Council, not Parliament, to take decisions about these issues."
"The June List has therefore voted against the amendments."
". The need to safeguard security and compliance with the law in a freer and bigger Europe mean that lawmakers must seek to protect the citizens whilst guaranteeing that the authorities have the necessary conditions in place to boost security."
"Citizens must also be protected, however, from unnecessary and unwanted State interference in the private sphere."
"In other words, as usual a balance must be maintained, even on issues that may seem trivial, between ensuring security and promoting freedom."
"This applies to the legislation that is the subject of the recommendation before us, which I voted in favour of."
"Pollution from households, agriculture and industry is increasing."
"It reduces the quality of groundwater."
"When groundwater is polluted, the consequences are longer-lasting than when surface water is polluted."
"Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water and for industrial and agricultural processes."
"It should therefore be protected for current and future use."
"We Social Democrats therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative concerning new regulations governing groundwater."
"Groundwater is not, however, identical throughout the EU."
"It is therefore difficult to come up with a common standard suited to groundwater as it is variously to be found in the EU and, at the same time, entailing the most beneficial result for the environment."
"We believe that an approach taking greater account of the big differences in groundwater between one part of the EU and another would have had a more productive effect on the environment."
". The precautionary principle must be applied with regard to protecting groundwater against pollution, and this is currently laid down in Directive 80/68/EC, until 2013."
"The protection should thereafter be continued through what is known as the Water Framework Directive, of 2000, and through the directive now receiving its first reading."
"Among the various different opinions on what approach to take, the report advocates that quality standards should be based on human and eco-toxicological criteria and points out that when setting quality standards the Member States may take into account the levels of substances naturally present in water."
"The rapporteur points out, however, that the new legislation must maintain at least the current level of protection, and that prevention should be a key element."
"There must subsequently be the political will to take the necessary measures aimed at preventing pollution and protecting groundwater quality."
"The June List’s members are elected with a mandate to ensure that only cross-border environmental issues are decided on at EU level."
"The Council should have the central role in this decision-making process."
"The groundwater issue is partly a cross-border issue."
"We regret that the Directive on groundwater does not refer to a greater extent to the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution should therefore apply for roughly three years whereupon it should be replaced by a directive incorporating the principle of subsidiarity."
"I voted in favour of this directive."
"This directive must not deviate from the principles adopted in the Water Framework Directive."
"In view of the considerable diversity of bodies of groundwater in Europe, precise objectives can only be set at local level."
"It is unrealistic to try to impose the same standards on the whole of Europe."
"Only a limited number of parameters can be subject to quality standards laid down at European level."
"Thus, the proposal that the parameters of nitrates and pesticides should be the only ones laid down at European level seems acceptable in this case."
"On the other hand, we need to put certain situations in context."
"The fact that the quality standard or threshold value is contravened does not necessarily mean that the body of groundwater is of poor quality; the causes of the failure must be examined so that the measures recommended in the Water Framework Directive can be applied to restore the quality of the water."
"Finally, certain specific local circumstances mean that historical pollution has to be taken into particular consideration without, however, leading inevitably to a downgrading of those bodies of water."
"Obviously, the measures laid down in the Water Framework Directive to avoid the spread of pollution must apply in these cases."
". The directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution, which sets out the rules for protecting such water against pollution, does not lay down clear quality objectives, nor does it provide for exhaustive and continuing assessment."
"It must be revised in such a way that more of the available data on groundwater quality in Europe can be gathered."
"In order that good chemical status can be achieved by 2015, it is crucial to keep clean groundwater clean."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe it is essential to improve the tools for protecting the environment and the quality objectives for water in Europe."
"The Moderate delegation has voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation on the creation of a European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions."
"We think it important that the foundation’s working methods and the composition of its board be continually reviewed so that it might operate more efficiently."
"It would, however, cause problems if the review were to be undertaken by the whole of the European Parliament, since few MEPs are aware of how the Foundation operates."
"We also believe that recruitment should be according to the applicant’s merits and that it should be gender-neutral."
"It is in the organisation’s interests to have a board uniting a variety of skills and experience, but there must be no political control of recruitment."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Harkin, because I feel that we are faced with new challenges in terms of improving living and working conditions."
"I welcome the objectives behind the creation of this foundation and I believe that the amendments put forward will certainly help it to be implemented more smoothly and effectively."
"The principles of good governance are essential to the smooth running of Europe’s institutions and should thus be the cornerstone of any revision and assessment of their constitutional texts."
". The regulation that set up the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in 1975 is being revised, to follow up the results of an external audit."
"The purpose of the Foundation is to develop ideas on improving living and working conditions in the medium and long term, and to identify factors leading to change."
"The main amendments are intended to bring about an internal restructuring of the Foundation’s management bodies, greater participation by independent experts and an increased role for the social partners and representatives of national governments."
"This strategic and operational revision will thus enable the Foundation to carry out its work with greater efficiency and transparency."
"By providing information and analysis on living and working conditions, the Foundation has played a significant role in developing the Community’s social policy."
"I therefore voted in favour of these amendments."
". We welcome any attempts, provided they are workable, to improve safety and health at work."
"Although Europe has a relatively good record on safety and health at work, there is much that it can still do to improve that record."
"Throughout the EU, there are still clear cases in which health and safety at work is clearly not safeguarded and in which the rules are not being followed. Serious work-related accidents therefore continue to happen."
"In order to prevent such accidents, we must build up a firm foundation of suitable legislation, ensure that this legislation is complied with and promote good practice."
"This is what I hope this new agency will be able to accomplish."
". Following an external audit to assess the functioning of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Bilbao), the Commission has tabled a number of amendments to the regulation establishing it."
"I voted in favour of the report, given that the amendments are intended to clarify the Agency’s objectives and responsibilities, to improve its functioning, to strengthen the role of the social partners and to enhance cooperation with other bodies operating in the social field."
"This Agency plays a key role in disseminating information and encouraging people to exchange experiences on health and safety at work."
"This task is crucial given the terrible tragedy of work-related accidents, which come at an incalculable human and financial cost."
"The Agency also takes part in the decision-making process in that it provides the European institutions with the information needed to adopt legislation in the social field and, more importantly, information on the impact of that legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In addition to collecting and passing on information, the Agency will henceforth take on the task of analysing data relating to safety and health at work."
"I wholeheartedly support any amendment aimed at making this Agency more transparent and more efficient."
"With regard to international matters, the EU must not overlook the fact that the various Member States have different relationships with third countries. Legislation must therefore guarantee that each Member State is able to act and react to its own situation in relation to the world."
"As the mechanism was difficult to use, it was not put into practice. I therefore endorse the move to make it more flexible."
"Furthermore, the availability of other avenues in terms of taking action has the potential to be useful and effective."
"I therefore feel that we should support the solution that has been reached."
"As I have stated in previous explanations of vote, the pressure put on the new Member States to incorporate the Community acquis into their national legislations is unacceptable. They are peddled the argument that failing to transpose law would block the growth of the European economy and would exacerbate regional disparities."
"This is a policy based on double standards. On the one hand, it suggests that we must boost and develop the internal market, overcoming obstacles by harmonising national legislation, in order to allow goods, services and capital to move freely; whereas, on the other hand, it seeks to limit the movement of people from those countries and to restrict their rights."
"The report before us does not take into account the specific characteristics of the new Member States and the fact that they lag behind the other Member States. It also fails to address the need to set out measures to support the running of the markets in such a way as to promote economic and social cohesion."
"Cohesion policy needs increased funding to be set aside in the financial perspective, so as to foster integration on the basis of economic development criteria of promoting jobs and social inclusion and of breaking down the imbalances between the regions and countries of the enlarged EU."
"In that way, support to countries lagging behind in structural terms, such as Portugal, can be maintained."
"( We believe that an efficient Internal Market in the EU is important."
"Naturally, the new Member States must also adapt to this."
"We object, however, to the adoption of political positions in the report’s explanatory statement and to the Commission providing extra resources for developing professional bodies in the new Member States."
". I voted in favour of this report, because in my opinion an accurate assessment of the situation in the new Member States must be carried out."
"Barriers to the movement of goods and services must be removed and replaced by open market conditions, so that opportunities can be created for these economies to grow."
"Whilst I feel that it is first and foremost up to the private sector to make the most of these new opportunities, the public authorities must at the same time ensure that internal market directives are transposed correctly and on time."
"Mr President, I wish to make a statement concerning the vote on Mr Coveney’s report on human rights."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats definitely welcomes the Coveney Report as a whole and has therefore voted in favour of its adoption."
"Like all Parliament’s reports on human rights, it does of course carry a political message, and Mr Coveney, for whom my Group has high regard, has managed to hold in balance the various political tendencies represented in this House."
"For this reason, I am all the more astonished and perturbed by the attitude of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which ended up abstaining from voting – despite having secured the acceptance of its two amendments on abortion – simply because its amendments relating to Cuba and Venezuela failed."
"That is politically inept."
"Acknowledging its importance, the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of the report as a whole."
"I would, however, like to make it clear that we regard Amendments 8 and 9 with grave concern and have left it to our members to vote for or against them as a matter of conscience."
"Why is this so?"
"Firstly, because the amendments call for access to abortion, which is hardly likely to be any sort of bulwark against human rights abuses."
"Their primary concern is with women who have been raped, even though rape is clearly condemned elsewhere in the report."
"Secondly, these amendments indirectly imply that abortion is a human right."
"Abortion, though, is nothing of the sort; on the contrary, it violates human rights."
"Even the United Nations understands that to be the case."
"Thirdly, Articles 8 and 9 go against the principle of subsidiarity."
"The EU has no power to deal with this matter, which is reserved to national jurisdiction, and so most members of our group, having been free to decide in accordance with conscience, have rejected these articles."
"I, myself, was one of those who did so."
"This is not the first time that the left-wing groups in this House have sought to misuse the human rights report in order to make abortion more freely available."
"The mere fact that a majority wants to do this does not make it right."
"Nor is it binding, for the report as whole is not binding in its effects."
"The PPE-DE Group has therefore deliberately left these questions to the consciences of its Members and taken a negative line on the substance of Amendments 8 and 9."
"I would not have asked for the floor if Mrs Stenzel had not attacked our group in such an unbecoming way, and one that is so extremely unworthy of a Member of this House."
"There are two things I would like to say to her."
"Where abortion is concerned, and in this debate, we respect the right of every Member to reach a decision in accordance with his or her conscience."
"Rarely in parliamentary debate is that necessary, and rarely do political groups have to allow their members the freedom to decide in accordance with their conscience."
"There are few such issues, but this is one of them."
"Mrs Stenzel will not find it difficult, if she looks at the result of the vote, to see that the report would have been lost if our group had voted against it."
"A ‘no’ from our group would have been enough to throw the report out."
"There were certain key points in the report with which we did not agree, but we were quite satisfied with others."
"It was because we wanted to help this report gain a majority, while also wanting our scepticism to be visible, that we abstained."
"If she thinks that is bad form, then perhaps she should consider whether she is perhaps judging by the wrong criteria."
"Thank you, Mr Schulz."
"I am not sure that your assumption is entirely correct."
". While able to agree with much of this report, I felt compelled to abstain because of the amendments embracing abortion on demand and the blanket attack on capital punishment, which I regard as legitimate where there is a transparently fair legal system based on due process of law."
"I particularly welcomed the report’s forthright affirmations against terrorism – including the declaration that there is a prime duty on democratic governments to dismantle terrorist networks – its denunciation of the Commission’s reversal of the embargo on arms sales to China and its identification of persecution in many countries throughout the world of citizens because of their Christian beliefs, though I would have liked it to have been more explicit and focused, particularly with regard to the appalling abuse of the rights of members of minority Protestant denominations in Eritrea, Vietnam, North Korea, Colombia, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Egypt, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and elsewhere."
"The persecutions and imprisonments imposed on good citizens, whose only ‘crime’ is to live according to their sincere beliefs, is intolerable."
"Freedom of expression, assembly and religion must be defended throughout the world."
". I welcome the broad thrust of Simon Coveney’s report but I do not think it goes far enough in terms of recognising the urgent need for particular support for women who are the victims of violence and sexual abuse."
"The report denounces the impact of mass rape and recognises that victims of acts of sexual violence are put at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS."
"But it fails to offer these victims any immediate care."
"Because of this I support Amendment 8 which calls for such victims to have access to condoms, to prevent further spread of infection, and access to abortion in the event of unwanted pregnancy."
"The report should also recognise, as is demanded in Amendment 9, that the only way we can ensure there is a proper response to acts of sexual violence is by giving full respect to reproductive health rights in the first place."
"As far as I am concerned, sexual and reproductive health is a human right; a right that should be recognised fully and guaranteed to every man, woman and child in the Member States and throughout the world."
"The report concerns the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World and the EU’s policy on the matter."
"The EU has a responsibility for human rights in its immediate neighbourhood, consisting mainly of countries in Eastern and Central Europe that are potential Member States."
"It is not, however, the EU’s task to guarantee human rights globally. That is the task of the UN."
"There are positive aspects of the resolution, and we support these. They include the call for increased environmental work and support for the International Criminal Court."
"The resolution is largely, however, about strengthening the EU’s foreign policy role."
"We are therefore abstaining from voting on the resolution as a whole."
". I could write a great deal about this annual report by Parliament, which, in common with previous years, has been used as a means of political pressurising and meddling, in which countries seen as ‘friends’ are exempt from criticism, and the ‘others’, those countries deemed targets by the USA and EU, are criticised."
"Among many examples, the report:"
"- glosses over the military occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies – the occupying troops are euphemistically referred to as ‘military forces stationed in the country’;"
"- does not condemn the Israeli Government for the military occupation of Palestine or for building the fence; instead it expresses its ‘concern’ regarding the ‘security fence/separation barrier’;"
"Furthermore, it:"
"- ‘condemns’ the lifting of sanctions against Cuba by the Council, bringing it into line with the USA’s policy towards the country, and;"
"- astonishingly, calls on the Venezuelan Government to ensure ‘freedom of expression and free access to information’, when the overwhelming majority of media outlets in the country are controlled by forces that will stop at nothing to succeed in undermining democracy;"
"In spite of everything, this year’s report was only adopted by the Right. The number of votes in favour was much lower than the number of abstentions and of those who, like us, voted against."
". Every year, the European Parliament’s report on Human Rights tells the world how to respect these rights."
"However, it does not mention the situation in Member States of the European Union."
"I wish to draw attention to the case of Marek Dochnal and Krzysztof Maciej Popenda, two Polish businessmen, who have been in captivity since October 2004."
"The charges against them have been changed several times, extending with no real legal basis the prosecution procedures which allow them to be detained."
"This is a violation of Article 6(2) of the ECHR on presumption of innocence."
"Their identities and photographs have been published, in contravention of Polish law, to try to put pressure on the judges."
"Information about their private and family lives, not connected with the legal investigation, has been also published, which breaches Article 8 of the ECHR."
"These two men are victims of political persecution."
"Perhaps this persecution aims to refute the testimony of Mr Dochnal in front of the parliamentary committee investigating any links between certain Polish politicians and certain oil companies."
"I hope and trust that this Parliament will react against this abuse."
". I voted against the Coveney report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU’s policy on the matter."
"This was because, provisions concerning the extension of so-called reproductive rights as a method of preventing the spread of AIDS were introduced into the report by the Left and the Liberals, in spite of opposition from a significant proportion of Members."
"According to the World Health Organisation, the term reproductive rights covers abortion."
"Provisions regarding swift access to abortion for rape victims were also introduced."
"I believe abortion to be a morally unacceptable and cruel practice."
"In view of the fact that opinion on abortion is so divided in Europe, I feel that such controversial provisions should not be included in any European Parliament document."
"Even if the current differences of opinion on this matter are taken into account, given the current state of knowledge I do not believe that anyone can reasonably argue that abortion is definitely not an attack on human life."
"These are the reasons why I was unable to vote in favour of a report containing such provisions."
"Within my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, there has been considerable criticism of the selective nature of this proposal, and a number of my colleagues have therefore voted against it."
"No one denied that it contains many pertinent comments about human rights abuses outside of the European Union, but it is striking that countries such as Israel, Turkey and the Colombian government are being spared the sort of criticism that is levelled at Cuba, Venezuela and the Colombian guerrilla movements."
"In Venezuela, where most of the media are in the hands of the opposition, there is supposedly a lack of press freedom."
"This attitude creates the impression that allies never make mistakes and that others never do things right."
"Both left and right have a long tradition of selectiveness in their upholding of human rights, where a lack of human rights was particularly important as argument against political opponents."
"We must stop this practice and take seriously, rather than trivialise, criticism in respect of mistakes perpetrated by those we hold dear."
"If the Right had not just confirmed its rejection of the EU’s improved policy in respect of Cuba’s isolation by the US in a vote, despite criticism, I, along with Scandinavian and German colleagues, would still have voted in favour."
". I am unable to vote in favour of the report, as it is vague about some major human rights problems and ignores others completely."
"I will give five examples of this."
"Firstly, no mention is made of the abuse and torture committed in Iraq by members of the US forces."
"No explicit reference is made to the persons who committed these offences."
"One looks in vain for calls for criminal proceedings to be brought before the International Criminal Court."
"Secondly, no reference is made to the continuing occupation of Iraq, or to the violations of human rights that are going on there day in, day out."
"The report does not condemn this breach of international law."
"Thirdly, the Western states’ wars of intervention and the violations of human rights associated with them are not discussed."
"Not one line of text is devoted to the Iraqi civilians – of whom there were over 100 000 – killed in the course of the onslaught by the ‘Coalition of the Willing’."
"There is no condemnation of the military interventions – described as ‘humanitarian interventions’ – on the pretext of combating terrorism, or of the ‘war of disarmament’, all of which happened in contravention of international law."
"Fourthly, the risks to human rights arising from the militarisation of the EU, in particular as a result of it being enshrined in the EU’s Constitution, are not treated as an issue."
"It is a scandal that no mention whatever is made of the human rights situation in Turkey, and the assertion that it will be considered in a separate report does nothing to remedy that omission."
"It is incomprehensible that this should be passed over in silence, particularly in view of the increasing number of human rights violations in the country."
". The overview of human rights protection around the world portrayed in Mr Coveney’s report is, unfortunately, an accurate one."
"Looking at this report from our privileged situation, living in this part of the world, one inevitably feels a duty to take concerted and effective action to protect human rights (and to protect democracy, because, let us not forget, these two concepts are intrinsically linked; without democracy, there is no human rights protection)."
"It is impossible to cover every aspect of such a broad issue, but there is one aspect that I wish to bring to the fore."
"I am concerned at the fact that it is not clear to many European politicians – albeit not only European politicians – that terrorism is the greatest threat to our societies and that it is a threat to our citizens (I shall not point out that they are innocent citizens, because that would suggest that there could be some sort of justification even if they were not innocent), to our societies, to the model that those societies represent and to democracy itself."
"Lastly, let this report send out a clear message that Europe will be resolute in promoting human rights and democracy."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Coveney on this annual report and on the new system that he has introduced."
"The final resolution places demands on the Communist regime in Cuba and vehemently condemns terrorism. These are areas that are especially close to my heart and that I have been pursuing as human rights coordinator for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I was pleased to see that attempts on the part of the communist and socialist left to remove the forthright condemnation of the Cuban dictatorship were defeated."
"Other areas that I have been following with concern, such as the trafficking in human beings and human organs, were also addressed appropriately in this resolution, and that is something new and positive."
"I deplore the Left’s manipulative strategy to present the right to abortion as a fundamental human right. They went as far as to block the vote on an oral amendment by the rapporteur that contained the following lines: ‘recognises the impact of mass rape in making women and girls vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS; calls on the EU to guarantee that all women and girls who are the victims of rape will have access to full medical care’."
"After this oral amendment was rejected, all of the amendments tabled in this House by the Left were adopted, yet the Left abstained from the final overall vote, which is evidence of their intention to manipulate an important overview of human rights to their own ends."
". I voted against the Coveney report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU’s policy on the matter."
"This was because, provisions concerning the extension of so-called reproductive rights as a method of preventing the spread of AIDS were introduced into the report by the Left and the Liberals, in spite of opposition from a significant proportion of Members."
"According to the World Health Organisation the term reproductive rights covers abortion."
"Provisions regarding swift access to abortion for rape victims were also introduced."
"I believe abortion to be a morally unacceptable and cruel practice."
"In view of the fact that opinion on abortion is so divided in Europe I feel that such controversial provisions should not be included in any European Parliament document."
"Even if the current differences of opinion on this matter are taken into account, given the current state of knowledge I do not believe that anyone can reasonably argue that abortion is definitely not an attack on human life."
"These are the reasons why I was unable to vote in favour of a report containing such provisions."
". I would like to explain why we as a delegation have largely abstained on the Coveney Report."
"This report is very largely supported by us and we stand for the highest level of civil and political human rights throughout the world, good governance and democracy as the form of ideal government."
"Nevertheless, our party has stated a policy position rejecting the International Criminal Court and therefore we cannot support Amendment 45."
"We are examining the issue of resiling the UN Geneva Convention on Refugees in order to regain control of immigration and asylum policy and therefore cannot support Amendment 35."
"Similarly, we regard the death penalty for the most serious crimes and abortion as conscience issues and have no stated policies either way."
"In the light of these considerations we have abstained overall."
". I am unable to vote in favour of the report."
"Although it does indeed mention a very large number of important points – such as the human rights violations in the Western Sahara, which is illegally occupied by Morocco, and which are often forgotten – it is generally characterised by a one-sided view of things, selectively castigating human rights violations particularly where it seems politically opportune to do so, and even going so far as to falsify the facts."
"Let me now name some of the important problem areas in terms of human rights to which no reference whatever is made."
"Firstly, to talk in terms of restrictions on the free expression of opinion in Venezuela and to call upon the government to take appropriate action is positively grotesque in view of the fact that most of the media are owned by the opposition."
"Secondly, the assessment of the situation in Columbia completely ignores the grave violations of human rights committed by the government and is framed as a one-sided condemnation of the guerrillas."
"Thirdly, Parliament’s criticism of the EU’s cautious resumption of relations with Cuba is, in human rights terms, utterly beyond comprehension."
"Fourthly, the grave problems with human rights in Turkey are not addressed at all."
"The fact that the report scarcely discusses social and economic rights, and refrains without exception from any self-critical comment on the human rights situation in the EU and on the EU’s role in the world, is certainly problematic and goes against the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible."
"All voters want the politicians they elect to stick to the platform on which they were elected."
"I am a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I made a commitment to respect the platform of Christian-democratic values represented by this group. These include supporting the principles of the protection and promotion of human dignity and, consequently, respect for the right to life and the uniqueness of every human being from conception to natural death."
"When a political programme sets out values to promote, it is only natural to follow it, including in the voting lists."
"The electorate does not like being betrayed by its elected representatives, particularly with regard to the essential values for which it elected us."
"The protection of life at all times, from conception to natural death, is a non-negotiable part of any political calculation."
"According to the World Health Organisation’s definition, the concept of ‘sexual and reproductive health’ includes the reality of promoting the termination of unwanted pregnancies."
"That is why I voted against Amendments 8 and 9."
"As these amendments were adopted, they have amended the resolution in a way contrary to the PPE-DE Group’s platform of values."
". I support the PSE Group’s resolution (B6-0275/2005) and the joint resolution on the Commission Statement on the situation of Roma in the EU."
"In 1984, Parliament first acknowledged that ‘gypsies still suffer discrimination in law and practice’ and called on governments of the Member States to eliminate all forms of discrimination against Roma."
"Twenty-one years on, it is unfortunately the case that this conclusion endures: Roma and Travellers still suffer discrimination in law and practice."
"The recent establishment of the European Commissioners’ Group on Fundamental Rights, Anti-Discrimination and Equal Opportunities, as well as the stated commitment of President Barroso to address the social exclusion of Roma and Travellers, are positive developments."
"These must now be followed by concrete actions by the Commissioners’ Group and the relevant Directorates-General."
"The Commission has to address the social exclusion of Roma and Travellers in Member States, candidate countries and other countries outside the current borders of the Union, and act, as a matter of urgency, to curb the widespread anti-Roma and anti-Traveller sentiment in Europe."
"At the very least, this means full and correct application of Council Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin."
". We voted in favour of this joint resolution, to which we also contributed, because we feel it is urgent to eliminate continuing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination against Roma, and are conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by anti-Gypysism and Romaphobia plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action for its eradication."
"8 April has been designated International Roma Day and is considered to be the annual day of celebration for Roma, as well as an opportunity for raising awareness about Europe's largest ethnic minority and the extent of its social exclusion."
"We feel it is important to vehemently condemn, once again, all forms of discrimination, including discrimination against Roma."
"We expect their rights to be upheld in all Member States and that the Member States adopt the measures needed to combat the negative images that lead to discrimination, to hatred and to racism towards Roma and to combat ‘Romaphobia’ in all its forms, at local, regional, national or European level."
"The EU is a union of values and is therefore responsible for maintaining respect for human rights within its borders."
"Therefore, the EU also has a role, via its Member States, in drawing attention to the vulnerable position of the Roma and in facilitating their integration into society."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues completely and unreservedly condemn all forms of racism and xenophobia."
"However, we are unable to support this resolution because we do not think that the cause of a specific minority group such as the Roma is furthered by ‘pigeon-holing’ them into a separate category, which runs the risk of increasing their isolation and marginalisation."
"Instead, we feel it is best to keep the fight against discrimination and prejudice, which the Roma undoubtedly face, within the mainstream of political, economic, and social policy."
".– The PASOK parliamentary group in the European Parliament will be voting in favour of the resolution on the Roma."
"Combating social exclusion and discrimination against the Roma in Europe, on the basis of today's resolution, must be a priority of the institutions of the European Union and of the Member States."
"At the same time, it notes that the Member States of the Union have different definitions for national, ethnic and religious minorities and sections of the population within their borders, based on their laws and/or international conventions (as in the case of Greece) and that these must not under any circumstances be thought to be contested or affected by this resolution."
". Only seven out of the twenty-five EU Member States have a population that exceeds that of the Roma nation as a whole in the EU’s present and future territory."
"They are a nation without a state, and are considered a minority wherever they are, even if there are towns in which they represent the majority."
"If it is the case that many Roma people have become outsiders, unemployed as a result of poor education, and with an attitude that can easily provoke irritation in others, this is attributable to isolation and discrimination."
"We have a long tradition of driving those people away from one state to another, and of refusing to grant them civil rights because they can be considered aliens on account of their forced moves."
"In some cases, individuals are given the opportunity of integrating and being accepted by the majority, but the group as a whole is not."
"There are problems not only in a number of new Member States that joined in 2004 and in the two countries that will be acceding in 2007, but also in such old Member States as Greece and Italy."
"Since newcomers are refused shelter, schooling and an income, criminal activity represents these people’s only means of survival."
"That should really improve after the 90% majority for this resolution."
"The outlook for society and medicine in Europe is gloomy."
"We talk about problems of inequality, waiting lists, and backward science and technology."
"The solutions recommended by Parliament will be just as ineffectual as those recommended by the Commission."
"This desire for modernisation actually concerns European countries that are a long way from the French model. This system still protects us from the shortcomings that exist throughout the world."
"With regard to the ageing population, nobody will dare suggest that we finally return to a true pro-family policy that encourages a higher birth rate."
"We should also be worried that this report on public health uses terms such as ‘market’ and ‘consumers’."
"More seriously, and for reasons that can only be guessed at, this report glorifies the European Constitution in Recital A. That Treaty is not yet in force and must be condemned as an instrument of social decline which threatens the health of the French people via a reduction to the lowest common denominator."
"Finally, the issue of immigration is completely missing from the text."
"Paragraph 11 expresses a concern in administrative terms, whereas this is in fact a matter of the progressive annihilation of our societies, not to mention the future arrival in Europe of Turkey, for which reason we oppose a rejection of ‘social self-defence’."
"Social protection and health care systems are the responsibility of the Member States, and rightly so. It is also true that we wish to see the citizens of Europe enjoying the best, the most appropriate and the most effective social protection, and the same is true of health care."
"That said, we must not overlook current predominant trends, especially the ageing of the population. In other words, we must urgently seek solutions to problems that are already apparent."
"Lastly, I wish to point out that the broad consensus that this issue usually generates is a consensus based on the objectives and on what we want to accomplish, but not on the means and the methods. That is where the differences are clear and well-documented."
"The Hughes report is about reforming the activities and organisation of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work."
"The Harkin report is about reforming the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions."
"The Cabrnoch report is about modernising social protection and developing good quality healthcare."
"We believe that issues surrounding safety and health at work, social protection or healthcare are not the responsibility of the EU."
"These are issues that should be decided upon by each Member State."
"The aforementioned bodies should not be run by the EU but by the parties concerned and as non-governmental organisations."
"We also choose, therefore, to abstain from voting on the three reports."
". The Financial Services Action Plan came into being one year before the ‘Lisbon Strategy’, yet it is one of its key pillars."
"The purpose of creating an internal market for financial services and integrating the capital markets is not only to liberalise the movement of capital even further, not only to provide large multinational corporations with the means to restructure and acquire capital at the lowest cost, not only to speed up the process of acquisitions and mergers at European level, but mainly to manage the enormous flow of finance released by the gradual privatisation of national pensions systems."
"It is not a little ironic that, although the rapporteur is not satisfied, 39 of the Plan’s 42 legislative measures have already been adopted. In other words, the targets of this Plan are those areas with the best implementation, in light of the unambitious social targets set by the ‘Lisbon Strategy’."
"What is more, all of this is wrapped up in technical jargon, is almost devoid of prudential rules, and leaves self-regulation to the discretion of those operating in the sector."
"More jobs and economic growth are promised, but the impact of the increasingly financial focus of the economy is shown in stark relief by the high number of financial crises at both regional and world level and by the drain of investment from production to capitalisation and speculation."
". For those like me who advocate the completion of the internal market – without which we would not be able to meet some of the Union’s prime objectives, such as those set out in the Lisbon Agenda – the successful integration of the financial markets is something to be welcomed."
"The existence of an action plan for that purpose and the results that have come to light are cause for some satisfaction."
"There is more work to be done, however, which, as the report before us points out, must be accompanied by a suitable assessment of the measures that will need to be taken over time, so that a good proposal is not spoiled by too many or too few legal instruments."
"Discharges of substances dangerous for the environment constitute an important political issue."
"We do not, however, believe that the EU needs to have a common strategy in terms of the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants."
"Individual Member States should each determine their national negotiating policies themselves."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 28 April 2005."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement commemorating the end of World War II in Europe."
"As you know, and as everybody knows, it is 60 years today since we were able to begin our assessment of the horrors Europe had experienced during that period."
"The figures are horrific: 60 million dead, the systematic extermination of peoples and minorities, cities and regions reduced to ash and rubble, economies ruined and 30 million displaced people from amongst the civilian populations of all the warring countries."
"And regardless of the responsibilities of those who started the war, human suffering is human suffering."
"In the Pacific, as you know, the war was to continue until 14 August and ended with those horrendous pictures of nuclear extermination."
"At that point, Europe was a desolated, hungry and threatened continent."
"With the peace, or at least with the end of the war, on that 8 May, certain political leaders proclaimed that the flag of freedom was flying over the whole of Europe, but today we must acknowledge that, at that point, the end of the war only brought peace and freedom to half of the continent."
"The other half was the victim of the new world order that was created in Yalta."
"In fact, peace and freedom did not reach everybody."
"On that 8 May, a new European geography was drawn up; totalitarianism was overcome — at least certain forms of it — but another different kind, although equally iron-fisted and more lasting, took half of Europe hostage."
"Bipolarity was born, a long ideological conflict began and the nuclear era terrorised the world."
"Our continent was split in two and today, 60 years later, here in the European Parliament, we can at last commemorate a reunited Europe, not an enlarged Europe, but a reunified one."
"On 1 May we marked the first anniversary of our reunion with the countries that were taken hostage after Yalta."
"There will soon be more of us and our reunification will be more complete."
"And this gives greater meaning to this 9 May, Europe Day, on which, 55 years ago, the foundations were established in order to respond to the desolation of war, in order to guarantee that it would never happen again, and this response is now complete with the arrival of the new countries that have joined the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like today, a day on which we are commemorating three events which differ from each other, but which are related, to be a day of reflection: 55 years since the beginning of the European adventure, 60 years since the end of the war and one year since reunification."
"This offers us a great opportunity to remember together our duty of memory and, above all, to pass this knowledge on to the younger generations who have never known war and to whom peace appears to be something natural."
"That has not been the case, however."
"The streets of our cities are full of names of people and circumstances, of events that shaped our history and which are part of our collective memory: the Westerplatte in Gdansk-Danzig, the Place Montgomery in Brussels, the Stalingrad metro station in Paris, the Boulevard Dresde, just a few metres from here, and military cemeteries of both sides dotted across Europe."
"All of this is our common memory, the memory of a continent that today has overcome what then was the subordination of the individual to the State and disregard for law and for human dignity."
"Our system today is based on the separation of powers, on popular sovereignty and on respect for human rights."
"And that is the message we must send to the whole of Europe and the entire world on marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the war and the beginning of the European Union adventure: the commitment to carry on fighting to defend the values of peace, justice and tolerance, not just for Europe, but for the whole world."
"And we must do so in the knowledge that what the citizens of Europe expect from their Union is no longer peace, because we Europeans already have peace amongst us and we all believe it to be irreversible."
"Nobody could imagine that we will ever go back to resolving our differences through arms."
"What the Europeans expect from their Union today is that it contribute to their prosperity and to their security in the face of the new threats in a world which is no longer the same as the one established at Yalta."
"I would therefore ask that we look to the future with the firm obligation to achieve that prosperity and security that our citizens are asking us for."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we wished to mark this day — the end of World War II, Europe Day and first anniversary of the reunified Europe — in a formal and unusual manner, with music in the Chamber."
"I would like to present a young Latvian, born in Riga, Miss Baiba Skride."
"Miss Skride has accepted our invitation to be here with us today, and to commemorate this event, she has proposed a Baroque piece: Bach’s Chaconne 1004."
"Alejo Carpentier said that the baroque was undoubtedly the style that most reflects European cultural diversity."
"In spite of her youth, Baiba Skride has played in the most prestigious concert halls in the world and I am sure that the improvised concert hall we have created from our Chamber will be added to her curriculum vitae today."
"Miss Skride’s talent and youth are accompanied by a violin made by Stradivarius in 1725 and which is known by the name Wilhelm, in honour of the famous German violinist August Wilhelm, to whom it belonged for almost 50 years."
"I propose that you listen and at the same time watch — because sometimes music is also to be seen rather than simply heard — this evidence that our European Union is a synthesis of history, of talent, of youth and hence of the future."
"Let us do so, if possible, with our mobile phones switched off."
"Miss Skride, your violin has the floor."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the May I and May II part-sessions as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday 4 May pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"No amendments have been proposed."
"No amendments have been proposed."
"The Independence and Democracy Group has requested that an oral question to the Commission be included, presented by Mr Farage, on the Commission’s procedure for preventing any risk of conflict of interest."
"Does anybody wish to explain the request of the Independence and Democracy Group?"
"Mr President, do not misunderstand me, I am not against people going on holiday; it is just that, normally, we have to pay for it ourselves."
"My simple request to all 25 Commissioners was for them to declare what free holidays they had received since they became Commissioners."
"They point blank refused to answer the question, treating this Parliament with contempt."
"When it leaked out that Mandelson and Barroso had enjoyed holidays on billionaires’ yachts, we were told not to worry: there was no conflict whatsoever."
"Then it emerges that one of the Latsis-owned shipyards – the Lamda Shipyard – received a EUR 10 million grant, and then Mr Barroso resigns the shipping portfolio."
"That resignation is too little, too late."
"It is about time Parliament called the Commission to account, and I urge Members to vote to change the agenda to bring Mr Barroso here this very week."
"According to our Rules of Procedure, I must now ask whether anybody wishes to speak in favour of the proposal."
"Mr President, I should like to support the proposal, and I recommend in this connection that an examination be made of Article 213 of the existing Treaties which states regarding members of the Commission: ‘When entering upon their duties they shall give a solemn undertaking that … they will respect’ – and I now move on a bit ‘ … in particular their duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefits’."
"Anyone who does not comply with this regulation in Article 213 can be dismissed or made to forfeit his or her pension rights or other similar benefits."
"The Treaty’s position is that Commissioners must behave with integrity once they no longer hold office."
"That does not mean that they do not also have to behave with integrity during their terms of office."
"I would therefore recommend that we vote in favour of the proposal and be given a full report by the Commission on the way in which Commissioners are showered with gifts."
"Since nobody wishes to speak against Mr Farage’s proposal, we shall put it to the vote."
"We now have a point of order that had been raised earlier."
"Mr President, I find it astounding that people in this House who are elected to hold the executive to account should vote against the proposal."
"You have raised a point of order and, as you know, you must tell me which Rule it refers to."
"I wanted to point out, in the light of what I said, that I did not have time to vote in favour of the proposal, and I wish to have that added to the Minutes."
"However, what happened was a disgrace."
"Alright, it will be recorded in the Minutes that you wished to vote yes."
"No amendments have been proposed."
"Mr President, further to Rule 154 of the Rules of Procedure in conjunction with what Rule 132 has to say about Rule 150, an objection has been raised to the Dombrovskis report, on which the Committee on Budgets voted even though a full voting Member raised an objection to oral amendments."
"I do not believe that this report can be debated ..."
"Your comments relate to Wednesday, but carry on please."
"The Dombrovskis report has been put on the agenda for Wednesday evening, even though procedural errors were made when it went through the Committee on Budgets."
"The fact of the matter is that substantial oral amendments were put, to which one member of the Committee objected, despite which the Committee moved to vote on the report."
"You have already received a letter concerning this; having raised this objection at the last plenary sitting, I wish to repeat it now."
"If you insist on holding this debate, I have to say that I regard it, and the previous vote, as unlawful and also contrary to the Rules of Procedure."
"Thank you for reminding me that you have written to me."
"I can confirm that I have received your letter and that the reply to your comments prepared by the services is awaiting my signature."
"You will receive it very shortly."
"No amendments have been proposed."
"We shall proceed to the one-minute speeches of political importance."
"Mr President, as the president of Intergroup responsible for traditional national minorities, I would like to inform MEP’s of our letter to President Josep Borrell, which asserts Intergroup’s full support for the legitimate request of our eleven Catalan colleagues, who petitioned to be able to use the Catalan language at the EP’s plenary sessions."
"This is in accord with Spain’s constitution and with the appeal lodged by Spain to the European Council."
"It does not involve any extra costs for the EP, as the representatives agreed to submit their claim the day before their speech at the plenary session."
"Therefore, I would like to ask President Borrell, as a Catalan himself, to present at the Presidential Meeting this petition of Intergroup’s, which requests that the Catalan language be used by Catalan speakers at future plenary sessions."
"Mr President, in the west of France, in Guérande and Saumur, as well as in Spain, in Barcelona, nearly 800 job cuts are expected as a result of internal relocation within Europe."
"Celestica, a Canadian company manufacturing electronic cards, has taken the decision to close its production sites and relocate them in the Czech Republic, a country with lower labour costs and a Member of our Union."
"Europe’s decision to devote a little more than EUR 11 billion to the regions and people hit by restructuring is a good decision."
"In a context that is also marked by relocation, however, it is absolutely vital to have a policy in support of the employees and the regions that have to sustain relocation within the Union’s borders."
"Hopes for a European social model in aid of the 25 countries of the Union that is based on strong social cohesion can only exist if our Institutions implement real and significant policies of territorial and human solidarity."
"That is why it is today essential to capitalise on this strong political desire by supporting the men and women undergoing intra-European relocation."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the Members’ attention to the fact that the International Day against homophobia occurs on 17 May, which is next week."
"I should like to urge this House and all Members to give this initiative their wholehearted support, for it is, unfortunately, still the case that not all homosexuals in Europe enjoy European basic rights."
"Only last weekend in Amsterdam, the capital of tolerance and freedom, seven persons joined in beating up a man in the most cowardly fashion, his only crime being that he held hands with the person he loved."
"At present, we remember all the victims who fell in the war in Europe, and these include many homosexuals who were persecuted and killed on account of their sexual preference – something that, even today, some countries do not acknowledge."
"I would therefore like to urge all Members to include those people in their commemoration next week."
"Mr President, last week we celebrated the first anniversary of the largest enlargement to date of the European Union."
"The accession of the ten new countries hailing from the former Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia, the Baltics and the Mediterranean is, undoubtedly, the most significant and historic event in the history of the Union."
"These countries – for years many of them locked in the iron grip of Moscow – have joined the most unique and successful experiment in the history of democratic politics."
"General de Gaulle dreamed of a united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals."
"Given the circumstances at the time – the Iron Curtain, the cold war and the military polarisation between East and West – few other than de Gaulle could have believed that would happen."
"However, it is happening and it should be celebrated."
"I wish our friends the ten new countries well."
"I come from Ireland, a country whose economy has been transformed from little more than that of a poor, Third World country into one of the strongest in Europe, courtesy of European assistance through membership, and I wish all the same benefits and success to our ten new neighbours."
"Integration has succeeded in overcoming age-old differences between European countries."
"The political and economic reunification of our continent is a victory for the spirit of Europe, one of which we should all be proud."
"Mr President, there are only a few hundred Hungarians living in Latvia today but if we believe in humane minority rights, however, then we must also mention their deprivation of rights."
"According to Latvian law, it is practically impossible for non-Latvian inhabitants of Latvia to obtain citizenship."
"They cannot vote at elections, they cannot obtain a passport and it is very difficult for them to find employment; they are considered stateless in the country they live in."
"Unfortunately, the majority of Hungarians living in Latvia also belong to the hundreds of thousands of stateless persons."
"Latvian authorities justify this discrimination as Stalin’s sins."
"I do not wish to take sides in the historical debate between Latvians and Russians."
"I understand the grievances of the Latvian nation, but at the same time I refuse to accept collective punishment."
"In all cases, discrimination is inexplicable, especially in the case of Hungarians, as we were also victims of the same Stalinist oppression."
"I hope that, in the spirit of common democratic values, my Latvian colleagues will urge their government to eliminate this form of discrimination."
"– Mr President, I would like to congratulate you for the sensitive manner in which you spoke a short while ago about the sixty years since the end of fascism, since the end of the genocide of Europeans and, in particular, of Jews."
"However, the month of May brings to mind another case of genocide by one of Hitler's predecessors, Κemal Ataturk, who, when he entered Samsun on 19 May 1919, slaughtered half a million Greek Russians."
"The historians of the time write that the Black Sea turned red and that heads were piled high in the squares."
"I think that it is a question of sensitivity on our part to condemn this incident, for which there was no Nuremburg, as there was for Hitler; for us to show the world that we, free Europe, are thinking about, know about and remember all those who committed these crimes against nations."
"The memory of these Greek Russians should be celebrated."
"I therefore wish to ask you, Mr President, to arrange a day in memory of these Greek Russians and a day in memory of the Armenians."
"It is a question of justice; it is a question of sensitivity."
"Sixty years ago, the Second World War ended in Europe when Germany’s Third Reich capitulated and hostilities ceased."
"On the occasion of this anniversary, it is worth pointing out that it was not only Hitler’s Nazi Germany that was responsible for starting this global military conflict which claimed the lives of tens of millions of people, but also Stalin’s internationalist Soviet Union."
"The agreement concluded between these two countries in August 1939, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, made it a foregone conclusion that the two socialist dictatorships would carry out a joint military attack on the other democratic nations of Europe."
"The Soviet Union only started fighting on the Allies’ side in 1941, when it was attacked by Germany, its former partner."
"Unlike the Allied forces in the West, the Red Army introduced a system of Communist coercion after driving the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe."
"In reality, this amounted to a new occupation, which at times was even worse than the previous German one."
"At the conferences in Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam, Stalin received political backing for his actions from representatives of Western countries, including the USA."
"Shameful as it is, this is what really happened, and we should not forget it in our endeavours to construct a political vision of the unification of Europe."
"Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to tomorrow’s vote in the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective for the 2007-2013 period."
"As rapporteur for the funding and programming of rural development in this period, I ask you, Mr President, to lend your support to the justified expressions of concern in relation to, and demands for, adequate financial resources for the ongoing development of rural areas, so that their development in line with the requirements of Lisbon and Gothenburg may continue to be guaranteed in future."
"– Mr President, following on from meetings with workers and company representatives from the textile and clothing industry in Portugal, it must be stated once again that measures must be taken at European level, as a matter of urgency, to halt the further deterioration of a situation in which companies are closing down and unemployment is on the rise, with the social impact that that implies for thousands of workers and their families."
"It is impossible to understand why the Commission has been putting off taking the immediate action that is required."
"In light of the seriousness of the current situation in the sector, it is appalling that the Commission has postponed making a decision on formally beginning the process to activate the safeguard clause, and that it has in fact triggered a so-called investigation, which could take months."
"The socio-economic situation in some of the regions most reliant on the sector is serious and could become even worse if the Commission and the Council continue to shirk their responsibilities."
"Mr President, I have drawn the Commission’s attention to the problems relating to soft fruit faced by the EU Member States, in particular Poland, on many occasions, both in writing and orally."
"I addressed my concerns to the Commission on 28 October 2004, for example, and on 13 December I asked the President to take action with a view to ensuring protective measures were put in place."
"I would like to thank him for having intervened in this matter."
"I was delighted to hear, from the Commission representative who took part in the meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture on 19 April 2005, that a delegation would be sent to Poland to conduct an on-the-spot investigation into the problems, and indeed this trip has already taken place."
"In view of the limited amount of time left before the first soft fruit is picked, I would urge the President to ensure that the delegation presents its proposed solutions before the harvest begins."
"If it fails to do so, we will have to wait another year before intervening in the market for soft fruit, and Polish producers will suffer further losses."
"I would point out that Poland produces 50% of all soft fruit grown in the EU, and I would ask the President once again to take action on this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House something that can scarcely be called good news."
"With effect from 1 January 2005, quotas on textiles and clothing became a thing of the past in Europe, and, since then, dramatic changes have occurred."
"Within three months, textile imports from China have risen by a quite considerable extent – by 700-800%, in fact."
"A firm in my electoral district, having already sustained serious losses as a result of this flood of imports, has seen its order book reduced by 8%, and as many as 9% of its workforce have already been laid off."
"This change puts millions of jobs throughout Europe at risk."
"I therefore call on Members of this House not only to support the Commission in its action to deal with these developments, but also to use their influence on it in such a way that these measures may be made even tougher and even more effective."
"Mr President, following the referendums on the European Constitution in the different Member States, we have to establish that in the debate on this Constitution, the arguments that are being put forward are not always correct."
"For example, the April issue of , an information sheet issued in Belgium by the Commission, contained an article in which those opposed to the Constitution were accused of being populists who try to instil fear in people."
"That is a widespread misconception, and one that is kept alive – whether deliberately or not – by certain pressure groups."
"As it happens, current events show that things are slightly more complicated than people sometimes let on."
"What are we to make of the speech by Mr Donner, the Dutch Justice Minister, in which he stated that the rejection of the Constitution would have the same consequences as the collapse of, and civil war in, former Yugoslavia?"
"A week later, the Dutch Prime Minster, Mr Balkenende drew a link between rejection of the Constitution and Auschwitz."
"On a French public radio station, a doctor claimed that victory for the ‘no’ camp would be a disaster for AIDS research."
"That is reprehensible."
"Within our own Parliament, a ‘rapid reaction force’ was set up to respond to incorrect information by those opposed to the Constitution; we should also respond to incorrect information disseminated by those in favour of it."
"I should like to alert the House to various irregularities relating to pension payments."
"In certain countries, the latest trend is to increase the retirement age and to cut pensions, or even not to pay them at all."
"Those responsible justify this by citing economic reasons and the ageing population, even though the root cause of the latter is the anti-family policy that has been pursued for many years."
"Policyholders commencing employment need to be sure that they will receive a pension, provided they meet certain requirements and a set amount of time has passed."
"The state should take the necessary steps to ensure the funds needed to safeguard constitutional rights are available."
"Countries that amend regulations as they go along, fail to pay pensions or reduce the level of these pensions are violating fundamental social rights that derive from the natural dignity of every human being."
"Particularly in the EU Member States, where respect for social rights is writ large, these rights should not be violated."
"This also follows from the principle of public trust in the state."
"The ceremonies taking place in Moscow today to mark the end of the Second World War were intended to serve as a symbol of global reconciliation and unity."
"One cannot help feeling, however, that the Kremlin is attempting to use this occasion to rewrite history."
"It has disputed the crimes committed in Katyn, where thousands of Polish officers were murdered, as well as the genocide committed in the labour camps and the illegal annexation of the Baltic States."
"It was for this reason that the leaders of Lithuania, Estonia and Georgia boycotted the ceremony."
"We must not forget that the Second World War began with an almost simultaneous attack on Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and that Hitler and Nazi Germany were not the only architects of the war, as the Soviet Union also acted as an accessory."
"Finally, we must bear in mind that the end of the fascist occupation of Eastern Europe marked the beginning of Soviet domination."
"If we fail to remember these facts, today’s ceremony in Russia may turn into a eulogy of Soviet imperialism instead of a celebration of the victory over fascism."
"Mr President, religious freedom is one of Europe’s important fundamental values."
"Two days ago, Christians attending mass in the Turkish city of Bergamos, in the presence of the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, came under attack from a large mob of Turkish nationalists known as ‘Grey Wolves’, who tried to disrupt the mass by shouting obscenities, abuse and death threats at the attending worshippers."
"The Turkish police made no attempt to stop them and nobody was arrested or prosecuted."
"This is one of many episodes of state-tolerated and, on many occasions, state-sponsored persecution of Christians in Turkey."
"Mr President, could you please send a letter of strong protest to the Turkish Prime Minister, telling him in no uncertain terms that, if he is to have us believe that Turkey seriously has European aspirations, then he must, amongst other things, make sure that the rights of religious minorities and, in particular, of Christians in Turkey, are properly protected and respected?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the affection felt for Europe by many European citizens is, unfortunately, beginning to wane."
"In Italy this is undoubtedly due in part to the change from the lira to the euro, which has increased the prices of all products, leading consumers to believe that they are spending less in the new currency than in lira."
"I should be grateful, Mr President, if you informed the Council and the appropriate Commissioner of my proposal for resolving this issue: the compulsory marking of prices in both euros and the old currency; the price shown in lira should be double that in euros."
"I am convinced that that will help restore the affection felt for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the number of Poles occupying top management posts in the Commission is a source of some concern to Polish MEPs."
"Even though it was agreed that Poles would hold 17 of these posts, there is not yet a single Polish director-general, deputy director-general, director, chief advisor or head of unit."
"Not a single one of these posts is occupied by a Pole, although the intention was that Poland would receive 17 of them."
"Lithuania and Cyprus, which were meant to receive four and two posts respectively, are facing the same problem, taking the total to three countries."
"Furthermore, there are still no Estonian, Latvian or Slovakian directors-general or deputy directors-general."
"There has been public outrage in the new Member States over this situation, which beggars belief, and I would ask the President to intervene in the matter."
"Mr President, I want to touch on a strange concept referred to several times recently: the assertion that the collapse of the USSR was ‘a tragedy for the Russian people’."
"Well, other peoples changed their status from captive nations to free nations."
"Does the first statement mean that Russian people are so different that liberation from Soviet authoritarian tyranny made them tragically unhappy?"
"No authority, not even the President of Russia, has the right to present his nation in such a cartoon-like manner."
"We should be concerned with how to defend the dignity of the Russian people."
"Mr President, I am sure everyone here today will be aware that last Thursday there was a general election in Britain."
"It was conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system, which is inherently unfair and is no longer defensible in the 21st century."
"It produced some strange results: the Labour Party that now forms the government won 55% of the seats based on only 35% of the vote."
"Thirty-nine per cent of the electorate could not be bothered to vote."
"Britain now has a government put in place by only 21% of the electorate."
"In 1999 the European Union forced Britain to adopt a form of proportional representation for the European parliamentary elections."
"Since the European Commission is now the real government of Britain, perhaps it could do us a favour and force Britain to adopt a form of proportional representation for parliamentary elections."
"Under a fair voting system, the UK Independence Party could gain representation in the British Parliament and use it eventually to bring about our desired goal: Britain’s unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest news from France is not encouraging."
"In the run-up to the country’s referendum on the Constitution, journalists working for the state-run media, in particular television channels, have mounted furious protests, accusing the authorities and the media bosses concerned of a serious lack of objectivity in their coverage of the European Constitution."
"Events have taken a dramatic turn, and there have been accusations of blatant bias."
"I believe that this House should prove itself equal to the task of addressing this issue."
"After all, who will see to it that the media tell the truth in the run-up to the key political decision to be taken by the French people, if we fail to do so?"
"I believe that the President should take action on this matter, and that we should send a delegation of observers to France to find out whether democratic principles are being violated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform the House of the disastrous situation in which the Polish fishing industry has found itself as a result of the protective measures put in place by the European Union."
"One can only assume that these measures are intended to wipe out Poland’s Baltic fisheries, and it is already an established fact that they led to a significant rise in unemployment in coastal regions after Poland joined the European Union."
"We Poles have been forced to accept absurd catch limits that will do nothing whatsoever to help protect stocks."
"There is no biological or economic justification for these limits, and it is my firm belief that they were arrived at on the basis of political considerations."
"To date, the Commission has failed to propose any solutions that would allow Polish fishermen to catch up with their Western counterparts."
"Most importantly, no proposals have been made regarding ways in which EU funds could be used to modernise the fishing fleet."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the Commission Statement: Justice for the McCartney family."
"I would like to inform you that the sisters of Robert McCartney are in the gallery, together with Mr Niall O'Neill."
"We welcome them to our debate."
". Mr President, the Commission wishes to reconfirm that it condemns Mr McCartney's murder outright."
"It totally understands and expresses its admiration for the decisive action taken by the McCartney sisters in their quest for truth and justice and wholeheartedly supports their efforts."
"Although the Commission, as of course the McCartney family understands, cannot intervene in judicial investigations and proceedings by the Member States, it wishes to take this opportunity today to pay homage to the courage, dignity and quest for truth and justice on the part of the McCartney family."
"The Commission cannot but express its admiration for the strong and courageous stand taken by the McCartney sisters in their campaign for justice."
"It would like to express its solidarity with the McCartney family and is certain that, once the Irish judicial proceedings have been completed, the truth will out."
"While there is no such thing as freedom without security, there is also no such thing as security without justice."
"The rule of law is the cornerstone of democracy and fundamental freedoms and the McCartney sisters are fighting not for revenge, but for justice."
"The Commission supports their case unreservedly."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming the representatives of the McCartney family here this evening and conveying the best wishes of the European Parliament to all the sisters – Catherine, Paula, Gemma, Clare and Donna, and indeed to the late Robert McCartney’s partner, Bridgeen."
"There is a welcome to them here in the European Parliament."
"On behalf of Mr Poettering, the leader of the PPE-DE Group, on my own behalf, and particularly on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation, I would like to pledge our fullest support to them in their courageous, dignified and determined pursuit of justice for their brother Robert’s brutal murder."
"As my Party Leader in Dáil Éireann, Enda Kenny, said, Robert McCartney’s vicious beating and stabbing to death was ordered by a commander in the Belfast brigade of the provisional IRA, following a minor dispute between the commander’s uncle and the group with which Mr McCartney was socialising."
"Robert McCartney was in the wrong place at the wrong time but this was no minor bar room brawl, as some have disgracefully attempted to portray it."
"His brutal beating and stabbing was a serious and savage attack, which bore all the hallmarks of a politically motivated IRA murder."
"It was perpetrated by up to 12 killers, a significant number of whom are known members of the provisional IRA."
"Initially, Sinn Féin’s Alex Maskey vehemently denied IRA involvement but, two weeks later, having spoken to the family, Sinn Féin’s Gerry Kelly issued a statement on the matter and they accepted IRA involvement."
"This killing was ruthlessly supervised and forensically covered up by men announcing that their activities were IRA business, by men who proceeded to intimidate the 70 witnesses to the crime and their families, first forbidding them from calling an ambulance on the night in question, as Robert McCartney bled to death before their eyes and his colleague lay seriously injured."
"Then they warned them not to cooperate with the authorities."
"Such is the level of fear and intimidation of the witnesses that the code of silence surrounding the event has still not been broken, nearly four months after Robert McCartney’s death."
"In tonight’s motion, we are calling ‘on the leadership of Sinn Féin to insist that those responsible for the murder and the witnesses to the murder cooperate directly with the PSNI and be free from the threat of reprisals from the IRA’, or indeed to cooperate with the Ombudsman of Northern Ireland."
"The appalling offer by the IRA on 8 March 2005 to shoot dead the perpetrators of this awful crime is abhorrent and barbaric and has been met with incredulity in the civilised world."
"To even suggest that amends might be made through such summary justice indicates what few lessons, if any, have been learnt by the IRA over the past 30 years."
"It shows how little understanding this group has of the basic tenets of the rule of law in a democratic state."
"The rule of law Sinn Féin advocates, and the IRA enforces, is a brutal regime of terror, intimidation and violence."
"One parallel to, and incompatible with, democratic society."
"One so grounded in illegality and criminality that it constitutes an affront to the very concept of justice and leaves its victims, such as the McCartney family in this case, powerless and without redress for their terrible loss."
"But these brave women, the McCartney women, through refusing to be intimidated in their four-month campaign for justice for their brother and their partner, have achieved more to highlight the residual thuggery and criminality that has existed in Northern Ireland since the official IRA ceasefire than either of the two governments or the political establishment in Northern Ireland have managed to achieve in the last decade."
"Today we, the European Parliament drawn from 25 Member States, add our voice to that of the Irish Government, the British Government and the United States Congress, in support of the McCartney campaign for justice."
"By bringing the killers of Robert to justice, there is a bigger statement being made in terms of a total rejection by all decent people of this continued wanton killing, maiming and violence."
"It is a call for real peace."
"I hope we will be in a position to help Robert’s family if the necessity arises, if none of the witnesses, nor indeed the IRA or Sinn Féin themselves, are brave and honourable enough to supply to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or the Ombudsman the information necessary to institute criminal proceedings."
"We are not in danger of creating a precedent: this case is unique."
"For the first time the provisional movement has been shaken to the core by the depth of reaction from within its own community."
"They can now put their words into action."
"This case is a test of the movement’s sincerity, of its repeated disavowal of criminal activity in all its forms – or are they just more weasel words?"
"Time will tell."
"I commend the resolution to the House."
". Mr President, I wish to express the wholehearted support of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the McCartney family in their quest for justice, truth and peace."
"The McCartney sisters joined us for a group meeting chaired by Martin Schulz, when we – as we shall continue to do – marvelled at their courage and uprightness."
"We are very glad that Mr De Rossa and Mr Titley have taken up their cause, approaching it from two sides, which are, though, ultimately one and the same."
"If I, not being Irish, address the subject, I do so not least to put it on record that we see this, not as an Irish problem, but as a problem for Europe as a whole."
"When, as we are currently doing, we commemorate the end of the Second World War, we also recall that Europe is, for us, the answer to violence, whether or not politically motivated."
"The fact is that the sort of acts we are talking about today are not political measures, but criminal activities, albeit wrapped up in a political cloak."
"For all of us in this House, though, and for my group at any rate, Europe is about seeking to resolve conflicts, to discuss, and to negotiate; it is not about violence or about finding out who can be most violent."
"John Hume, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also attended our group meeting today, and he stressed how important it had always been for him to perceive and acknowledge the differences in this Europe of ours – not just the differences between two sides, but differences on the same side."
"What has happened in this instance – the cold-blooded murder of a man simply because someone did not like him or perhaps because his opinions differed from their own – is not acceptable."
"Even if a political grouping has definite objectives, it must nonetheless accept differing opinions, and so let me reiterate our wholehearted support for the McCartney family, for these courageous women, these courageous sisters, as they continue their struggle."
"We will be alongside them until the day when peace and justice also prevail in Northern Ireland, and, with them, the European spirit among those who do not as yet accept it."
"We will fight to the very end."
". Mr President, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this resolution on the murder of Robert McCartney."
"On my own behalf and that of the ALDE Group, I warmly welcome the sisters and partner of Mr McCartney to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today."
"I should like to commend their courage and tenacity."
"They have raised their case in Belfast, Dublin, Washington DC and now in the European Parliament."
"I have no doubt but that we, in Parliament, will give them the strongest possible support in their pursuit of justice."
"The circumstances of Robert McCartney’s murder shocked very many people."
"But the forensic clean-up and subsequent intimidation of witnesses and others outraged all of those who genuinely believe in justice, in truth, in the rule of law and democracy itself."
"While I know that the original intention was and still is to bring Mr McCartney’s murderers to justice, that search for justice has influenced the political landscape in Northern Ireland."
"It has dared to challenge those who thought of themselves as untouchable."
"It has forced the spotlight into some of the darker places where violence and intimidation still hold sway."
"People have whispered about this for years, but those of us who did not experience it listened with incredulity and, I have to add, a certain amount of disbelief."
"However, it is now out in the open."
"While I cannot say that it will never happen again, I can say that finally the veil of secrecy has been lifted."
"It is not possible in such a short time to give any meaningful background to the situation in Northern Ireland, but like any area where there is conflict, it is always a complex situation."
"Those who would have us believe that in Northern Ireland we have the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other, do not accurately describe the situation."
"I fully endorse the statement that violence and peace cannot coexist."
"But in order to finally eradicate violence and promote peace, there must be genuine willingness to enter into dialogue and to share power, and there must be an acceptance that the past cannot dictate the future."
"When we look to the future, we look to women like the McCartneys, who refuse to bow down to intimidation and who want, more than anything, to live in a peaceful society."
"Unfortunately, when it comes to the peace process, we do not see too many women around the negotiating table; but when it comes to peace-making and peace-building in communities and neighbourhoods, it is often women who take the leading role; women who have an understanding that peace is not just about political statements, or documents signed or agreements negotiated."
"Such agreements are just the framework for peace."
"The real work of peace-building takes place in everyday interaction: in schools, offices, clubs and community centres, where women play a hugely important role."
"With regard to peace funding, the EU has enabled many people of goodwill to contribute to peace-building in Northern Ireland."
"I believe that the EU can make a further contribution today."
"If the Police Service of Northern Ireland is unable to bring a prosecution, the EU could grant a financial contribution from the budget line for aid for the victims of terrorism to assist the McCartney family to mount civil proceedings in its search for the truth."
". Mr President, I also wish to welcome the partner and relatives of Robert McCartney today."
"This weekend, I attended a vigil in London to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of Brian Douglas at the hands of the police."
"That is a fact, but no one has been prosecuted or held accountable for his death."
"Brian’s family is not alone: there are many such cases in the UK where people have lost loved ones to such violent deaths, yet no one is punished or held to account publicly in a court of law."
"The families will tell you of their burning sense of injustice at this state of affairs and their anger that the killer of their loved one will continue to lead their own life, see their own children grow, spend time with friends and all of those things that they have robbed from their victim."
"Robert McCartney will never see his children grow."
"We know that in many places witnesses have failed to come forward for one of two reasons: a misplaced sense of loyalty or fear of consequences."
"In the McCartney case we have both, set against a political backdrop that has further constricted the truth."
"Such silence hands the rule of law to thugs and to those who can feel powerful only by creating a culture of fear."
"They fear the truth."
"The offer from the IRA, as we have heard, to shoot the killers was an affront to justice and shows breathtaking arrogance."
"The IRA is not the law!"
"In Northern Ireland, whatever the past, the ballot box now holds sway and the rule of law goes with that."
"There can be no argument for paramilitary justice for any sector of the community and my Group believes there never has been."
"So the death holds a symbolism for the future: an opportunity to break with the past."
"That is why my Group has decided to support the spirit of the resolution, despite some of the wording and difficulties concerning the possible financial contribution from the Union, which is why we have asked for a separate vote on that issue."
"However, the case offers an opportunity to break free from a culture of secrecy and fear and to bring the killers to account."
"It is time to break that stranglehold of the past and to create a rule of law that applies to all people in all communities."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group does, of course, wish to give Robert McCartney’s sisters a very warm welcome to the European Parliament."
"We wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to them for having been able, in April, to meet them and to assure them that our group is alongside them in the search for their brother’s murderer, in their quest for justice, in their search for peace of mind, and in seeking to bring about the social conditions that enable people with differing views to live together in peace."
"To them I say: in your campaign against murder, we will always be by your side."
"My group supports the justified demand that the murderer or murderers surrender to the police and that the witnesses should make – whether to the police or to the ombudsman or to some other body – statements that will stand up in court and help ensure that the murderer is punished as he deserves to be."
"There must be no walls of silence where murder is committed."
"It is for all of us to demand that the civil law should banish such things from every society."
"Every institution, every association, every party, every individual must use their influence to cause the rule of law to prevail, not only in the European Union, but also throughout the world."
"In this sense, we all share in the responsibility for ensuring a climate of openness in every land on earth, one that makes it possible for the rule of law to prevail and for laws to be obeyed."
"My group condemns every use of military force as a means of policy."
"We condemn state-sponsored oppression and the use of force by the armed services or the police as a means of suppressing democratic movements, every bit as much as we do individual acts of murder or terrorism carried out by individuals or political groups against individuals or the structures of civil society, for such things do nothing to help deal with society’s problems; on the contrary, they make matters worse."
"Believing it to be necessary to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, my group calls on all interested parties to press on with the peace process that was set in motion by the Good Friday Agreement and to actively promote it."
"In its motion for a resolution, my group’s sole concern is with the case of Robert McCartney, and it makes no attempt to establish a connection with certain political groups that are alleged to be responsible for his murder."
"There is a difference between someone inciting someone else to do something, doing it themselves, doing it on someone else’s behalf, or being a member of an organisation."
"That is why this resolution is drafted in this way, and I believe you will be able to wholeheartedly endorse its substance."
". Mr President, as an Irish MEP, I hesitate to speak on this matter."
"Since the tragic killing of Robert McCartney, I am concerned that politicians have pushed their own electoral agenda in the context of the recent elections and have lost sight of the real point of all this."
"I am, therefore, going to speak personally."
"A man has been unspeakably, brutally murdered and the perpetrators have been able to walk freely and have not yet been brought to justice."
"His fiancée, Bridgeen, his children, his family, are caught up in a fight at a time when they should be free to grieve and work towards closure."
"Justice, it seems, is eluding these brave people and so they have come to us."
"But what can we offer besides more rhetoric in this already over-opinionated debate?"
"We can give them what they ask for: financial assistance in their struggle."
"Funds will pay the legal bills and that is necessary."
"It will not, however, bring them justice: for this, I call on those present on that fateful night to have courage and testify against those who committed this crime."
"I ask this, not as a Member of this Parliament, but rather as a mother who cannot imagine the pain this courageous family is going through."
"It is this Parliament’s duty to help financially."
"It is our obligation to seek peace for Northern Ireland."
"But, as a mother, I mostly beseech those with information on the thugs who perpetrated this act to come forward."
"This family needs justice to get closure and completion of this saga and to grieve in peace."
"They are in my prayers."
". Mr President, I should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the McCartney family to the Chamber to witness an unusual, unprecedented debate."
"Anybody who hears the story of Robert McCartney and what happened to him cannot but be struck by the malicious intent of those who were there."
"We can all, at times, excuse an occasional argument or even an accidental slap that might be given."
"But this was the sequence of events that took place that night: Robert McCartney was specifically targeted and people were instructed to take him out and kill him; those same people were then instructed to ensure that no emergency services could assist him and told to clean up the bar, eliminating all signs of any involvement or any link to any individual through forensic evidence and so on."
"The women of the McCartney family – Paula, Catherine, Donna, Gemma, Clare and Bridgeen – who are ordinary women in every aspect of their lives, have done something extraordinary."
"Through their pain, sorrow and search for justice they have united people across countries and political divides, including those who have had no involvement in any form of politics but can empathise with the pain and suffering of a family."
"It is now incumbent on those who have influence in Northern Ireland and those who have influence on these members of the IRA and other political organisations to give them up to the police service and the prosecution; to allow for justice to rule and prevail."
"We speak about democracy on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War."
"We speak about justice and remembering victims."
"There have been thousands of victims in the conflict of Northern Ireland."
"Many of them from all communities have not received justice."
"Now is the time for people to stand up and show their true democratic principles; to show that they believe in the rule of law; that they believe in justice and equality and parity of esteem for all people in all families."
"It is up to us, in Parliament, to ensure that if this is not done at a political level in Northern Ireland, we can assist them on a legal level."
"Mr President, right at the outset I salute the superb courage of the McCartney family."
"Intimidation and the capacity to impose its will through fear has always been as vital a weapon to the IRA as its guns and its bombs."
"In exposing and standing up to the thuggery of Sinn Féin/IRA, the McCartney sisters have shown remarkable bravery."
"This was a foul murder."
"By a hand-signal indicating a knife should be used, a member of the IRA’s northern command gave the order to kill, and a key Sinn Féin member savagely wielded the knife and butchered this innocent man before multiple witnesses."
"An IRA unit, led by the volunteer who had fetched and then disposed of the knife, then coordinated a clean-up operation to destroy forensic and real evidence, including the CCTV footage."
"Then, in classic IRA style, the intimidation brigade swung into action to silence the witnesses."
"Though the IRA and Sinn Féin claim to have expelled or suspended up to ten members linked to this murder, their duplicity and double-dealing is amply illustrated by the fact that, three months after this murder, this cut-throat psychopath remained publicly proclaimed as one of Sinn Féin’s official treasurers."
"And the man who ordered the killing still struts the streets of Belfast in the company of the IRA’s chief of intelligence, Bobby Storey, and leading provisional IRA man, Eddy Copeland."
"So much for the IRA’s supposed disciplinary action: it is a farce."
"We are due to hear in this debate from one of Sinn Féin/IRA’s representatives in this House."
"She and her partners are in a position to help this family by influencing Sinn Féin members, like Bob Fitzsimmons and Joe Fitzpatrick, and other people like Terry Davison, truthfully to tell the lawful authorities what they know of the horrific events in the alleyway."
"I challenge her to do so, but instead I fear we will hear the usual Sinn Féin empty, pious, weasel words that reek of insincerity, with hypocrisy dripping from every syllable."
"Sinn Féin/IRA could secure justice for the McCartney family but their priority is to protect their own."
"Hence the IRA-enforced wall of silence."
"Punitive and deterrent justice through the criminal courts is much the best option."
"If Sinn Féin/IRA succeed in denying criminal justice to this family, then I endorse the call that the EU should help fund an action so that the killers and conspirators can be pursued at least through the civil courts."
"But, given that the IRA has benefited to the tune of EUR 40 million from its Northern Bank robbery, it would be an odious scandal if state legal aid were available to anyone to defend such proceedings."
"Finally, I would add that the EU fund should also be available to the many other victims of the IRA, who for years have been denied justice because of this same intimidation."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by adding my words of welcome to the McCartney family here this evening in our House, and pay tribute to their courage, strength and determination in what they have achieved and in what they have tried to do."
"I welcome the opportunity to have this debate."
"I wish to give my wholehearted support to the McCartney family in their quest for justice for their brother Robert."
"The events that led to Robert McCartney’s murder show clearly the collusion that occurred."
"That night, not only was a murder committed, but also the bar was systematically wiped clean of evidence."
"This all happened in front of witnesses who seem to have seen nothing."
"The truth is that they are being intimidated and are afraid to come forward: such is the hold of the provisional IRA on the people in this area."
"I would urge those who have information to come forward and give that information to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and put it on record, and finally bring an end to this."
"The provisional IRA has instilled fear into people."
"Unfortunately, we seem to be no closer to resolving this murder."
"The great danger now is that the further we get away from the terrible events of 30 January, the more likely that this – like so many other murders of innocent people in Northern Ireland over the last 35 years – will go unsolved and will be forgotten about."
"That is something I would not want to happen."
"I ask Parliament and the Commission to give every support to this joint resolution."
"I would like this House to reject what I consider to be a disgraceful resolution by the GUE/NGL Group."
"If Mr Markov had lived in Northern Ireland he would not have come out with the rubbish he spoke tonight to try to justify the cause of provisional IRA/Sinn Féin, who are sitting behind him."
"It is a well-known fact that the provisional IRA and Sinn Féin are inextricably linked."
"I do not want to see the continued stonewalling against all appeals to bring those responsible for this evil deed to justice."
"We cannot condone such terror or intimidation in any part of the European Union."
"I do not want to see it in any part of any society in which I would want to live, in Northern Ireland in the future."
"We have suffered enough for far too long and we want a better life for everyone."
"Mr President, this Parliament has a very good record as a strong supporter of the peace process in Northern Ireland and, indeed, we were strong backers of the peace fund for Northern Ireland."
"It is therefore natural that we are concerned that the peace process has been running into difficulty, and the McCartney murder highlights one of the reasons for these difficulties."
"It is often the case that so-called ‘freedom struggles’ come to be used by criminal elements who use a political cause as a cover for their activities."
"The McCartney murder has shown that this is happening in Northern Ireland."
"As we have heard, we have the motiveless murder of an innocent man."
"That murder has been met by a wall of silence and intimidation little different from that imposed by the Mafia elsewhere."
"As peace becomes more possible, the more the criminals – the drug runners, the bullies, the extortionists – feel threatened."
"Frankly, we have reached a crucial point in the peace process."
"It will not work unless we can break the hold of the gangsters."
"People have to come to realise that the so-called liberators have become their jailers."
"This is not a phenomenon restricted purely to the Nationalist side."
"It is also a phenomenon of which we are aware on the Unionist side."
"But the issue we are debating today is the murder of Robert McCartney, and we need to keep that issue in the public eye."
"That is why Sinn Féin, in particular, has to break the wall of silence so that it can set its community free."
"That is why we would support the use of the budget line for aid to the victims of terrorism in order to provide finance for any civil action taken by the family – money, I hasten to add, not directly for the family but money for a court action."
"We have to remember that for evil to thrive it only takes good men and women to remain silent."
"The results of the general election in Northern Ireland last week show that there has been a move in support of those who are opposed to the Good Friday agreement."
"Time is running out for the peace process and that is why we need to maintain our pressure on those responsible for the murder and cover-up because, unless we resolve this issue, the peace process will fail completely."
"Mr President, I agree with all speakers here today who have said that there is no argument for paramilitary justice."
"Nobody in Parliament today has condoned or justified the terrible act, but all have called for justice."
"There is no need for the IRA to continue to exist."
"Sinn Féin has asked the IRA to cease its armed policy."
"It should do so immediately."
"That will help to prevent the recurrence of such acts as the murder of Robert McCartney."
"However, right now there must be an insistence that those who cold-bloodedly murdered Mr McCartney and those who witnessed it should cooperate fully with the police service of Northern Ireland."
"Equally, there is an urgent need to moderate the language of politics in Northern Ireland."
"In recent times the mask has slipped and parties who advocate peaceful means have used inflammatory language, which exacerbates rather than calms the situation."
"There is a phrase often used in Northern Ireland politics: ‘We all jump together’."
"Some of those who took that leap of faith in earlier times were not rewarded for their courage and now find themselves more on the periphery than holding the middle ground."
"Now others stand on the edge of that very same precipice."
"They have the responsibility and the duty to jump together."
"Mr President, Sinn Féin supports the McCartney family’s demand for those responsible for Robert’s murder to face trial and will continue to do all that it can to help them."
"I welcome them here today."
"Our party has met with the McCartney family a number of times."
"I met them a few weeks ago when they visited Parliament in Brussels."
"I have pledged them my support and the support of our party."
"Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams has called on those responsible to come forward and admit their responsibility for this horrendous murder."
"They have refused."
"He has also called on everyone who was in the vicinity of Magennis’s Bar to provide full and frank statements."
"Because we take this matter so seriously, eleven members of our party who were in the bar on that night and one who arrived on the scene later were suspended without prejudice."
"This has been done to establish whether they complied with the call by party leaders for everyone to provide a full and frank statement."
"Two members were expelled for refusing to follow this instruction; four others resigned; the other six remain suspended pending a report to our party’s national executive."
"As a Sinn Féin MEP and as an individual, I could not campaign for the victims of British or Unionist paramilitary thuggery if I was not as clear and as committed to justice for the McCartney family."
"Those responsible for the brutal killing of Robert McCartney should admit to what they did in a court of law."
"That is the only decent thing for them to do."
"Others who have any information should come forward."
"It is our belief that the PSNI the Police Service of Northern Ireland could and should have acted by now."
"It has not carried out a thorough investigation."
"Mr President, I too should like to welcome the McCartney family members to the Chamber."
"I salute their courage and bravery in endeavouring to get justice for their brother."
"Robert McCartney was brutally murdered by a gang of thugs and criminals masquerading as Republican political activists or IRA freedom fighters."
"These people should be brought to justice."
"They have murdered an innocent man and severely injured his colleague."
"They have compromised the good names and reputations of those people in their own political family who were witnesses to, but not involved in, this murder."
"The entirely innocent people who were accidentally present at the time of the murder have been obliged to remain silent about these events: in effect to become accomplices in the crime of these thugs and criminals."
"The guilty people continue to walk the streets of their community and to associate with their political family despite the pretence of disowning them by the Sinn Féin leadership."
"Its political and parliamentary leadership has shown that it is unable or unwilling to control them."
"Their continued freedom raises a fundamental question concerning Sinn Féin and the IRA movement: who controls the direction that this movement takes in the future?"
"Is its future to be shaped by people who genuinely subscribe to the Irish peace process and to the resolution of the problem in Ireland by democratic means, or are Sinn Féin and the IRA controlled by people who are prepared to tolerate and even support criminal acts of murder?"
"I know that these sorts of acts do not only happen on one side of the community, unfortunately."
"There are other groups involved in paramilitary activities, beatings and shootings."
"They too must be condemned."
"But the leadership of Sinn Féin and the IRA has the power and influence to bring the thugs and criminals who murdered Robert McCartney to justice if it so wants."
"So far it has shown itself to be more interested in political posturing and media manipulation than in getting justice for the McCartney family."
"Why is it that the McCartney family has to go to Washington, Brussels, Strasbourg, London and other places to get justice when, in its own community, it is not being properly represented by the people who say they represent it – Sinn Féin/IRA?"
"Why is the family looking for justice here?"
"Why is Sinn Féin/IRA not helping it on the ground to get justice within its own community?"
"Yesterday an article was written by Jim Cusack in . If half or one-third of what he wrote is true, then Sinn Féin/IRA has a serious problem about controlling what is happening in the communities it says it represents."
"The time has come for Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness to produce the people guilty of this crime and oblige them to submit themselves to the will of the courts."
"They should not be allowed to hide behind the cover of the political movement they claim to support."
"I support this resolution and the proposal for the family to be given full funding for any legal fees it may incur if it goes to trial."
"Mr President, I, too, want to welcome and salute members of the McCartney family, who continue their crusade for justice outside Ireland and within it."
"On 30 January, their brother Robert was murdered by members of the Irish Republican Army in Belfast."
"This is not the only brutal murder that has, unfortunately, taken place on our island in the last 30 years; but this one has caused many across the world to sit up and recognise the activity that is continuing in Ireland seven years after the historic Good Friday Agreement."
"The facts are sobering."
"A savage murder was ordered outside a pub in Belfast less than four months ago, carried out by psychopaths, witnessed by 70 to 80 people."
"A clinical clean-up operation – which took some time, I might add – was then ordered by local IRA leaders."
"Since then, there has been such intimidation within the community that it has resulted in silence: people live in fear of reprisals if they speak out."
"In this House, we have representatives from the political party Sinn Féin who, by their own admission, have a special relationship with the IRA and that is why we refer to them."
"Both the Irish and British Governments describe them as two sides of the same coin."
"Sinn Féin is not and has not been doing enough to bring justice to this horrid affair."
"It is also a fact that Sinn Fein’s influence within communities in Northern Ireland can bring about justice in this case."
"But what we hear are words and more words of support instead of actions on the ground."
"Robert McCartney’s sisters continue their quest for justice and we must support them here in this House where we can."
"We need to end impunity where it exists: outside the European Union, where we have influence; but more importantly, within the European Union and in this case in a community in Northern Ireland."
"This Parliament can help by raising the issue and also potentially by providing finance, as stated in the motion for a resolution."
"I support both those ideas."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to make financial assistance available if a civil case proceeds."
"We hope that will not be the case and that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will bring a trial successfully to court, with the cooperation of those who have influence within communities in Northern Ireland."
"The week before last, we in this Parliament adopted a resolution on human rights."
"Its essence was the need to end the scourge of impunity in parts of the world."
"We must lead by example and do the same in Belfast."
"Mr President, the sole purpose of this resolution is to achieve justice for the McCartney family – whom I welcome here this evening – by insisting that normal policing and judicial procedures be allowed to take their course in relation to the murder of their brother Robert."
"It is claimed by Sinn Féin that the murder of Robert McCartney was not politically motivated."
"That will not be known for certain until this matter is heard in a court of law."
"It is a fact that the forensic clean-up of the murder scene, the intimidation of witnesses, the offer by the IRA to murder the murderers and the refusal to cooperate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland are politically motivated and cannot be separated from the murder itself."
"It is also a fact that the so-called IRA is the most active and politically driven perpetrator of violence and intimidation in Northern Ireland, that it engages in widespread criminality in Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland and also in Britain and does so to enforce its rule of law and to fund its activities."
"Until that criminal activity is stopped definitively and the iron grip that the Republican movement exercises on various parts of Northern Ireland is ended, there is little possibility that ordinary citizens can hope to have their human rights vindicated."
"The European Convention on Human Rights, echoed in the new European Constitution, enshrines the right to life, freedom from torture, no punishment without law, freedom of expression, the right to an effective legal remedy and the right to liberty, security and a fair trial."
"They are all denied by the IRA, by word and by deed, on a regular basis."
"Indeed, Sinn Féin, by its continued integral link with the IRA, is just as guilty, in spite of its claims."
"By seeking to spread the blame to criminals generally for the monstrous murder of Robert McCartney, the GUE/NGL resolution and the amendment by the Verts/ALE Group naively allows Sinn Féin and the IRA to wash their hands of the known complicity of the members of the IRA before, during and after the murder and should not, therefore, be supported by this House."
"I would urge the House to support the joint resolution."
"Mr President, I too welcome the McCartney family here this afternoon and offer them my support in their efforts to get justice in the appalling murder of Robert."
"In my view the death of Robert McCartney was not in any way politically motivated."
"The people who murdered him should be obliged to face judgment in the courts and to serve their sentences in prison."
"The fact that most, if not all, of the people involved in this murder are either members or supporters of the IRA or Sinn Féin in no way excuses their actions."
"Their failure to give themselves up for justice endangers the reputation of Sinn Féin and of its leadership."
"Even more importantly, the failure of Sinn Féin’s leadership to ensure that justice is done in this case undermines the cause of Irish Republicanism."
"Nobody should ever be allowed to use the cloak of Irish Republicanism to hide the murder of an innocent person when the motives have no political justification whatsoever."
"Like the great majority of the people on the island of Ireland, I have always aspired to a united Ireland."
"I have always thought of myself as an Irish Republican, as indeed do the McCartney family."
"I am therefore sickened that anybody should expect that their republicanism can be used as an excuse for violent and despicable acts of murder, particularly in the case of Robert McCartney."
"This is a view which I believe is shared by the vast majority of the Irish people."
"The cause of Irish Republicanism must be completely separated from common criminality now and in the future."
"The actions and statements of the Sinn Féin leadership over the last few months have failed to make any significant progress in getting justice for the McCartney family."
"It is still not too late for the Sinn Féin leadership to rectify this failure, provided it has the commitment to do so."
"As the leaders of the largest republican party in the six counties, and in particular after last week’s election, they have a duty to separate the cause of Irish Republicanism from the acts of common criminals."
"They also have an obligation to the McCartney family, who have a right to expect justice for the murder of Robert."
"This appalling saga has already gone on for far too long."
"I commend this motion to the House."
". Mr President, I would like to inform you that I shall report back to President Barroso about this discussion – President Barroso had the pleasure of meeting members of the McCartney family about a month ago – and I shall also inform Vice-President Frattini about the request for the possibility of funding to cover the judicial procedures expenses."
"The Commission fully supports the peace and reconciliation process in the region, not least through the Peace Programme, which quite a few Members mentioned, which is worth around EUR 760 million for the period 2000-2006."
"This includes funding for programmes in the McCartney sisters’ neighbourhood, such as an after-school club, a youth victim support programme and a community economic regeneration programme."
"Once again, I would like to express my deep admiration for these brave people: the McCartney family."
"I have received two motions for resolutions(1), tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0102/2005) from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality and repealing Directive 76/160/EEC (Rapporteur: Jules Maaten) (12884/1/2004 – C6-0006/2005 – 2002/0254(COD))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, what should and should not fall within the EU’s remit and, where rules are concerned, why not take the foot off the accelerator once in a while?"
"These are among the questions raised by this directive, not only in the form originally proposed by the Commission but also, of course, in the Council’s common position, which is before us now."
"The Bathing Water Directive dates back to 1976 and since then, a great deal has changed, not only in terms of how we think about the environment, but also about what exactly must be regulated at what level and how."
"You can, of course – as indeed I did – question how useful it is to determine at European level the standards with which bathing water and coastal and inland waters in the European Union must comply, whether we should lay this down at European level and whether European action in this area represents any added value."
"This House decided, at first reading, that it did, but – and actually more importantly – so did the Member States."
"Even the Member States that one would be inclined to regard as perfectly capable of determining this for themselves considered a new bathing water directive to be necessary."
"Who are we then to claim the opposite?"
"Why do governments opt in favour of the new bathing water directive?"
"The main reason why they do so is that the old directive is unworkable and, in environmental terms, pre-historic."
"The old directive was based on monitoring and measuring rather than the pro-active and sensible management of bathing water."
"With its proposal, the Commission decided to change this, and I think it was right to do so."
"The new directive must be implementable, flexible and geared towards the management of bathing water and towards deregulation, and must certainly cut down on red tape."
"It should, for example, be possible to be more flexible when measurements are taken: if bathing water in a certain location has been clean for years, it should be possible to reduce its measuring frequency."
"That is what the Commission proposed and what this House and subsequently the Council adopted, which is definitely progress."
"The directive is also popular among the public at large, something that is not unimportant during this time of referendums."
"It is one of the most well-known directives among the European public who each year, anxiously await the new figures."
"It has also been a successful one; about ten years ago, only some 60% of bathing water was acceptable, compared to 95% these days, which is excellent."
"This House does believe, though, and this is how the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted, that the information which should be available to the public should mainly pertain to current water quality."
"I have put this to the test and picked a random location in Europe which is the base of a prominent Member of the Commission, namely Athens, to examine the bathing water quality there."
"We did some research on the Internet this afternoon, but the most recent data, regrettably, was that for water quality in 2003, which is, of course, no indication as to whether or not it is still safe to swim near Athens."
"It could well be that this information is available from the site of the Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare, but I would not be able to read it because that information is in Greek."
"That is also the reason why, according to this House, current information should be made available and symbols should be used which can be developed by the Commission and are recognisable around the European Union by all citizens."
"At present, information is trailing behind and can be traced via the Internet only with difficulty, quite apart from the fact that most tourists do not – or so I hope – take their laptops with them on holiday or, at any rate, not to the beach."
"According to the standards of the old directive, there is a one in eight health risk."
"One in eight bathers, according to current standards, runs the risk of becoming ill."
"We should not underestimate those health risks, which include stomach and abdominal disorders, skin, eye and respiratory tract complaints and outer ear infections."
"With the standards proposed by the Commission and this House’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one in twenty bathers become ill."
"This may still be too many, but is at least a step forward, while the Council’s common position is satisfied with one in nine."
"I can understand the position of the governments who want the system to be affordable."
"Parliament should, in my view, take this into consideration and that is why I regret that there was no far-reaching agreement between the Council and Parliament at second reading."
"A number of very interesting amendments have been tabled."
"As far as deleting or adjusting the category ‘sufficient’ is concerned, I think that if amendments of that kind were adopted, then that would at least stand us as Parliament in good stead at conciliation stage, enabling us, together with the Council, to arrive at a solution which is beneficial to bathers and consumers, and on the basis of which we can conclude that the quality of bathing water is really significantly improving, which is what the Commission wanted in its original proposal."
"We should, however, also find a solution that benefits the governments and that is more workable, leads to deregulation and is also affordable, because that is, of course, an important factor."
"It is also for that reason that I think that we should not include recreational waters in this directive, but should do so at some point in the future."
"I have no problems talking about it, but now is not the right time to bring this up in this manner."
"On a final note, I have noticed that the Commission was rather reluctant to add a statement to the Council position."
"In any case, it wants continued scrutiny of the values in the future."
"I find this very useful, because it goes without saying that we need to continue to make adjustments in the future."
"This will, hopefully, be done according to the usual procedure in consultation with this House."
". Mr President, first of all I should like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, for his work on this difficult dossier."
"With regard to the European Commission's report on the 2004 bathing season, I wish to inform you that it will be published by the end of the month, and not just in Greek but in other languages also."
"The Commission's initial proposal was designed to update the existing directive, which dates back to 1976."
"It proposed adopting stricter water quality standards, updating bathing water management measures, rationalising monitoring requirements and improving public information channels."
"The Commission accepted in full or in part 22 of the 37 amendments approved by Parliament at first reading(1)."
"The wording of the proposal was improved; however, its basic structure and, more importantly, the water quality standards remained in keeping with the Commission's initial proposal."
"Discussions in the Council were held during the Greek, Italian and Irish Presidencies."
"It soon became evident that a significant majority of the Member States considered that the Commission's proposals on quality standards were over-ambitious and that they would be overly expensive."
"Similarly, it was clear from discussions in the Council that there was a desire to distinguish between quality standards for coastal waters and quality standards for inland waters."
"Other changes which emerged from discussions in the Council concerned the choice of the right time for adopting the new standards and an alternative approach to combating short-term pollution and emergencies."
"The Commission considers that many of the changes made to the common position improve the Commission's initial proposal."
"However, with regard to the question of whether or not the water quality standards and the classification categories adopted are strict enough, the Commission would prefer the original proposal to stay as it is."
"Nonetheless, after long and arduous negotiations with the Council, it was concluded that the Commission proposal would never muster the necessary support."
"The Commission therefore decided to support the common position which, even if far from ideal, does nonetheless represent a significant improvement over present arrangements under the current directive."
"The current legislation, which is nearly 30 years old, urgently needs updating."
"When the common position was approved, the Commission made a statement for the record, emphasising its intention to fund an epidemiological research programme to examine in depth the possible repercussions on bathing and, more importantly, the health repercussions associated with bathing in fresh water."
"The results of this programme are expected to be ready in 2008 and will perhaps allow certain issues on which the Council and Parliament today take different stands to be resolved."
"I would like to ask Parliament to try, with the Commission's help, to find common ground with the Council on this dossier as quickly as possible."
"We urgently need a new directive with targeted management practices, more rational monitoring schemes and more effective communication with the public."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was with the 1976 Bathing Water Directive that uniform minimum standards for bathing water in the European Community were first laid down."
"While the 1976 Directive specified 19 physical, chemical and microbiological parameters for the assessment of water quality, the present Common Position from the Council reduces the test criteria to a mere two microbiological pathogens, to which it adds the visual checking and measurement of the pH value of fresh water."
"In general terms, the Commission proposal for a new bathing water directive forms part of the European Union’s comprehensive policy on water, being based on more recent scientific discoveries, and on WHO studies in particular. Whereas, in 1976, values described as ‘adequate’, still put between 7% and 9% of bathers at risk, the WHO now stipulates values permitting a maximum risk of 5% incidences of illness among bathers."
"In its Common Position, the Council has introduced a new parameter of ‘sufficient’, which does not, however constitute an improvement over the 1976 standard."
"This is where opinions differ."
"You said, Commissioner, that the main argument is that the costs would be too high, yet many of the alleged additional costs arise from compliance with the standards of the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive."
"The minimal costs that actually are incurred by reason of compliance with higher quality standards are now, though, covered by the reduction in social costs, quite simply because, at the end of the day, fewer people become ill."
"I, personally, would argue in favour of the introduction, with immediate effect, of the higher quality standards proposed by the WHO and the Commission."
"Although preventive healthcare is not something that can be put off to another day, Mr Seeber has joined with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mrs Ayuso González in tabling a compromise amendment on behalf of the group."
"It provides for a transitional period of eight years, which will be sufficient to achieve the quality standards."
"There are those countries that believe that the new quality standards impose particularly heavy burdens on them, and the amendment is intended to allow them more time to prepare themselves for their greater rigour and to deal with any problems they may have."
"I ask the House to support this compromise amendment."
". Mr President, there is a funny Hungarian saying about ‘throwing the baby out with the bath water’."
"I am sorry to tell you that is my opinion of the recommendation."
"The Council common position is a realistic approach to the issue, understanding the problems of the different Member States and their regions."
"The Maaten report seeks to destroy this compromise, for instance deleting the ‘sufficient’ category."
"Ordinary people understand that although some water may not be perfect for bathing, it is not dangerous either: it is just sufficient."
"This is what we call common sense."
"The self-cleaning capacity of a lake and that of a sea are clearly different."
"That is why the Council has wisely set up different quality standards for coastal and inland waters; the rapporteur opposes this."
"The Maaten report would tell Member States in which language they should provide information on water quality."
"That is not a good idea."
"If some people decide to vote against the European Constitution, it will be because of the kind of over-regulation proposed in this report and other things like that."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur deserves a great deal of thanks, particularly for raising the question as to whether a European directive of this kind is needed at all."
"As Montesquieu said a few centuries ago, ‘If it is not necessary to make a law, then it is necessary to refrain from making a law’."
"I regard the Bathing Water Directive as a good example of the sort of directive that Europe can well do without."
"Europe’s constant urge to harmonise results in an excess of regulation, which means that the European Union becomes more and more distant from the public."
"The other side of that coin is that more and more members of the public become disenchanted with a European Union the most visible aspect of which is the way it decks itself in an array of bureaucratic rules and regulations."
"Let me come to the point with which we are concerned in this instance."
"Every region possessing stretches of water for bathing or leisure activities has an intrinsic interest in maintaining them to a high standard; if it does not, the penalty it pays is that visitors and tourists stay away."
"The creation of a legal framework in this area should remain a matter for the Member States, for I certainly cannot see it having any effect on the internal market."
"Again, I do not think I need to discuss how badly many environmental regulations are transposed in the EU, as there are enough infringement proceedings in progress – a plethora of them, in fact – to demonstrate that."
"If Europe wants to become more transparent to its citizens, then, where the protection of the environment and of health is concerned, we have to concentrate on what must – and can – be done at European level."
"What this means is that, if we have doubts as to whether or not a function should be performed at the European level, we should leave the responsibility for it with the Member States."
"I do not regard the Bathing Water Directive as a vitally necessary component of European integration."
". Mr President, Commissioner, in answer to my colleague, if there indeed exists a directive that is popular or well-known by all citizens, it is the bathing-water directive."
"Personally speaking, I would go even further than this directive: we believe, in actual fact, that if the draft directive on the quality of bathing water remains as it is, it will exclude recreational activities, which will discriminate between bathers and other users of coastal waters and continental waters, and we cannot accept that."
"The version proposed by the Commission is decidedly unsatisfactory in our eyes and we are, today, within our rights to ask the Commission and the Council why they persist in refusing to consider other recreational activities as coming under this bathing-water directive."
"What will be the value of this directive, therefore, if it does not offer the same guarantees of safety and quality of water for new types of nautical activity such as surfing, windsurfing and kayaking, which have become – as we all know – common currency in many bathing waters throughout the European Union?"
"These activities and recreational and competitive sports carry as much of a risk of swallowing water as simple bathing, and we are all aware of that fact."
"If we do not listen to the expectations of a younger, older and increasingly numerous public, and if we remain deaf to the requests of new users of coastal and continental waters, we will truly fail in our work as the legislators and representatives of our fellow citizens."
"Whilst in France, the debate on the competence and role of the Union is particularly animated, we have here, with this draft directive, the opportunity to demonstrate that the Union is in touch with a society on the move, and that it can listen and respond to its citizens’ desires."
"The organisations that campaign, for instance, to practice sports in good-quality water have rallied themselves by gathering in excess of 10 000 signatures, precisely to persuade us to integrate recreational sports."
"In answer to the Commissioner, I believe that everyone is in agreement that we should invest in the quality of water when this costs nothing."
"It must be recognised, however, that investing in good-quality water means investing in our future."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, as you will imagine, as a Cypriot I am particularly sensitive on the subject of protecting bathing waters, given that I come from an island."
"The revenue of my country, with its outstanding beaches, depends to a large extent on tourism, and European tourism in particular, which is demanding when it comes to clean waters, as are Cypriots."
"A contaminated beach in Cyprus is a serious subject of conversation and concern, and citizens demand that their government maintain and improve the state of the seas on the basis of very strict criteria."
"The reason why I agree that the new directive should be both strict and feasible is not only so that tourism in Cyprus can be safeguarded."
"All European citizens have the right to enjoy the waters of Europe, both coastal and inland, to exercise various types of activities without danger of microbiological contamination and, most importantly, they have the right to information as quickly as possible on the state of the waters in which they and their children will be bathing."
"I see no reason to delay the application of the directive."
"I believe that the 2011 deadline gives local authorities enough time to make arrangements for the sort of tests they will need to carry out and to develop an appropriate infrastructure."
"I absolutely agree with the rapporteur that public information is one of the most important elements of the directive."
"If the objective is to improve and maintain the quality of European bathing waters and protect citizens, I find it hard to understand why the Council does not wish to develop a public information system."
"I therefore call on you to support the relevant amendments."
"The first time this directive came into my hands, I wondered why the Commission should content itself with merely good quality waters on the basis of the parameters which it sets."
"Now the Council wishes to add a parameter of sufficient quality."
"It appears unacceptable to me that we should end up with even lower microbiological specifications than those set by the Commission."
"I therefore call on you to vote for the relevant amendments, which delete the new parameter, and for the amendments which make no distinction between inland and coastal waters."
"Given that no scientific study supporting this view has been presented to Parliament and until such time as substantiated data are presented, I propose that we vote against the distinction."
"Finally, I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament should stand by its views, especially after the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and I call on you to demonstrate with your vote that European citizens deserve the best possible bathing water."
"Mr President, since we discussed subsidiarity at first reading, I will not elaborate on it now."
"I had hoped that the revision of the Bathing Water Directive would have brought us closer to cleaner bathing water, as indeed, the Commission’s original proposal gave us ample opportunity of bringing this about."
"That is why this House decided to make relatively few changes at first reading."
"The Council cannot, though, be said to have taken a positive line when drawing up the common position, which cannot, I think be regarded as entirely ‘common’."
"There is little evidence of Parliament’s position at first reading."
"In particular, I cannot commend the Council for the way it has lowered its sights."
"All kinds of cosmetic changes have been made in order to jazz up the proposal, including the introduction of a new category of ‘sufficient’ bathing water, but that cannot take away the impression that there was little enthusiasm in the Council for tightening up standards."
"In addition, the distinction drawn by the Council between salt and fresh water is dictated by the wish to reach a compromise within the Council."
"However, the arguments raised have not convinced me of the scientific basis which is reported to exist."
"I will therefore support the amendments that intend to reverse this."
"Similarly, I can endorse the deletion of the category ‘sufficient’."
"I could, perhaps, accept as a compromise Amendment 36, tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I also welcome the re-inclusion of the table with parameters – Amendment 29 – which is worth supporting."
"While we are on the subject, I would like to ask the Council how it feels about the way in which the old 1976 Bathing Water Directive has been implemented."
"Looking at the situation in the EU in 2003 – which is the last available year – then we see that some 95% of the bathing waters meet the compulsory standards and approximately 80% meet the guiding values."
"So without the need for any additional work, 80% of the bathing water already meets the new standards proposed by the Commission."
"So why is the Council so opposed to better protection for bathers?"
"We all know that the present directive no longer meets present-day requirements, but I do think that the new directive should raise the bar a little higher."
"That is, in the interest of the bathers, the only right course."
"Finally, I should like to wish the rapporteur much strength."
"He has to my mind done an excellent job so far."
"Let us hope that the Council realises this and that conciliation can be avoided."
"Mr President, this is a very useful and important revision of the 1976 Directive."
"We should remember that it does mean real improvements in water quality within the ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ categories now proposed."
"It will enable the bathing water directive to be better focused, with clearer and more demanding rules, and I underline that it is ambitious."
"The implementation of the 1976 Directive has taken 30 years at least and cost a lot of money."
"I represent the South-West of England, where we have spent more than GBP 1 billion – I am sorry I am not speaking in euros – in clearing up the bathing beaches around the coast of that region of England alone."
"That has meant a 15% year-on-year increase in water rates and I do not think people will be prepared to pay a lot more for a much more demanding directive."
"There are obviously two problems."
"Unlike Mr Blokland, I am in favour of keeping the category of ‘sufficient’."
"I know that some want to delete it, but it seems to me that given that the new ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ standards are much tougher, and that even with investment some beaches may fail, especially after rain, we need the ‘sufficient’ category as a sort of probationary category."
"I would like to hear what the Commissioner thinks of Amendment 36."
"Does he think it is an efficient way of dealing with this issue and can he forecast the Council’s likely attitude to it?"
"Finally, on the question of recreational waters: I think that all the recreational water amendments are rather silly, because the definition is too wide to be meaningful."
"If you set out from Cornwall and try to get to Florida in a canoe, you are turning the entire Atlantic into recreational water and I do not think that is worth it."
"I have seen no estimates of cost from any of the Greens who tabled these amendments: I do not think any exist."
"There is also the question of practicality."
"I highlight the fact that the British Canoe Union is begging us not to support the extension of this directive to recreational waters."
"I note that the British organisation Surfers Against Sewage says: ‘The impact of the directive will be felt particularly at the Canoe Union’s national watersports centre, where poor water quality is routinely thought to put young people at risk’."
"The British Canoe Union says: ‘Significantly, the health risk to canoeists in the water in the UK is very low and on this basis we query the justification to include recreational waters and activities in the directive’."
"I wish this directive well."
"I remember the 1976 one when it first came forward."
"This is a great improvement and we should remember that."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Maaten on his work."
"I appeal to all Members, and to the Commission, to maintain the core of the proposal as it was tabled, that core being a high level of protection by means of high standards for good and even excellent bathing water."
"The Commission has based its work on research by the World Health Organisation, but the Council, in its common position, is showing that it has a very cynical side."
"The standards are high and bathing water locations facing the prospect of being closed down, but, because standards are being fiddled, they do not need to be."
"We should bear in mind that this is about health standards, and that we cannot afford to fiddle those. The European bathers simply want to know whether the water is safe for themselves and, above all, for their children."
"Bathers are entitled to clarity, and what are they to make of a lake that contains bathing water of ‘sufficient’ quality?"
"Is it safe or not?"
"That is why we will be voting against lowering the standards."
"In any case, the Dutch Labour Party puts the bather first; we cannot see the point of extending the directive’s scope to include other forms of recreation."
"The WHO standards are based on bathers and not on canoeists or sailing crew who accidentally go overboard."
"We are in favour of practical and implementable legislation which is not unnecessarily complex."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank our rapporteur and fellow member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for the quality of his report."
"We are well used to it. It is both an ambitious and a balanced text that tackles the major issues: being practicable and also giving precise and up-to-date information to bathers."
"For my part, I should like to make two observations on reading the European legislation on bathing waters that, today, spans nearly 30 years."
"Firstly, we must above all congratulate ourselves on the very encouraging results already obtained."
"I would point out that, according to the last report made public by the Commission in 2003, nearly 96% of coastal sites and over 91% of freshwater sites were in compliance with the quality standards laid down by the directive."
"Secondly, it is nevertheless advisable to place a caveat on this observation and this success and to criticise the lack of scope given to the Member States in applying this European law."
"If you will excuse me, I shall give a concrete example that affects me: it appears to me to be particularly zealous that, for certain rivers in Wallonia, the Commission, with the support of European judges, has considered that a river of 10 centimetres deep, where two bathers occasionally go to take a dip, warrants the classification of bathing water and therefore requires drainage investment amounting to EUR 700 000 per zone."
"It is no coincidence that this legislation in force has been the subject of no less than 15 judgments of the Court of Justice."
"If we want this new directive to bring about the improvements desired by one and all, and in particular, if we want it to be applied in practice, we must get rid of this slightly restricted legalism at all costs."
"We want a practicable law – we have said it, the rapporteur has said it – a directive that also provides us with the means to inform and to fight effectively against all forms of pollution, the majority of which is, moreover, less and less accidental, since in the case of bathing waters as well, we must address the causes of environmental pollution and their impact on the health of citizens from Europe and elsewhere."
"Mr President, this directive is particularly popular; our fellow citizens are very attached to it and, since 1976, new public health requirements have obviously appeared as a result of developments in scientific knowledge."
"We therefore have at our disposal standardised information on harmonised measures."
"Each citizen benefits from the same information, be they in Belgium, Spain, Greece or Slovenia."
"I therefore have five remarks to make on this directive."
"Firstly, it is important to implement appropriate measures in order to provide the public with good information."
"Secondly, with numerous having made considerable efforts to improve the quality of their waters, our legislation must certainly not discourage local initiatives."
"This directive must therefore be applicable and flexible, as has already been pointed out."
"Unexpected pollution can occur and, in such an event, temporary banning orders must be implemented, which do not, however, irrevocably lead to the downgrading of the"
"With regard to classifications, it is indeed necessary to be demanding and not to be mistaken on the quality of bathing waters;"
"I deplore, however, the disappearance of the intermediate category, classified as sufficient."
"A measure of this type can have grave consequences for the development of certain of our tourist resorts."
"It is not a good thing to worry citizens for nothing."
"The right balance must be found between the quality of bathing waters and support for tourism, which is an essential sector of our economy."
"I also consider it significant that recreational activities are excluded from this directive, the absence of which will lead to the disappearance of surfers, and kayak, windsurfing and waterskiing enthusiasts, etc. from our holiday resorts."
"This does not strike me, in actual fact, as being very realistic."
"Finally, it is indeed necessary to distinguish between coastal waters and inland waters, which are by nature different; we therefore look forward to the European epidemiological study conducted to evaluate these differences."
"It is above all our duty to do all we can to avoid marine pollution as a result of accidents or the emptying of petrol tankers, which all too often inflict our coastal resorts."
"Mr President, the revision of the bathing water directive is very important, as has already been mentioned here."
"What has emerged very strongly in this connection is the question of what falls within the competence of the European Union, and what falls within national jurisdiction."
"We need to focus particular attention on the ways in which different areas have adapted themselves to water systems, as this will go far in determining how the different points in this bathing water directive will be viewed."
"For example, from the point of view of recreational activity, if we are talking about a seaside area where hundreds of people go boating, for example, that is quite a different matter from a 50 kilometre-long river in Lapland where canoes are used."
"These do not have very much to do with one another."
"Matters such as these should be taken into account, but at the same time we must ensure that all Europeans are afforded the best possible protection with regard to bathing waters."
"Mr President, we have in our hands a strategic directive, because it reflects the basic problem with the EU environmental policy: that is, the enormous differences in circumstances between the Member States."
"We must therefore react to it in an appropriate manner."
"I myself come from a country where there are 187 888 lakes."
"Obviously, we would be frustrated if the measures applied were the same as in Luxembourg, for example."
"Consequently, it is important, both as far as common sense is concerned and from the point of view of the environment, that we focus on the objectives, but leave the means for achieving them to the Member States."
"Fortunately, the proposal also offers the Member States more latitude in determining for themselves which beaches are to be ‘EU beaches’."
"In this respect, the definition of bathing waters in the common position is fine."
"In my country, that will mean reducing the administrative burden on the authorities without quality control suffering as a result."
"We need this bathing water directive: the current directive is obsolete, and the reformed version will reflect the state of the water, in terms of hygiene, more effectively than the present one does."
"There is, however, much in the amendments made by Parliament that I cannot agree with."
"Tightening the deadline from 2015 to 2011 will be problematic because of the timetables for the implementation of the water framework directive."
"What is most irksome about the amendments made by Parliament, however, is the plan to delete the satisfactory/sufficient classification for bathing water."
"We should remember that that was an unconditional requirement for achieving the common position of the Council."
"The same problem applies to the standardisation of values for coastal waters and fresh waters."
"There are scientific criteria for the different values, and they do not increase the risk to bathers."
"The compromise proposal drafted in Parliament is more of a step in the right direction."
"If the ‘sufficient’ category is not adopted, there is a danger that the entire project will fail in the Council."
"This would be very regrettable as far as the environment is concerned."
"Some Member States, of course, would certainly prefer to let the project fail rather than agree to more stringent values."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too believe that the directive we are about to put to the vote is of great importance for Italy and the Member States, as it will enable us to overcome some of the inflexible elements of the directive currently in force, which result in a large number of prosecutions for infringements."
"I have two brief considerations to make; the first relates to the quality of bathing water."
"The Commission proposal defines three standards for grading these waters."
"Each category is based on precise microbiological parameters obtained from research carried out by the World Health Organisation, which correspond to a high level of protection of human health."
"Adopting the ‘sufficient’ category would extend the legal validity of the 1976 bathing-water directive without meeting the minimum requirements of the values set by the World Health Organisation."
"I therefore hope that this House votes in favour of keeping the three original categories, and I propose that they are implemented by the initial date set of 2011."
"Mr President, our committee often receives mediocre proposals from the Council."
"Unfortunately, I sometimes have the feeling that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety then sees its task as that of turning mediocre proposals into bad ones."
"We now have another example like that before us in the shape of the Bathing Water Directive."
"Actually, the name of this directive says it all."
"What it means is that the EU is to regulate water quality on our bathing beaches."
"I have to say that, in my view, that is extremely stupid."
"One wonders if there is any issue so small that the Member States themselves are to be allowed control over it."
"In the Council’s defence, it has to be said, however, that this is no new form of stupidity, for the current directive is far worse than the compromise arrived at by the Council."
"According to the current directive, a small country such as Sweden ought regularly to measure the water quality at getting on for 5 000 bathing spots."
"The fact that Sweden does not measure the water quality at more than 800 such places is not a sign that we are some sort of European Wild West."
"It is an example of the way in which, as luck would have it, common sense has prevailed over absurd legislation."
"In the Council’s defence, I must say, however, that an attempt has now at least been made to get rid of some of the silliest aspects of the legislation."
"However, the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on which we are to vote is, as I say, unfortunately an example of the committee wanting to turn mediocre legislation into bad legislation."
"One of many examples of this is the fact that the committee now requires that information concerning the quality of bathing water in, for instance, Härjarö outside Enköping, where I spent many sunny summer days, also be distributed in French."
"Unfortunately, there is now a desire further to increase the burden in many quarters."
"For example, a number of people want the requirements also to extend to the quality of water used in recreational activities and want the quality of such water regularly to be monitored."
"This includes water wherever people go windsurfing or canoeing or such like, with the result that, before you know it, water throughout the Swedish archipelago will, in theory, need regularly to be monitored."
"If the European Parliament is now to compel all the Swedish local authorities to measure water quality at every location bar none, I actually have a good mind to vote against the whole proposal. Unfortunately, we should then be in danger of losing the simplifications proposed by the Council."
"In reality, the problem does not reside in all the details I mentioned but in the fact that the EU is regulating issues in a sphere in which Europe is so manifestly diverse."
"The fact is that the EU should not be regulating the way in which the quality of bathing water in lakes in northern Värmland is measured."
"Too many Members of this House appear to take a pride in the new regulations that they can claim, back home in their constituencies, to have introduced."
"I feel at least as much pride in having helped put a stop to some of the nonsense, and I hope that more Members of this House, following tomorrow’s ..."
"Mr President, I actually know few rapporteurs who are as amenable to this Parliament’s shadow rapporteurs as Mr Maaten, but still, as a Dutch person, I would say to him that our working relationship was once again excellent, for our concerns are those of the Netherlands, a country which has earmarked some 600 bathing waters and required them to be of good quality and beneficial to the environment and health."
"They must also allow the public to practise recreational activities."
"Although this is all very important to us, we would, at the same time, say that a number of requirements covered by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety actually went way too far and did not really add anything, or would not have added anything, by way of extra public health protection."
"We therefore shared the rapporteur’s concerns but at the moment, I am very confident – well, slightly worried, but mainly confident – that things will work out tomorrow."
"We, along with the majority, are glad that the initially planned extension of bathing water to include recreational water has been abandoned."
"Secondly, there is the issue of bathing water being of ‘sufficient’ quality."
"There are people in this House who want bathing water to be of excellent quality straight away, but what about national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty?"
"I happen to know that in nature reserves, only on account of the faeces of birds, for example, the source of pollution is so diffuse that bathing water will never be of a good quality, that it can never remain ‘sufficient’."
"I therefore take the view that we must reject a second batch of amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow, in which the category of ‘sufficient’ has been deleted."
"Finally, I am also concerned about Amendment 42 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, who claim that once bathing water has been selected, it should not be struck off the list, even if you know that it will never meet the quality requirements again."
"That is too crazy for words and I hope that no one in this House will back this notion."
"Mr President, Scotland has found it very difficult to meet even the 1976 Bathing Water Directive."
"The main problem for us is agriculture and the run-off because of high rainfall, especially on the west coast."
"Rainfall in these parts, which face the Atlantic and the prevailing weather, can be anything from 80 to over 100 inches – i.e. 250 cm – a year."
"The land use on the west coast is predominantly livestock: sheep and cattle and wild deer."
"So, every time there is a heavy rainfall, some faecal material will be washed down from the moors and onto the beaches."
"This is not unnatural, it has happened for centuries, and the next tide will quickly clean things up."
"Even so, the Scottish Executive, the local authorities and Scottish Water have spent huge sums of money trying to minimise these occurrences, keeping livestock out of the water courses and installing simple treatment systems that are designed to stem the natural flow."
"However, it is impossible to stop it completely."
"Scotland has miles and miles of splendid beaches."
"Scotland has much of Europe’s finest and wildest landscapes."
"Scotland has several of the world’s best-known breeds of cattle and sheep."
"Scotland sometimes even has beautiful weather, when tourists and local people flock to our beaches."
"It would be perverse and severely damaging if Parliament, led by the Green brigade who, sadly, know so little of the real world were to remove the ‘sufficient’ classification in this new directive and condemn Scotland’s beaches to the loss of their coveted and deserved status among the best and most beautiful in Europe."
"Mr President, in my home country, Hungary, there is a saying we use to describe the situation when someone overshoots the mark in an act of good intention, and in the end does more harm than good: he throws the baby out with the bathwater."
"Well, this is exactly what the EP will do, if it accepts Jules Maaten’s report in its present form."
"Lake Balaton is one of the largest freshwater lakes in Hungary and Europe, and it is the most valuable resource for Hungarian tourism."
"Millions of people use it for swimming or recreational activities every year, and accepting the recommendation would put an end to this, just as it would eliminate the workplaces of hundreds of thousands of people who work and make a living of tourism there."
"I certainly agree that our goal is to ensure excellent bathing water quality in Europe."
"The health of those who visit the waters for sporting or recreational purposes as well as other environmental conditions make this necessary."
"This is why we cannot accept that this report conflates qualitative provisions for coastal and inland waters."
"Nor can I agree with Parliament’s report that suggests, without professional justification, a stricter threshold than the Council’s proposal."
"At the same time, I am also anxious about the recommended management measures in the event that their water quality becomes poorer."
"If parameters exceed the limits, indicating that the water is detrimental to health, bathing should simply be prohibited."
"This has been the practice so far and there is no reason to alter it."
"It is simply unreasonable that complete information should only be provided in English and French in all the twenty-five Member States."
"Bathers should rather be informed in the languages most commonly spoken in the given area."
"Lake Balaton and Lake Fertő in Hungary are excellent examples for this, as they are mostly frequented by German, Austrian and Dutch tourists."
"In the past days and hours, there have been a few proposals to amend the present Parliamentary report that provide positive contribution to the new legislation, and therefore, I do not recommend accepting the report unless these amendments are adopted."
"Thus, we can avoid passing legislation that ignores environmental conditions and may make it impossible for the tourist industry to flourish in many regions and also deprive millions of people from the joy of safe bathing and the pursuit of recreational activities."
"We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater."
". Mr President, the Commission can accept a range of amendments concerning the provision of information to the general public, both at bathing sites and over the Internet."
"The Commission is also very happy to accept the idea of developing common symbols and signs to be displayed at bathing sites."
"However, it is necessary to be clear as to what exactly the signs and symbols are supposed to indicate."
"Several amendments seek to reintroduce provisions concerning emergency plans."
"The Commission considers that, in this respect, the common position is an improvement on its original proposal."
"As the text already deals with pollution resulting from unusual or exceptional events, it is not appropriate to introduce detailed provisions on emergency planning in relation to bathing."
"As to the issue of classification, the Commission wishes to maintain the ‘sufficient’ category with the aim of reaching an agreement that would allow the European Union to adopt a better framework for bathing waters than the present one."
"The Commission cannot accept the deletion of this category."
"However, the Commission welcomes the spirit of compromise behind Amendments 36 and 55."
"Amendment 36 provides that this classification category would exist only for eight years after the entry into force of this directive."
"As this would only take us to 2013, which is before the date on which the common position proposes that the quality standards would come into effect, the Commission does not regard this amendment as realistic."
"With regard to Amendment 55, the Commission considers that increasing the severity of the quality standards associated with the ‘sufficient’ classification category would represent a potentially fruitful option in which to pursue a compromise."
"Therefore, while the quality standards for the sufficient category are far too stringent, the Commission could accept the principle of the amendment."
"With regard to the distinction between coastal waters and fresh waters, the Commission cannot accept the amendments that remove this distinction, nor those amendments directed at bringing forward the dates when the new quality standards become effective."
"Finally, the Commission notes the attention Parliament attaches to the issue of dealing with other recreational uses of waters such as surfing and sailing."
"The Commission does not believe that it is feasible to extend the scope of the directive to include these issues today."
"However, the direction suggested by Amendment 35, whereby the Commission commits to conducting a study on this issue and reporting by 2018, is acceptable."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept ten amendments in their entirety, and three amendments in part or in principle."
"However, 21 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission."
"I shall give a complete list of the Commission’s position on the amendments to Parliament’s secretariat(2)."
"The European Union ensures minimum standards."
"Member States can go further and faster, and competition between tourist locations will push things in this direction."
"My final remark: the Member States are responsible for designating bathing sites."
"The Walloon case to which Mrs Ries referred involved a site identified by Belgium as a bathing site."
"That is why we and the Court insisted on the site respecting the 1976 Directive."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in their entirety: 2, 9, 10, 13, 17, 19, 21, 25, 26, 33 and 35."
"The following amendments are acceptable in part or in principle: 15, 16, 22 and 55."
"The following amendments are not acceptable: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53 and 54."
"The next item is the Oral Question (B6-0237/05) by Karl-Heinz Florenz to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission’s strategy for the Second Meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the Aarhus Convention was adopted in 2001, but it is an unfortunate fact that only 17 European countries have as yet signed up to it."
"As a Member with an interest in these matters, I would like to know, and perhaps the Commission will tell me, why it is that relatively few countries have in fact signed up to this Convention?"
"Where the three pillars, in particular, are concerned, I am sure that there are many countries that – like my own – have the most enormous difficulties with the issue of ‘access to justice in environmental matters’."
"I would be interested to know whether the Commission and the Council are aware of the need for sufficiently precise and fair prior negotiation, and also of the extent to which national parliaments are consulted on conventions of this kind."
"The reason why I ask this is that we now have to deal, in Kazakhstan, with the issue of how we are in future to give consideration to GMOs – genetically modified organisms."
"However sympathetic one might be to worldwide conventions of this kind, it is surely unacceptable that the national parliaments should not be consulted on this development."
"My question to the Commission is specifically directed at Commissioner Dimas. How will you, Commissioner, be preparing yourself for the event in Kazakhstan?"
"In what ways are you in contact with the Council? What information have you been given about the Member States’ positions on this issue?"
". Mr President, I am delighted that, having filed its deed of ratification on 17 February 2005, the European Community will now be attending the second meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention as a party to the Convention."
"This meeting will provide an opportunity to review the application of the Convention and the Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers."
"The meeting of the Parties will examine the measures taken by the Parties to apply the Convention, while the Commission will present the measures taken by the European Community."
"The European Community has made highly satisfactory progress in this direction."
"In addition to adopting directives on access to information and on public participation, it has made significant progress, especially with the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Aarhus Convention to Community agencies."
"Similarly, proposals are being examined concerning approval by the Community of the Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers and the adoption of a regulation setting up a European pollutant release and transfer register."
"In addition, the Commission has submitted a proposal on access to justice on environmental issues."
"The Commission believes that over coming years efforts must focus on questions of application."
"It points out the importance of incorporating the provisions of the Convention into administrative practice, so that they become operational in practice."
"In addition, the exchange of experience and best practices on electronic information channels, the clearing house mechanism and access to justice must also have our support."
"Within this framework, the compliance mechanism is also considered very important."
"We therefore need to ensure it operates effectively."
"The Commission will also emphasise the importance of developing institutional capabilities as a means of improving the application of the Convention."
"Within the framework of its commitment to promoting the objectives of the Convention, the Commission has taken the necessary measures to make provision for a monetary contribution to the Convention for 2005."
"The agenda for Almaty will also include the question of the possible amendment of the Convention in relation to its application to genetically modified organisms."
"As far as this item is concerned, the Commission will follow the Council's negotiating instructions for conducting the negotiations and will make every possible effort to bring about a satisfactory outcome to the discussions."
"On this point, I believe that it is particularly important for the procedures to be applied for which provision is made for activities relating to genetically modified organisms under the Carthage Protocol, for example, and for the acquisition and exchange of experience to be promoted."
"Additional efforts can also be included here for developing institutional capabilities, especially in the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia."
"The Commission is particularly satisfied with the interest expressed by the European Parliament and, in particular, by the inclusion of three of its members, including two rapporteurs on the Aarhus proposals, as observers in the Community delegation to Almaty."
"Of course, according to the interinstitutional agreement, the Commission will report regularly to the Members of Parliament on developments in the negotiations."
"Mr President, Parliament has worked with the Aarhus Convention since 2000, when we received the Commission’s version of the first pillar of the Convention: the right of the citizen to environmental information."
"Our policy all along has been ambitious and one that advocates public participation."
"We start from the position that nothing may restrict the rights of the citizen to access information and to be heard in matters concerning the environment."
"This is essential in order for democracy to function in a world where environmental issues have an ever more central role."
"Consequently, as the meeting in Almaty approaches, we will likewise work on the assumption that the matter at hand – the subject of biosafety – will be debated in the same spirit, with a respect for the rights of the citizen."
"Accordingly, Parliament assumes that its delegation will be properly heard at the talks, as we have something to offer."
"We want the decisions taken at the second meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention to promote its implementation and development, and we want multilateral agreements on the environment, such as Kiev or Cartagena, which are important for the Aarhus Convention and the issue itself, to achieve a synergic impact between them."
"The Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers plays its part in helping to reduce pollution and promote sustainable development."
"The purpose of applying the principles of Aarhus is to persuade public authorities and citizens to take individual and collective responsibility for environmental protection and improvement, so that the welfare of present and future generations can be ensured."
"The Aarhus Convention is an important element in a functioning democracy."
"For that reason, my political group does not think it is right that these wide-ranging rights of the citizen should be abused where an appeal is concerned, with the aim of slowing down projects on purpose or providing a forum for fund-raising campaigns organised by NGOs."
"Neither can we accept that the legislative work done by political decision-makers should collapse amid the endless complaints of these organisations."
"It is simply not appropriate to keep exercising the right to complain."
"Such abuses also undermine the rights we set out to defend."
"This is why we will look carefully in the future at how the Community applies the right to appeal."
". Mr President, I welcome the fact that the European Community has ratified the Aarhus Convention."
"It is a priority for us to provide a clean and safe environment for our citizens."
"A good environmental policy goes together with proper information on environmental matters, including pollution, possible dangers and the effects of environmental accidents."
"The European Union has already taken important steps to update existing legal provisions in order to meet the requirements of the Aarhus Convention."
"Coming from a new Member State and as a former journalist, I totally agree with the importance of the Aarhus Convention."
"Former Socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe had a certain level of environmental policy, but it was strictly understood as a state policy without any kind of public participation."
"That is why people had such a negative feeling about the real state of play."
"The lack of proper information or environmental NGOs led to degree of mistrust about actual environmental performance."
"Even basic information on pollution was labelled a state secret."
"To be frank, some multinational corporations are still tempted to follow this practice today."
"In order to implement the Aarhus Convention effectively we need to look at all the details and content of each and every piece of legislation."
"For example, the PSE Group, with our rapporteur Guido Sacconi, is very active on the new legislation on REACH and on the evaluation and authorisation of chemical substances."
"As regards REACH, we urgently need strong legislation providing every possible piece of information to the public on the possible dangers and risks of every chemical substance."
"The same applies to GMO products, pollution release, the transfer register directive, etc. All this legislation must provide the public with the right of access to information that is of concern to it."
"If we ratify the Aarhus Convention, we must put it into practice in our legislation day by day."
"The forthcoming meeting to be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is very important."
"When we talk about access to information, the public must be sufficiently involved and informed."
"We should begin by looking at the discussion on the Convention, where the participation of the parliamentarians of this House is guaranteed, as they are the representatives of the European citizens."
". Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group, I have to say that we agree with those earlier speakers in regarding the Aarhus Convention as a great leap forward in environmental policy."
"The clear rules on the right of public participation provided for by the Convention create a situation in which members of the public, NGOs, and the authorities too, can make a better job of protecting the environment."
"I might add that I do not believe for one moment that we in Europe would be making insoluble problems for ourselves if we were to combine these rights with access to the justice system."
"When engaging in discussions with members of the public, I often find them more advanced than politicians give them credit for, and I do not worry much about their ability to reason in these matters."
"I do, however, worry about how Almaty, for which we are currently preparing, will handle the topic that concerns many members of the European public, who can see it giving rise to problems in the future, the topic that Mr Florenz, the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, has just addressed: will genetically modified organisms be covered by the Aarhus Convention in future or not?"
"The Moldovan government is expressly calling for them to be and would like to see that clearly laid down in an annex to the Convention."
"How is it that it is an Eastern European country, an Eastern European government, that is pushing this issue forward?"
"I think the reason for this is perfectly clear: American agribusiness – and its European counterpart too – are currently trying to find tracts of land in Eastern Europe in which to experiment – without being observed, if at all possible – with the release of genetically modified organisms."
"If we want the Aarhus Convention to be credible and to be taken seriously, then I believe that it must cover GMOs."
"This will certainly be a central issue in Almaty."
"I believe, moreover, that – as others have said – rights of participation in other areas need to be clearly regulated."
"I would also be glad if you, Commissioner Dimas, were again to elaborate on the Commission’s thinking concerning the third part of the Convention – access to justice – and on what you plan to say about this in Almaty."
". Mr President, I have noted with interest the points made in the motion for a resolution and the remarks made today."
"Above all, I would like to thank you for the overall support for the Commission’s strategy for the second meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention."
"It is important that the European Union sends a coherent message to the other Parties to the Convention and that, at the same time, we demonstrate our commitment to its principles and rules."
"With regard to the question posed by the last speaker on the proposed directive on access to justice, the Commission stresses that the ratification by the Community of the Aarhus Convention prior to the adoption of the directive on access to justice does not imply that the directive is no longer useful or opportune."
"The Aarhus Convention has broken new ground in the way the public is involved in decision-making relating to the environment."
"However, in the end its credibility will depend on the way in which it is applied."
"That is why the Commission considers that work for the years to come should concentrate on the implementation of the Convention."
"The Parties and signatories not only need to put in place or adopt administrative procedures, they also need to gain experience, exchange it with other parties and learn from practice."
"As Mr Florenz observed, they have to sign and ratify it."
"The present situation is that 24 Member States signed it in 1998 and one country is ready to sign."
"Of those 24 Member States, 19 have ratified it so far."
"Those that have not – according to our information – are all in the process of putting implementing legislation in place."
"I count on your continued support in this ambitious endeavour."
"Pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution(1) at the end of the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the debate on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities (COM(2004)0171-C5-0133/2004-2004/0066(COD)) (Rapporteur: Gyula Hegyi (A6-0101/2005)."
"Mrs Reding, on behalf of the Commission, has the floor."
". Mr President, on 16 March 2004 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council and Parliament recommendation on the protection of film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities."
"Cinematography is an art form contained on a fragile medium, which therefore requires positive, quick and effective action from the public authorities to ensure its preservation."
"Films bear comprehensive witness to our times."
"The protection of the European film heritage, including co-productions with third countries, is therefore in the interest of future generations."
"In order to ensure that the European film heritage is passed down to future generations, it has to be systematically collected, catalogued, preserved and restored."
"It should also be made accessible for educational, cultural, research or other non-commercial use; in all cases, in compliance with copyright and related rights."
"It is therefore the Commission’s intention to promote European standards on the cataloguing of films and we have therefore given a mandate to the European Committee for Standardisation to go ahead with preparatory work."
"That will facilitate the exchange of information and the interoperability of the databases that are kept by the film archives in all Member States."
"The Commission will also promote cooperation between film archives."
"One advantage of this cooperation will be the possibility of recuperating and restoring so-called ‘lost films’."
"The report and the amendments discussed today reflect the thorough work by the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on the one hand, and the presidency on the other."
"I would like to thank Mr Hegyi for his very constructive work in that respect."
"The Commission is grateful to all the key players who made it possible to reach a good compromise today."
"The Commission proposal, as amended by Parliament, recommends that Member States introduce an obligation to deposit cinematographic works that form part of a Member State’s audiovisual heritage and that have received public funding."
"Also, and in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, the text gives Member States the option as to how to implement this obligation, by law or by means of contract: we leave that up to Member States."
"A recommendation is the best-adapted instrument available for achieving the objectives of the proposed measures."
"They are: first, strengthening of the film industry by laying the foundations for the explanation of sleeping catalogues by rights holders; and secondly, the systematic deposit, collection and conservation of Member States’ visual heritages."
"The Commission is very satisfied –– and I think the citizens are, too – with the prospect of a first reading agreement."
"The Commission accepts Parliament’s amendments insofar as they correspond to the political agreement reached between Parliament and the presidency and confirmed by Coreper on 2 May 2005."
". Mr President, cinema is the beloved child of European culture."
"It was born in the golden age of European civilisation, together with other scientific and important technological inventions."
"All that happened before the Great Wars period and before the illusion of the 19th century broke into pieces."
"Cinema was born in Paris, the capital of art, revolution and glamour at the time."
"In the space of a year the first films were shown all over Europe in cafes, theatres and other public places."
"Films and filming became a rapidly developing activity for thousands of mostly young men and women."
"In the first three decades of cinema history the European silent film conquered the word thanks to its artistic merits."
"The young American film industry was also pioneered by gifted European immigrants."
"The invention of the talking movie definitively changed the world of cinema."
"Multilingualism proved a barrier to the marketing of cinematographic products and some might have felt that the linguistic richness of Europe of which we are so proud became a disadvantage from a competition perspective."
"This paradoxical situation should be tackled through subsidising cinematographic products with national and European funds – not the film industry as a business but its cultural and linguistic plurality, which is the very essence of Europe, needs that funding."
"Every European government should do its best to defend our unique cultural richness, protecting and encouraging European cinema, which speaks to every European nation in its mother tongue."
"I welcome the strong commitment of our governments to maintaining the existing formula for subsidising cinema."
"Film and filming is not only art and entertainment."
"After the Second World War many destroyed buildings were reconstructed with the help of film sequences."
"The film heritage of Europe covers every aspect of our life from the end of the 19th century to the dawn of this new century."
"The preservation of this heritage means the preservation of the memories of our culture and history, everyday life, big events, small tragedies and common joys."
"If the old films are lost, younger people are hardly likely to understand their ancestors’ lives."
"The national film archives play an important role in preserving our film heritage."
"If a film is properly archived its message will be saved for the future."
"That is the reason why I, as rapporteur, recommend the compulsory depositing of every European film made for public distribution in the archives."
"The national film institutes and archives of Europe should harmonise and standardise their archiving systems."
"In doing so we can ensure that our film heritage will really become our common and public heritage."
"The digitalisation of European films, the setting up of a common database and the cooperation of the national film academies and archives serve a common aim: to save our film heritage and to make it accessible to everyone."
"This proposal, in the form of a recommendation, aims at ensuring a more systematic deposit and preservation of European films to safeguard Europe’s audiovisual heritage."
"I believe that due to a very constructive approach by my Parliament colleagues, Mrs Descamps and Mrs Gibault, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, as also the inclusive and active role played by the Luxembourg presidency, a good compromise for first reading agreement has been achieved."
"This dossier shows the added value of codecision and serves as a good example of how Parliament and the Council can together agree on a number of important issues that can make the initial Commission proposal more comprehensive and effective."
"Let me point to those issues to which Parliament attached great priority and which were taken on board by the Council. As a result of Parliament’s approach, the deposit of films will, in all cases, be mandatory or compulsory, so that a systematic collection is secured throughout Europe."
"There is now a definite time period within which Member States have to adopt the necessary measures to ensure the preservation of the European film heritage."
"In order to ensure the quality of the deposited works, it is now a requirement that the deposited copy has to be of high quality."
"In order to make our common film heritage as comprehensive as possible it is stipulated that after a transitional period every film must be deposited and not only those that receive public funding."
"In order to know what collection each Member State has, the report proposes a network of databases, where already functioning Council of Europe institutions such as the European Observatory in Strasbourg can play an important role."
"I believe that a good compromise has been found."
"I ask you to support the report to enable the first reading agreement, which would be in the interests of our common film heritage."
"I am grateful for the kind words of Commissioner Reding, from Luxembourg."
"We both started our careers as young journalists, as film or theatre critics."
"It is good that we can cooperate on this report."
". Mr President, first I would like to congratulate and commend Mr Hegyi on his work on film heritage and on the competitiveness of related industrial activities."
"My Opinion on film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities allowed me to investigate the functioning of the European film industry, an industry that produces films accounting for 25% of the European market."
"Unfortunately, approximately 65% of the films produced are commercial productions outside the European Union, mostly in the United States."
"Obviously, the European film industry does not have a competitive advantage in this case."
"Frankly, this is not good enough."
"While I have no problem with American culture or with the American film industry, I believe it is important that we protect European culture and improve the European film industry in any way we can."
"If one looks at the success of the industry in India, Bollywood is a case in point of where it can be done and has been done."
"One means of tackling this problem is through the provision of state aid."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission cinema communication identified the importance of state aid to the film industry as a means of promoting culture."
"Also, the extension of the validity period of this specific state aid to June 2007 is evidence that it provides a high degree of stability and much-needed legal certainty to the industry."
"For the end users, this ensures the continuation of vital support schemes such as the Irish Film Board."
"I have stipulated to the Commission that higher levels of state aid should be considered in the areas of culture and difficult films."
"Any reduction in state aid to the film industry would be unwarranted and undesirable."
"State aid as a means of promoting culture is important because it means national films are shot nationally and not offshore."
"This helps to maintain nationally specialised skills and expertise required for audio-visual creations."
"I believe that all film-making should be determined a cultural activity, thereby exempting it from the notion that it is an obstacle to the single market."
"I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has indicated a willingness to consider high levels of aid in the next review of the cinema communication."
"I hope this indication will soon be turned into application."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cinematographic works in their entirety – those of the past, of the present and of the future – are, and will remain, one of the most vivid artistic expressions of our Member States."
"Europe has an identity that has been shaped by an exceptional accumulation of cultural heritage, including film, which has contributed both to shaping this identity and to safeguarding and developing cultural diversity."
"Mr Hegyi’s report therefore aims, on the one hand, to ensure the preservation and conservation of our national and European film heritage and, on the other hand, to improve the conditions required for the competitiveness of industrial activities related to this heritage."
"In order to achieve these results, it is advisable that the cinematographic works making up this heritage are systematically collected, catalogued, preserved and restored, whilst respecting copyright issues."
"Another essential point in this report concerns the nature of the deposit of cinematographic works within organisations commissioned by the Member States, which should carry a legal or contractual obligation."
"In terms of the material deposited, moreover, the copy should be of a high technical quality to enable good use to be made of the film at a later date."
"It is furthermore specified that this film heritage should include the production, but also the co-production of films between Member States or between a Member State and a third country."
"An idea has been proposed, moreover, that I find interesting, namely the implementation of a database network for European audiovisual heritage, in collaboration with the Council of Europe and, more specifically, with Eurimage and with the European Audiovisual Observatory."
"Finally, a point appears in this report that, in my view, is crucial: the aim for film to be taught at every educational level, and for younger generations to also learn a little about history, everyday life and sociology, thanks to the richness of European film heritage."
"I should also like to congratulate, in particular, the rapporteur for his excellent, and above all useful, work, that will contribute, I hope, thanks to this effort to preserve cinematographic works, to the development and spread of film culture in Europe."
". Mr President, allow me to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work he has recently carried out on such a crucial subject as the safeguarding and promotion of European film heritage."
"I should like, in particular, to point out three crucial points that appear in the report."
"Firstly, it is clear that the cataloguing, preservation and restoration of works are essential to safeguarding cultural diversity in Europe."
"Secondly, the report rightly points out the importance of undertaking a systematic collection of cinematographic works thanks to the legal obligation for a system of deposit."
"Finally, emphasis must be placed on the extent to which the development of new technologies is fundamental to ensuring the cataloguing, preservation and restoration of cinematographic works in order that they be of the highest quality."
"I should now like to point out the links between this report and the discussions taking place on European programmes in the field of education and Media 2007."
"This report demands a more active approach on the part of the Member States in the field of visual education, particularly of professional training and media literacy."
"As the author of the report on the role of education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process – a report that I will shortly be presenting to the Committee on Culture and Education – I fully support this excellent proposal."
"Our societies have become more tolerant with the development of literacy."
"We must henceforth all learn to better read images, which have become the essential vehicle for communication between mankind."
"In conclusion, I should like to point out that, whilst European cinema is already a fine heritage, it must continue to form part of our future."
"To this end, I should like to alert my fellow Members to the necessity of integrating financing terms suitable for European film production into the Media 2007 programme."
"Examples of this exist: the Institute for the financing of film and cultural industries was set up more than 20 years ago in France, precisely to help producers and independent distributors gain access to credit."
"Access to bank loans is crucial for independent producers, given the way films are financed."
"I hope that the discussions on the 2007 programme will allow us to find solutions so that the spirit of European cinema is preserved in its entirety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Hegyi for the work he has done and for the open approach he has demonstrated at our working meetings, which has led to a very complete and well-argued final wording of this recommendation within a very short space of time."
"I am also pleased that it has been possible to reach a compromise with the Council, thanks to which, I hope, this report may be adopted at first reading, thus allowing European film heritage to benefit as soon as possible from all the guarantees that this recommendation is going to provide."
"I am extremely pleased that all the amendments I had tabled have been supported and adopted both by my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education and by those from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe;"
"I would like to thank them very warmly for their confidence."
"This recommendation will undoubtedly give new impetus to European film production and help to drive the development of cinema in the new Member States."
"I have followed the drawing up of this document very closely, which is of very special interest to us, the French, since we invented the cinema."
"The Lumière brothers, in Lyon, were the first to perfect the technique of cinema and they inspired its documentary strand."
"A few decades later, Georges Méliès invented the cinema of spectacle and of the imagination."
"All of the films by the Lumière brothers have been restored by the French Film Archive and have recently been released on DVD."
"This is why I am convinced that, in order to ensure that nothing is lost, we should emphasise the requirement for the original prints of films to be deposited with a European body and for a database to be created at the European Audiovisual Observatory."
"What a joy it would be to be able, in that way, to relive the magic moments of L’Arroseur Arrosé; that is what I had in mind when I was working on this Council recommendation."
"I would also like to stress the role played by film criticism, a French speciality whose writings have encouraged works to be preserved."
"I am thinking of André Bazin, François Truffaut and Henri Langlois."
"I am therefore entirely satisfied with this report, which I would ask you to support."
"Cinema deserves a heritage policy, in the same way as buildings, pictures or books."
"The same goes for preserving that heritage, piecing together that history and making the link between the past and the future."
". Mr President, I would add my voice of congratulation to our rapporteur and, indeed, to the Commission on an ambitious report and package."
"I would stress the importance of such ambition from the European level for the European film industry."
"By way of example of how not to do it and why we need this package, look at Scotland."
"We have a high-quality film infrastructure, talented technicians and actors and stunning locations, yet we are not known for our film industry."
"With good reason: our government does not adequately support it."
"A film about Mary, Queen of Scots, is about to be made in Ireland; a new film version of Macbeth - the Scottish play - will be shot on the Isle of Man."
"Government support for film is crucial in the global market of the film industry."
"This report demonstrates why we need a European framework that is ambitious and has a soul to it that we can push forward from a European dimension."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and I shall be giving a copy of the report to the Scottish Government."
"– All possible measures should be taken to preserve the film industry in EU Member States and accord it the value it merits, given that it represents historical, cultural and human heritage."
"It should also be made accessible to all for the purposes of cultural research, training and enjoyment, a principle that should of course be applied to all other manifestations of cultural heritage."
"Policies and practical measures of this nature – involving preserving and maintaining memory within a state that is a fertile breeding ground for all art forms – can help to promote the plurality of the culture of Member States, along with the extraordinary spiritual and material wealth that that brings."
"They can also help to achieve and encourage the essential European added value that should characterise the cultural projects supported by EU institutions."
"European culture can only stand its ground in the face of third country cultures by emphasising its own value, thereby making the citizens who identify with it become ever more demanding in terms of quality, as regards both what they create and what they consume."
"Europe does not have to defend itself against culturally high quality output from elsewhere, which mirrors human dignity; Europe needs such output, too."
"The important thing is for Europe to compete with them, on a level of quality that is at least comparable."
"Defending Europe is also about protecting us from the potential invasion of dubious products."
"Nor is it about politically correct conventions that claim to protect cultural diversity, but that actually build barriers on behalf of interests that are to a greater or lesser extent corporate or parochial."
"I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation, although I have my doubts as to its legal effectiveness, given that, whilst it is being referred to as a recommendation, it is in fact a case of harmonisation, which is prohibited by the Treaty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Hegyi on his elaborate report, which stems from a Commission proposal which consists of two different texts: a communication following up the Communication on the cinema of 2001, on the protection of film heritage and State aid, and a proposal for a recommendation of the Council and of the European Parliament, solely on film heritage, since Parliament currently lacks legislative powers in the field of aid."
"Europe is the cradle of the cinema."
"Our film heritage must be protected, because it contains a significant proportion of our memory, it expresses our cultural identity and illustrates the diversity of our peoples; as the rapporteur points out, it deals with all aspects of our lives since the end of the 19th century."
"It is also an economic asset the protection of which can contribute to growth and employment, as well as the promotion of the innovation, research and technological development policies that promote general industrial competitiveness."
"That is the view that the Commission has taken, quite rightly, when basing the recommendation on Article 157 of the Treaty, on the competitiveness of related industrial activities, thereby making codecision possible."
"The domination of the European market by American films — with a share of around 75% — the difficulties faced by European films in transcending the market of their country of origin — they only reach 10% of the Community market — and the lethargy of film production, demand a thorough response."
"I am therefore very much looking forward to seeing the results of the study announced by the Commission on the economic and cultural impact of the existing State aid and I welcome the Commission's extension of the validity of the criteria for aid to film and television production until 2007, and I am pleased that this has been taken up in Mr Hegyi’s report."
"I would like to stress the importance of the public broadcasting bodies in terms of protecting our film heritage, extending its scope to television productions and satisfying public service demands."
"I believe that they must be taken into account in order to make progress on the development of audiovisual heritage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which is an obvious sign of heightened sensitivity, derived from his specific expertise in this area."
"Film heritage, through its ability to represent diverse national and local cultural realities and to spread Europe’s historical memory – not to mention its educational role – is a useful tool for strengthening Europe’s cultural dimension and common historical identity."
"It is no coincidence that, in some Member States, film production is already recognised as a cultural asset in law."
"It is therefore crucial to harmonise legislation with regard to the deposit, conservation and distribution of European films, by appealing to the exchange of best practice in the first instance."
"The use of new technologies, moreover, represents an inevitable shift towards the rationalisation of the costs and resultant competitiveness not only of film production in the strictest sense, but also of all related activities, such as collection, cataloguing and restoration."
"I agree, moreover, with the rapporteur both on the focus on disabled people – ensuring better access to deposited works – and on the need to preserve all cinematographic works, and therefore not just those benefiting from public funding, as laid down in the Commission proposal: all of these works have contributed to the history of European cinema, giving an insight into the various trends and influences of different periods."
"In conclusion, I should like to make a proposal to Mrs Reding, which takes on a symbolic meaning today, 9 May, Festival of Europe Day: the creation of a European themed film archive that preserves a careful selection of films relating to historical events and episodes concerning the development of the Community project."
"Film, therefore, acting as an instrument of mediation to promote a more responsive approach from citizens to information and knowledge about Europe and its institutions."
"At a time of increasingly close ties within the European Union, the forging of links in the cultural sphere is very important, and films play a special part within this."
"I therefore welcome the report on the film heritage, for I believe that proper and timely storage enables the preservation of the film heritage for later generations, too."
"At a time of rapid development and change it is essential for each nation to preserve its identity and national heritage, and this applies especially to small nations such as Slovenia."
"For this reason Member States need to support their film industries, national film academies and film projects, or a gap will appear in the film records of parts of the history, life and culture of the nation."
"Since modern people spend a large amount of time watching films, there is also an urgent need for education in this area, and this applies especially to young people."
"Greater familiarity will afford a more prominent place for high-quality films which may not necessarily be made to attract the broad mass of viewers, but whose mission is nevertheless diminished if the viewer is not capable of recognising quality."
"I therefore support proposed Amendment 10, in which the proposer recommends to Member States that they promote visual education and media literacy within national education systems and professional training programmes."
"Indeed the point of preserving the film heritage lies in the accessibility of these archives for the needs of education, research and cultural links."
"And since our age is also the age of sound films, film is also a good and effective medium for the more rapid learning of languages, so I believe that for the preservation of authenticity, subtitles are generally more appropriate than dubbing."
"– Mr President, we had numerous interesting discussions in the committee which I have the honour of chairing."
"I would like today in plenary to congratulate Mr Hegyi, on his excellent report on the protection of film heritage which is the result, as we have heard, of his knowledge of the cinema."
"European cinema, the cherished offspring of European culture, has produced thousands of cinematographic works over the last 100 years which are a unique memorial to its culture."
"The proper preservation, the rescuing of these works, is equivalent to the preservation of the culture of the image and of our history."
"These films make it much easier for us to understand the development and the progress of life on our continent and elsewhere."
"That is why it is important that the European Union is taking an initiative today, albeit in the form of a recommendation to the Member States, in which preserving the film heritage is raised to a priority objective while, at the same time, specific and realistic measures are proposed to make it feasible."
"This report rightly emphasises the important role which the national film archives have in preserving European films."
"The Member States must give serious consideration to the application of a system of mandatory deposit of new film productions in their film archives."
"The Member States should take suitable measures to ensure that this heritage is collected, catalogued, preserved, restored and made accessible."
"This will result not only in the preservation of old films, but also in the creation of jobs."
"I believe that the present recommendation is just the beginning."
"Finally, it is most encouraging that the views of Parliament and of the Council are identical on this subject and it is interesting that two journalists – Mrs Reding and Mr Hegyi – have the leading roles."
"The decision to approve the proposal for a recommendation at first reading brings us one step closer to its application, so that substantial measures can start to be taken as quickly as possible in order to preserve the film heritage."
"The 20th century was defined as the century of the culture of the image."
"I trust and believe that the 21st century can be the century of the knowledge of history through the image of culture."
"Mr President, I would quite simply like to express my joy, because it is rare in politics for there to be such harmony amongst the various institutions."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council are on the same wavelength, and that is a good thing, because we are talking here about nothing more or less than preserving our common heritage, building upon our roots and ensuring that not only our rich film heritage of over a century is preserved for future generations but also, and in the same way, the cinema created today and in the future, since this is our future heritage."
"This is a duty we owe to our cultures, and it is good that all our energies should be combined in taking action along these lines."
"I entirely agree with the rapporteur and with the honourable Members who said that accessibility was important."
"It is not just the heritage that is important, but also public access to that heritage."
"This is why the Commission is investing in search engines and in research in general in order to ensure that old films are better preserved."
"Access is, however, also needed to this heritage that has been made available, and, in this respect too, I am in agreement with Parliament, which wants our young generations to be taught to read images."
"Indeed, it makes no sense for young people to learn to decipher words and to understand figures but not to have access to the images that make up almost everything that surrounds them and only to experience them in a passive manner."
"My theory is as follows."
"European films require an active response."
"One cannot remain passive when watching a European film or simply allow oneself to be carried along by it."
"It needs to be read, and reading skills need to be acquired for that purpose."
"We must therefore ensure that our younger generation learns to read the language of our cinema."
"We have already had several pilot projects in schools, but that is not sufficient."
"Such projects must be launched across the board."
"I am genuinely happy to see such wonderful harmony within this Chamber on a 9 May."
"This is a good sign, a sign that Europe is moving forward and realises that we have a common history and a common future."
"With regard to this common future, I would like to add a word on state aid."
"Even though what I am saying may be entirely superfluous, I wish to say it since questions are constantly addressed to me on this issue, and I believe I must respond to them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no danger at all of the Commission interfering with the state aid aimed at promoting the cinema."
"So please do not worry each time the Commission carries out its work of analysing the situation on the ground, and do not imagine that this work is aimed at removing whatever has been provided until now."
"We have so far analysed many national systems of aid for the cinema, if not all of them."
"We have always offered our support and we will continue to do so."
"Everybody must play their role."
"I am convinced, however - and I make this commitment to you - that European cinema needs assistance and that we shall continue to offer it help."
"Together with this House, I offer my thanks to Mrs Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The next – and last – item is the Commission statement on the state of negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur."
"Mrs Reding, on behalf of the Commission, has the floor."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I would like to make a statement on the negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur."
"Despite the progress made over recent years, these negotiations have been in deadlock since October 2004."
"At that point, it was considered that the offers of the two parties did not allow our high ambitions for that agreement to be achieved."
"At the ministerial meeting in Lisbon in October, the Ministers decided to take the time to reflect on how to relaunch the process."
"In January 2005, Presidents Barroso and Lulla da Silva met in Davos."
"The two Presidents stressed the strategic importance they attach to an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur."
"We should remember that the negotiations began with an ambitious, indeed strategic, objective: to construct a strong alliance between the two blocks, which have much in common, including parallel visions of the international order."
"The two Presidents agreed that, if we wished to make progress with the negotiations on the commercial aspects, they should be based on the best offers exchanged at that point by the two partners."
"The idea of restarting the negotiations on the basis of the best offers was largely taken up and supported by all the European Union and Mercosur negotiators at the EU-Mercosur Business Forum in February."
"A technical meeting took place on 21 and 22 March to prepare for the ministerial meeting that was to restart the negotiations."
"At that meeting, Mercosur refused to confirm the best offers exchanged."
"It expressed the view that they would be too favourable to the European Union and that confirming them would increase the supposed imbalance."
"Our objective is to convince Mercosur to allow the negotiations to progress quickly."
"This is essential, in fact, since certain Mercosur partners could be tempted to focus exclusively on the negotiations within the WTO and then to finalise a bi-regional agreement."
"At this stage, I would like to point out that we entirely disagree with Mercosur’s view that the offers on the table are too favourable to the European Union."
"Firstly, with regard to access to the market, the Union’s offer is the most generous ever made in terms of the products it covers and the timetable for dismantling tariffs."
"In particular, the Union’s offer on agricultural products is the most substantial that has ever been made in any bilateral agreement."
"Secondly, in relation to rules, Mercosur has refused to make an offer on public contracts or to include a chapter on intellectual property rights."
"It has refused to accept the principle of appropriate protection of the European Union’s geographical indications."
"As for Mercosur’s offer on services, it does not even consolidate the current level of liberalisation."
"Having said that, we believe that only a ministerial meeting would allow the dialogue to be relaunched."
"The preparations for this meeting are underway."
"To this end, we are maintaining close contacts with our Mercosur partners."
"Our efforts are essentially focused on the stage reached by the technical preparations and Mercosur’s level of commitment to substantial discussions, since our ambition at this stage is to prevent a downwards spiral and to avoid jeopardising the progress already made."
"Our partners, in particular Mr Amorin, the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, have repeated publicly on several occasions that Mercosur wished to keep all the options open, including therefore the bi-regional negotiations with the European Union and the Free Trade Area of the Americas Agreement, while making the negotiations within the WTO their main priority."
"Our objective, therefore, is to seek to maintain a communication channel until our partners have a sufficiently clear picture of the potential results of the negotiations within the WTO."
"The Commission remains committed to putting these negotiations back on track, with the aim of reaching an ambitious and balanced agreement."
"To this end, we hope that a ministerial meeting will take place before the end of July."
". It gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of my Group, and I pay especial tribute to the work of my colleague, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who is unable to be present tonight, and who is a renowned expert on EU-Latin America trade and political relations."
"At times, it is very difficult for someone such as myself, interested in global trade patterns, to monitor the number of different bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations going on all the time outside the framework of the Doha Round of the WTO – which, I hope, will ultimately make such biregional deals redundant in the future."
"Currently, in Latin America the EU has successful free-trade agreements with Chile, in the shape of an association agreement – which also enables additional close political cooperation and key human rights and democracy commitments by both parties – but also a similar agreement with Mexico."
"However, being itself from inception a regional customs union, it makes sense for the EU, wherever possible, to negotiate with other multilateral customs unions elsewhere in the world and to draw up regional free-trade agreements in preference to a whole series of bilateral agreements."
"One such major bloc is Mercosur, consisting of four Latin American countries – Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay – with Chile and Bolivia having associative status."
"Mercosur’s fortunes have waxed and waned in recent years over the imbalances in trade between Argentina and Brazil in particular – a matter constantly under criticism from Argentina, which last September proposed to Brazil a safeguard clause to which Brazil refuses to agree."
"Mercosur has traditionally been designed to deal in trade between the large industrial conglomerates, not the SMEs in the region, which feel disadvantaged by this deal."
"Argentina also objects to the confusion over the Brazilian initiative last December to create a South American community of nations, which was important recently in supporting Brazil’s role in stabilising Ecuador, as Argentina believes that Mercosur needs to be reinforced before that happens."
"There is also the tricky issue of the desire of Portuguese-speaking Brazil to have a seat on the UN Security Council to enhance its regional superpower political ambitions."
"Argentina instead suggests the seat could rotate to give room for all the South American countries, mainly Spanish-speaking, to express their opinions."
"Last year, Mercosur had problems negotiating a deal with the EU – particularly because, Mercosur alleged, Pascal Lamy, the then Commissioner, came from France, which is amongst the most protectionist of countries in terms of agriculture – chiefly regarding Mercosur’s desire to gain access for its agricultural products, which our EU farming sector finds threatening."
"Brazil is a huge soya bean producer and Argentina a producer of wheat and beef, as well as of fresh fruits, etc. In turn, Mercosur is unhappy about giving tariff-free access to EU industrial goods, as Brazil, in particular, is highly developed in the heavy industry sector."
"Curiously, Mercosur is simultaneously negotiating with countries like South Korea and with other multilateral blocs, like the proposed agreement this week with the Gulf Cooperation Council, as the leaders of Latin America are meeting tomorrow in Brasilia with the Heads of Government of the Arab League."
"There can be no doubt that President Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Kirchner of Argentina are still jostling for power to see who is perceived as the principal interlocutor with the United States of America ahead of President Bush’s visit."
"Mercosur appears still to hope that the Free Trade Area of the Americas will come to pass even though the USA has little appetite for it, preferring instead advantageous bilateral deals with individual Latin American republics, as it already has a very successful and cosy set-up in NAFTA with Mexico and Canada."
"As I have outlined, the situation is complex, and I disagree with the recent allegations from Mr D’Alema on the other side of the House, who accuses Commissioner Mandelson, who I believe will be the main player in the negotiations, of lack of interest in the region or in securing a deal."
"I look forward to hearing how Commissioner Mandelson will bring this project forward after the breakdown last October, as it would appear to me there is no real political will on Mercosur’s side."
"I would be interested to have a fuller explanation from the Commissioner on how we could bring them back to the negotiating table."
". Commissioner, as you know, the European Parliament has been following very closely the current process of negotiations with Mercosur, a region with which we Europeans have significant links, not just economic ones, but also historical, political and cultural links."
"Please allow me, Commissioner, to address my comments and questions to you in my capacity as a member of this Parliament’s Committee on International Trade and of its Delegation for Relations with Mercosur, which will be on an official visit to Brazil next week."
"Following the standstill in the negotiations last autumn — that you have mentioned — and their subsequent hibernation, I am delighted to see that the Commission is making every possible effort to reach an agreement."
"Nevertheless — and you have mentioned this as well — I am concerned about the possible tensions that may arise between those negotiations and the Doha Round negotiations, which I believe to be the Union’s main priority in terms of its trade policy, particularly with a view to the Ministerial Conferences in Hong Kong in December of this year."
"Could you go into a little more depth — and you have already mentioned this — about the reciprocity of the two different negotiation processes?"
"At the beginning of the negotiations it was emphasised that the Association Agreement would be based upon what is agreed in the WTO."
"My question is how the results of the Association Agreement negotiations will be incorporated if they are concluded before December."
"As far as I can see, it is going to be difficult, but if they are concluded, how will this be done?"
"I would like to ask you three very brief questions: what solution is on the table to deal with the differences over the lack of reciprocity between the free movement of agricultural products requested by Mercosur and our demands for the opening up of its market, with a view to achieving the free movement of services, particularly in the field of telecommunications and financial services?"
"Secondly, how do you intend to reconcile access to our market for developing countries with the protection of our fisheries and agri-food industry sectors?"
"Thirdly and finally, could you give us a brief assessment of the Commission’s cooperation and technical assistance programmes for the institutional development of Mercosur with a view to greater sub-regional integration at political and economic level?"
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to pick up on a number of points already mentioned by both Dr Tannock and Mr Moreno Sánchez, and also by you, Commissioner."
"In both these problematic processes – the Mercosur negotiations and the question of how these can rationally be tied in with the ongoing WTO negotiations – we need to make sensible strategic plans, particularly as regards the timetable."
"Bearing in mind the difficulties that we came up against in the negotiations last year and the fact that neither we nor the Commission have yet managed to resolve them, I do wonder how you think you will manage, by the end of the year, to organise a proper timetable and to extract more substantial concessions than have been made so far."
"As Mr Moreno Sánchez has already said: how, in fact, do you intend to establish a link between these negotiations, not least in terms of the resources at your disposal?"
"I think both sets of negotiations are enormously demanding and complex, and the whole business strikes me as very difficult."
"Hence the question as to whether it might perhaps be more intelligent and more rational to provide for more time and more leeway in the negotiations, particularly in view of Dr Tannock’s argument that there are, quite simply, a lot of political power games being played here and that the negotiations between Brazil and Argentina are very complicated indeed, not to mention those with the United States."
"I think, then, that the big issue is whether we actually have to keep to the timetable that has been laid down, or whether it might be smarter to consider another one."
"My second question has to do with the texts."
"I have read that you want to organise a major round of talks with ministers, which will then achieve a breakthrough."
"That is a good way of going about it; it is always important to get the backing of political leaders."
"It seems to me, though, that – rather as with negotiations involving the United States and the rest of the world – you, the Commission, are concentrating too much on governments and very often ignoring the parliaments."
"That is something we, over and over again, have had cause to deplore."
"Here, too, it might be appropriate to make use of the bodies that we have for this purpose – after all, this House does cooperate with those in the Mercosur countries."
"Our giving political back-up may perhaps seem difficult, but why should it not be given consideration as a means of stimulating greater political willingness, and also to send the message to the political leadership in each country that parliamentarians want to support negotiations of this sort?"
"Mr President, I would very much like to draw conclusions, but unfortunately that is still a long way off."
"For the time being, in reply to Mrs Mann, it is clear that Parliament’s role is of key importance."
"This is the reason why the Commission is funding exchanges;"
"I am thinking for example of the Parliamentary Delegation for Relations with Mercosur."
"We would therefore view it as very positive if, on their coming visit to those countries, the honourable Members, within the context of their competences, could take things in hand."
"The problem is that if we want more WTO, it would be better to wait until the WTO is operating in its present form before forging ahead."
"That is precisely the conflict between the countries that want to move ahead bilaterally as quickly as possible and others that want to wait for a WTO decision."
"I have nothing to add to the Commission statement that I made as an introduction to this debate, apart perhaps from the following elements."
"It is important that, when they visit Mercosur, the honourable Members are aware that the latter is defensive about the majority of the issues of interest to the European Union: industrial tariffs, services, investments, geographical indications and public contracts."
"The European Union’s agricultural offer, for example, amounting to EUR 2.7 billion, is the largest ever made within the context of bilateral negotiations."
"With regard to the proposals already on the table, we believe that there is an imbalance in favour of Mercosur."
"I shall give you some examples."
"The Union’s offer on liberalisation of the trade in goods is more generous than that of Mercosur in terms of the products it covers, the dismantling of tariffs and the timetable for that dismantling."
"The offer relating to access to Mercosur’s market in services remains unsatisfactory in a number of key sectors of interest to the European Union, such as financial services, maritime transport and telecommunications."
"The Union’s specific demands relating to services, investment and public contracts are not aimed at achieving broader access to the market – in practice, Mercosur’s market is already entirely open – but at reaching an agreement on rules providing legal security for our operators in the region."
"In fact, Mercosur has specifically refused to make an offer on rules of this type relating to public contracts, intellectual property and European Union geographical indications – an extremely sensitive issue for countries such as Spain, Italy and France in relation to wines and spirits."
"To summarise, the Commission is available to the honourable Members to provide them, before their mission begins, with all the information they will need in order to help establish, under the best possible conditions and as quickly as possible, a balanced relationship between these two regions of the world."
"The debate is closed."
"We have come to the end of our agenda for today, Monday."
"The next item is the oral question to the Council (B6-0238/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on financing TEN-T and the oral question to the Commission (B6-0239/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on financing TEN-T."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I have the honour of chairing, is following the process of achieving a trans-European transport network (TEN-T), as set out in the guidelines codecided by the Council and Parliament in April 2004, with much attention and with some concern."
"The concerns stem from the discovery of significant delays in the execution of constituent projects of the first definition of the TEN-T – codecided in 1996 – and from the identification of insufficient funding as the principal cause of those delays."
"Decision No 884/2004, which amended the definition of the TEN-T in the Union of 25, anticipates large-scale financial requirements: at least EUR 225 billion for the 30 projects from now until 2020, of which at least EUR 140 billion is to be spent in the period incorporated within the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"Given the strategic value of creating the trans-European network, it would appear crucial that funding for these requirements should be guaranteed straight away, if possible even prior to the definition of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, in order to prevent unbearable frustrations for the Union and Member States in coming years."
"It is strategic for the internal and external competitiveness of the economy of a Union that must fully exploit the benefits of the single market."
"Such benefits will be illusory if a product manufactured in Lisbon or Dublin cannot compete with similar products manufactured in Warsaw or Budapest because of differentials in transport costs."
"It is strategic for the sustainability of European transport, since the priority projects chiefly concern rail, marine and river transport."
"Lastly, it is strategic for the genuine integration of European society: social and cultural integration that is neither forced nor impeded, but which requires effective links between every Member State of the Union to allow communication, exchange, recognition and appreciation of identity and diversity to take place."
"If, as I hope, the Commission and the Council confirm their awareness of the strategic value of the TEN-T here today, the assurances required by Parliament as a consequence concern, firstly, whether the appropriation for Community cofinancing of the entire network will be sufficient for all of the 30 projects to be carried out by 2020; and, secondly, when and where it will be appropriate for Community cofinancing to be used, so as to back up the far more extensive funding provided by the Member States as well as, where possible, the contributions made by private individuals in private/public partnerships."
"Community rules and decisions to facilitate all of this – from the Eurovignette directive to the creation of a special fund of loan indemnities – are necessary additions."
"It is in that context and in view of the EUR 20.3 billion proposed for the TEN-T by the Commission under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective – a budget that would guarantee that an average 15% of the funding of the trans-European transport network is met – that the Committee, through me, would like to learn from the Council whether it considers that sum adequate to cover the amount of Community cofinancing that is necessary and sufficient for all 30 projects."
"In other words, can the Council guarantee that the Member States will be able to finance the remaining 85% on average of the estimated funding from their own public or private resources, or ought we not to consider increasing the Community share?"
"We address the same question to the Commission, and call on it, moreover, to disclose the time frame for the take-up of Community funding by the various projects, which means knowing their stage of progress, administratively and technically, both now and in the future. We also ask how it intends to distribute the available budget in time and space."
"The next question is addressed to both the Council and the Commission and includes a proposal or explicit recommendation: is it not advisable to concentrate Community cofinancing as a priority, if not exclusively, on the 48 cross-border sections of the 30 projects: those that straddle two Member States, which in many cases do not get off the ground as a result of conflicts of competences or interest?"
"This would have many positive effects: by limiting funding just to the 48 cross-border sections, it would put us in a position to make the idea of a 30-50% level of cofinancing a feasible one and ensure that those sections were constructed promptly."
"If Community cofinancing were made conditional and the endorsement of international bilateral treaties were required, the Member States would be forced to clearly accept their responsibility even for internal sections."
"By ensuring that cross-border sections would be completed, stumbling blocks would turn into incentives."
"To give an example that I know first-hand, how could the internal section between Turin and Trieste not be completed if the Union guaranteed the completion in a set time of the Fréjus Tunnel between Turin and Lyon on the French side, and the Trieste-Divača stretch on the Italian-Slovenian side?"
"In the hope that this recommendation will be accepted and incorporated by the Council and the Commission, I will conclude with the request, addressed to the Commission, that it should specify the 48 cross-border sections clearly and precisely."
"Commissioner, Minister, I confidently await your replies."
"."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for having addressed this extremely important issue."
"We agree, in fact, with his analysis of the importance of the trans-European networks, which is evident in many respects: these trans-European networks are first and foremost part of a growth initiative that has been relaunched by the European Council; they contribute, or must also contribute, to the objective of competitiveness as defined at the March European Council; they represent, moreover, an essential element of the smooth functioning of the internal market; and, above all, they are indispensable for guaranteeing the territorial cohesion of the European Union."
"Delays have in fact occurred and that is all the more regrettable given that a number of projects were decided on within the context of a quick-start programme."
"A priori, these projects had to be launched quickly."
"It is precisely on these issues and on the reasons for the delays that a high-level group on the trans-European transport networks, led by Mr Karel van Miert, has carried out its studies, in particular regarding the delays occurring in the cross-border sections."
"To alleviate these delays, the Council adopted Regulation No 807/2004, in April 2004, which specifically aims to increase the proportion of Community financing of certain projects."
"The clear objective of the Regulation is to guarantee adequate cofinancing for the projects in question; implementing this Regulation falls within the competence of the Commission and I am sure that the Vice-President will provide you with explanations in this regard."
"On 27 July 2004, the Council received a new proposal for a regulation on this matter."
"This proposal aims to improve the financing of trans-European transport and energy networks for the 2007-2013 period."
"The competent working group of the Council examined the text only once."
"Given the significant financial implications of this proposal, several delegations wished to wait for the conclusion of the discussion on the financial perspectives before taking a definitive decision."
"I am able to state, on behalf of the Presidency, that the implementation of this programme and of these projects is of the utmost importance for the reasons we have outlined."
"In order to accomplish these projects, sufficient means are indeed necessary."
"The Presidency therefore believes that the budget proposed by the Commission appears adequate and sufficient."
"The Council is also busy examining a communication from the Commission regarding the possibility of introducing a Community loan guarantee instrument for loans granted to trans-European transport network projects."
"I believe that we will only succeed in implementing this series of projects if we are also able to create innovative financing methods."
"You have suggested a number of them, particularly a better division between private and public funding."
"I am sure that, on the basis of these different elements, we will manage to launch these projects as soon as possible, since that is also an important factor within the context of enlargement."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to thank the European Parliament for raising this question today because it allows me to draw attention once again, Minister, to the fact that trans-European transport networks are the key to the Lisbon strategy and to growth in Europe."
"As you yourself said, Mr Schmit, territorial cohesion is vital for the enlarged Europe."
"You also referred to the Lisbon strategy’s goal of competitiveness."
"I am among those who believe that mobility is now an integral part of competitiveness."
"Before answering the questions raised by Mr Costa, the Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would also like to mention a few figures confirming the importance of these networks."
"The time lost in congestion in Europe has been put at 1% of gross domestic product or more than EUR 100 billion; that is almost as much as the European Union budget."
"The Commission’s 2003 impact assessment concluded that construction of the large trans-European network projects could generate extra economic growth of around 0.25% of GDP, that is one million permanent highly skilled jobs."
"Mr Costa referred to the delays in carrying out the Essen projects."
"The main reason for this has been the inadequacy of Community aid."
"That aid has not in fact always been enough to persuade investors to mobilise and to coordinate their efforts, especially for transnational links."
"It is quite clear that these projects will not come about without an EU financial effort, which will take the form of this reasonable and much thought-over increase in the Community budget for trans-European networks."
"If I may, I would like briefly to discuss three questions."
"The first concerns the van Miert Group’s estimate for all 30 priority projects at EUR 225 billion for the period from 2003 to 2020."
"Following a survey of the Member States, the Commission has established the finance needed for each project up until 2020."
"Adding those requirements together gives an investment profile showing that, for the period 2007-2013, the need for funding will peak half way through the new period of financial perspectives."
"This profile suggests that the investment needs will be of the order of EUR 140 billion for the period 2007-2013 and that there will be a considerable increase between 2007, with EUR 17 billion, and 2010, with EUR 25 billion, especially as large projects, like the Brenner and Mont Cenis Alpine crossings, which will absorb very large amounts of money, take off."
"The EUR 20 000 300 000 budget proposed by the Commission is a minimum."
"In fact, if I confine myself to the sections of priority projects that are ready for starting today, I can tell this House, Mr President, that the entire average annual budget proposed by the Commission for 2007–2013 would already be taken up."
"The requests for funding that the Commission received from the Member States in 2003 and 2004 are already enough for spending three or four times the present budget."
"I am saying this to the Luxembourg Presidency because we really must have these figures clearly in our minds in order to understand that this money will be used immediately, in the best of conditions."
"In addition to these priority projects, we will have to cofinance the rest of the network, in particular such technology projects as the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) or the Sesame air traffic control initiative."
"All this shows quite clearly, honourable Members, how important it is to maintain at least the proposed EUR 20 000 300 000 budget."
"This money really can be used as soon as the European Union has access to it."
"That is my first answer."
"I will now answer the second question."
"The budget breakdown will, first of all, be based on an indicative multiannual programme for 2007–2013, which will set out the amounts allocated to each project in each period."
"Obviously, these allocations will depend on the actual progress made with the projects."
"This programme should be settled in the course of 2006."
"Secondly, part of the budget will be distributed on the basis of annual calls for proposals."
"Projects will be selected on the basis of how well the project has been prepared for, the soundness of the financial package and the consequences for the environment."
"The Commission will be particularly keen to obtain firm commitments from the Member States in order to ensure that the priority projects go as planned."
"That is my answer to the second question."
"Turning to the third question which Mr Costa rightly stressed, I would like to confirm that the 48 cross-border sections of the 30 priority projects to which you refer are and will continue to be considered priorities in the allocation of funds, provided that those cross-border sections satisfy the preparation and maturity criteria I have just mentioned."
"For potentially eligible cross-border sections, please note this is not a general scale, but some cross-border sections could be eligible for as much as 50% if the Commission’s proposal is accepted."
"To be eligible for such a rate, projects will have to satisfy the following criteria: first, they will have to require action, construction works, on both sides of the border between two Member States."
"Secondly, the project will have to be technically and financially indivisible."
"Lastly, the Member States concerned will have to be committed to the project jointly and set up a common structure."
"I am personally very much in favour of giving such priority to cross-border sections."
"I can assure Mr Costa that we do have the list of these projects, these 48 sections."
"I am now drawing to a conclusion, Mr President, honourable Members."
"I know you are already convinced of the necessity of the European Union having an effective and efficient trans-European transport network."
"Did you not adopt the 30 priority projects here in this House in April 2004?"
"Clearly, Minister, the future financial perspectives for 2007–2013 will have to allow those perspectives that Parliament has so wisely described to be translated into reality."
"I want to be clear on this question."
"Either this House and the Council of Ministers will grant the necessary budget for the 30 priority projects and we will then, I am sure – and I will do my level best to see that it happens – succeed in putting these 30 priority projects in place."
"Or – and I do not believe this will happen – your decision will remain a dead letter and then it will only be possible to cofinance a relatively modest part of those projects"
"Changing the subject, I see, Mr President, that I must take this opportunity to thank the Luxembourg Presidency because we have completed the first stage in establishing the Eurovignette."
"I would like to draw attention to all that the Luxembourg Presidency has done to achieve that."
"I would also like to point out that, together with my fellow-Commissioner Mr Almunia, we have created this guarantee tool, which, as you said just now, will make it possible to use public-private partnerships in just a few cases."
"To be honest, however, without these EUR 20 000 300 000 it will be extremely difficult for us to rise to this challenge."
"I therefore thank Parliament once again for raising this important question today."
"Even if it anticipates the major debates on the financial perspectives, it is sometimes good, honourable Members, to remember that there are a number of imperatives we cannot avoid."
"When you believe deeply in the success of Europe, in the success of this territorial cohesion we all want, in the success, too, of a more competitive Europe, quite honestly I believe we must give the necessary priority to our trans-European networks, as Parliament has wisely described them, which in all honesty I believe are essential if Europe is to succeed in the years ahead."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, Minister Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in this debate because I fully agree with the reasons that have led the Committee on Transport and Tourism to ask this question by means of Mr Costa’s brilliant speech."
"I am aware that our sectoral interests are not the only ones threatened by the restriction of resources apparently approaching, but, in any event, they fall within this Parliament's responsibilities."
"The delay in compliance with the commitments made in 1996 by means of codecision between Parliament and the Council, with regard to the funding of the trans-European transport networks, is a fact."
"It is not merely an opinion."
"The Commission's proposal of a sum of EUR 20 300 million for this objective, within the framework of the financial perspectives 2007-2013, is also a reality."
"The Council is being asked whether there is sufficient funding to meet the commitments laid down in Decision 884/2004."
"We respect the opinion of the Council, as expressed by Mr Schmit, who describes it, at least, as appropriate and sufficient."
"Well, we are asking questions because we truly believe that extremely important projects are genuinely at risk of coming to nothing."
"In its proposal, the Commission has highlighted serious concerns, which deserve to be reproduced in their entirety."
"The Commission says: ‘the worst delays concern rail projects and cross-frontier links which limit the possibilities created by the opening of the railway market."
"They have in fact become one of the principle sources of congestion and imbalance between modes of transport on the major routes’."
"At the current pace of investment, it would take more than 20 years to complete the whole of the trans-European transport network in accordance with the 2004 review."
"So the conclusion is very clear;"
"Mr Barrot has demonstrated his ambition and the Council has told us that this budget is sufficient, but we believe that if it is not supplemented in this way, the great projects which peripheral countries such as Spain are hoping for will be frustrated."
"We trust in the efficiency of the work of the Commission and the Council, with the contribution of this Parliament."
". Mr President, the trans-European networks present us with a glaring discrepancy between their general importance, which Mr Schmit has just underlined, and the extent to which they have been realised."
"It is for this reason that we are running the risk, where the trans-European networks are concerned, of making permanent the trans-European nuisance that we have had for some years now."
"Let me remind you that building the trans-European networks is a task given us by the Treaty of Maastricht."
"They are not something that we simply came up with; they are a matter of obligation, an obligation into which we jointly entered."
"Throughout the time that I have been working on them – starting with the Christopherson group, and most recently in the high-level representatives’ group under Karel Van Miert – the outcome has always been a great deal of hot air, but little of any real substance, and little in the way of projects."
"Even in the days of the Christophersen group, we were told that the projects were all ready to go ahead, that they were a practical proposition, and that the excavators could start work tomorrow."
"Not much actually happened, though."
"I would also like to remind you that last year, in May 2004, the Council and this House specified completion dates for the projects."
"If it turns out that these completion dates cannot be met, I would hope that the Council – and by that I mean not the Council as a whole, but the Member States – will say that that is not what they want, that they cannot go along with it, and that the projects cannot be completed."
"It is at that point that we will have to abandon the projects."
"So, in this matter, let us have more courage, more commitment and more honesty from the Council, and if what we have heard today – that the presidency, Parliament, and the Commission endorse the budget appropriations for the Financial Perspective – is a promise, then that is a statement with which we are very comfortable."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have, over the past few days, observed the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945, but we also recall 1 May 2004, when the division of Europe came to an end."
"Now, in Europe, what belongs together can grow together, and the TEN projects help to bring this about, but we also know that the 30 TEN projects are a wish-list drawn up in a spirit of national ambition."
"The bridge over the Straits of Messina has nothing to do with European integration, but it is on the list."
"We know that funding all 30 projects, which are due to be completed by 2020, will call for some EUR 600 billion."
"We also know, though, that, if we presuppose a 20% share, the EU, under the present financial plan, will take 120 years to do that."
"We do not have that much time."
"Yes, it is a good thing that the Council has agreed on a Euro-vignette, but we know that the amount levied will not be enough to fund, for example, the tunnel through the Brenner Pass between Austria and Italy."
"On the basis of the tolls that Austria collects, it would take 300 years for Austria to be able to fund its share of the Brenner tunnel."
"That is why we need priorities; what we need is the sort of transport projects that will unite Europe."
"This has prompted us to start an initiative transcending party and national boundaries."
"We want absolute priority to be given to the joining-up of the European rail links between Berlin, Warsaw, Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius, and we want a rail link between Vienna and Venice to Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest."
"If we complete these two projects, we will have reached all eight capitals of the new Member States, and Europe will then be able to grow together."
"In any case, we would rather see these two projects fully realised by 2010 than have 30, 50 or 48 projects half-finished in 2020."
"European integration is dependent on our setting priorities in this area."
". Mr President, I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the general rules for the granting of financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks and energy."
"In this capacity I can clearly state that under no circumstances should the EUR 20.3 billion currently being proposed by the draft regulation be reduced."
"It is imperative that this level of funding be viewed as an absolute minimum."
"The Commission needs to give an assurance that this proposed level of funding will meet the needs created by the higher levels of Community cofinancing, which can be as high as 50%."
"We need to be realistic in order to meet the objective of advancing these projects, particularly when the number of priority projects has increased from 14 to 30."
"Undoubtedly there is a high level of expectation on the ground for clearer rules on the granting of aid to TEN-T projects."
"I strongly believe that cofinancing is essential."
"Member States need to stand up and take responsibility for their respective infrastructures."
"European funding alone cannot achieve this for them."
"Much of the funding will be directed towards major cross-border projects, but I do not believe that this can be effective without all countries concerned signing binding bilateral agreements."
"Where proper parallel funding has not been made available by a Member State, the Commission’s inspection role and its ability to recover funds need to be strengthened."
"The Commission, after all, is the custodian of the Community budget."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if I may, I should like to start by thanking Mr Cramer for his fine words of solidarity."
"As I understand it, three things are needed before the trans-European transport network can be established, namely money, money and more money."
"In my opinion, however, money is not all that is needed."
"Once upon a time all roads led to Rome, the centre of the civilised world, because that was how the Romans built them."
"Where do the roads of the ever more united Europe now lead?"
"It is not my intention to answer that question just now."
"Instead, I should like to address another question that lies behind it."
"Does the transport system of the enlarged EU, which in future will enlarge even further, really form one system, and can the European network be viewed as a whole?"
"In my opinion, the answer to this must be no."
"Sixteen new priority projects have been added to what was until recently 14, in order to take account of the accession of the new EU Member States."
"The action we take in future will undoubtedly also follow this pattern, or in other words we will continue adding on extra projects in a piecemeal fashion whenever new countries join, as though we were extending a house or making a patchwork quilt."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission whether it is not finally time to take a bird’s eye view of Europe, and whether it would not be worth drawing up a comprehensive study of the trans-European transport network."
"This study should cover not only the Balkan states, but also Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, and probably also Russia."
"In my opinion, it is high time that a comprehensive and methodical study of this kind be drawn up in order to gain a bird’s eye view of Europe."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his courage and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for the good will it has demonstrated, but more than good will, it must show rigour in demanding greater funding, or sufficient funding at least, for the trans-European networks."
"Parliament has always supported the trans-European networks and their sufficient funding and, in fact, it views the proposed 20 300 million for the financial perspectives as a minimum and condemns the delays and obstacles, because they are delays and obstacles to promoting growth and employment and social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"I am pleased that special attention is being paid to cross-border routes and I would like to ask the Commission whether it has examined whether the sum — of 20 300 million — will be sufficient in the ideal event that, for at least half of the cross-border projects, the possible 50% is invested up until 2013."
"Will that sum also be sufficient to ensure the operation of the guarantee instruments which are being established jointly by Commissioner Barrot and Commissioner Almunia?"
"I would want assurance that the Commission and the Council intend to concentrate on the 30 projects already adopted, guaranteeing their stability and providing them with the necessary impetus, and not to be diverted by other interests which, in the form of alternative projects, are appearing as a result of the prospect of fresh money."
"I would like to end by mentioning the necessary flexibility and provision of additionalities at the different levels of funding, both at Community level and at national and regional level, both public and private, including the possible synergies between transport networks and energy networks."
"The limited amount of funding set aside for transport policy made it necessary to draw up a list of priority trans-European transport network projects."
"It is, however, abundantly clear that this list still contains too many projects in relation to the EU’s financial resources."
"In view of the recent enlargement and the massive delays being experienced by the new Member States with regard to infrastructure development, I therefore believe that projects aimed at unifying Europe’s transport network should be the focus of particular attention."
"With regard to the Commission’s proposals for levels of funding under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, it should be noted that there is no justification whatsoever for citing EU enlargement as the reason for increased expenditure in this area."
"The new Member States are involved in only 10 of the 30 approved projects, and they receive only 10% of funding."
"Furthermore, the 10 new Member States regard this as an unattractive funding option because of the unusually low rate of cofinancing from the EU."
"In spite of these shortcomings, however, I believe that we should do everything in our power to ensure that expenditure on the trans-European transport network remains at the level proposed by the Commission."
". Mr President, I should first like to thank all those who have spoken and who have clearly demonstrated that the implementation and creation of the trans-European transport network projects is a significant priority for your Parliament."
"I must perhaps offset the pessimism and negative analysis expressed in certain quarters, since if it is true that progress in the achievement of these projects has up to now, since the Maastricht Treaty, been insufficient, a number of them have nevertheless been carried out or are on course to be carried out since the 1994 European Council in Essen, if my memory serves me well."
"A first step in completing the projects has thus been achieved or is on course to be."
"There is no doubt that the Council shares the concerns of your Parliament when you state that the trans-European networks are an essential element from an economic point of view, or from the point of view of territorial cohesion as the speakers have said, and as Mr Vice-President has noted."
"Certainly, as someone pointed out, money provides the backbone for this effort."
"We must therefore ensure that our political priorities can also be translated into budgetary priorities."
"It is in this respect that the financial perspectives are indeed a major issue."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, I can but state that until June, the Luxembourg Presidency attaches great importance to this section of the financial perspectives and would not wish it to be reduced, because that would mean that the political priority would be decreased or further delayed."
"It is a commitment that the Presidency alone cannot, however, make."
"It is, in actual fact, the responsibility of the Member States first and foremost and of your Parliament to decide upon them, since the financial perspectives are not only decided upon in the Council."
"The financial perspectives are decided upon jointly by the Council and by your Parliament."
"I believe that if you attach great political importance to the trans-European networks, you should let it be known."
"You have done that today, the lesson has been learnt, and the message will be conveyed during the coming weeks, whilst discussions on the financial perspectives will certainly intensify."
". Mr President, I should first like to follow Mr Schmit in thanking all of the Members and speakers who have demonstrated their great interest in this matter by being here today."
"I should next like to point out that we have a practically complete outline for 27 current and future Member States, and that the proportion of cofinancing will be the same for all Member States."
"Broadly speaking, we will finance 50% of the studies – as we are doing at present."
"With regard to the projects, we will increase from a rate of 10% for the ‘normal’ projects to possibly 30% if they are priority projects."
"The cross-border projects, which until now have benefited from a maximum rate of 20%, could possibly benefit from a rate of 50% if we join you in treating them as a major priority."
"I should, moreover, like to return to the issue of neighbourhood and the links you hope to foster with the entire European continent."
"You are aware that I confided my thoughts on extending the trans-European network to neighbouring countries – the Balkans, the Caucasus, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, the Eastern and Southern Mediterranean – to Loyola de Palacio."
"I am expecting great things of this work, which will enable us to reflect on the future of relations across the European continent and that will also contribute to our thoughts on the neighbourhood policy."
"I should also like to point out that we will have to be very attentive, because we will still have to make sure that the nation states and the Member States can undertake the projects in earnest."
"Overall, we will provide a seventh of the effort, a contribution that will have a fundamental lever effect."
"I will not go over all of the speeches that have been made, particularly by members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"That said, you are right that it is a matter of great urgency, particularly if we hope to avoid, as certain among you fear, the creation of a kind of patchwork made up of small sections that could be managed well, but that would not be linked to the entire network."
"It is for that reason, Mr President – and I take the liberty of insisting on this point this morning – that I have taken the decision to propose the appointment of coordinators to the Council and Parliament. These coordinators will be made responsible precisely for ensuring that every effort is made along the whole length of the corridor – they are essentially rail corridors and also river corridors – to guarantee the cohesion of the corridor, within the time allowed."
"I believe, Mr President, that Parliament must promptly issue its opinion on the proposals."
"As Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that I look forward to Parliament’s opinion?"
"I will then be able to communicate to the Council this proposal on the strategy – if I can use the term – of coordinators, to which, Minister, it has moreover given its consent."
"Armed with the opinion of Parliament and that of the Council, I would then have to present the nomination of these coordinators that I sincerely hope for to the College of the Commission."
"The coordinators would in fact have both technical skills and, I believe, the necessary political and moral authority to truly get everybody moving and, if need be, to make sure that two neighbouring States can commit to the project of extending the network by means of bilateral relations."
"I would like once again to thank Parliament and the Presidency, which has pointed out that everything has of course been put on hold due to the financial negotiations."
"That said, I believe that it is also the responsibility of Members to point out to their leaders and to the leaders of their Member States that, if we want a fully competitive Europe that achieves territorial cohesion, they too must play their part in implementing these large-scale projects that can prove a real opportunity for the future of Europe."
"My thanks also go to Mr Costa who, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, took the initiative for this debate that I too have found very useful."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert on enhancing port security (COM(2004)0393 – C6-0072/2004 – 2004/0031(COD))."
". Mr President, my first word is a word of thanks to your rapporteur, who has carried out some truly excellent work."
"The recent wave of terrorist attacks has demonstrated that no country or business sector is immune to such threats."
"Whatever their motives may be, these terrorist acts can occur in any place, at any time."
"The maritime world and port environment do not escape such threats, and we cannot wait for an attack before we take what are essentially preventative measures within the transport policy framework."
"The fundamental objective of this proposal for a directive is to complete, at port level, the measures adopted in 2004 exclusively on port terminals, within the context of the regulations regarding the security of ships and port facilities."
"You will recall that this regulation transposes, at Community level, the security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in December 2002, particularly the ISPS code on the security of ships and port facilities."
"At that time, the Commission had chosen to extend the security measures to the entire port area only at a later stage and by means of a directive."
"Our final objective is to emerge from this near artificial separation between the port, on the one hand, and the port facilities that make up the port, on the other, and to implement a coherent security plan that takes into account the geography and the topography of different ports, as well as the various areas of which it is composed, on a case-by-case basis, according to the Member States’ transposition."
"We believe that this approach is viable in terms of efficiency and cost."
"I would like to stress that our proposal is largely based on the results of a piece of work carried out jointly by the International Labour Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation, which has led to the publication of a code of conduct on port security."
"This code of conduct is not, however, legally binding."
"That is why the Commission’s proposal requires the same structures and security measures as the regulation already in force, in order to create a security regime that applies to maritime transport as a whole, starting with ships and extending as far as the port area."
"This approach enables procedures and synergies to be simplified where security is concerned."
"The proposed directive calls on Member States to define the confines of their ports and to ensure that port security assessments and port security plans are drafted in an appropriate manner, and in accordance with minimum requirements."
"The proposal submitted before you also makes provision for a port security authority to be designated for each individual port or group of ports, a port security officer to be appointed, and focal points to be set up in Member States in order to ensure that the necessary communication takes place with other Member States and, of course, with the Commission."
"Finally, the proposal makes provision for a Community-wide system of inspections of the implementation of port security measures."
"I shall conclude my speech, Mr President, by stressing in particular that some of our major trade partners have already carried out an extensive implementation of the International Maritime Organisation’s ISPS-code."
"These third countries enforce the security measures in all of their ports and naturally expect the same commitment from us."
"They are all set to come and check that that is the case if we do not move more quickly in this direction."
"I believe that the European Union cannot be outdone in this area, both for reasons of trade but also for the protection, naturally, of our fellow European citizens and of such vital infrastructures as our ports."
"I would add that, when I travelled to the United States last month, I was able to visit Mr Jackson, who is responsible for national security."
"To be perfectly frank, we have really initiated a form of cooperation based on trust."
"That also implies, however, that Europeans are truly willing to consent to the efforts required to ensure this large-scale security effort across all port facilities."
"I therefore once again thank your rapporteur and all those who have examined this text."
"I thank you, in particular, for conferring on this document the full importance that it deserves and, Mr President, Minister, I hope for your speedy agreement on this matter."
". Mr President, as we know and indeed, as Commissioner Barrot stated a moment ago, the terrorist attacks in the US and Spain, as well as the general increase in crime, have led to all kinds of safety measures being taken in Europe."
"After the airports, it is now, of course, the turn of the seaports; after all, European ports are essential links within the transport chain which connect trade and passenger flows by sea and across the land."
"In many cases, they are also the nerve centres for the transhipment of dangerous freight for important chemical and petrochemical production centres and are located near cities."
"It follows that terrorist attacks in ports can lead to serious disruptions of transport systems, have a domino effect and cause damage to people in the ports and to those living in the vicinity."
"It was, quite simply, vital that action be taken."
"I should add that it is better to sort this matter out ourselves than to be on the receiving end of unsolicited help from American inspection teams, to name but one example."
"As Commissioner Barrot indicated a moment ago, first of all, Regulation 725 transposed the Code on international ship and port facility security – the ISPS Code – into rules that are binding upon the EU."
"This Regulation is not all-embracing, though."
"Since it is only concerned with the security of the wet section of the port, an additional directive on the regulation of the security of the entire port area came out in 2004."
"That is the directive that is before us this morning and on which we will be voting later on today."
"I would like to focus on two core issues to which I was committed as the rapporteur."
"Commissioner Barrot has already discussed a number of other issues at great length."
"The two issues I should like to discuss are related to guaranteeing a level playing field in the European Union."
"First of all, there is the proposal’s financial underpinning."
"Who is actually paying for what?"
"The differences between some Member States and others are considerable, and I see this as completely undesirable if there is to be a level playing field."
"In the final agreement, the Commission is therefore urged to present – as soon as possible and by no later than 30 June 2006 – a study about the distribution of the costs between government bodies, port authorities and industry."
"The additional security measures should on no account lead to distortion of competition."
"Secondly, I was determined that the interpretation of the rules in all Member States should be unambiguous and that their implementation should be harmonised."
"It is, of course, unacceptable that one Member State should settle for one extra lock, so to speak, while five guards and six cameras should be made compulsory in the others."
"Of course, I am exaggerating, but still."
"I have therefore argued in favour of the Commission ‘metamonitoring’ to some degree."
"This proved to be a tricky point during the negotiations, particularly for the Council, which surprises me, because it is the Member States that complain bitterly about the lack of a level playing field, but all is well that ends well."
"We have found a phrase with which all those involved can identify and by means of which the Commission is given sufficient means in order to carry out the necessary metamonitoring."
"As rapporteur, I have also tried my level best to avoid creating an additional bureaucratic institution, and proposals to that end have consequently been repealed."
"I am, of course, delighted to inform you that I reached agreement with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission very recently."
"This compromise is made up of Amendments 13 to 75, inclusive, which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and my own group can support, as can also the Council and the Commission."
"If we actually adopt this compromise later on today, the directive can be finalised at first reading."
"Although you may be inclined to be sympathetic to Amendments 10, 11 and 12, tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would nevertheless advise you to vote against them."
"They failed to pass muster at an earlier stage in the Committee on Transport and Tourism; and their substance has already been covered elsewhere or would lead to an unnecessary Christmas tree effect."
"The agreement that has now been reached is a very workable compromise for all parties involved in the implementation of the measures, and so a speedy conclusion at first reading is very much to be desired."
"There is nothing left to say but to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency warmly for their commitment and their cooperation, which I have greatly appreciated."
". Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"First of all I would like to express our broad support for this proposal and in particular welcome the flexibility contained therein, so far as Member States and their implementation is concerned."
"Security and counter-terrorism measures are very much a feature of the age in which we live and are very important issues, so it is all the more welcome that the Commissioner has taken an initiative in this matter."
"However, my committee had some concerns about the lack of a proper cost benefit analysis, or an adequate impact assessment of the costs arising from this directive."
"We also had concern about the absence in the proposal of any specific reference to funding or financing measures."
"It is all very well for us to come forward with proposals, but we should have regard as to how such proposals are to be financed."
"Therefore, we tabled an amendment, which draws attention to these aspects of the proposal and calls for them to be borne in mind by the Member States when they draw up the guidelines for action."
"We would not wish all the burden of the cost of this measure to fall on operators or shippers in the private sector, but would seek a fair and equitable sharing of the burdens and costs involved."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteurs who have gone before me and I can of course confirm that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs endorses the measure."
"I nonetheless think it necessary to add some points: the ease and confidence with which the terrorists were able to strike in September 2001 and in other circumstances have created the need to extend security checks not only at airports and border points but also at ports, which record a significant flow of goods and passengers on a daily basis."
"With regard to the proposal of the Council and Parliament to additionally subject cargo ferries to checks, I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, take the liberty of pointing out that a greater number of checks at ports would also make it possible to stem the trade in counterfeit goods, drugs trafficking and a long list of activities carried out by criminal organisations."
"My proposal, presented as an amendment in the Committee on Civil Liberties, was not accepted, in the same way that other amendments calling for the extension of checks to people, in addition to goods and vehicles, were not accepted."
"I truly believe this rejection to be incomprehensible, given that the objective was exclusively that of further safeguarding the safety of our citizens."
"Fortunately, subsequent discussions between the Council and Parliament confirmed the legitimacy of my argument and took note of it. The content of my amendments was added to the text, so that they have, in essence, been accepted."
"I believe that the directive can also act as a legitimate tool in the fight against illegal immigration, by restricting the entry of people who, arriving without jobs or any papers, and counting on straightforward social integration, very often are compelled to commit crimes in order to survive, sometimes even despite themselves."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert on doing a very fine job in drafting this report."
"The fact that we are, I hope, bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion is testimony to her hard work."
"We all know the threat from terrorism over the last few years has increased considerably."
"The House has rightly debated these issues many times recently."
"My original concerns were that the Commission’s proposals were too vague, would go too far and that the considerable costs of implementing and enforcing this directive could be pushed down the supply chain, leading to increased costs to industry and the consumer."
"I agree very much with Mr Chichester’s comments on the cost-benefit analysis."
"Through the hard work of the rapporteur, such vague phrases as ‘unlawful acts’ – which could mean anything, such as dropping litter in a port area which poses no real threat to security – have been amended to read ‘security incidents’."
"This tightens the meaning of the phrasing and ensures that the directive can be better targeted at real threats."
"Port areas have been better defined to limit the costs imposed on the supply chain outside the geographic area of the port."
"Importantly, the principle of subsidiarity has been promoted in terms of defining the port-related areas to which the directive will apply."
"However, security is not just about money and, indeed, cannot have a price put upon it."
"The hard work of the rapporteur has meant that the potentially unnecessary bureaucracy has been addressed."
"I am pleased to say that we have a report that I fully support and I would ask the House to give it its full backing in the vote later today."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this directive we are combining the security of transport with the safeguarding of goods and maritime traffic between Europe and the rest of the world."
"Indeed, since 2002 and with the specific provisions of 2004, the issue has no longer been seen merely in terms of protecting human life at sea and environmental impact, but also of preventing terrorist attacks."
"An improvement in the situation is, however, necessary, given that vessels are often not allowed to load and unload at US ports, and – particularly as regards container ships – the ports have to reach an agreement with the US customs agency under penalty of exclusion from transport routes."
"That does not aid our competitiveness."
"The security rules that already apply, as cited by Mr Barrot, moreover, are fragmented, they are not legally binding and they lack an overall picture."
"It would therefore seem fundamental to approve this regulatory framework, in order to prevent distortion of competition and to recognise ports as nodal points in the logistical chain."
"The contribution made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to the drafting of the overall proposals was aimed in the following two directions: defining ports in the transport sector – not only at the ship/port interface, but acknowledging their functional link with the common transport policy – and asserting the need for inspections by the Commission to guarantee a uniform framework, while respecting the Member States’ authority."
"In view of the considerable disparity between the positions of the Council and the Commission at the outset, and whilst we are making do with a less ambitious outcome than we would have hoped for, we consider the compromise reached to be satisfactory and we vote in favour."
"I sincerely thank the rapporteur for her fine ability to listen and synthesise."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I for my part am opposed to bureaucracy, and the same is probably true of every Member of this House."
"A burgeoning number of documents that deal with problems relating to port security could well result in a proliferation of bureaucratic structures, and EU regulation of this issue will mean that two overlapping sets of legislation and legal systems will be in force."
"Subsidiarity is one of the Community’s founding principles."
"We must not deprive the Member States of yet more powers by declaring that the directive will also apply to areas outside ports."
"We must not impose constraints on the Member States’ judicial systems by dictating what is to be considered an offence and what is to be considered unlawful."
"I am all for enhancing port security, but wherever possible it should be the Member States and the ports themselves that decide how this goal is to be achieved, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The effect of this directive must not be that ports have to undergo never-ending inspections, carried out by countless different bodies."
"As I said at the beginning of my speech, we must avoid over-bureaucratisation of the regulations, directives and laws that apply in the EU concerning this matter."
"Madam President, a directive on the security of EU ports is no luxury."
"The attacks in New York, Washington and Madrid have shown that no mode of transport is yet safe from terrorism, and it is therefore logical that seaport security should be stepped up."
"Commissioner Barrot pointed out a moment ago that by doing so, we are simply discharging a number of international obligations."
"In fact, this is not just about the threat of terrorism, but also about the fight against illegal immigration, organised crime and the trade in drugs and fake goods."
"We hope in any event that the initiative will not remain stuck in good intentions, but that each of these security concerns will be acted upon properly."
"Finally, I should like to express my approval about the amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"It is indeed necessary that the funding of the proposed measures should not result in distortion of competition and that clear guidelines are prescribed for covering the costs incurred by the governments on the one hand and operators on the other."
"Madam President, I am glad that you, a lover of the coastline, are in charge of this sitting, and you know that."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done in tandem with the shadow rapporteurs."
"I think we have here a sensible compromise ready for tomorrow’s vote, one that all the groups can support, and that will bring this matter to a close."
"The world is not, alas, the way we would like it to be."
"There have been terrorist attacks, which endanger the transport of persons and goods."
"Something must be done about them, and that is what this directive attempts to do; the upshot is that we have to take preventive action."
"One point that has to be made in this context, though, is that responsibility for security cannot, ultimately, be passed on to the ports alone; this is, on the contrary, a task for all those involved in transport, and that is something we must not forget."
"Security begins with the person loading on the goods, and it must, ultimately, involve both road and rail, or else we will end up with distortions of competition and with something else that we do not want, in the shape of more traffic on the roads rather than on water."
"This, I think, has to be taken into account."
"Unless I am mistaken, the Commission has already started giving consideration as to how this aspect may be included."
"Madam President, the security of vulnerable locations such as ports is essential to society. This applies to both the ship-quay relationship and to the other port sections."
"Since ports are not identical in terms of size, location, character and method or organisation, Member States are given scope to decide how best to implement these rules, rightly so."
"I applaud the fact that the Member States can implement those rules in the most appropriate manner."
"After all, a uniform regulation for all ports prejudices the diversity to which I referred and will push up costs."
"A second important point is the enforcement of those rules."
"Experience elsewhere has taught us that enforcement is easier in theory than in practice."
"Limited manpower is no ingredient for quality inspection, and so I welcome the fact that the Commission closely monitors the implementation of this directive."
"Finally, I should like to express my appreciation for the rapporteur who managed to bring this dossier to a good end in a succinct manner by holding on to the core principles in consultation with the Council."
"I very much welcome the fact that a debate is being held on this issue, as this proves that we are endeavouring to act wisely before any harm is done."
"It also proves that we really do regard ports as multimodal hubs within transport chains."
"Finally, this debate will boost consumer confidence."
"The advantage of the proposed directive is that it provides us with clear goals, and allows us to be flexible in implementing and achieving these goals."
"There was some controversy within my group over issues such as funding for institutions with competences in the field, and inspections and whether or not they disrupt port operations."
"I believe the compromise we reached is a good one, and that it deserves our support."
"In conclusion, I should like to add that I asked port authorities in my constituency of Szczeczin and Świnoujście for their opinion on these proposals."
"Their responses were positive in every instance."
"– Madam President, there is no doubt that we need to defend and guarantee the security of ports as well as airports."
"Terrorism is, of course, something we live with and fear."
"As a journalist, I experienced at first hand the major case of piracy on board the cruise ship outside Piraeus, when I saw arms and legs amputated and floating in the water."
"Terrorism is a terrible thing."
"However, equally terrible is the fear of terror, which various governments use as a pretext for committing crimes against civil liberties."
"Citizens fear for their lives from terrorism and are afraid for their freedom from cameras watching their every move in streets, ports, airports, hotels, everywhere."
"Τhe ESΡS is tapping telephone calls."
"Citizens are monitored from credit cards, they are monitored from everywhere."
"We have terrorism and fear of terror."
"So let us protect our citizens."
"All the money which we are spending on terrorism – we spent a billion euros for the Olympic Games – could have been spent differently, repelling fanaticism and the extremism which leads straight to terrorism."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as we know, terrorist action over recent years has targeted public transport – trains, buses, aeroplanes, ships and the areas in which they operate."
"Memories of terrorist attacks, such as the attack in Madrid, remain fresh in our memory."
"We urgently need to take more – and more effective – measures."
"The proposal for a directive aims to serve that purpose."
"Most of the measures introduced by the directive are satisfactory."
"We need to take measures at Community level, so that there are commonly accepted security rules and, at the same time, equal conditions of competition between Community ports."
"The successful example of the Olympic Games in Athens, where innovative security measures were applied, should be taken into account by the Member States, who need to acquaint themselves with these measures."
"Coming from a country with hundreds of islands and ports in a sensitive area on the geographical edge of Europe, I think that the European Union should give priority to programmes to meet major requirements and complete infrastructures on these islands, which are often a point of illegal entry for people and goods."
"Madam President, I shall be very brief, but I should first of all like to reassure both the rapporteur and, particularly, Mr Chichester."
"We are well aware that there is a cost issue and, as regards the costs liable to be generated by these measures, we in fact plan to undertake the commitment to prepare a communication on the security of different transport methods, including the issue of their financing, in our 2005 work programme."
"The concerns of your Parliament will be taken into consideration in this way."
"This reference to financing is, moreover, included in a preamble."
"I should also like to point out to those who fear that we are not taking specific national situations into consideration that this is a directive and not a regulation. This enables us to take into consideration, by way of subsidiarity, a number of practical considerations that will make the fight for security more effective, when the directive is transposed by Member States."
"Finally, I should like to say to Mr Piecyk that he is absolutely right and that we must also be concerned about safety throughout the transport chain."
"I now return to you, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, to express my deepest thanks as, thanks to you, I believe that we will be in a position to gain time in the context of implementing these security rules."
"I also thank your committee, the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"You have embraced this rather technical proposal and you have adopted a pragmatic and constructive approach in your handling of the dossier."
"I am pleased to observe that there are a great many points on which Parliament, the Commission and the Council fundamentally agree, with regard to the measures to be taken."
"The Commission can therefore subscribe to the compromise reached by Parliament in the context of negotiations with the Council and which is expressed, Madam President, in Amendments 13-75."
"We can therefore endorse Amendments 13-75, but unfortunately not Amendments 1-12."
"To conclude, I would like to express my wish for a decision to be taken in order that this directive can be speedily adopted."
"As I said, the European Union cannot economise on preventative measures for the protection of its ports either with regard to its people and sectors of port activity or with regard to its international partners."
"All of the above has, moreover, been extremely well put by a number of you."
"Madam President, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, ladies and gentlemen, my services will pass on to you the detailed position of the Commission on each proposed amendment."
"I thank you most heartily for your attention and for your altogether decisive contribution to the outcome of this project."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Thank you also for your brevity."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place at noon today."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0105/2005) by Mr Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (COM (2004) 0607 C6-0122/2004 2004/0209(COD))."
". Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking both the rapporteur and the House as a whole for their first-rate work, which has been carried out in an extremely short space of time, given the complex and sensitive nature of this issue."
"Our aim in revising the directive is quite clear, namely to ensure continued high standards of health and safety at work."
"It is well known that a link exists between work-related accidents and excessive working hours."
"At the same time, we are all aware that the future will belong to flexible businesses that introduce innovative working methods, in so doing motivating their workers to be more productive and also offering them high-quality jobs."
"In the interests of our fellow citizens, we must respond to these new challenges to the best of our ability."
"We must flesh out the European social model, one of the founding principles of which is quality as a determinant of competitiveness, and in fact the need to do so has also emerged from public consultations on the Constitutional Treaty."
"The Commission’s aim has always been to ensure that the revised directive maintains the current level of protection for workers at the same time as contributing to a more flexible organisation of working time."
"This was the intention behind the original proposal, and I believe that the same goal is pursued by those of Parliament’s amendments that the Commission will be able to accept."
"I will comment in more detail on the Commission’s position on the amendments that have been tabled after listening to your debate."
". Madam President, thank you very much, Commissioner, for your kind words, not just about my report, but also about the joint work carried out by all members of this Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, by chance, our debate on the Directive on working time has coincided with the European anniversaries of 9 May."
"The words of our President, Mr Borrell, yesterday in this house on the relationship between our duty to remember and our duty to build a Europe in which euro-scepticism and anti-europeanism have been defeated are still ringing in my ears."
"Our debate today and tomorrow’s vote are very much related to our responsibilities."
"They are very much related because millions of Europeans are awaiting the result of certain debates in which they have placed very great hopes, since this Directive is at the heart of social Europe and will be a clear signal of our will and our conviction that the European social model has a future, otherwise we will be at the mercy of a future dictated not from the other side of the Atlantic, but from the Pacific."
"Our debates also coincide with an important moment in European integration and the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty by the various parliaments and peoples of Europe."
"And at the heart of the concerns of the citizens currently facing the question of whether or not to take the constitutional route is always the same question: what is Europe doing to improve our living conditions?"
"We all know that this is the key point and that the question of whether or not our agenda is in line with the agenda and concerns of the citizens will depend precisely upon our reaffirming the European social model."
"And the key point, as the Commissioner has said, is the opt-out Parliament wishes to put an end to this clause."
"European social laws must apply to all countries without exception."
"It is not sufficient, Commissioner, to eliminate the abuse and fraud committed in the past under the previous legislation."
"We must put an end to its legal basis in all of the Member States, as Parliament says, after 36 months or whatever is decided in a subsequent negotiation with the Council."
"Why?"
"Because the opt-out blatantly contradicts the objectives of the Directive, the health and safety of workers and the fundamental principles of the Treaty."
"Because it contradicts that which we have learnt from 10 years of experience during which, in the countries in which it has been applied, the health, safety and reconciliation of the family and professional lives of millions of European men and women have suffered seriously."
"Because it contravenes the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our Constitutional Treaty, Article 91 of which lays down the obligation for a high quality of life in work and a restriction of working days."
"Because, Commissioner, European workers, their organisations, women's organisations and also, in private, many employers who want a typically European model for industrial relations, are asking us for it."
"What about flexibility though?"
"This Parliament knows that we also need to deal with the issue of flexibility, because in Europe we do not just need higher quality work, but also more work."
"We are therefore in agreement and we will allow flexibility and we will vote for the annualisation, but, I must insist, this is a , we shall not vote for annualisation unless there is a vote in favour of putting an end to the opt-out clause."
"We believe that the opt-out would be proper in a Europe without rules, but we are nevertheless in favour of making European rules flexible."
"Greater flexibility is not incompatible with a higher level of social protection for workers, provided that we ensure that there is a minimum level of regulations and guarantees, as the Wim Kok report stated."
"We also want to respond, Commissioner, to the principles to be taken into account when defining on-call times; we want the to be respected; we want the decision of the Court of Justice to be respected."
"On-call time is working time, because workers cannot use their time freely and they have to be in the places dictated by the employer."
"We are also sensitive to the needs of the European health systems, which are facing serious difficulties recruiting professionals to cover this on-call time."
"We have therefore sought a solution which creates a synthesis between flexibility and safety."
"Commissioner, the Members in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believe that these two things are compatible."
"Those who believe they are not compatible are the people who are seeking to perpetuate the opt-out or those who are seeking to define on-call time as non-working time."
"We can make an effort, we have demonstrated this, there is a consensus in Parliament."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council not to destroy the enthusiasm created by this agreement, because it is the old agreement that led to the European social model."
"We therefore fervently hope that we can count on your help, your dialogue and that we can work together constructively over the coming months."
"Madam President, in George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’, there is a scene that is repeated in which, as soon as a debate is to take place, the sheep begin to call out ‘four legs good, two legs bad’. That is what we see now."
"Whenever anyone objects to our transferring power from the Member States to the EU institutions, we are told that not to do so would be tantamount to re-playing the Second World War, complete with holocaust and everything else. We cannot therefore even debate the existence or otherwise of the Working Time Directive without being subject to accusations of that kind."
"The principle of subsidiarity is fundamental, with tribute paid to it on solemn occasions of every conceivable kind. When we get down to the details, precisely the opposite is the case."
"It is actually impossible for anything to remain with the Member States. The Working Time Directive is in itself a breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Each of the Member States is different. Each has its own economic structure."
"Some countries make their living from manufacturing, others from the processing industry. We have different arrangements in the public sector, with different rules governing such matters."
"There is no good reason for trying to regulate working time for the whole of the EU in this way. Indeed, it would be extremely inappropriate."
"Those who now argue in favour of doing so say that the alternative is social dumping."
"That is a hugely serious accusation to make against those countries that we have accepted as members of the EU and which all fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and are constitutional states entitled to organise themselves as they see fit."
"The notion that we could obtain some form of slave labour from these countries is a grotesque accusation which definitely must be rejected."
"Parliament has now attempted in this House further to exacerbate the Working Time Directive already in place."
"That is something we must reject, for it is an attempt to give a yet further increased presence to the EU institutions."
"The proposal should therefore definitely be rejected with reference to the principle of subsidiarity."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, political decisions are sometimes the result of compromises that are intended to keep both sides happy."
"Problems resulting from the fact that anything that benefits employers places employees at a disadvantage, and vice versa, have beset the proposal for a directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time at every turn, and we should not pretend otherwise."
"The vote in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am a member, has demonstrated that Members of all political persuasions wish to tackle inequalities between employees and employers, and to ensure that there is a gradual move towards equal treatment for men and women on the labour market."
"The modern humanist approach to employment relations did not come out of the blue, however."
"It is the culmination of a long struggle for the recognition of human rights, and hence of the right to fair working conditions, which right is enshrined, , in the Lisbon Strategy, and emerges quite clearly from the Cercas report."
"Yet a few legislative loopholes and seemingly innocent compromises could undo centuries of progress."
"It is an unfortunate fact that altruism by employers towards their employees has not to date been a founding principle of our civilisation."
"We adhered to the principle of work-life balance when voting on the proposal in committee, and we would insist that the following proposals are adopted, in order to ensure that this principle becomes more than an empty phrase to salve our conscience."
"Firstly, the maximum working week should not exceed 48 hours, including overtime."
"Derogations to this principle may only be decided on by means of collective agreements, which would rule out the use of individual opt-outs."
"Secondly, on-call time, including what is termed ‘inactive on-call time’, should be regarded as working time."
"Quite apart from anything else, this principle has been confirmed in rulings by the Court of Justice."
"Thirdly, the reference period for calculating the average working week should continue to be four months."
"There is a further priority I should like to highlight, namely that achieving equal opportunities does not only involve creating a level playing field for men and women with regard to wages and access to jobs and education."
"It also involves granting equal rights to men as far as opportunities to participate fully in family life are concerned."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal before us is a good one, based as it is on balance and common sense."
"It is in tune with the Lisbon Strategy, it protects small and medium-sized enterprises, and it contains a number of points providing for greater flexibility in the labour market."
"There are some controversial elements, however, the first of which is the opt-out."
"The possibility of keeping the opt-out would mean that the Union would be adopting a directive on delicate aspects of minimum standards to be met in the area of health and safety at work, and yet would be also saying in the same directive that compliance with those standards is entirely optional."
"Continuing this practice cannot therefore be seen as a form of flexibility. What it would mean is deregulation in an area as sensitive as health and safety at work."
"The European economy needs greater flexibility in the labour market, but not at the expense of an absence of rules."
"There are other, more effective, ways of bringing flexibility into the labour market, such as extending the reference period, which is covered in this proposal."
"This is, moreover, guided by the subsidiarity principle, in that it gives the Member States the freedom to choose to set the reference period anywhere between 4 and 12 months, depending on the situation in the country, without the EU unilaterally imposing a set period."
"Lastly, as regards working time and rest time, there is no reason for Parliament not to abide by the rulings made by the Court of Justice."
"Once again, this proposal fails to uphold the subsidiarity principle, which would accord the Member States the right to set out methods for calculation as they see fit for the purposes of salaries and counting working time."
"Let me state very clearly that, in the proposal that has been tabled, there are no other possible outcomes than those I have mentioned."
". Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur and all who have helped him in this work."
"There are two crucial points in the report: they are the twin proposals to phase out the opt-out, while opening a way to the annual calculation of working time."
"In that way we will maintain workers' safety while continuing to allow businesses the flexibility they need to thrive in the modern marketplace."
"An opt-out from a piece of health and safety legislation is wrong in principle."
"It needs to end and we need to bring about a proper balance between working and family life."
"Our leaders pledged to make the European Union the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better quality jobs and greater social cohesion."
"We will not achieve that by opening the door to a universal opt-out."
"That would be the path to a long-hours, low-pay economy, which is the exact opposite to what we are trying to achieve."
"If we do not end the opt-out, we should simply repeal the legislation and stop pretending that we want to put in place any sensible minimum standards at all on working time."
"I would stress this: people have told me that this has nothing to do with work/life/family balance."
"It has."
"In 1996 the European Court of Justice ruled that this is a health and safety directive and that health and safety is about the total social, psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals."
"Family and working life balance has to do with the social and psychological wellbeing of all workers within the European Union."
"So let us nail that particular argument."
". Madam President, Commissioner, this text, naturally, does not aim to standardise working conditions in the Union, which would today neither be desirable nor possible, but it seeks rather to implement common foundations for the protection of employees."
"The more beneficial social systems, like the French labour law, are therefore not challenged and will remain enforceable."
"This point is essential, you suspect, in the context of the debate on the Constitution in France and in view of concerns raised by the drafting of European rules in the social field."
"The stakes are nonetheless important."
"For us, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of sending a clear signal as regards the social system that we hope to promote at European level."
"The ambitious objectives of the Lisbon Strategy make it necessary to adapt the European economy to new challenges."
"It is obvious that businesses should benefit from a dose of flexibility in the management of working time, but we sincerely believe that greater flexibility is not contradictory with a high level of workers’ health and safety."
"The balance between flexibility in the management of time and the safety of workers enforces the definition of minimum regulations and safeguards as well as suitable controls."
"The debate surrounding the opt-out is thus of particular importance in this context."
"The option for an employer to contravene the legal limit of a 48-hour working week with the individual agreement of workers is, for us, clearly at odds with the spirit of the directive."
"I should like to point out that Parliament, during its examination of the 2004 report, was against keeping the individual opt-out agreement."
"Whilst we have hoped for the progressive abolition of the individual opt-out in a text that does not lean towards standardisation, however, we have given our support to keeping an opt-out option that would be managed by negotiation and collective conventions, in accordance with national customs."
"With regard to the reference periods, we agree with the rapporteur and the Commission on allowing an extension of not more than 12 months. This corresponds to the requirement for flexibility from the business community, which must naturally be able to deal with fluctuations in demand."
"Finally, we remain convinced that all instances of on-call time must be considered working time."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs nevertheless proposes that Member States may authorise the calculation of the inactive parts of on-call time in a specific manner in order to comply with the maximum weekly working time."
"We endorse this provision that once again takes account of national customs in this field."
". Madam President, we too would like to thank the rapporteur and others for the work that has been done on this revision of the working time directive."
"For our Group, this is an extremely important piece of legislation."
"The limitation of working time has been an historic struggle for the labour movement and we should not be giving that away in the 21st century."
"But according to a recent report from the Work Foundation, based in the UK, the pattern of working in excess of 60 hours a week is prevalent now throughout the European Union, particularly in certain sectors."
"I think this is something that we should not be welcoming but should actually be very worried about."
"For the Verts/ALEGroup,the control of working time is also about who controls your life, and this working time directive applies to employees."
"It is very important that people realise that."
"This is not just about having flexibility as a one-way street, but of bringing in the rights of employees."
"It is a health and safety issue."
"Tired workers are dangerous workers, whether they are operating on you or driving home."
"It is also a social health issue, in terms of a work/life balance, if we want our citizens to be active citizens involved in a whole set of other things."
"You cannot do that if you are working the entire time."
"But the opt-out is a big issue for us."
"We will be told that this is about workers having a choice."
"A lot of the evidence shows that it is not a choice."
"It is something that is put in front of workers who are asked to sign away their rights to avoid employers having to negotiate or do paper work."
"Indeed, we find that in the UK two thirds of workers do not even know there is a limit to their working time."
"For us the issue of on-call time as working time is also important, whether you are working in a burger bar or a hospital, and the compensatory rest element is also crucial, given that stress is one of the biggest causes of time off work and that is linked to working time."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my political group as a whole is absolutely opposed to the European Commission's proposal."
"At the same time, it is highly critical of the report approved by a majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because, unfortunately, on most issues it goes along with the Commission proposal."
"We reject the Commission proposal because it perpetuates opting out and strengthens social dumping."
"It feeds the unilateral power of the employer even more, on the pretext of corporate flexibility."
"It weakens the existing levels of protection of tens of millions of workers and the equilibrium within their families."
"It relaxes the current rules regulating working time introduced in the 1993 directive out of existence."
"To be specific, the Commission proposal will allow the maximum working time to be as much as 65 hours a week, while the current directive and the International Labour Organisation Convention introduced a maximum permissible working week of 48 hours as long ago as 1919."
"We are turning the clock back 85 years."
"In addition, the reference period for flexible working time has been extended from four to twelve months, while the necessary precondition of prior collective negotiation and agreement on the subject has been abolished."
"This will allow employers, in both the private and public sectors, to unilaterally and abusively manage the working time of workers, in the absence of the workers themselves, under the law or regulations."
"Similarly, the clear case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities has been circumvented with the misleading device of dividing on-call time into active and inactive on-call time."
"Thus, the Member States or employers acting alone can say that eight inactive working hours implies 0.8 hours active time."
"It is a mockery."
"Similarly, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has imposed a rest period immediately after on-call time."
"How does the Commission interpret the word 'immediately'?"
"One day, three days, three weeks?"
"I greatly fear that the Commission's proposal is nothing other than a knife in the back of tens of millions of workers, especially in the health and service sectors."
"At the same time, however, it represents a danger to the health and safety of us all."
"Commissioner, would you want to be operated on by a surgeon who had been on call for 30 hours?"
"Would you want to come across a lorry driver on the road who has been driving for 30 hours without a break?"
". Madam President, the working time directive is to provide a better deal for workers and improve family life; but will it?"
"The best deal a worker can get is to have a job, and this directive will not improve employment or social life."
"I understand that the central objective of the EU is for each Member State to bring to the table its experience and skills, its best practice and ideas, share with the rest and strengthen all."
"So, allow this UK representative to bring to the table today some UK experience and practice: that less regulation equals more employment."
"Even Mr Špidla agreed with me on that to some degree a short while ago."
"Denmark and Sweden apart, the United Kingdom has the lowest unemployment rate in the whole EU, way below the average EU rate."
"These countries have not taken the euro and the UK has not indulged in the more restrictive employment practices."
"The 48-hour week, rigidly enforced, will cause small firms to close or drive people into the black economy, where they are outside of all protection and where they will become avoiders of income tax and VAT."
"Flexibility can be provided by the opt-outs from the working week, which are due to be phased out in spite of a vote in this House on 24 February."
"Organisations like the United Kingdom Government, the chambers of commerce, EuroCommerce and Sky TV all want the opt outs to continue, but these bodies do not work in the pseudo-EU world of fancy plans and dead-hand regulation – they work in the real world of profit margins and of full employment as produced by the 48-hour opt out."
"Madam President, this proposed change to the Working Time Directive is just as absurd a piece of EU regulation as the directive it is designed to amend."
"It amounts to misplaced interference in the conditions of the labour market, and it is not surprising that the two sides of industry have rejected the directive."
"The conditions to which the directive relates differ widely across the 25 Member States and, no matter what positive things are inserted in the directive about the protection of employees and private life, it is and remains an expression of the EU’s obsession with regulation."
"The European Parliament clearly wants to see low growth."
"In my country, which without doubt has the EU’s highest standard of worker protection, these conditions are agreed between the two sides of industry."
"This has produced good results."
"Firstly, we have a larger proportion of the population of working age in the labour market than any other EU country."
"We do not have the strikes we see again and again in Belgium and France."
"We have a level of unemployment only half that of the eurozone, and we have the EU’s second highest gross national product per inhabitant."
"It is incredible that we should have to put up with a situation in which the EU, which has not been able to solve these problems nearly so well as ourselves, is to tell us what to do."
"People would do better to come to Denmark, see the way to do things and then go home and work out, on a national basis, what they might do in terms of their own circumstances."
"It is quite impossible to assess how hard a nation works by looking at the length of its working time."
"What are crucial are methods of organisation, the training of the labour force and degrees of efficiency."
"In Denmark, people work efficiently, so the country can manage with shorter working hours."
"Foreigners should not interfere in these conditions, and I recommend voting against this directive."
"Madam President, Mr Cercas, working time is an extremely sensitive issue."
"The reasons for this include the scourge of unemployment and the economic problems faced by employers, particularly in the new Member States."
"A few days ago I was astonished to find that people in Poland were able to go shopping in Ikea until 8 p.m. on 1 May, which was not only Labour Day, but also a Sunday."
"Supermarkets frequently stay open until 10 p.m. on weekdays, and sometimes even round the clock."
"The threat of job losses and the shaky state of our economies make it hard to know whether one should support employer or employee groups, the positions of which are inherently opposed."
"It is for this reason that I regard Mr Cercas’ report and the amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as a sensible compromise, and one aimed at improving people’s overall wellbeing."
"On-call time in the workplace should be regarded as working time, and employees should be paid a flat rate for on-call time outside the workplace."
"There are certain issues that need to be regulated jointly in the EU, and working time is one of them."
"Madam President, by saying, today, at first reading, that minimum rules for work are very important for health and safety in the workplace and also for the reconciliation of professional and family life, we are in fact underpinning the 1993 legislation."
"I note that some of those who engage in social dialogue have let pass the opportunity to deal with this subject themselves, or else we would not have needed to do it in this House."
"Thirdly, I note that there are many myths surrounding this topic, which have culminated in a polemic, even – and I do not wish to conceal this – in my own group."
"I would like to explode those myths, one by one."
"Firstly, with regard to flexibility, it is claimed that Lisbon and flexibility are no longer compatible with this legislation, but that is not the case, for the reference period for measuring 48 hours has been extended from 4 to 12 months."
"Secondly, given that I hear employers talk about the administrative burden, I would question the reason for changing this legislation."
"We are only changing in terms of flexibility and also in order to act upon a Court ruling."
"Thirdly, as for subsidiarity, at the moment, we are leaving it up to the Member States to decide whether stand-by or rest time during on-call duty must be paid and, if so, how much, and whether allowance is made for them, and, if so, to what extent."
"We are leaving this up to the social partners and the Member States to decide, for I think this is up to them."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Cercas and Mr Silva Peneda, who have tried to incorporate respect for the principle of subsidiarity into this document."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the very good job he has done."
"In the short time I have, I shall concentrate on one aspect, namely the opt-out."
"Mrs De Vits said that this is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, but that is not the case."
"Denmark, Sweden and France, for example, are at liberty to have standards higher than those in this minimum directive."
"This is a minimum directive."
"Can we do without a minimum directive?"
"No, we cannot, for a directive of this kind also affects indirectly what may be some countries’ very significantly higher standards."
"If we were to have a situation in which countries began to compete with each other in terms of long working hours, then that would affect the situation in Denmark, Sweden and France."
"Because we have free movement of capital, these matters are not unrelated to the principle of subsidiarity."
"That is the first thing."
"The second concerns our responsibility as legislators."
"Does our responsibility stop at our national borders?"
"Are we only to think about the free movement of companies or are we also to assume some responsibility for employees’ health?"
"I believe that we must also assume some responsibility for employees’ health, and we therefore need a minimum directive."
"Thirdly, we often talk about the need to reconcile family life and working life, but what is to become of this if we permit long working periods?"
"It would lead to a situation in which it were men who worked and did not assume responsibility for their families, and then we should not obtain an equal society."
"That is why we need this proposal by the rapporteur."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has carried out and on the conclusions reached in the vote of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"My congratulations are not just a formality, as from the very first words of the debate in which we participated, it was made clear to us how difficult it is to manage such a delicate subject."
"I will only make reference to a few fundamental issues in my speech: protecting health and safety in the workplace is not merely the legal basis, but the reference that warrants this proposal for a directive."
"I fail to see how people can assert that this is a threat to the principle of subsidiarity and to the safeguarding of our various national experiences."
"We must bear in mind that the principle of health and safety protection beyond certain limits on working hours constitutes a general safeguard value that demands a foundation of common rules and references for the very definition of the social and economic employment model and the principles from which the European Union must take its inspiration."
"Every opportunity for flexible and specific regulation in this area must be defended and it is precisely because of that that I, like other Members, would prefer the fundamental principle to be that of referring back to the solutions adopted by means of collective bargaining in the various countries. That is, of course, in so far as collective bargaining exists, is effective and guarantees a regulatory foundation that can combine the requirements of flexibility and the specific organisation of working hours by sector with those of health and safety, which must be protected at all costs."
"We will wait and see if it will be possible to make progress on this point, also in connection with the Council position."
"For the time being, I believe that the solutions adopted in the vote in committee guarantee such conditions, in the same way that they guarantee margins of flexibility thanks to the prospect of extending the reference period to 12 months."
"I hope that, on the basis of this work, the positions that may develop in relation to the Council’s common position will guarantee ever more adequate solutions in the future."
"Madam President, I would like to remind the House that we really do have to take responsibility for Europe’s social dimension, quite simply because many believe that the accession of the 10 new Member States will make it a utopia."
"A social Europe requires minimum standards, and so we reject the Commission’s amendments to the Working Time Directive, which suspend these standards and turn the directive into nothing but an arbitrary abstraction."
"These amendments involve, among other things, the new-found idea of dividing on-call time into active and inactive working time, with parts of it no longer recognised as working time."
"As we see it, time spent on stand-by must continue to be regarded as working time."
"Worker protection and the safety of the public must continue to be given priority over economic considerations."
"Health workers working shifts of 30 hours or more put patients at risk;"
"I do not think that there is any room for compromise here, and the ruling of the ECJ backs me up in this."
"Although I wish to thank the rapporteur for including this crucial sentence in the report, we cannot support the compromises that follow it."
"We see here a need for improvements, for we believe that on-call time must continue to be regarded as working time."
"– This proposal for a directive on working time is one of the most dangerous facets of the attack on workers’ rights. It jeopardises gains made in the course of a struggle that has lasted more than a hundred years and affects millions of workers and their families."
"It is therefore crucial that this Commission proposal be removed and another drawn up that completely scraps the opt-out, rejects the classification of inactive time, abides by the rulings made by the Court of Justice, helps people to reconcile working life and family life and protects workers’ health and safety."
"We also wish to stress the need to reduce the working week to 42 hours and not to increase it from 48 to 65 or more."
"What Europe needs to do is to set an example when it comes to protecting rights, and not to veer towards Asian standards in the name of flexibility and competition."
"Madam President, the revised Lisbon strategy aims at growth and employment."
"Granted, we need to become more flexible and more competitive, but that is precisely what we find in the Cercas report on the Working Time Directive, and in the compromises on which my colleague Mr Silva Peneda and others from our group have worked."
"We do not want to put the whole of the EU in a straitjacket; rather, we want a reasonable framework for action that leaves room for national regulations, for example to extend the reference period from four months to one year, provided that the social partners agree to this."
"Decisions on possible extensions of the 48-hour week, too, are a matter for them and for collective agreements."
"This is a practical expression of what subsidiarity and flexibility are about, but the basis for all this must continue to be the ruling in which the Court of Justice defined on-call time as working time."
"I regard the Commission proposal, which draws a distinction between paid active and unpaid inactive working time, as unrealistic."
"I can tell Commissioner Špidla that I, on one occasion, joined the staff of the biggest accident and emergency unit in Hessen for their night shift."
"The junior doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers were on call, and extremely actively so."
"The short breaks between callouts were not long enough to allow the staff to recharge their batteries."
"It is not only in hospitals that workers are entitled to job security and job satisfaction; there is a need for derogations from the directive for fire brigades, including those on airports, for rescue workers and for security workers in environmentally sensitive enterprises."
"I have talked to all of them."
"Familiar though I am with the hospitals’ financial worries, they must do what has been done in other sectors and find intelligent ways of reducing costs, improving the coordination of their staff’s callouts and making better use of technical facilities."
"Let us not forget the other costs that result when staff are, day in and day out, so stressed out that they run the risk of permanent damage to their health, not to mention the risk of exhausted staff making the wrong diagnosis or giving the wrong treatment."
"It is not acceptable that patients should be exposed to such risks."
"– Madam President, I shall be concentrating on on-call time."
"I do so because many Members are wondering why it is that this appears to be a particular problem in Germany, where the owners of hospitals are up in arms against the change proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, just as they once were against the rulings by the ECJ."
"So, for the sake of clarification, let me explain that the ECJ’s ruling has been implemented in Germany, too, since 2004, when German law began to treat the whole of on-call time as working time, in precisely the same way that Mr Cercas’ report demands."
"Secondly, in practice, too, this can be done without too much difficulty, as is demonstrated by a study to which even the German Minister for Health has referred."
"I might add that, in Germany, there has been funding available since 2003 for the introduction of much-needed innovative models of working time and for the recruitment of some new doctors."
"Even then, there can be problems, but it is for that very reason that our Committee wants the opening clause, which would state that alternative arrangements could be made by collective agreement – and only in an emergency by law – to make allowance for the inactive periods."
"The problem is not the European Working Time Directive; the problem is German hospitals’ aversion to reform."
"For example, one German region, while being much smaller than Sweden, has far more hospitals and hospital beds."
"The issue with on-call time is the safety of the patients."
"Even though staying awake for a period of 24 hours is equivalent, in terms of its adverse effects, to having a blood-alcohol level of 1 per thousand, doctors often work over 30 hours at a stretch, and that is what must be changed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, while discussing some aspects of the organisation of working hours, first of all we have to talk about those cases where hired employees support their families from their jobs, and who comprise the majority of the labour market."
"A high level of unemployment, in particular in some new Member States, the slow development of new workplaces, reduction of old workplaces in some sectors, for example, in the textile industry, and the fear of people, particularly in the provinces, that they will lose their jobs, enable employers to misuse the possibility of eliminating workplaces, or threatening dismissal if an employee refuses to work overtime."
"Work exceeding 48 hours per week can worsen the conditions of employees in all sectors even more, in particular those working in the service sector, creating not only physical, but also moral discomfort, and causing undesirable effects for families and the education of children."
"If the necessity for prolongation of the workweek is argued from the point of view of the fear that businesses in the European Union will move to China or other countries, then we should ask ourselves whether one of the essential motives of the establishment of the European Union – the welfare of its citizens – becomes just a catchword, and whether we should seek other means for economic development and competitive abilities."
"On the other hand, the proposal of the European Parliament, in respect to employees having several work contracts and to summing up their working time according to each contract, deprives the citizens of those states where salaries are low, in such sectors as the health sector, which employs duty time, of the possibility of ensuring themselves an appropriate standard of living."
"Therefore, when adopting the amending directive, I suggest refraining from the ‘opt-out’ introduction into all sectors and not to sum up the working time in respect to people voluntarily working according to several work contracts, and leave such decisions to the national level."
"Madam President, if we want to win the European public over to the European project, the EU must not become a self-service store where social and labour law are concerned."
"It is because an welfare state is not an option that the opt-out clause must be done away with; this currently permits derogations from the maximum working week, and has already, in the United Kingdom, resulted in 700 000 employment contracts that disregard the 48-hour working week."
"This is a good compromise, not least because, through the social partnership, it enables the trade unions to intervene."
"Let me end by appealing to our friends in the Confederal Group of the European United Left."
"In the last Parliament, we voted on the Tobin tax, and would have won the vote if you had voted alongside us."
"Watch out, or else your votes this Wednesday might enable the hardline conservatives to get what they want!"
"Madam President, I was expecting to find in this directive what is missing from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the draft European Constitution: the upwards harmonisation of social rights."
"There is no mention of it."
"The opposite is true, in fact."
"Only employees’ flexibility has been increased therein."
"Whilst the hanged men of Chicago died in 1886 for an eight-hour working day and a 40-hour working week, here we have, at the beginning of the 21st century, the great social innovation of the European Union, which should seek to raise the ceiling on the maximum weekly working time from 48 hours to 65 hours, or indeed above that in the event of individual or collective agreements, with the reference period for calculating the maximum weekly working time increased from four to 12 months."
"Generously, periods of compensatory rest at the end of 72 hours’ work are guaranteed."
"One can only acknowledge the social audacity of this text that will most likely make European employers tremble!"
"To cap it all, the concept of an inactive period of on-call time is being introduced, which is to be excluded from working time, and which completely contradicts the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"There is no need for further explanation."
"The zealous servants of European employers have toiled well and although they know, like those who will choose to vote in favour of this text …"
"Madam President, I will confine my remarks purely to the issue of the opt-out."
"The rapporteur said that the opt-out violates the fundamental principles of the Treaty."
"That is simply not true."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties; the Commission proposed 10 years ago that the opt-out should exist."
"In the review now, 10 years on, the Commission is still proposing that the opt-out should continue to exist."
"Mr Hughes said that the issue is about work/life balance."
"The rapporteur asserts that people are asking how Europe improves their living conditions."
"I do not believe that people are asking that."
"People are asking themselves how they can improve their living conditions for themselves."
"At the moment, the decision of many millions of them is to use the opt-out."
"The issue before us today is: who decides?"
"Should it be a small group of out-of-touch politicians dictating what makes a better quality of life for the people, or should it be the millions of workers themselves, who currently enjoy the right to choose and who want to continue to decide for themselves?"
"Many of the new Member States want to make use of the opt-out."
"All the social partners except the ETUC want to keep the opt-out."
"Small business organisations across the EU have contacted me, pleading that the opt-out be kept."
"My good friend Mr Silva Peneda says that this report proposes more flexibility and is good for SMEs."
"SMEs themselves fundamentally disagree, and they should know."
"The issue is: who should decide?"
"I believe that it should not be for us in this Parliament to decide and to dictate excessive and rigid restrictions on how people choose to spend their lives."
"People want more freedom and more flexibility."
"We should give that to them and vote against this report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on his fine work."
"We have an important task to complete: building in earnest, alongside an economic Europe, a social Europe."
"It is impossible to imagine the economic growth and development of Europe without the crucial contribution of the workers, the safeguarding of their quality of work and the protection of their health in the workplace."
"The working time directive is an essential element of a social Europe."
"We have to be fully aware that it will be impossible to reach these growth and development objectives, if we choose the ‘low road’ to competitiveness: that based on cost cutting and increased demands on the workforce."
"The high road is based on quality and innovation: in that context, human capital is vital and its qualitative contribution must be our objective."
"The Cercas report offers a legitimate response to this objective."
"The report in question seeks to preserve the fundamental principles of the working time directive, as they are laid down in the European Constitution, on the issue of the reference period, on the opt-out and as regards the Court of Justice ruling relating to the periods of time spent on duty."
"The report contains strong support for the introduction of provisions aiming at helping employees to strike a balance between work and family life, and we therefore fully endorse the Cercas report."
"Madam President, for many Liberal Democrats the opt-out represents an important principle of subsidiarity."
"We support measures that protect individuals from exploitation at work."
"We are not convinced that it is for the European Union to be the body that imposes unwanted restrictions, that have nothing to do with health and safety, on individuals in every Member State."
"We strongly disagree with Mr Hughes, of the British Labour Party, that the European Union should lay down the law with regard to the work/life/family balance of people everywhere."
"It is not surprising that we have to counter so much Euro-scepticism in Britain when senior Members of this Parliament call for the EU to be allowed to interfere in the lives of individuals to such an extent."
"We have a European single market, but that does not overrule the fact that Member States compete against one another."
"If the people of one country want greater social protection at the risk of damaging their competitive position, then they should vote for a government that will do that."
"In many cases the Liberal Democrats will support them."
"But blanket controls imposed on every country by Brussels will limit the freedom of Member States to decide the approach most appropriate for them."
"It is excessive and wrong."
"It is also condescending for this Parliament to seek to impose restrictions on others, while excluding executives, MEPs and Commissioners."
"Speaking for myself, I have never worked less than a 48-hour week and I do not intend to start doing so."
"Applying these restrictions rigidly to workers in the tourist industry and the agricultural sector, with their extreme seasonal fluctuations, will simply drive people into the black economy."
"That is no way to promote the Lisbon Agenda."
"For practical reasons and for reasons of principle, the right to opt out should remain."
"Madam President, it is good that we have now been given the opportunity to revise the Working Time Directive."
"My main focus in the course of this work is to ensure that it is made easier for the Member States to create new jobs."
"It is therefore important that flexible solutions be provided and that there is a reduction in detailed regulation and central control by the EU."
"Issues relating to working time should, in the first place, be the responsibility of the Member States, each of which should therefore have broad scope for finding its own solution."
"Industries too operate differently, and as individuals we also have different needs and desires regarding our working hours."
"Issues of working time are an area in which national practice should apply and not matters that should be decided on by the EU."
"Unfortunately, there are powerful forces in this Parliament which wish to move in the opposite direction."
"They want to curtail the Member States’ ability to adjust things to their own traditions and needs."
"A single model has to apply for the whole of Europe, meaning that they want to introduce supranationalism where issues of working time are concerned."
"They do not want to allow the Member States to be different from one another and are content for all Europeans to want exactly the same things in terms of organising their working time."
"Unlike those people, I believe that what is most important in Europe today is to lay sound foundations for creating new jobs. Unlike them, I have faith that people themselves have a better idea than politicians of what best suits them."
"As with so many other issues, it is not the case that one solution is best for everyone."
"We are different, and therein lie the charm and the strength of the EU."
"We consist of different states with different cultures and traditions."
"I want to give each European country the opportunity to retain its distinctive features and to give the Member States the power to decide about the issue of working time."
"It is not an issue to be regulated in detail at EU level."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no to the 60-hour week, the opt-out must disappear."
"It is without any hesitation whatsoever that I endorse the text presented by Mr Cercas."
"I will support it first of all by referring to the good sense that demands that we work to live and not the reverse."
"Good sense alone will tell us that, with the exception of jobs clearly demanded by those who carry them out, the reality of working 60 hours per week - or worse still, 63 hours with the authorisation granted in 1993 – as is the case in certain countries in the European Union, will pose problems in terms of adapting to one’s personal, family and social environment in the long run."
"In the social field, as in that of politics, progress gives way to compromise."
"The desire to extend the practice of 60 or 65 hours of working time is at odds with social progress."
"In this regard, the opt-out must disappear."
"As Members of the European Parliament, it is for us to assume the responsibility for ensuring that the people of Europe have the chance of a good future."
"This also involves our protecting their rights as employees and their rights in the workplace."
"For this, there must be rules; yes, indeed, but what rules?"
"How many and how detailed must they be?"
"The fundamental task must surely be – or so I have heard in this House over and over again in the course of the past year – that we give priority to enabling them to keep their jobs or to enabling them to have jobs in the first place."
"We have now been presented with a Working Time Directive that committees of this House have considered – and made worse, not least in terms of the criteria of the Lisbon strategy."
"The whole thing boils down to us making more regulations."
"Rather than reducing regulation and becoming more flexible, we will end up with the very opposite."
"Let me illustrate that by a couple of questions."
"Firstly, why is it that we, in Europe, have to specify what it means to be on call?"
"Must it mean the same thing in every hospital in every town in every country in Europe?"
"And, if so, why?"
"It is a fact, though, that there is a difference between what goes on in an accident and emergency department, where people often have to go out in the middle of the night, and the situation in an orthopaedic ward, where, at night, everyone is asleep!"
"It is not acceptable – it is quite wrong – for these things to be tied to some sort of Procrustes’ bed!"
"Secondly, why can the extension of working time be governed only by a collective agreement?"
"Why can an individual employee not conclude an agreement for himself?"
"Who, in fact, gives us the right to forbid workers to come to agreements for themselves concerning their jobs and the hours that they work?"
"I know young doctors who would be perfectly willing to work a bit longer in future and to earn a bit more, because they are starting out on life or have just become property-owners."
"Do we, in future, seriously want to prohibit them from doing that?"
"And what right do we have to do so?"
"Why, too, do we now also want to prescribe in minute detail the hours that family members may work?"
"Why do we want to prevent family firms from being, in future, as flexible as they always have been in the past?"
"Different work situations call for different solutions, and if we do not enable people to find them, we will be doing people an injustice and Europe a disservice."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the biggest challenge we face today in our parliamentary work is the abolition of the opt-out, which – let me tell Mr Davies – has nothing to do with subsidiarity but everything to do with lawlessness and a lack of rights."
"However, if we abolish the opt-out, we must find a solution for stand-by times, an increasing number of countries are responding to the Court of Justice’s rulings by threatening to resort to the opt-out for sectors such as health care and care for the elderly."
"It would be unacceptable to us, Commissioner, if stand-by and rest times were to be excluded from working time, for that is the time during which the workers are at their employers’ disposal, and what is more, exclusion of those hours would have major implications not only for the safety and health of workers, but also for patients in hospitals and the elderly in rest homes."
"In my view, the solution presented in the Cercas report is an excellent one, treating periods of on-call duty as working time, in accordance with the Court judgments, while proposing that we allow the stand-by and rest times to be calculated differently by collective agreement."
"I hope that the whole House will give Mr Cercas and his excellent report their backing, and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope that the Commission will change its position."
"– Madam President, the proposal for a working time directive to be put to the vote is the product of a synthesis of theoretical opinions on the organisation of working time and an effort to strike a compromise between the interests of employers and employees."
"An effort is being made to place the actual situation and the needs of each Member State within a general framework, which each partner evaluates from his own point of view and finds uncomfortably narrow and anything but protective of health and safety."
"However, the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, who deserves congratulations, and the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Silva Peneda, and all the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and, above all, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, did their very best, even if their opinions differed, to reconcile the differences."
"Thus, the report to be put to the vote and the amendments to it – not the Commission's proposal, Mr Papadimoulis – do not accept the extension; they put an end to the derogation from the 8-hour day, they do not accept the Commission's proposal for an upper limit of 65 hours, they safeguard the 48-hour week and, in all events, they propose that conditions of work and safety and the need for free time and lifelong learning be safeguarded."
"The Cercas proposal reinstates respect for the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities with regard both to working time limitations and on-call time, which is expressly referred to as working time."
"It likewise respects the principle of subsidiarity and safeguards social dialogue as a regulatory factor."
"Calculating working time on an annual basis is a compromise solution, but it will have consequences, unfortunately, for low-income workers relying on overtime in peak periods."
"As regards the issues which concern working women in families, I would comment that the European Commission may have forgotten them, but Parliament is being called on to vote in favour of Amendment 12, which emphasises that employers must take account of the needs of lifelong professional and family life, and Amendment 22 requiring the Commission to submit ...."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the 8-hour working day and the 48-hour working week were enshrined in one of the first conventions adopted by the International Labour Organisation, which was founded in 1919."
"This was an acknowledgement of the fact that the health and safety of workers must be protected, and that they must be given time to rest and the chance to raise a family, or in other words to produce more workers."
"The Commission’s proposal does away with all that, however, and cites hypocritical reasons for doing so."
"The opt-out clause, which is a disgraceful practice, invalidates everything that the trade union movement has managed to achieve over the past centuries."
"If the Cercas report makes provision for the abolishment of this clause, it deserves our support."
"Colleagues, we are in the middle of a debate and have approximately another eight minutes left, including the Commissioner’s statement."
"Please take your conversation outside."
"Those of you seated behind Mrs Klaß, please ask your colleagues to leave."
"That includes Mr Rasmussen and others."
"Could the huissiers please escort out of the Chamber those who are leaving the debate."
"Please sit down and be quiet for another eight minutes or leave the Chamber."
"There is no doubt that Europe has managed to establish a social model that is among the best in the world."
"We should work to preserve this model."
"Nobody is saying that we should not."
"The parliamentary report before us goes too far, however, and could create serious problems, especially in Member States that have not yet obtained a certain standard of living."
"Why should we remove workers’ right to increased wages, especially in new Member States where people necessarily have to work longer hours in order to increase their incomes?"
"What are workers who borrowed money from banks in the form of home loans going to do?"
"It is right to have ever higher social standards."
"However, we must understand that we are dealing with reality, not theory."
"At a time when we are talking so much about the Lisbon Strategy in order to make our economy grow and to create work, we should not pass laws that are less flexible."
"Workers want us to pass laws that create jobs, not to stop them from working more than eight hours’ overtime per week."
"Who are we to take this right away from them?"
"I would be the first to agree that the working week should be shorter, but only if wages are enough to live on."
"Some countries have not yet reached that position."
"So let us use common sense."
"If there is anyone who abuses the opt out and works an excessive number of hours with risks to health and safety, then let us attack this abuse."
"We should not, however, remove workers’ right to choose for themselves whether or not they want to work longer hours."
"Madam President, if the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives are to be met, the social and employment situation in Europe needs to be improved."
"The opt-out from the 48-hour week must finally be removed."
"No country should be exempt from the rules governing working time and thus have a labour market in which employees are exposed to impossible and exhaustingly long working weeks."
"The opt-out makes no contribution to a social Europe. It opens the way to social dumping, whereby countries can pick and choose which rules they want to follow."
"That is not the way forward for Europe."
"We cannot and must not compete in terms of either low wages or long working days."
"Europe’s populations must feel that the European Union has their interests at heart."
"All studies clearly show that long working weeks are harmful to both safety and health."
"A 48-hour working week which had better definitions of working time and recreational time and which called on companies to take account of workers’ family lives, would increase employees’ options."
"By voting in favour of the committee’s report, we shall show the people of Europe that we want a social and just Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to revive the Lisbon process, the Barroso Commission has publicly committed itself to cutting through red tape and to deregulation, and this House must support it in this endeavour."
"Tomorrow, we will be able to take a step in the right direction by voting in favour of a flexible, modern and forward-looking revision of the Working Time Directive."
"A European directive must, by definition, allow the Member States the creative space and flexibility to apply it in their own way, and so our main objective, at European level, must be only to set out the guiding principles."
"If what the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has proposed is accepted, that is, if the whole of the time spent on call is, in principle, to be treated as working time, and if the opt-out is to be abolished, then this will represent a considerable hindrance to flexible working arrangements throughout Europe."
"This is not what I would regard as a modern solution."
"It cannot be fair that we should set down as applicable to the workers concerned the principle that time spent on call is seen in its entirety as working time, for there is no likelihood of, for example, fire-fighters, youth workers and staff in rehabilitation centres over-exerting themselves, as being on call in these involves being inactive for most of the time."
"It is for that reason that we advocate the drawing of distinctions between different types of on-call service."
"Let the hospitals, the doctors, the fire services and the youth workers, together with the local social partners, decide among themselves what working arrangements are right for them."
"Let us vote to give workers freedom of choice."
"Let us opt for flexibility, which requires the opt-out, longer reference periods and reasonable and appropriate differentiation between different types of standby duty."
"It is for these that we are aiming with our Amendments 26, 27 and 32, along with Amendments 29 and 30 on on-call services, and these I ask you to support."
"Madam President, reviewing the directive takes more than a simple legal step."
"As we know, it is in the workplace where law and practice differ the most."
"The more means a country needs to mobilise in order to catch up, the larger the gap becomes between rules and reality."
"In the new Member States, the length of working time is just barely above the European average, but the actual number of hours worked annually is 112 more, almost three weeks more, than in the existing States."
"It is therefore especially important for us to set clear limits for working time."
"Consistent participation of social partners in the creation of local rules is important, and so is the improvement of monitoring mechanisms on both a Community and Member State level."
"Parliament’s compromise proposal promises that the role of trade unions will become more important, the individual will not be left alone and that by monitoring Member State compliance with guarantees, it will establish consistent practice in the labour market."
". Madam President, honourable Members, although the Commission is unable to agree with Parliament on all counts, the report by Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs makes it quite clear that we share the same desire to seek a broad consensus that would both protect workers and help achieve the necessary flexibility."
"Before I focus on the individual amendments in more detail, I should like to make a number of more general comments."
"Firstly, I would note that this proposal for a directive is a proposal for an amending directive."
"The original directive, which has already been in force for 10 years, needs to be amended from time to time, not least because provision is made in the directive itself for future amendments."
"Furthermore, I should like to emphasise that this is a directive that relates to safety and health at work."
"Its aim is therefore not to reorganise working time, but to protect workers, at the same time as maintaining the much-needed flexibility demanded by the Lisbon Strategy, and indeed by modern life itself."
"The issues that form the backdrop to this directive are extremely complex."
"They include the ageing of the population, which is something that calls for a much better balance between working life and social life."
"As I have already highlighted, the directive relates to the protection of working time."
"I have no hesitation in stating that working time has an overall influence on safety and health at work."
"Consideration is currently being given to an extension of working lives as a result of demographic developments in society, and there can be no question that people need to reach the end of these working lives in good health."
"The debate we have just heard covered a number of key proposals, which I should like to deal with in more detail."
"I shall begin with the proposal for an extension of the reference period for calculating the maximum average working week of 48 hours."
"As you will be aware, the Commission is proposing that matters should be left as they stand, or in other words that the ‘standard’ reference period should continue to be four months, with the option of extending it to twelve months by means of collective agreements."
"The Commission wishes to ensure that the same conditions apply in all Member States, irrespective of the way in which relations between social partners are organised, and I would therefore propose that it should also be possible to extend this reference period by means of legislation."
"I am glad to see that Parliament’s position does not differ greatly from that of the Commission on this matter, and in fact Parliament’s proposal offers a better guarantee that this extension will be possible."
"I am therefore able to tell you that the Commission can accept almost all of Parliament’s proposals in this respect, with the exception of that stating that the reference period may only be extended by means of legislation if the worker in question is already covered by collective agreements."
"The Commission does not believe that collective agreements should be favoured to the extent that the use of legislation is denied in instances where either the reference period has not been discussed or no agreement has been reached."
"The Commission cannot accept Parliament’s position with regard to on-call periods, although it does appreciate Parliament’s concerns."
"I should like to make our views on this issue quite clear."
"The basic aim of the Commission’s proposal is to provide a guarantee of legal certainty, and I am sure I do not need to remind you that this problem has arisen as a result of the way in which the Luxembourg Court of Justice has interpreted the concept of ‘working time’."
"The Commission has chosen not to regard ‘inactive on-call time’ as working time for safety and health at work purposes, in order to leave the Member States free to take the measures they believe will best protect workers’ safety and health."
"I do not believe that Parliament’s proposal, as set out in Amendment 10, would provide the same level of legal certainty, and it could well leave the door open for further judgments that would lead to even greater legal uncertainty."
"I do, however, fully appreciate Parliament’s concerns, which it has outlined in the draft report."
"The Commission will therefore amend its proposal in such a way as to ensure that on-call workers are better protected."
"The inclusion of inactive on-call time in the daily rest period of 11 hours and the weekly rest period of 24 hours will not be permitted."
"I should now like to say a few words on the delicate issue of individual opt-outs."
"Although both Parliament and the Commission are critical of the practical implementation of this provision, the two institutions hold differing views on its future."
"The Commission is proposing that the issue be reviewed, whilst Parliament is calling for the opt-out clause to be abolished three years after the directive comes into force."
"The Commission cannot accept this proposal as it stands."
"It is, however, willing to discuss it, and to work together with legislators, who are themselves divided on the issue, in order to find the best possible compromise."
"I am aware that this is a very political issue, and also a matter of principle."
"In view of this, the Commission will continue to engage in intensive dialogue with Parliament."
"I should now like to outline the Commission’s position on the individual amendments."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 12, 13 and 17 in full, as they either improve the text of the proposal or make it clearer."
"One of them introduces a provision regarding improvements to work-life balance, which I regard as a key issue."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 4, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 24 and 29 either in principle, in part or on the condition that they are reworded."
"In particular, I should like to draw the House’s attention to Amendments 16 and 18, on compensatory rest, and Amendment 19, on the reference period."
"The Commission is unable to accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 to 28 and 30 to 52, some of which relate to the individual opt-out that I have already discussed."
"As I said before, the Commission intends to seek a compromise solution to this issue."
"The remaining amendments deal with matters not covered in the Commission’s original proposal, for example Article 17(1) on the derogation for managing executives."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank Parliament for the high quality of the debate that has been held on this proposal."
"The dialogue between the Commission and Parliament has made it possible for me to state with confidence that the directive which we now have, and which serves as a symbol of a social Europe, does even more to protect the health and safety of workers, whilst ensuring that the latter are not jeopardised by the flexible organisation of working time called for by our entrepreneurs."
"It therefore helps to build a stronger and more modern European social model."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Thank you also for being patient with this House and for speaking under more difficult conditions than usual."
"Mr Davies, is your point of order really necessary, considering that the vote is about to begin?"
"Madam President, Members of this Parliament were asked to vote here at 11.30 a.m."
"It is not their fault that their time has been wasted: it is that of the Presidency."
"It is not your fault, you are not responsible for every detail, but when is the Presidency going to start timetabling debates properly?"
"Mr Davies, we will take note of that in the Bureau, but it is also the fault of the House itself."
"I had to keep calling the House to order to give the speakers some quiet in which to speak."
"It is also the fault of certain political groups, because one-minute speeches never last for one minute, they always overrun."
"That can be dealt with in the Conference of Presidents."
"I would be happy to abolish one-minute speaking time slots in favour of two minutes."
"We can discuss the matter but we have to agree on it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow."
"– The next item is voting time."
". Mr President, this report was not controversial in committee: it was accepted unanimously and without amendment."
"Therefore, you may wonder why I seek to comment on it now."
"That fact should not be allowed to obscure what was a very comprehensive piece of work by the Commission, making sense of a 25-year-old document that had undergone multiple revisions."
"It has been recast into a document of some 300 articles, which is now comprehensible and which can, therefore, be better implemented."
"Nothing in this requires any change of legislation in any Member State."
"However, it makes sure that all the accession treaty additions etc. are incorporated into one document, which is useful."
"As an individual who has frequently been critical of the European Commission, it is reasonable on this occasion to record our gratitude and to compliment the Commission officials who have undertaken this task and done it extremely well."
". Mr President, whilst regretting the result of the vote, the Commission has taken due note of the position expressed by the majority of Members."
"In line with the framework agreement that exists between Parliament and the Commission, the point will be raised within the Commission, with a view to very carefully examining its position in these circumstances."
"Mr President, the Commission will shortly, and in an appropriate manner, inform Parliament of the results of these considerations."
"– The report is referred back to committee in accordance with Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Voting is suspended and will continue after the formal sitting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin our sitting dedicated to the official visit of the President of Afghanistan, Mr Hamid Karzai."
", which means that we welcome President Karzai to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, this Parliament, like the rest of the world, has followed very closely the dramatic events in your country over the last quarter of a century."
"Few countries have had such a turbulent history as yours: the Soviet occupation, the civil war, the international military intervention following the attacks of 11 September and now the difficult process of transition to democracy in a country which has suffered so much and which has seen its social, economic and political structures profoundly transformed."
"Mr President, we wish to acknowledge your solid leadership, which is helping to develop this embryonic democracy, initially in a provisional capacity and now as democratically elected President of Afghanistan."
"We also acknowledge the great personal risks you and your colleagues in government have faced."
"We are all aware that there is a long way to go."
"Sometimes the television cameras bring us harrowing images to remind us what is happening, but sometimes there are no cameras there."
"The reality remains however; the conscientious, slow and methodical reconstruction of a country devastated by decades of war is not as attractive to the media as the war itself."
"We in the Western world understand the importance of the impact of the big event when compared to everyday lives and events, which are only of importance when the media record them in a striking manner."
"We also know that democracy cannot be consolidated overnight, that societies cannot be changed by decree, that it is one thing to guarantee the rights of women in a constitution, for example, but that it is quite another to ensure that these rights are respected in the remotest parts of the country."
"We are also aware of your commitment to equal rights for women, but you will also understand that, when specific events revive our consciences, concern arises."
"Let us hope to use the indignation this causes to increase our commitment to the task of democratic reform and progress in your country."
"I am sure that you too will mention this in your speech."
"We wish to offer you our commitment to this difficult process of transition."
"We will do everything we can to help you to create a stable and democratic country."
"This House, therefore, Mr President, is keenly awaiting the Parliamentary elections of next September and, as we have mentioned to you previously, this Parliament should seriously consider the possibility of sending a delegation to assess the current situation before the elections take place and then to send observers to monitor them on the ground."
"We trust, Mr President, that, following the elections, we will be able to develop close interparliamentary relations, precisely because we believe that the European Union and Afghanistan will make their great potential for friendship and cooperation a reality."
"For all of these reasons and in view of the importance of the country you represent, it is a pleasure for me and an honour for this Parliament to welcome you and offer you the floor."
". Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted and honoured to address this distinguished gathering, particularly as this is my first visit to the European Parliament."
"It gives me great confidence for the future of Afghanistan and our region to see the countries of Europe come together here in a spirit of unity and cooperation."
"It was not long ago that the Iron Curtain divided Europe into West and East."
"Yet, today, that curtain has been removed to reveal a mosaic, where each piece retains a distinct identity, but together form a greater entity."
"Two days ago, Europe celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Victory in Europe day, the anniversary of Europe’s new beginning."
"While in the past, European conflicts had global implications, today European cooperation is improving lives and is a source of admiration across the world."
"As you rebuilt after the Second World War, you had security guarantees, the Marshall Plan, and an international long-term commitment."
"We, the people of Afghanistan, are also grateful for the international security and economic support we have received over the last three years."
"The European Union, in particular, has been one of the largest supporters of Afghanistan."
"We are grateful for your generous contributions, the commitment of troops from your nations, and the technical assistance you have provided and continue to provide."
"Most importantly, you show us what our region’s future could be: a future of peace, a future of unity, and a future of cooperation."
"Afghanistan was one of the least-developed countries, even before its invasion by the former Soviet Union."
"Ten years of fighting the Soviet invasion, followed by more than a decade of foreign interference and factional conflict, further impoverished our country."
"Our infrastructure was almost totally destroyed, our communities devastated and our state institutions crippled."
"The long and dark years of suffering, however, did not dampen our aspirations to build a stable, democratic and prosperous Afghanistan."
"Given that opportunity in 2001, the people of Afghanistan enthusiastically began the process of rebuilding our country."
"Today, we have an enlightened and progressive constitution which safeguards human rights, guaranteeing the equality of men and women, provides for a free-market economy and creates a framework for responsible government."
"The first presidential election in our history was held last October in which more than eight million people participated."
"The success of the election graphically illustrated the defeat of terrorism in Afghanistan."
"In particular, the massive participation by the women of Afghanistan, 42% of the national turnout, demonstrated emphatically that a new era of social and political rights for women had arrived."
"Here, I would like to narrate a story to you that I witnessed about two and a half months ago."
"Two and a half months ago, I was having lunch with a group of tribal elders from a very conservative part of Afghanistan, and I noticed that with these tribal elders and clergy there were women."
"I felt as if the women were from the urban parts of the country, and I greeted the tribal chiefs by name."
"I knew many of them by name, and I said: ‘Mr so-and-so welcome and how are you?’."
"When I had finished greeting the men, I said to the ladies: ‘Welcome and good to see you’."
"Suddenly one of the ladies got up and said: ‘Mr President, you greeted the men by name."
"You did not greet us by name’."
"I was shocked."
"I said: ‘Well, madam, I am sorry I did not know your name’."
"She said: ‘You know, you are elected because of our vote."
"Next time I see you, you had better know my name or you will not be elected!’."
"That is the change in Afghanistan for which we are very happy."
"The presence of the International Security Assistance Force, led by Europe from the beginning, has provided us with a secure environment to exercise our political rights."
"With help from Europe and others in the international community, we have trained a new police force of some 50 000, along with a special force to conduct counter-narcotics operations."
"The new Afghan National Army, currently 20 000 strong, is increasingly taking responsibility for supporting security across the country."
"We are accelerating the disarmament process, disarming both regular armed forces and armed groups."
"More than 50 000 former combatants have been disarmed, and over 95% of the heavy weaponry has been cantoned."
"Extensive reforms are also under way in other sectors, including the judiciary and the civil service – the administration."
"Our judicial system is recovering in effectiveness and credibility from the damages of war."
"Institutions of government and civil society are gaining increasingly in strength, giving the citizens more confidence, more services and more rights to enjoy."
"The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission continues the important work of promoting human rights throughout the country."
"Thanks to the open political atmosphere in Afghanistan, the free press has enjoyed great development and success, as demonstrated by the publication of more than 300 independent papers, more than 30 independent radio stations and four independent television channels in less than two years."
"We realised that political and security developments can be sustained only with corresponding improvements in the economic area."
"Over the last three years, we have introduced a new currency, stabilised inflation and enacted numerous legal and administrative reforms to simplify our customs and investment processes."
"As a result, hundreds of millions of dollars in international investment have flowed into Afghanistan."
"Certain industries, such as the hospitality sector, banks and mobile communications, have particularly benefited."
"Wages have increased, as has trade and commerce with countries of the region, notably Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, China and beyond. I should like to give an example here of the changes that have occurred."
"Three years ago, Afghanistan’s trade with Pakistan was less than USD 50 million."
"Last year, this trade – in less than three years – surpassed USD 1 billion."
"Today, trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan amounts to USD 1 billion."
"The same applies to China and other countries around us."
"Much has been done so far, but daunting challenges remain ahead of us."
"Afghanistan’s social development indicators are still dismal: we have one of the infant mortality rates and one of the life expectancy rates in the world; and we have unacceptable levels of illiteracy, particularly among women."
"Sadly, these social indicators place our country close to the bottom of the human development index: in fact, fifth from the bottom."
"Terrorism has been defeated as a force, but its residues disturb our peace and tranquillity."
"While critical steps to establish an effective government have been taken, the ability of the new institutions to provide security and help lift the population out of extreme poverty is far from adequate."
"Poppy cultivation and the drug economy are still afflicting our communities and remain obstacles to Afghanistan’s stability."
"I wish to depart from my prepared speech to explain to you what is happening in Afghanistan with regard to the drug economy – the cultivation of poppies."
"Thirty years ago, when the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Afghanistan was a somewhat well-to-do agrarian society."
"In the years of conflict, drought and difficulties for the Afghan people, Afghan men and women – families, fathers, mothers, daughters – had no hope for the future."
"A father, a mother did not know whether their son or daughter would be alive or dead the next day; whether they would have food to eat or be hungry."
"In that situation, people destroyed vineyards and replaced them with poppies; people destroyed pomegranate orchards and replaced them with poppies; people destroyed apricot orchards and replaced them with poppies, because poppies were easy to grow – there was not much need for irrigation – and easy to sell."
"Therefore, because of a lack of confidence in the future and a lack of means, society became involved in that easy crop."
"Last year, we began action against poppy cultivation, and the people responded because they have more hope for the future: they have more confidence in their country and in themselves."
"We hope that there will be a considerable reduction in poppy cultivation this year in Afghanistan, a great part of it voluntarily."
"My hope, and that of the Afghan people, is that the international community will continue to assist us in decreasing poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and to replace it with legitimate forms of agriculture."
"In other words, to replace it with alternative forms of livelihood, so that our people can return to growing vines, pomegranates, apricots and the other agricultural products which Afghanistan is very good at cultivating."
"Afghanistan produces the best pomegranates, the best foods; it can compete in international markets."
"Please continue to help us bring a legitimate economy to the Afghan people again."
"Nobody wants to have a bad name in the world, and Afghanistan is no exception."
"Afghanistan wants to live an honourable life, a life where it can return to generating its own legitimate income."
"I am grateful for what you have done for us so far, but please continue to help us."
"Parliamentary elections in September will mark the culmination of the Bonn process in Afghanistan."
"The Afghan constitution decrees that at least 27% of members of the Afghan Parliament should be women."
"Yet, while we will have met all the benchmarks set out in the Bonn Agreement by the end of September, we will only be at the beginning of a long road towards achieving the vision set out for Afghanistan in that document."
"The end of the Bonn process, therefore, must not be the end of your commitment to and support for Afghanistan, but the beginning of a long-term and more comprehensive partnership."
"The end of the Bonn process will not mean the success of Afghanistan or the total success of Afghanistan."
"The end of the Bonn process, the coming of the parliament, will lay the foundations for the success of Afghanistan but not constitute success itself."
"Success itself will take many more years to come, and for that your help is needed."
"From Europe, we need support and the assurance that Afghanistan will continue to receive assistance in a sustainable manner."
"In particular, as you deliberate here about the European Union’s future international commitments, I hope you will see the need for multi-year pledges of aid to Afghanistan to support our efforts at rebuilding our country."
"We also need the United Nations, the United States, Japan and others who have assisted us so far to reaffirm their commitment to partnership with Afghanistan: a partnership that is essential if Afghanistan is to achieve lasting stability, democratisation and development."
"Allow me to take this opportunity to thank you once again, on behalf of the Afghan people, for the generous support that the European Union, as one of the largest donors to Afghanistan, has provided over the last three years."
"The people of Afghanistan are especially grateful to your sons and daughters in uniform who are serving courageously in our country."
"To those who have given their lives to provide us with security, we offer once again our gratitude, our prayers and our pledge that we will never forget."
"Today in Afghanistan, in a country which, not long ago, was totally isolated from the world, something unprecedented is taking place."
"In a true spirit of cooperation, people from all corners of the world, people from different faiths, cultures and backgrounds, are together helping to secure the lives of the Afghan people and rebuild our country."
"It is clear that without this cooperation Afghans would never have accomplished what we have accomplished over the past three years."
"Afghanistan is as much in need of your help today as Europe was 60 years ago."
"Then, a long-term commitment from your friends around the world gave you the support you needed to rebuild your countries, your lives."
"Today, we are asking for that same opportunity."
"Thank you for what you have done so far for us."
"We are very grateful."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in order to draw attention to the content of Rule 9 on standards of behaviour and the code of conduct of this Parliament, since today, in this House, flags have appeared of a nation that does not exist – Padania, as it is described by Mr Borghezio."
"I should like to denounce this act, which offends my country, Italy, a country that I am proud to represent, and I question whether the Presidency intends to take action against this offence caused to one of the Member States with the presence in this Parliament of flags belonging to a state or nation that does not exist and that is not recognised within any of the international organisations."
"I hope that all Italian Members will join me in denouncing this affront to our country."
"Mr President, following President Karzai’s powerful speech, for which our President did not feel obliged to thank him, I would like to thank him for addressing this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I intervene only to point out to every Member of this Parliament – including the Member who has just spoken – that up until the fall of the Berlin Wall there were many nations without statehood in Europe, and that one day the right to self-determination will allow Padania to also become a nation with its own state."
"– The Bureau is examining the issue and will certainly take a decision on the matter."
". I am sorry to steal two minutes from your lunchtime, colleagues, but I have to table an oral amendment."
"This is one of the first reports by a new Member from a new Member State."
"I would like to say thank you for the help I was given in this job."
"My special thanks go to French colleagues, from different political groups, who were very active in helping me."
"Just before the French referendum it is important to understand the important and frontline role of France in preserving and saving the common cultural heritage of Europe."
"They can be proud of their country."
"My aim was to reach a first reading agreement and the Luxembourg presidency was very positive and active in this respect."
"If Members adopt my amendments co-tabled by the Liberals and the PPE-DE shadow rapporteurs, there will be a first reading agreement in May in the Council of Ministers."
"I have one oral amendment to amendment 59."
"There are two extra words: ‘within two years of the adoption of this recommendation, legislative, administrative’ – and now comes the oral amendment – ‘or other appropriate measures ...’"
"Thank you for your help and understanding."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was going to take the floor to inform you that I had withdrawn Amendment 12; however, it lapses like Amendment 10, because they have in fact already been accepted by Parliament and the Commission."
"On the other hand, I uphold Amendment 11, which refers to checks against drug trafficking, the counterfeiting of goods and above all against illegal immigration."
"We support in principle a closer association of Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania with the EU."
"Once these countries have complied fully with the Copenhagen criteria, they should become Members."
"That would be a natural consequence of the enlargement begun in May 2004."
"The EU’s Framework Agreements, designed to prepare the countries for membership, must concentrate on improving state administration, strengthening the judicial systems and combating corruption."
"The countries concerned must not be acclimatised to the EU’s costly and damaging agricultural policy."
"EU enlargement must not become an excuse for failing to reform and, in time, abolish the common agricultural policy."
"An enlarged EU with up to 35 Member States requires a comprehensive reform of agricultural policy."
". I voted in favour of this report because I feel that the framework agreements in question form part, on a broader scale, of what should be the European policy on cooperation with its neighbouring countries, including these countries, whose recent past and future prospects justify support from, and close cooperation with, the Europe of 25."
"If Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania ever in the future fulfil all the criteria for membership of the EU, they should be welcomed as Members."
"The European Parliament should not, however, adopt a position on a Framework Agreement before there is a clear basis for the financial commitments to be provided by such an agreement to other Member States."
"The document concerned should also show what types of aid and entitlements a Framework Agreement would entail."
"Experience of previous Framework Agreements shows that a ‘yes’ vote creates political pressure from then on to support every conceivable form of aid and subsidy."
"Up until now, it has often been a question of getting countries used to an EU system that should be reformed."
"Various forms of aid for adaptation to, for example, the EU’s agricultural system is just one example."
"Neither the EU nor potential Member States are helped in the long run by adaptation to a system that creates dependence upon subsidies."
"I have therefore voted against the report and hope that the Commission will come back with a financial calculation and a basic document that clearly defines what forms of aid would be made available once a Framework Agreement had been signed."
". By enhancing and harmonising the statistical tools used by the EU, we will be in a position to gain a better understanding of the social reality in the EU Member States and will consequently, in principle, be able to assist the Council and the Commission in the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"At the moment, any information on social exclusion is scarce, is supplied late, is not disaggregated and does not cover gender, as I have proposed."
"We therefore hope that the Commission will bring in more, better and quicker indicators, so that we can gain a better understanding of the situation. In so doing, we can take effective and timely action, because the EU and the Member States must provide structural responses, as a matter of urgency, to remedy an appalling situation in which there are almost 70 million people live in poverty, and there is enormous economic inequality and high unemployment."
"We have voted in favour of this report’s proposal that the EU (EC) accede to this international convention."
"In general, we are sceptical about the EU as such acceding to international conventions, but, because intergovernmental organisations are able to accede to this convention and because we also believe that the EU’s accession would improve the internal market in this area, we are voting in favour of the report."
". The fact that the EU has signed up to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) is a positive step towards striking the right balance between the interests of breeders and farmers in terms of reasonable protection of breeders’ property rights regarding new varieties of plants."
"For this reason, and because I feel that Portuguese interests are thus protected, I shall be voting in favour."
". There is across-the-board agreement on this report, given the need to prolong the transitional measures until a full package of measures for tackling BSE is in place."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to split the proposal for a regulation into two."
"Firstly, the report proposes amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, to extend the transitional measures further until 1 July 2007, in order to give time for the debate needed on the two measures."
"Then it calls for a new regulation to be drawn up, encompassing the amendments to the content of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, in other words, the amendments to the rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, given that such amendments require in-depth knowledge of the situation as it stands, the progress made in categorising countries, scientific progress and a thorough-going debate on the revision of the regulation in question."
". We voted in favour of the report concluding the agreement between the EC and Switzerland on the latter’s participation in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Environment Information and Observation Network."
"The objective of the agreement and Swiss participation is to provide objective, reliable and comparable information on the environment."
"Switzerland will be granted the status of non-voting observer, will be treated equally as regards the supply of environmental data, information and analysis, and will establish an infrastructure for providing uniform data on the state of the environment."
"This agreement will facilitate and tighten up the provision of reliable and comparable information on the state of the environment in Europe. It will also support integrated assessment and environmental reporting of the ecosystems that are shared by Switzerland and its neighbouring countries."
". The situation of the EU, its Member States and Switzerland, in terms of geography, economic importance and the relations established in various fields, justifies – indeed, demands – Switzerland’s participation in the European Environment Agency."
"In this context, as in others, dealing with practical reality cuts across geopolitical borders."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,"
"We have voted against Mr Hudghton’s report on the recasting of the multiple VAT directives because it is in fact only a recast, without fundamental changes, of texts whose standardising principles and principles in contempt of the Member States’ fiscal autonomy we rejected at the time."
"Within this text, we see no freedom for States to freely set the taxation of purely localised activities, such as catering, which have no bearing on European competition."
"We see no permanency for applying reduced VAT rates to labour."
"On the other hand, we note that States will still have to beg Brussels in order to change their VAT rates."
"We note that they are still not free to choose the sector or the products subject to a given tax."
"We note above all that the announcement made, three weeks from the French referendum, to lower VAT in the catering sector is a final, pathetic attempt to buy the French vote."
"Nothing has been done, nothing has been decided."
"Enough of these lies and false promises."
". Given that there are no substantial amendments to the VAT system established in the Sixth Directive, which has undergone a number of amendments, I voted in favour."
"I shall continue, however, to express my opinion on the various areas that fall under the scheme, when the moment arises in discussions on such matters."
". This report rejects the Commission’s proposal as regards cofinancing for market support measures in the case of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as foot and mouth and classical swine fever."
"In this respect, I agree wholeheartedly with the rapporteur and the proposals that he has made."
"Where we differ, however, is on his reasons for rejecting the Commission’s proposal; for example, the report mentions the potential negative impact of the proposal for the common agricultural policy, and for competition conditions in European agriculture."
"Whilst this is true, it is not the main reason to vote against the Commission’s proposal."
"In addition to providing support to farmers in the event of outbreaks of infectious diseases, in the form of practical, financial measures to establish a level playing field in the market for farmers from all Member States, the EU must also take action to prevent such diseases, by means of support for farmers, particularly those with fewer resources."
"It is well known that we are opposed to the reform of the common agricultural policy and to the measures proposed, given the impact on Portuguese agriculture, and especially on small and medium-sized farms and family farms."
"The EU’s task is to solve cross-border problems."
"One of these is the spread of infectious veterinary diseases."
"We are therefore voting in favour of the report."
"Combating the spread of infectious veterinary diseases within the framework of the EU is no reason, however, for continuing to conduct a costly and damaging common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"We believe that responsibility for financing the CAP should be nationalised."
". The report rightly points out that the Commission’s proposal will not only lead to inequality in agriculture, but also appears to form part of a broader question on the nationalisation of the common agricultural policy, on which the debate is far from over."
"The right decision is therefore to reject the Commission’s proposal and to call on it to table a new one."
". Fianna Fail and the UEN Group today do not support amendments regarding:-"
"(a) The deletion of a new ‘sufficient’ classification introduced and agreed upon in the Council during the Irish Presidency in June 2004 in Annex I"
"and"
"(b) The erasing of the distinction between inland and coastal waters, again agreed upon in Council by the Irish Presidency."
"Under the existing Directive of 1976 (76/160/EEC), the majority of Member States support the ‘sufficient’ classification as this classification establishes realistic, enforceable standards with a minimum legally binding requirement that will apply to all bathing waters in all Member States."
"In addition, I feel that it will serve as a stepping stone and strong incentive to work towards achievement of the ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ classification."
"With regard to classifications for coastal waters, we support the distinction between it and fresh waters, as coastal waters have lower permissible levels of contamination than those for inland waters."
"I welcome this Report and the rules for the monitoring and classification of bathing water quality."
"We cannot afford any weakening of quality standards."
"I support the Environment Committee's rejection of the proposed quality category being ‘sufficient’ rather than proper."
"I also reject any lowering of quality standards for inland waters compared to coastal waters."
"Ireland achieves about 98% compliance with the current Directive, but it is clear that not enough is being done to ensure proper standards in water quality, and environmental standards generally."
"Last month's ruling of the ECJ that Ireland is in breach of the EU's main waste management directive represented a damning indictment of the Government’s environmental record."
"The Commission has also confirmed that Ireland has yet to report on the implementation of European Landfill legislation for the years 2001-03, and the Commission is now considering launching more infringement proceedings."
"From this shabby performance we have more than enough evidence that standards of environmental controls are far from good enough and I hope today's adoption of the MAATEN report leads to further pressure for improvement."
". The undersigned Members voted against Amendment 27 of the Maaten report on the quality of bathing water, because, according to epidemiological studies, there are differences between coastal and inland waters."
"According to those studies, the dangers of faecal contamination to children (the most vulnerable group) are caused by various bacteria. It therefore makes complete sense to maintain the difference between coastal and inland waters, which is in fact what the Council had proposed."
"The undersigned Members voted against Amendments 5, 7, 8, 12 and 32 because they are in favour of the existence of the ‘sufficient’ category for classifying bathing water."
"This ‘sufficient’ classification would make it possible to assess a stretch of bathing waters on a gradual, rolling basis. Accordingly, if those waters comply with the directive, they would have the opportunity to be promoted to ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ levels."
". Broadly speaking, we welcome the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the directive on managing bathing waters."
"We do object, however, to removing the distinction between coastal waters and inland waters, as this would mean that certain bathing areas in Portugal, such as river beaches, would be reclassified as unclean, despite the fact that they are fit for use, and have not given rise to public health problems. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that, in fact, there are differences between these two types of water."
"In this area, as in others, it is therefore essential to heed the World Health Organisation’s recommendations."
"As for the ‘sufficient’ classification, it would only be acceptable if this were taken as a minimum quality requirement, to be improved by a specified tight deadline, which was not the case."
"Similarly, bringing the classification date forward gives rise to problems with regard to the framework directive on water."
"I welcome the measures on informing the public and emergency plans for areas regularly affected by flooding, and we therefore supported these proposals."
". On 21 April, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted 34 amendments to the Council common position on the management of bathing water quality."
"I am strongly opposed to Amendment 27, which is intended to remove the distinction between ‘coastal waters’ and ‘inland waters’ in Annex I. Portugal has maintained a clear distinction between the two, given that epidemiological studies have demonstrated differences with regard to quality indicators and levels of bacteriological activity, using a range of different methods."
"The conclusion is therefore that if the bacteria indicators are different and operate differently, then the two types of water require different epidemiological assessment criteria."
"I see no reason to take decisions that run counter to the recommendations hitherto made by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and to the scientific studies on which those recommendations are based, which indicate that a distinction should be made between ‘coastal and transitional waters’, especially because in Portugal around 21% of bathing waters that currently comply would lose their classification."
"I therefore feel that I cannot support this proposal by Parliament."
"I have voted against all of the amendments contained in the Maaten report that sought over-regulation."
"The public must be informed about the quality of bathing water, and its quality must be improved."
"We must, however, have confidence in the intelligence and judgment of human beings, particularly as regards carrying out recreational activities."
"Regulations concerning the rules that are to apply to the quality of bathing water at European seaside resorts are a matter not for the EU but for the individual Member States."
"Parliament’s proposal has taken no account of the principles either of subsidiarity or of proportionality."
"Over and above the position we adopt on principle, to the effect that the management of bathing water quality is not an issue for the EU, we consider Parliament’s proposal to be more bureaucratic and long-winded than the Council’s."
"We have thus voted against the present recommendation."
"The condition of bathing water varies a lot within the EU, and it is therefore undesirable to adopt a directive applicable both to the Mediterranean countries and the EU’s northern countries, for example, Sweden."
"We therefore object to a number of the wordings, for example the one stating that emergency plansneed to be set up to cover events such as floods, accidents or infrastructure problems that could affect the quality of bathing water."
"We are not in favour of the detailed regulations Parliament wishes to introduce, for example stating that the scope of the directive should be extended to include further recreational activities."
"This report on bathing water quality is very important to my country. The Portuguese coastline stretches for many miles, and bathing in the water is a very popular pastime."
"The requirements that must be met in order to ensure the safe use of designated bathing water areas encompass not only access, infrastructures and safety on the beaches, but also, to an increasing extent, the quality of the water."
"The quality of bathing water thus represents both a health issue and an important indicator of environmental quality and tourism development."
"Nevertheless, I cannot agree with the proposal made in the report to scrap the distinction between coastal waters and inland waters, because there are differences between these two types. I am also opposed to the removal of the ‘sufficient’ classification, which gives Member States greater room for manoeuvre in terms of managing the suitability of bathing water."
"Adopting these two amendments would have serious repercussions for Portugal, given the disproportionate costs involved in relation to the benefits gained."
". I welcome this report and strongly wish to see further improvements in the quality of bathing water and fully recognise the need to update the existing Directive which is now almost 30 years old."
"I have two concerns."
"I do not wish to see the ‘sufficient’ category deleted as this would lead to some beaches in this category being labelled ‘poor’."
"This would lead the public to this conditions had deteriorated when in fact no change had taken place."
". Labour MEPs want to see further improvements in the quality of bathing water and welcomes the opportunity to update the bathing water directive almost 30 years after the existing directive came into force."
"However, they did not support amendments in two key areas."
"Firstly, on the deletion of the sufficient standard, Labour MEPs cannot support this because it would mean that bathing waters which meet current standards, would suddenly be classified as ‘poor’ (the sufficient standard being proposed is twice as strict for coastal areas as the current minimum standard)."
"This would be confusing for the public."
"It is much better to have a phased approach to improving standards."
"Secondly on the extension of the scope of the directive to include recreational waters: Labour MEPs cannot support moves to extend the scope of the directive to recreational waters."
"Such an extension is uncosted and impracticable – recreational sports are carried out throughout the year rather than in a bathing season and the number of monitoring points would be huge."
". It is of course necessary and desirable to protect the environment with ever-tighter regulations."
"However, because policy of this nature does not need to be incompatible with economic growth and development, the measures taken in this regard must not, in the name of staunchly protecting the environment and public health, end up damaging the economy, particularly the tourist industry, which is so important to Portugal."
"In this report, and more specifically in some of the amendments tabled therein, this balance was not struck; far from it, some of them had no scientific basis whatsoever."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of the report but against the amendments that would, to my mind, work against reasonable and justifiable national interests, such as the provision scrapping the ‘sufficient’ category in water quality assessment, and the removal of the distinction between coastal and inland waters."
". The purpose of this proposal for a directive is to facilitate cross-border mergers of companies with share capital, although I welcome the fact that it does not cover cooperative societies."
"Broadly speaking, the report deals more with the companies themselves than with the repercussions of mergers on the lives of workers and regions, although it does mention that the draft terms of the merger should include the effects of the merger on employment and the opinion of the employees."
"It does not consider that opinion binding, however, and does not provide for the merger to be rejected if that opinion is negative."
"With regard to the employees’ right to participate, there are some contradictions, which means that even some of the positive aspects will ultimately be difficult to put into practice, in light of the context of which they form a part."
". In view of the fact that cinema is an integral part of culture and that culture is key to the development of human beings, it must be encouraged and supported by means of practical – and especially financial – measures."
"The film industry must not be looked upon as an exclusively economic activity, because competitiveness has a negative effect and may dilute cinema’s cultural and educational elements."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the cultural heritage of European cinema must be preserved, ‘encouraging policies of innovation, research and technological development in the field of conservation and restoration of cinematographic works’, but with a cultural and educational end, rejecting competitiveness as a principal factor."
"The establishment of the ‘legal requirement’ to deposit the master copy is a further welcome measure in preserving people’s collective memory and identity."
"These measures should form part of a cooperation framework between Member States, under the scope of the cultural diversity that characterises Europe’s different regions, countries and peoples."
"The obsession with competitiveness undermines creativity and artistic nature, due to the pressures of the market and the demands placed by the capitalist, profit-orientated mindset."
"A policy must therefore be drawn up that sets out practical measures to support the audiovisual sector, which would reduce the sector’s dependence on private backing and would make it less beholden to the inherent contradictions therein."
"Preserving the cultural heritage is, of course, very important."
"We believe, however, that this is an issue to be dealt with not by the EU but by the Member States and that we can have plenty of confidence in the latter’s way of handling this issue."
"We have therefore voted against this report, since we believe that this recommendation need not have been dealt with at all by the European Parliament."
"In order to better protect the European cultural heritage, Europe intends to establish exceptional conservation and protection measures that will enable its film heritage to be preserved and that will promote efforts to protect the linguistic, cultural and artistic identity of our ancient continent."
"One of the recommendations proposes extending the benefits of State aid to film."
"This in fact means extending the ‘cultural exception’ and expanding this exceptional status, which is the exact adaptation of what we champion for France, that is to say national preference!"
"The Commission has taken the decision to extend the current system of State aid for cinematographic and televised works by three years, even though it would be more appropriate to evaluate and reform these far from satisfactory provisions."
"In these conditions, why limit this protection to culture and not extend it to the textile industry, to agriculture, to the iron and steel industry, to the shipbuilding industry and so on?"
"In the end, will the internationalist logic of the Commission not condemn this moratorium that distorts free competition?"
"The clear defence of national and European preference will alone protect Europe from global ultraliberalism."
"I have chosen to vote against this report because I do not believe that the EU should exercise control over these cultural issues."
"The report is far too inclined to interfere where it is not required."
"It is up to each individual country to manage the way in which film is regulated."
"I have abstained from the vote on improving port security, because our Parliament, as usual, has unnecessarily overburdened and complicated procedures that in any case are subject to subsidiarity."
"Obviously, there need to be stringent security requirements for European ports. We acknowledge that."
"We wonder, however, if there is any danger of a Member State such as the Netherlands genuinely mishandling security at the port of Rotterdam, which is so crucial to the country’s economic life."
"This directive has been designed in such a way that there is a danger of its dealing a heavy blow to smaller ports, which would have to implement a disproportionate number of costly measures in order to continue with their activities."
"Because such ports are often situated in economically weaker regions, this would have unfortunate consequences for the regions."
"We wish to see the directive reviewed and reworked from the perspective of the smaller ports."
"The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have put the issue of transport security at the top of the political agenda."
"As vital links in the transport chain connecting the flow of goods and passengers by sea and by land, ports must obviously be the subject of security measures, in line with proposals by the Commission."
"I can but endorse such an initiative because, as the elected European representative of the large north-west region, more than 15 large maritime trade ports vital to the local and national economy are affected."
"France is susceptible to this dossier as it has three particularly well-exposed coastlines."
"The English Channel in the north (the ports of Le Havre, Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne and Rouen), the Atlantic coast (the ports of Bordeaux, Nantes, Saint-Nazaire and La Rochelle which form entry ports for trade with Eastern, Southern and Northern Europe), and finally, the Mediterranean coast (the Marseille-Fos port)."
"These security measures must obviously not be restricted to port terminals alone, but must also extend to the whole of the port and related activities."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert on her important and timely report on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on enhancing port security, which I endorse wholeheartedly, especially the proposal to establish a common security level in all Community ports. The Member States must be free, however, to establish different security levels commensurate with the amount of risk in the ports, and to define the perimeter of each port under this directive and its adjacent areas."
"It is also crucial, I feel, to examine the costs involved in the proposed measures and who is to pay, in order to ensure a level playing field for all concerned."
". I reject the need for EU legislation in this field since it should be the responsibility of the individual member states to decide how best to ensure port security."
"In addition an IMO code of conduct covering the issue already exists."
"The EU argues that the IMO code of conduct is not legally binding and a proposed EU Directive has ensued, which I have voted against."
"Amendments 5, 6, 7, 30 and 45 attempted to mitigate the impact of this Directive, permitting Member States more authority over proposed measures and I would have voted for these had they not been included in a block vote, the remainder of which was impossible to support."
".– The EU directive on enhancing port security sees off the directive on the liberalisation of port services, strikes at the wage and employment and social rights of the workers and sells off ports to shipowners, industrialists and monopolies in order to increase the profits of big business."
"On the pretext of terrorism, the directive in question is being used to create ghetto workplaces, strengthen repressive mechanisms and strike at the collective and individual freedoms of workers in ports and on ships."
"The Communist Party of Greece voted against the reactionary directive enhancing port security."
"We call on the workers to take joint action against the anti-grass roots policy of the EU, to fight to defend and extend their rights, for radical changes, for ports which belong to the people for the prosperity of the people."
"The resolution on the murder of Robert McCartney identifies the IRA as being responsible for the murder, in spite of the fact that the issue has still not been decided in court."
"It is absurd for the European Parliament to set itself up as a judge on a sensitive issue that can affect the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"We therefore choose to abstain from voting on the resolution."
"We have voted in favour of the resolution by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the McCartney case."
"We have abstained from voting on the resolution by the other groups."
"This resolution contains many sound points, but its basis, in Article 1, is that the murder was a political one organised by the IRA."
"That is probably not the case, and the police investigation is not complete."
"This introduces an imbalance into the resolution as a whole."
". GUE/NGL deplores and condemns the killing of Robert McCartney and asks for justice to be done."
"We express our condolences and stress that the McCartney family deserve the fullest support in their pursuit of justice."
"GUE/NGL calls on those responsible to come forward and take responsibility for their actions and calls on those who witnessed any of the events surrounding the killing to come forward and provide information to the police or in any other form that will assist the prosecution of Robert McCartney's killers in a court of law."
"Respecting what the sisters of Robert McCartney underlined when they visited the European Parliament on 6 April, that this murder had no political background, but was a criminal act which should be prosecuted and those responsible brought to justice, GUE/NGL made every attempt to agree a common resolution with the other political groups."
"We very much regret that they were not willing to compromise, preferring to use the resolution to focus on the political situation in the North of Ireland."
"GUE/NGL will be happy to deal with this issue in the European Parliament, but today’s voted resolution is not the correct way to do it."
"We therefore abstained in the final vote, and our position is made very clear in our own groups proposed resolution."
". I welcome this vote to give support to the sisters of Robert McCartney in their fight to bring to justice his killers."
"Their courage gives real hope for change and reconciliation in Northern Ireland."
". Democratic states have but one way of dealing with terrorism and that is through their judicial systems."
"Free societies have but one way of dealing with those who use terror and private ‘justice’ as their weapon, and that is to reject them out of hand."
"Anyone who wishes to represent people politically must follow these rules."
"There can be no exceptions."
"Quite apart from the personal family tragedy that the murder of Robert McCartney represents, it is also a perfect example of the fact that we must uphold these principles unreservedly."
"Although it is not Parliament’s job to become involved in national-level judicial processes, these values are so important that I shall be voting in favour."
". We in UKIP strongly support the brave stand taken by the McCartney family to gain justice after the murder of their brother, Robert."
"However, we cannot support the use of EU money in a civil court case in Northern Ireland."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on the Council’s Strategy for the Seminar of Governmental Experts on Climate Change (B6-0234/2005),"
"and the oral question to the Commission on the Commission’s Strategy for the Seminar of Governmental experts on Climate Change (B6-0235/2005)."
". Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner, it is true – climate policy matters not only to the European Union, but also to the world as a whole, and attention to that policy is for that reason a global task."
"Before we press on with discussion of the Kyoto issue, though, Europe should ask itself what targets it has set itself and which of them it has achieved."
"Or perhaps the other way round: which targets must we set ourselves for the future, and by what means can we achieve them?"
"Have we, in the whole Kyoto debate, managed to involve those countries that have not signed the Kyoto Protocol?"
"Morally, at any rate, the Kyoto treaty is binding upon all of us, for we all share in responsibility for the policies we adopt with regard to this planet’s climate."
"It is for that reason that I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us how they are preparing for this new step post-2012, and whether they are willing to take the initiative in finding new shoulders to bear the burdens of Kyoto."
"Are you, then, looking for other partners and participants in this process as a whole?"
"The countries I have in mind are, of course, India, China, Brazil and the United States."
"If this House believes that this or that country can be induced to make progress by threatening it with a court summons, then it is, in my view, making a mistake."
"Only if all the arguments are in your favour and beyond reasonable doubt should you haul someone before the courts."
"It strikes me as preferable by far, and as a more promising course of action, to get these countries into a situation in which they have to make a move, and to motivate them to stop sulking and making excuses for each other, and instead to say, ‘yes, we do have a shared responsibility’."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, there is another question I would like to revisit, and it is that of to what degree you are able and willing not only to involve other countries and actively engage in dialogue with them, but also other sectors as well."
"I am thinking, for example, of transport policy, the heating of private homes ..."
"Oh yes, that is something we have long been calling for, but you have never paid any attention."
"All these sectors, then, need to be involved."
"There is no doubt that there will be trouble; that is why, when I told the German minister for the environment – who is one of your party-political allies – that he should ask for that, his reply was that he could not do that, for if he did, he would lose his seat in no time."
"It is precisely for that reason, though, that he should do it, so, Commissioner, which sectors do you want to include?"
"I also believe that we have to have the courage to tackle heating in private homes – along with all the other things in our homes that give off heat and account for over one third of all CO2 emissions."
"How far are you prepared to go in highlighting new ways of dealing with this?"
"The examples are very simple, but, rather than trying to apply one standard to all, what we have to give the partners who will join us in Kyoto is targets, leaving it to them to find their own ways of reaching them."
"Who, after all, would have believed that the Federal Republic of Germany, to take one example, would, by means of a well thought-out waste policy, have saved 21 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over the last 15 years?"
"We can, though, do a lot if we are willing to motivate these countries to get stuck into this."
"Just by way of a final observation, why is there no longer any reference to agriculture in all this?"
"By this, I do not mean punishments for this sector – that is the Greens’ policy, which I have always thought misguided – but to motivating it."
"Nowhere is it written that farmers must plant only root crops, cereals, rape or vines; they could equally well grow genetically or biologically modified plants that absorb large quantities of CO2 and return it to the atmosphere only in small quantities when burned later on."
"Here too, then, there are lots of opportunities for the future and scope for being imaginative."
"Commissioner, I would urge both you and the President-in-Office of the Council to be pro-active and optimistic when tackling this issue, so that we may be able, for our children’s sake, to take the necessary steps at long last towards making this continent safe where CO2 emissions are concerned."
"I think I should begin by thanking Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for his question and for his speech, which clearly defines the issues of climate change and also suggests some answers to this problem, which will, or might ultimately, be a threat to humanity."
"I believe Europe has become a real leader in this field."
"We have managed to show the way by applying the Kyoto Protocol, but we also know that we cannot stop there, that we must continue to develop the policies we have implemented on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol."
"And while we must join with our partners to find solutions internationally, we must also, as you so rightly said, find solutions at home."
"As the March European Council showed, I think climate change is indeed a major challenge for Europe, as it is for all the industrialised and industrialising nations, but it also offers our industries new possibilities and prospects."
"To speak of the European economy being competitive certainly does not mean that industry need not rise to this challenge."
"It is quite clear that Europe is also capable of exploiting its role as an engine to become an industrial power in development technologies, especially in the realm of alternative energies; when it comes to energy savings, Europe can consolidate its leading position and benefit more economically by cooperating with other partners, countries like China in particular, which is beginning to attach greater importance to these questions for a variety of reasons, especially reasons of climate."
"I therefore believe that competitiveness and environmental protection are entirely compatible, as are competitiveness and a solution to the climate problem."
"The Council also agrees with a number of the analyses Parliament makes in its resolution on the subject, and the seminar of government experts is an important occasion here: it is in a way a new stage in the development of a future climate regime for the years after 2012."
"At this seminar, the parties will exchange views on present policies and initiatives and on the future adjustments that will have to be made to alleviate the problem of climate change."
"The European Union’s contribution to this seminar is therefore an important part of its strategy with a view to formal negotiations to draw up a post-Kyoto regime."
"The European Council which met on 22 and 23 March 2005, and of which I have already spoken in connection with relaunching the Lisbon strategy, has already adopted some key elements which will be essential for designing the future climate regime."
"It confirmed that, if the essential target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be met, the increase in the global annual average surface temperature must not be more than 2ºC above pre-industrial levels."
"It also welcomed the Commission communication entitled ‘Winning the battle against global climate change’ and in that connection clearly emphasised the need to give fresh impetus to international negotiations by exploring options for a post-2012 regime and ensuring the widest possible cooperation of all countries."
"It also stressed the need to develop a medium- and long-term EU strategy that will be compatible with the 2°C target and in that respect I believe that it answers all the concerns you have voiced and that it takes on board the suggested solutions for the various sectors to which you referred."
"During a visit by the troika to the United States on 18 and 19 April 2005, which I think the Commissioner may speak about, agreement was reached to explore ways of relaunching the EU-US High-Level Group’s activities in order to examine policies for fighting climate change."
"I can tell you that the President of the United States assured the President-in-Office of the European Council that the United States was going to adopt a more open and more sensitive approach to these problems."
"Contacts with other key parties involved in the climate change process, and I will mention China and India in particular, will be made in the months ahead."
"The issue of climate change also figures prominently on the agenda for the G8 and I know that the forthcoming British Presidency considers this problem one of its priorities."
"The European Parliament certainly has an important part to play in our joint efforts to reach an agreement on a future climate regime."
"The Council is very interested in Parliament’s position on the post-2012 framework."
"It also hopes that Parliament will continue to take part in international meetings."
"The Council also invites Parliament to assist it in heightening the awareness of European public opinion and of national parliaments in the European Union and elsewhere."
"It is not in fact rare to meet in other parliamentary fora MPs of countries that are concerned by this problem, a problem which ought to concern us all."
". Mr President, following the very informative intervention by Minister Schmit, I wish to add a few comments and perhaps come back to some of the points raised by the Minister."
"First I wish to thank the chairman, Mr Florenz, for giving us this opportunity to debate climate change and, in particular, the strategy of the European Union for the seminar of government experts on climate change due to meet in Bonn next week."
"I share Parliament's opinion that the seminar is a very timely step in working out the future arrangements with regard to climate change."
"The European Union's contribution to this seminar therefore constitutes an important part of our strategy, the aim of which is to obtain a mandate to open official negotiations on the development of these arrangements."
"On 9 February, the Commission approved its communication entitled 'Winning the battle against global climate change'."
"This communication, which is also addressed to the European Parliament, contains the Commission's initial recommendations on the European Union's strategy after 2012."
"Basic elements of the communication in question were adopted by the Environment Council on 11 March and by the European Council on 22-23 March, as Mr Schmit mentioned earlier."
"Apart from defining the elements which will comprise future arrangements, the communication also lists specific steps which need to be taken in the direction of these arrangements."
"First in importance is the need to investigate, jointly with basic partners and during the current year, both the potential for a strategy after 2012 and the shaping of a favourable climate for opening official negotiations on future arrangements."
"Three weeks ago, as Mr Schmit said, I and my colleagues from Luxembourg and the United Kingdom visited the United States and the outcome of these truly constructive talks, as you acknowledged Mr Florenz, because we had discussed all this beforehand, was the agreement to find ways of restarting, of reactivating the EU/US high-level group, with a view to examining policies to combat climate change."
"We have also scheduled contacts with other countries over coming months."
"Climate change is also high on the agenda of the G8 Group, while I personally have already held unofficial talks with my counterparts representing our basic partners both within the framework of meetings of the G8 Group and at the United Nations during talks on sustainable development."
"We met, either jointly with Mr Lux and Lord Whitty or separately, with representatives, with ministers from China, Brazil, Spain, South Africa, Australia and Russia and got their initial reactions."
"Unfortunately, we were unable to meet the Indian minister, despite the fact that we tried both in England to achieve a meeting at the meetings held by the G8 Group and in New York."
"At the same time, we are strengthening numerous informal contacts and talks at a technical level."
"As far as the seminar of government experts is concerned, this is an important opportunity to broaden these contacts at the level in question through open dialogue within the framework of the United Nations convention on climate change."
"According to the Commission's strategy, the objective of the European Union for the seminar is to create a climate of trust, to discuss and look for common ground and to send out appropriate messages, not just to the United States, but also to all the global partners."
"I should point out here that many countries are hiding – at least they have been hiding until now – behind the refusal of the United States, in order to avoid discussing the question of climate change."
"The European Union will not do likewise."
"It will send out appropriate messages by presenting our opinions and endeavouring to obtain the opinions of others on the topical issues raised in the Commission communication."
"I wish to agree with Mr Florenz that we also need to include other sectors, if we are to be able to combat climate change more effectively, including in the transport sector."
"As we said earlier, the Commission is preparing a communication for next June on the question of air transport, the contribution of which to greenhouse gas emissions is increasing constantly."
"We are examining three alternative solutions: tax, inclusion in the gas trading system or user charges."
"Similarly, we must say that the new agricultural policy supports the production of biofuels and, of course, the housing sector and the construction sector in general are very important sectors in which we can achieve important results."
"Finally, I should like to say that Parliament is being called on to play an important part in our efforts to achieve an agreement on future arrangements with regard to climate."
"The Commission is particularly interested in your opinions on the problems and on the recommendations for the European Union's strategy, as presented in our communication."
"I also anticipate that your active participation and cooperation at international conferences will continue."
"Moreover, I call for Parliament's support in further raising the awareness of the public in the European Union and of your parliamentary counterparts in other countries."
"You did a very good job in Buenos Aires and I want this work to continue with the same demands on the part of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, may I thank everyone, and especially Mr Schmit and Mr Dimas, for their contributions."
"It is in itself extremely positive that you radiate a certain optimism regarding this difficult issue, both where the problem as a whole is concerned and, specifically, when it comes to your reading of Bush."
"I wish I could be just as optimistic."
"Just the other day, George W Bush gave a speech on energy and climate change that unfortunately did not show any real movement in the right direction."
"I of course agree with you, however, that the dialogue with the United States is incredibly important because, without its active participation, the work on climate change can never be properly effective."
"It is, of course, just as important to engage in dialogue – and dialogue of a strategic nature – with large developing countries such as China and India."
"I saw the other day that China anticipates building 800 large coal-fired power stations over the next ten years."
"The emissions from these will completely overshadow what we do in Europe."
"The conclusion is, of course, that the developing countries need not go down precisely the same route in energy development as we have done."
"They need not repeat our mistakes, and it is in the interests of all of us to offer them favourable conditions for investing in the best possible technology."
"On this point, I am unfortunately compelled to note that the CDM, that is to say the Clean Development Mechanism, is not enough. Instead, we must come up with something much more radical and ambitious."
"The situation is serious, with the latest research reports in fact indicating that the climate system may be much more vulnerable than we had previously believed."
"It will be much more difficult to stay within the two-degree increase in temperature established by the EU as an objective and to avoid dangerous climate change."
"That is why the summit in Bonn is so important, for you will be able to lay a foundation for the period following 2012."
"Our resolution indicates the need for short- and long-term emissions objectives."
"We also think that such objectives need to be accompanied by far more ambitious programmes in terms both of the development of new energy sources and increased investment in energy efficiency."
"There is a range of issues in this area to which we must return and in connection with which we must together devise practical objectives."
"I wish the Commission and the Council good luck in Bonn and hope that you will come back with positive reports so that we can do this work in a way that is constructive for the future and, as Mr Florenz pointed out, accept our responsibility for future generations."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Florenz and Mr Wijkman for taking the initiative and prompting this debate."
"Commissioner, global warming is materialising much quicker than anticipated."
"We are faced with the dual task of adapting to climate change and, at the same time, of keeping it to an absolute minimum."
"In the light of this enormous challenge, the outcome of the Climate Conference in Buenos Aires was particularly disappointing."
"It is, of course, good that a seminar managed to keep the Kyoto process on the rails, if only just, and that the EU had its own way and that next week’s seminar in Bonn will be about future developments, but this is a shamefully poor result."
"We have to conclude that the EU is becoming ever more isolated, and that the urgency that is felt in Europe is not shared in other parts of the world."
"The EU will need to be constructive in Bonn if a much stronger international coalition is to be built up, and sound, productive and well-founded proposals will have to be tabled there."
"Commissioner, I would like to put to you four points which, in our view, can help achieve a constructive, international coalition."
"First of all, we must put far more work into adaptation and help others, certainly developing countries, to adapt."
"Adaptation is certainly not simple, but aid should definitely not be restricted to major disasters."
"As lifestyle adaptation is far-reaching, credible programmes must be written."
"Secondly, with regard to the transfer of technology, which has already been mentioned by Mr Wijkman, we must abandon our ideological reservations about the mechanism for clean development and go all out for investment in technology transfer, concentrating on further research and development in the area of environmental technology, to which subject I will gladly return during the debate on the seventh framework programme for research."
"Thirdly, we will need to focus far less on the national approach and objectives within each country, but far more on sectoral objectives."
"In the discussions we held as parliamentary delegation in Buenos Aires, a sectoral approach emerged as a viable route."
"We will need to enter into dialogue with the steel, cement and paper industries."
"I regard aviation as a sector to which priority should be given."
"In all these sectors, competition is worldwide, so it is obvious that worldwide objectives should be established based on the best available technology."
"Moreover, a sectoral approach is ideally suited to our Lisbon strategy, which was reviewed during the last spring summit."
"Finally, although it is more controversial for me to say this, I would ask you to consider the role that the WTO can play."
"The European Union must open the discussion on trade measures against countries that fail to meet their climate obligation."
"In that case, green trade policy is not directed against developing countries but against the richer countries, which can, in fact, result in help for developing countries."
"Commissioner, we expect from the European Union an international climate policy with ambition and with the largest possible international support base in other countries, industry and among the public."
"I wish you much success in Bonn."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is, in fact, an extremely important issue and a real issue."
"There are still some who wish to deny it, but we cannot allow ourselves to conceal the seriousness of the issue."
"Climate change derives from a two-fold shortage: the physical scarcity of energy resources and the inability of the ecosystem to absorb the flow of waste."
"It must be pointed out, in actual fact, that, as extreme events become worse, climate change creates considerable threats for the region, which must be tackled immediately."
"In the present context, greater security provisions are required: the Kyoto Protocol is only the first answer; we must move forward and provide a systematic solution."
"It is not only the issue of energy production that is at stake, but also the consumption habits of our society."
"What scares me most are the statements emerging from the United States, according to which their standard of living cannot be called into question."
"On the contrary, such a reappraisal is the very first thing that we must make possible in Europe."
"Taking the knowledge-based society seriously additionally means changing our way of life in an ever more radical way, and ensuring that our development is sustainable."
"We must seek to progress in the work of involving other countries, persuading them that we are indeed faced with the duty of transforming our society."
"We must emerge from the age of fossil fuels, and the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step; we must go beyond this and work in earnest, because we must radically alter the ways of our society."
". Mr President, last autumn a Finnish business magazine wrote that if the world had a managing director, he or she would have already started to take vigorous action to reduce emissions, and action a lot more vigorous than Kyoto."
"Some time ago, an article in the British magazine, , expressed astonishment at decision-makers who view the warnings of climate researchers with indifference."
"The magazine asked whether political decision-makers thought they lived in an alternative universe where the laws of nature did not apply, and went on to say that no one would ever view a risk of economic collapse so nonchalantly."
"After Kyoto, we will need bolder cuts in emissions and more countries to be involved."
"We will also need to involve major economically developing countries, such as China and India."
"Above all, however, it is the biggest polluter, the United States of America, which ought to recognise its responsibility."
"It is pointless trying to imagine the involvement of China and India if the richest country on earth remains a free-rider."
"The industrialised countries have to acknowledge their historical responsibility for the fact that climate change has begun generally, and, accordingly, it is we who have the main responsibility to cut emissions."
"The countries which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol are trying to gain an unfair competitive edge."
"We should seriously think about whether we can, for example, impose protective tariffs on imports into Europe of steel produced in the United States."
"The rules of the World Trade Organisation make this possible."
"Fortunately, the voice of reason is also being heard in the United States."
"Many states there have decided to take action."
"The north-eastern states are starting to engage in carbon dioxide emissions trading, and want to be part of the European Union emissions trading scheme."
"A number of city mayors have committed themselves to action at local level, and they are seeking the involvement of 141 cities, which is the same as the number of countries that have ratified Kyoto."
"Since, however, mere reason does not appear to be enough to persuade the United States to bear global responsibility, the kind of action possible under WTO rules ought to be seriously considered."
". Mr President, I fully support the resolution on climate change."
"In February, four members of our group attended the IPCC’s Climate Conference in La Réunion where we were shocked by the conclusions of the scientists that had gathered there."
"Even if we resorted to all the measures listed in the resolution, we would not be able to resolve the problem of climate change entirely."
"Even if we make every possible effort in the framework of Kyoto until 2050, we will still not be able to stop the earth from warming up by two degrees and the sea level from rising by half a metre."
"I happen to come from the Netherlands, the Low Countries, so you can imagine that this causes me some considerable anxiety."
"If the sea level increases by half a metre, large parts of my country will flood if nothing is done about it."
"The coastline as we know it will disappear."
"The Hague will disappear into the sea and with it, the embassies of all the countries represented here today, our government buildings, the International Court of Justice, the Yugoslavia Tribunal and the Palace of our Queen."
"We may, as a party, be republican, but we do not want to achieve our goals by submerging the royal palace."
"Fortunately, the Netherlands has the technical capacity to prevent this from happening, but many other countries do not."
"The disappearance of whole swathes of coastline is inevitable."
"We should prepare for that eventuality, and I would therefore urge the Commission to form an opinion on this."
"It can make a start during the forthcoming seminar which will be attended by government experts."
"I would ask the Commission at least to stand by its own measures and directives, including those for air quality."
"Since these measures are now beginning to take shape in a concrete manner, opposition from some Member States or sectors will increase and there will be a call for moderation, something that we oppose, and we would ask you, Parliament and the Council, to stand firm."
"We would also urge you not to opt for a step forward, for more nuclear energy, but instead to choose for the development of all possible alternatives, and we would ask you to stick to the text of the resolution so that the EU can continue to play its pioneering role."
"Mr President, during the last hundred years, the world has experienced an increase in temperature of approximately 0.6 degrees."
"The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted that this change mainly affects the world’s poor people."
"I wish to emphasise this, because we in this House too often see global problems from a one-sided European perspective."
"The reasons why it is mainly poor people who experience the effects of global climate change are many."
"They partly have to do with the fact that these countries’ economies are often dominated by climate-sensitive industries, especially agriculture."
"They also have few resources with which to adapt to, and protect themselves against, various changes, for example rising sea levels or reduced rainfall."
"There are also too few resources for preventive healthcare. It is thus difficult to eradicate the risk of climate-related diseases, such as malaria, from breaking out."
"The world’s rich countries need to coordinate their common efforts in combating climate change and to work in particular with preventive measures."
"My party believes that the EU should work on cross-border environmental issues. Climate change is among these."
"I thus support constructive and well thought-out proposals by the EU in this area. At the same time, I wish to emphasise that the UN Climate Conventionhasbeen ratified by189 parties."
"Thus, we cannot operate unilaterally through European institutions. We need instead also to coordinate our measures within the frameworks of other international organisations and to be alert to the UN’s competent bodies and the World Energy Council (WEC)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that the environment is an inalienable resource that must be managed to its full potential and its continuity must be guaranteed, and it is only right in our opinion and that of the , which I represent, that the Union includes this theme as one of its political and strategic priorities."
"It is not possible to enter here into the scientific merits of the theory that our planet is undergoing climate change on a geological time scale – a theory about which researchers are not in agreement – partly because of the limitations of meteorological observations in time and space."
"On the other hand, it is widely agreed that, since the beginning of the last century, the average increase in the planet’s temperature has been one of the causes of changes to the ecosystem – we only have to mention the increase in desertification by way of example."
"Assuming that the rise in temperature is recognised as being, at least in part, attributable to human activity, we agree that application of the Kyoto Protocol on the widest scale is a worthwhile and necessary attempt to limit such effects."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to encourage absolute compliance with the Protocol within the EU, and to examine every possible means of exerting political and economic pressure on countries that have not adopted said Protocol."
"– Mr President, it is very important to lay down the right preconditions so that policy on climate change, based also on the Kyoto Protocol, can start to bring about specific results."
"I agree with the previous speakers that the United States of America, China, India, Brazil and other countries need to participate."
"However, it is equally important that the right guidelines be given, so that policy and progress to limit emissions of greenhouse gases can be formulated and addressed in the long term."
"I was delighted to hear the Commissioner talk about a strategy after 2012."
"This policy must take account of the increased needs of our planet and of the pressure caused both by the population increase and our various manmade activities."
"Sustainable development cannot be achieved without developing new environmental technology and innovations, especially in the transport and energy sectors."
"We need to promote this policy not only at European Union level, but also at global level."
"The seminar of government experts must also include the question of promoting environmental technologies and innovation."
"Measures to moderate and adjust must also be based, over and above the aspect of the cost of productivity, on meeting future challenges."
"With this objective, the seminar is seen as useful in identifying the factors which currently impose the greatest burden on the environment and, consequently, in promoting the necessary environmental technologies and innovations to mitigate these harmful repercussions."
"Mr President, thank you Mr Schmit and Mr Dimas for your extremely hopeful contributions."
"I really hope that you are right in your analysis and that things are moving in the right direction."
"I should also like to thank Mr Wijkman for his work on the resolution we shall later be voting on."
"In common with many others here in the House, I share the view that the conference involving government experts is an extremely welcome development, even though I also wish to emphasise that it cannot replace summits at a higher political level, for it sometimes feels as if we have a very great deal of knowledge but that we lack the political will to do more to get on top of climate change."
"I hope that this conference can contribute to drawing attention to positive examples of the way in which the effect on climate can be reduced, especially when it comes to social planning, for it sometimes feels as if climate issues are only regarded as a peripheral environmental issue for those with a special interest in it."
"It is extremely important, however, that we integrate this approach into all of our social structuring and social planning, for it will only be then that we shall be able to achieve results."
"I also hope that the conference will include discussion of ways of integrating measures designed to reduce effects upon climate and bring about sustainable development into the WTO’s trade system, as well as into other international agreements."
"That is what is needed if more countries are to adopt the measures required, but rules of that type could also help reduce the number of those shipments that at present play such a big part in causing major climate problems."
"At present, for example, fish are hauled out of the Baltic and North Sea, transported by ’plane to Asia and packaged as ready-made meals which are then transported back and sold in the same places as the fish were landed."
"Shipments of that type cannot make economic sense or be in any way sustainable, and we must ensure that the economy is partly driven in a manner that makes it unprofitable to transport food in this way."
"Finally, good luck with the conference, and do your best to let it be known that the EU is in actual fact doing something in this area."
"We do need to do something. We need to show our electorates and citizens that we are in actual fact doing something about the greatest challenge we face, namely climate change."
"Mr President, several of the scientific studies carried out recently show that climate change is probably proceeding even more quickly than we thought and that greater reductions in the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are also needed in order to prevent this change."
"This means that the demands upon us are increasing and that the measures we need to take to reduce emissions by 60 to 80% by 2050 – which is a realistic figure – will require quite different energy and transport policies than those we have at present."
"We have, then, really only just begun."
"At the same time, we are used to saying in this House that we are better than the United States, as indeed we are, but that is not of course something that it is particularly difficult to be in the present situation."
"We saw in Buenos Aires how, at present, the United States does not only refuse to accept its own share of responsibility but also tries actively to prevent global cooperation in the climate sphere."
"That is why it is even more important that the EU dare to conduct a consistent policy involving far-reaching objectives."
"I also believe that the nation that, in the end, will be the main loser in this situation, not only ecologically but also economically, will be the United States itself because its outmoded and cumbersome energy and transport systems will force it to make even more rapid and more comprehensive adjustments further down the line."
"Mr President, last week the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted my amendment relating to the World Trade Organisation in which I propose that government experts should investigate the possibility of imposing trade sanctions at WTO level on those that remain outside the Kyoto Protocol in the future, in phase 2."
"This is a tough statement, I readily admit."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that no one is being condemned to having sanctions imposed on them here: we are simply proposing that the possibility should be investigated for the future."
"For this we shall need new opening gambits and moves, and bold ones too, in the debate on climate policy."
"I therefore ask whether we should not take the step that would make free-riding impossible and uncomfortable."
"Hopefully, the weaknesses of the Kyoto Protocol will also reveal themselves to us, so that we might learn a lesson, and so that by 2012 we might have much more effective weapons to fight climate change."
"We have to admit that Kyoto has now reached an impasse, as the global front is inadequate, partly because there are no limits for developing countries, and partly because the major polluters are on the outside."
"That makes Kyoto ineffective and causes the distortion of competition and carbon leakage."
"Even if we did all we could in the EU, it has been estimated that in future decades the proportion of emissions from the 25 EU countries will drop to below 10%, while developing countries will increase their share to over half of all emissions."
"Unless the front is made wider, the efforts of the EU will come to nothing."
"Not even the EU, however, will be safe from my WTO amendment, if it does not succeed in fulfilling its commitments."
"Political decisions and rhetoric in the EU are now in a good state, certainly, but practical development is becoming a problem."
"Progress in the reduction of emissions in the EU has come to a halt, as the easiest action to make cuts has been taken."
"Nine of the fifteen old Member States have exceeded their own Kyoto targets by more than 20%."
"Unless we can think of something radical, there is a danger that we too will have to recognise the hopelessness of the situation."
"Mr President, I believe the debate has clearly shown that there is no fundamental disagreement between the Commission, the Council and this House."
"We are all aware that the issue of climate change deserves our full attention and must be fully integrated into our policies."
"It is also the reason why the Luxembourg Presidency made sustainable development one of its major priorities, together, as part of the sustainable development strategy, with everything more specifically concerned with climate change."
"As I have already said, Europe is showing leadership in this field and must continue to do so."
"That will certainly be the case under the British Presidency."
"Europe must make its voice heard loud and clear on the international scene."
"Ultimately, I believe, no country will be able to avoid the obvious constraints that apply to us all in this regard, and if Europe continues to play its part on climate change, I think it will also succeed in winning over those who seem the most hesitant today."
"Mr President, once again I would like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to respond to some of the questions and for the discussion we had."
"With regard to the merits and weaknesses, the advantages and disadvantages of being an optimist or pessimist, as suggested by Mr Wijkman and Mrs Westlund, on this issue one should not be an optimist or pessimist but a realist."
"We must try to work with all those who realise the importance of the problem, that the problem is a global one and needs a global solution."
"With regard to the United States, mentioned by Mr Sjöstedt, Mrs Hassi and Mrs Korhola among others, I have to tell you that during our discussions with the United States authorities, we were very clear that we consider that cooperation in research and development of new technologies and the deployment of new technologies is very important, but we are not going to consider this a first step forward because it is something on which we in any case agree."
"No-one disagrees that we should use new technologies, as Mr Trakatellis said."
"We should deploy new technologies in order to fight climate change."
"That is something we have agreed."
"We should make progress."
"It is not progress if they agree at the G-8 or anywhere else that we will cooperate on development."
"That is not enough."
"We should take steps forward."
"That was made very clear to the United States because, as we correctly said earlier, other countries will refuse to cooperate and, after a few years, the developing countries of South Asia and South America and other developing countries will contribute more to the greenhouse phenomenon than the European Union and the United States combined."
"We need all countries to cooperate, to be on board."
"We will follow a common but differentiated policy because we cannot ask developing countries to contribute towards the reduction of emissions as much as the developed countries that have contributed far more up until now."
"The Commission recognises the need for the European Union to maintain its leading role in international and also domestic efforts to fight climate change, as Mr Trakatellis said."
"The Commission highlighted in its communication of 9 February ‘Winning the battle against climate change’ that we should focus on leadership by example."
"Mr Prodi said that we have a moral duty to do so."
"One of the central recommendations was that the European Council should give a clear message that the European Union wishes to engage with other countries in an open dialogue on what further multilateral action is required to address the challenge of climate change."
"Targets were mentioned."
"They have proved to be a very useful tool in environmental policy-making."
"They provide clear guidance to decision-makers in society."
"They are particularly useful to industry in the private sector."
"Thus, targets will continue to be a core element of any future climate policy regime."
"However, the timing of targets is very important."
"The exact timing should depend on the progress we make in building international support for starting negotiations on the future climate change regime."
"Once we have a mandate to start such negotiations, the European Union will need to consider putting forward the targets it is willing to set for the post-2012 period."
"I should like to respond to the suggestion made by several speakers that the European Union should use trade measures to protect our industry or other measures to offset the competitive advantages of companies in countries that do not restrict their greenhouse gas emissions."
"The European Union’s climate policy has been carefully designed to minimise costs to industry."
"That is the reason we opted for emissions trading."
"Our goal should be to work towards a future climate regime that is not only a decisive step in winning our battle against climate change, but also allows us to do so in a way that strengthens our competitiveness in clean technologies."
"Such a regime will get us much further – also in climate terms – than trade sanctions."
"With regard to the developing countries, I agree about the importance of assisting developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change."
"The European Union is the main contributor to the 2001 Bonn Political Declaration, which pledges USD 410 million per year in climate change funding for developing countries, starting this year."
"An important part of this will go to support adaptation measures."
"The European Union is also the main contributor to the Least Developed Countries Fund."
"Those countries have to face all the consequences of climate change, but they are not in a position to take the measures needed to adapt properly."
"It is our moral duty to work with them and help them."
"It is also in our interests, because in this way they will also contribute to reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases."
"I should like to underline the importance of developing and deploying new technologies, including in developing countries."
"The Commission is identifying and implementing concrete actions."
"The Commission recently agreed with China on the setting-up of two new European Union-China action plans in the area of energy: one on clean coal and the other on renewable energy and energy efficiency for which the Commission has secured initial funding."
"Once again, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the Bonn seminar and the forthcoming negotiations on the future international climate change regime."
"I am confident that Parliament will, as usual, play an important part in this debate."
"The Commission and Parliament have always been strong allies in this respect."
"I look forward to working with you in the future."
"To conclude the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution B6-0278/2005."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on small arms, ahead of the United Nations Conference in July 2005."
". Mr President, when it comes to small arms and light weapons (SALW), we all know that the world is faced with many regional conflicts where weapons of this kind, sometimes even used by children, are creating extremely dangerous and destructive situations."
"That is why the European Union is backing the Secretary-General’s call for the development of long-term strategies to end the scourge of the illicit proliferation of small arms."
"The United Nations programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects is one such strategy."
"It was adopted on 20 July 2001 and the European Union is actively seeking to apply the recommendations it contains at national, regional and world levels."
"The consequences of the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation and of the excessive build-up and uncontrolled spread of small arms lie at the heart of four of the five major challenges identified by the security strategy adopted by the European Council in 2003."
"Small arms and light weapons in fact help to exacerbate terrorism and organised crime and are a major factor in the unleashing and spread of conflict and the collapse of state structures."
"As the European strategy underlines, conflicts in which weapons of this kind are by far the principal instrument have cost the lives of nearly 4 million people since 1990 and have forced more than 18 million others to leave their homes or their countries."
"The increased access by non-state players to these stocks of arms has changed the nature and duration of conflicts."
"It is a situation that risks compromising our own security and the European Union needs to cooperate closely with its international partners in responding to it."
"We are therefore very actively preparing for the second biennial meeting of states to consider the implementation of the United Nations programme of action on small arms and light weapons, to be held in New York in mid-July."
"In connection with preparations for this important event, the Presidency has compiled a list of subjects that should be given priority in the competent international fora."
"This list, which is awaiting approval, includes in particular the illicit brokering of small arms, control of transfers, verification of end use, the link between security and development, the management of weapons held by the military and security forces, the creation of machinery for implementing the UN action plan, the possession of small arms by civilians, transfer to non-state players and technical assistance for the submission and presentation of reports."
"More particularly, the European Union stresses the importance of creating a group of government experts immediately following the 2006 conference that will examine the programme of action; the group will consider further measures to strengthen international cooperation to prevent, combat and eradicate illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons."
"Another of our key priorities is to negotiate an international instrument for the identification and tracing of such weapons."
"The open-ended working group responsible for negotiating this instrument has the European Union’s full support."
"At the two meetings held by the working group of diplomats and experts up until now, the European Union and the other parties have explained and confirmed their priorities on the different aspects, in particular the type of instrument, its scope and definitions, the marking and tracing of small arms and ammunition, registration and international cooperation."
"The European Union notes the progress made at these talks, while regretting that the participating states remain divided on the two big issues of the type of instrument and the inclusion of ammunition."
"The European Union itself is working to see the adoption of a legally binding instrument to complement the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms."
"It is also insisting that this instrument should include suitable provisions on ammunition."
"After all, only a steady supply of ammunition enables illicit small arms and light weapons to continue to wreak havoc."
"If we can prevent trafficking in ammunition, however, we will be able to silence the weapons themselves."
"If the working group reaches a positive outcome at its final session in June 2005, the EU will do all it can to see that the instrument comes into force quickly."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is also very active in this field, both internally and through its bilateral aid to third countries."
"In the EU itself, the Council adopted the Code of Conduct on Conventional Arms Exports in 1998."
"This makes for improved exchanges of information between Member States and strengthens mutual understanding of their export control policies, including requirements for an end-user certificate or appropriate documents or a form of official authorisation issued by the country of final destination, which must be meticulously checked."
"As you know, the code of conduct is currently being revised; it will cover virtually all activities closely or remotely connected with arms transfers."
"So far as assistance to third countries is concerned, following a few limited common actions, in 2002 the European Union adopted a common action and on that basis launched specific actions involving projects for the collection and destruction of weapons in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Balkans."
"In the matter of those weapons, the Council is willing to report to this House periodically and to work closely with you."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the European Commission obviously approves the constant efforts being made by the United Nations and other players in the fight against the serious effects of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons."
"We welcome the renewed attention being paid to this issue and we are looking forward impatiently to taking part in the biennial meeting of States to be held in New York in July 2005."
"We are very grateful to the European Parliament for taking the initiative of drawing attention to this forthcoming event."
"The Commission will be studying the proposals made in the Parliamentary resolutions very closely."
"We recognise that the build-up and spread of these weapons aggravates conflicts, feeds terrorism, hampers reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of conflicts and reduces the prospects for sustainable development."
"It is therefore essential that we tackle these questions through multinational partnerships combining preventive and responsive measures and it is also essential that we use the United Nations instruments to that end."
"The effectiveness of the fight against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons depends on communication and cooperation between states."
"The Commission favours a multilateral approach and has committed a number of its services to different projects in this area."
"It is important to stress that, if an answer is to be found to this problem, action must be taken in several directions, ranging from development aid proper to reform of the security sector, by way of the actual destruction of these weapons."
"Some of these areas are matters of Community competence, others unfortunately are not."
"In its violent conflict prevention programme, the European Union recognises that by endeavouring to eliminate small arms as a source of destabilisation and conflict it would make a major contribution to preventing renewed acts of violence."
"The European Union is trying to achieve this through international cooperation, financial and technical assistance programmes and effective arms control."
"Through the European Development Fund, the Commission is financing a number of actions involving the demobilisation of ex-combatants and their reintegration into society and the collection and destruction of these arms."
"In a very large number of cases, these actions are implemented through specific demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration programmes."
"In other cases, however, the reintegration of ex-combatants has been included in broader programmes for the development or rehabilitation of post-conflict areas."
"These programmes seek to bring about an overall improvement in the economic and social structures of the areas affected by a conflict by helping to reintegrate former combatants and their families into civilian life."
"A number of questions relating to the cross-border transfer of these weapons are currently being examined for next year’s conference."
"In particular, a treaty on the arms trade is being discussed."
"The Commission will be actively involved in the debate on these subjects that will be held in the Council."
"It would be premature to discuss these points in detail at present, since some of them will have to be examined in depth by several commissioners."
"The European Union has also on several occasions called for legally binding instruments on arms brokering and the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons at the United Nations conference and the follow-up meetings on the illicit trade in small arms in 2001 and 2003."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figure of four million victims just quoted by the President-in-Office of the Council shows how important this topic is."
"We are all agreed that small arms have to be prevented from getting into the wrong hands."
"Here in Europe, in the European Union, the state has a monopoly on the use of armed force, and that is of enormous benefit."
"Circumstances here are different from those in the United States, where this is not understood in the same way."
"What that means is that the use of small arms is reserved to soldiers and police officers, with special arrangements being made for those engaged in hunting and in shooting as a sport."
"It is vitally important that every single weapon here in this European Union of ours is actually registered, or in other words that its origin is known."
"A problem arises when these weapons find their way into countries outside the European Union, and this is what makes it so important that the code of conduct on the export of arms, as it stands at present, should be further tightened up and that we prevent, in so far as possible, at least the supply of weapons to the trouble spots where, in fact, this extraordinary number of people are killed."
"To do so will involve developing a tracking system, in which every single purchase or sale of such weapons is recorded by being entered in an international register, thus making it possible to trace a specific weapon back to its origin and to its manufacturer, and to determine who was responsible for it being sold and who for it being passed on."
"For this, international agreements are needed, and that is what makes it especially important that we, in this House, should play our part in actually taking these projects – set in motion by the United Nations – further and bringing them to a successful conclusion."
". Mr President, whilst the world has focused on weapons of mass destruction, it is right that we look today at the 650 million small arms and light weapons in circulation worldwide."
"Almost one person every minute is killed by the bullet from a gun and two million children have been killed in the last decade."
"These arms escalate and provoke prolonged conflicts."
"They facilitate violent crime and they are used for terrorism."
"It is in Europe’s interest to limit small arms for our own security, to protect foreign investment and to promote development."
"That means integrating small arms into Europe’s security development and governance programmes."
"It is not simply a question of supporting ad hoc disarmament, demobilisation and reconstruction programmes as part of our crisis management response, we have to mainstream this into broader development assistance programmes and include it in our political dialogue with all other countries and regions worldwide."
"As a follow-up to the EU security strategy, it means developing a comprehensive EU disarmament and arms control strategy."
"This should integrate with civil society initiatives, just as NGOs should be able to contribute actively to the UN biannual meeting of states in July."
"It means, as we say in the resolution, new impetus for the UN consultations on combating illicit brokering."
"Here in the EU, our Member States have only to consider applying these controls to our citizens operating outside of the European Union."
"Yet these brokers deliberately travel overseas to ply their trade."
"I would have liked, this afternoon, to have heard a commitment from the Luxembourg presidency to strengthen the common position to make it mandatory to control EU nationals involved in arms brokering, wherever they are based."
"Finally, it means limiting the supply of arms overall."
"Action by the EU to control the proliferation of small arms in fragile states is undermined by our role as major arms exporters."
"Good as the EU code of conduct is, strengthened as it must be, German armaments used in Burma arrive there only because they were exported via Ukraine, which is not bound by our EU rules."
"It shows why regional agreements alone are not enough."
"That is why I welcome the commitment from my own government in the United Kingdom and from the Finnish Government, as well as the recommendation of the High Level Panel of the United Nations to champion an international arms trade treaty."
"Arms transfers must be subject to legal controls, not just in the EU, but across the world."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking both the Commission and the Council and all the other Members of this House for having accepted the invitation to deal once again with this issue — the scourge of small arms in the world."
"Because today, as has been pointed out, these are the real weapons of mass destruction, not just because of the millions of victims they cause every year, but because of their social and political consequences."
"The lack of control of pistols, revolvers, assault rifles, grenades, machine guns and similar weapons has had dramatic consequences for the security and integrity of millions of people throughout the world."
"In some countries, such as Brazil, Colombia or El Salvador, it is estimated that violence involving this type of weapon is responsible for the loss of 10% of gross domestic product."
"At the request of civil society and in particular the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), in July 2001 the United Nations held a conference in New York during which an action programme was adopted to prevent, combat and eliminate every aspect of the illegal trade in small and light arms."
"Next July, the governments of the Member States of the United Nations will meet again in New York for the bi-annual meeting on the implementation of this action plan, and the review conference is scheduled for a year later."
"The action programme urges the governments to control the production and sale of this type of weapon, to mark pistols in order to facilitate their identification once they have been sold, to penalise the production and possession of illegal weapons, to identify and destroy surplus weapons and to establish final use certificates for export and transit, amongst other measures."
"Since 2001, considerable progress has been made, particularly in the field of national legislations."
"It is still necessary, however, to develop and implement general recommendations."
"Within this context, the European Union and its Member States must continue to lead the debate."
"The current process of reviewing the code of conduct offers a good opportunity to do so."
"I must say that, in general terms, I am optimistic, especially since the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, not just today, but on other occasions, has insisted on the need to go further and urge the governments to produce a legally binding text on brokering and transfers of small arms."
"Nevertheless, other data makes me a little more wary, such as, for example, the fact that few European Union countries have expressed support for the establishment of an international treaty on the arms trade."
"So far, only Finland and the United Kingdom have expressed firm support for the idea, although Spain has also made comments in this regard, and we would therefore like more details to be provided."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is urgent that we provide real impetus for the establishment of an international treaty on the trade in weapons which should be possible immediately after the review conference on the United Nations action plan in July 2006."
"This is not just necessary, but clearly of vital importance."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the world in which we live nearly 700 million weapons are in circulation and a further eight million are produced each year."
"Businesses are manufacturing them, brokers are putting them on sale, governments and individuals are buying and selling them and people are dying: at the rate of one a minute."
"With those words Amnesty International has recently launched the Marking and Tracing project, a treaty under which States undertake to adopt measures for identifying all weapons and ammunition with a serial number that cannot be falsified nor destroyed."
"This represents a necessary step in preventing the illegal trade in arms."
"For as long as arms remain unidentifiable, States and businesses will always deny responsibility for them."
"The European Union should actively support this campaign."
"From 1999 to 2003, Italy, for instance, as the second most important small arms manufacturer in the world and the first at European level, sold, in defiance of legislative decrees, EUR 36 million of arms to countries involved in armed conflicts, EUR 3.6 million to nations under embargo and EUR 128 million to countries condemned for human rights violations."
"On the other hand, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council control 88% of the global market in arms."
"For all of these reasons, it is essential that the European Union adopts the treaty on arms brokering drafted by a group of NGOs and Nobel prize winners, and launches a convention on arms brokers that, , makes any activity with the aim of transferring arms between third parties subject to state authorisation."
"The European Union must improve its code of conduct on the transfer of arms, clarifying the circumstances in which it is possible to refuse an authorisation to export arms, extending checks to all military equipment, forcing individual States to bring in legislation in compliance with the code of conduct and to publish an annual report on their respective arms exports."
"We cannot forget that it is precisely small arms that are responsible for nearly the entire sum of deaths in conflicts taking place across our world."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Schmit and Mr Michel for their speeches, which I found to be notable fundamentally for their level of commitment."
"This commitment — which we all have an interest in making — is demonstrated by two areas of work: firstly, to put an end to the lack of control of the arms trade and, in this regard, we must insist on the need for mechanisms allowing for control from the point at which the weapon is manufactured until the point it is used, that is to say, we must achieve international control."
"Secondly, it is fundamental and very important — as other Members have said — that we prepare the conditions to ensure that at the 2006 meeting we can make progress and achieve a genuine international treaty to regulate every aspect of the arms trade."
"We Europeans must continue to offer an example."
"It is very important that, in the debate we are holding on the code of conduct, we ensure firstly that it become more restrictive and, above all, binding on every Member State."
"If we all work in this direction, I believe that Europe will be able to make a modest contribution to putting an effective end to this lack of control, which leads to the majority of the suffering of many populations and to many territorial conflicts."
"I would, therefore, very much hope that we can combine our wills in this way so that, within no more than two years, we can put an end to this scourge of humanity."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are all agreed that conventional weapons, and particularly small arms, still cause the largest number of victims worldwide."
"They are fairly readily available on the market at relatively low cost, and are far too often an obstacle to sustainable development and reconstruction processes."
"It is right that we should examine our own consciences, for in my own country, important arms exports have been set up to conflict areas in the past."
"Commissioner Michel is well placed to give you a full account and his assessment."
"Let me remind you of the supply of arms to Nepal or the Democratic Republic of Congo where, since August 1998, more than three million people have been killed."
"The President-in-Office, Mr Schmit, talked about cutting off the arms supplies."
"That is why the Tanzanian project and the construction of an arms factory deserve our undivided attention."
"This project must be stopped."
"I would repeat with great emphasis the political request made by fellow Members to the Presidency-in-Office to ensure that a political pledge is made that an international treaty on the trade in conventional weapons is drafted."
"This treaty on arms trade should come about with the support of the 25 Member States without delay, if at all possible."
"Mr President, there are two particular proposals from this House that I will take on board and pass on to the Council, proposals which I think the Commissioner has also noted. First of all, the strengthening of the control mechanisms within the European Union itself to make it easier to trace the route taken by arms, since this information helps us to uncover, spotlight and identify the existing and growing export trade in this type of arms."
"Secondly, the idea of an international treaty. There are in fact a number of exporters sending large quantities of small arms to all parts of the world, and those exporters are not necessarily Member States of the European Union."
"Some industrialising countries have in fact become exporters in this field, and the only way of effectively controlling exports of this kind, which underlie the regional conflicts to which several speakers have alluded, is to have much stronger international commitments and also a sounder and more effective system of control."
"The European Union must in my opinion take the initiative with such a treaty and support the Secretary-General’s efforts to that end, because we want to play a part there."
"As someone has said, and Mr Michel knows this, we want successfully to conduct a peace mission across part of Africa in particular, and peace will only have a chance if we can manage to break the supply lines for such weapons, since they are often the weapons of the developing countries, the weapons of the poor."
"As I said, they often put weapons into the hands of child soldiers, and that is one of the most horrible things you can imagine."
"Mr President, I believe it has been repeated often enough."
"It is obvious that preventing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a European Union priority objective."
"Equally obviously, it must also be a priority objective of the Member States."
"It is particularly regrettable that the European code of conduct is not binding."
"At any rate, it is not binding in every country, and I can tell you from personal experience that it only takes one country to refuse an export licence and other European countries are quick to present themselves as candidates to fill the unplaced order."
"We should not deceive ourselves."
"In my country, for example, the law now makes provision for this scenario, and there is normally a requirement, but obviously it needs to become the norm."
"Also, even if we had a binding code, that does not mean that the European Union’s outside competitors would abide by it."
"Having said that, I am of course the first to want to make such a code mandatory."
"There are three considerations I would like to mention."
"First, traceability is a very important aspect, since it enables us to trace back the entire route the arm has taken."
"I would also like to draw your attention to a new perspective that may be interesting."
"Research is being carried out in Europe today, not only to ensure that the arm can be traced, but even to disable it remotely."
"Research in this area is already well advanced and I believe we should support initiatives of this kind."
"I would also like to mention a number of projects and actions being conducted by several of our Member States."
"Some of them, for example, are suggesting to populations who own weapons and are prepared to hand them in that they might exchange those weapons for bicycles."
"I can tell you that this is the kind of action we should also be encouraging in Africa."
"Another consideration is this. I am quite familiar with the African problem and I can assure you that it is not the European Union that is supplying the largest number of small arms to Africa."
"I accept that we must show the way and that we must even beat our breasts from time to time, but all the same we should not end up believing that all those arms came from the European Union."
"Most of those arms do not come from the European Union, they come from other countries and in particular from the unused leftovers of certain armies."
"I could name some countries, but I will not."
"But it is obvious that some know, and that they know very well, whom I am talking about."
"That is therefore nevertheless a very important factor."
"Regarding the treaty on the arms trade, which introduces compulsory national-based approvals for all international arms transfers and puts in place effective machinery for permits and licences, we do of course support such measures and I hope that in a few months’ time we will have made that kind of progress."
"The explicit restrictions on arms transfers where there is a breach of obligations under international law, in the case, for example, of breaches of UN arms embargos, of customary law, of international treaties between the contracting parties or where there is a failure to observe international prohibitions on certain weapons, such as anti-personnel land mines, the restrictions, too, on transfers based on use where, for example, it is brought to a contracting party’s notice that the arms being transferred are likely to be used in complete violation of international humanitarian law or of human rights for the commission of genocide or crimes against humanity."
"These restrictions are all manifestly important aspects of this treaty."
"However, the present text remains very vague in a number of areas."
"Its main purpose is to get a sufficient number of governments to agree on the principle of an international legal instrument on arms transfers."
"The NGOs are trying to create some momentum around the idea of a treaty before tackling the details."
"The treaty has been conceived as a framework convention that may be added to by protocols concerning, among other things, arms brokering or manufacture under licence."
"As always in such cases, however, maximum pressure will be required to get all states to subscribe to it, because if it is always the same States which subscribe and the same other States which do not, discouragement is bound to set in."
"Finally, given that reference has been made to my personal experience, I would like to end by saying that it is sometimes difficult to judge whether an arms export licence should be granted or not."
"In fact, in some cases, Mr Staes, where, for example, the army or police of a country that is perhaps not necessarily a democracy asks for access to arms or to buy them and that same government, that same country, is faced with really very dangerous rebels who, for example, make use of human shields when attacking police stations or schools, it is extremely difficult, as a responsible politician, to make a choice."
"What I am really trying to say is that you never have the choice between a good and a bad solution, you always have the choice between two bad solutions."
"I do know what you are referring to and I can assure you, to answer your question, that if I had my time over again I would take exactly the same decision, because in my heart of hearts I do believe that was the decision I had to take."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 26 May."
"The next item is the report (A6-0094/2005) by Mrs Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of an Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, as provided in the Central Bank Statute and the Treaties, we are required to replace the members of the Central Bank’s Executive Board by rotation to ensure that it has some continuity in the exercise of its responsibilities."
"Today, we salute the way in which Mr Padóa-Schioppa, the predecessor of the person whose candidature we are to examine, carried out his duties on the Executive Board."
"I believe that in his relations with our institution and more widely in his capacity as the Executive Board’s external representative, he showed great talent and a thorough grasp of these questions."
"The candidate whose nomination we are to examine today is Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi."
"Your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been able to question him first of all in writing following the questionnaire procedure with which we are familiar and then verbally at a hearing, where the members of the committee reached a consensus."
"We were able to check that there is no doubt as to his expertise and professional ability in the light of the job he will have to do."
"He has all the abilities to be a good central banker together with two additional assets I would like to mention: an ability to communicate, which is certainly very useful for a central banker, and also a vision enriched by a multidisciplinary approach."
"Whether the mindset of a central banker is enough to make a good Executive Board member, or whether it requires a broader vision and outlook is something we have debated a number of times."
"It seems to us that Mr Bini Smaghi will be able to contribute this multidisciplinary approach to the Executive Board’s discussions and that this will make monetary policy more responsive to the needs of the real economy and to the public’s aspirations."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin, on behalf of the Commission, as Mrs Berès has done, by paying tribute to the work carried out by Mr Padóa-Schioppa during his mandate as a member of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank."
"I believe he has demonstrated skill, respect for his institutional responsibilities and a professionalism that is beyond all suspicion; a professionalism that has also been demonstrated by Mr Bini Smaghi throughout his career."
"The European Commission does not participate in the formal procedure for selecting and appointing members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, but it has been lucky enough to work with and know Mr Bini Smaghi for a long time in his role as a highly qualified and very experienced economist in the Banca d'Italia and in his work within the Italian administration and also within the context of his very active participation in the Economic and Financial Committee, within which, until he was appointed as a member of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, he has been chairman of the subcommittee on monetary and financial affairs."
"I believe him to be an absolutely ideal person to carry out the duties being entrusted to him and, therefore, although, as I have said, we do not participate in a formal manner, we will be extremely pleased if Parliament supports this appointment, just as the Ecofin Council did."
"I would like to make a final comment."
"The Commission does not participate in the procedure, but it is the guardian of the Treaties, and we have monitored extremely closely whether the Treaties and the rules in force have been complied with throughout all the stages of Mr Bini Smaghi’s appointment."
"They have, in fact;"
"I had the opportunity to say so during the Ecofin meeting that unanimously proposed him as a candidate."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to say that there are still four Member States of the eurozone which have yet to participate in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland and Portugal)."
"The fact that during the last two replacements of members of the Executive Board of the Central Bank, the institutions have appointed people of the same nationality as the person being replaced in no way prevents the Commission from pointing out that the procedure must not take account of the nationality of the outgoing person, but rather of the professional competence of the new candidate, as has undoubtedly been the case here."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès, we in this House are in agreement as regards the qualities of Mr Padóa-Schioppa, who has left the ECB’s Executive Board."
"We are grateful to him for his work and for his cooperation with us."
"Having endorsed his successor’s nomination, we are in agreement about his qualifications too; we take a favourable view of him, and wish him every success."
"I would like to take this debate as a starting point, by saying that I agree with the Commissioner, that there must be nothing automatic about nominations being made by certain countries, and that it would have been a good thing if we had had several candidates for the seats available, and hence a competing array of qualities, principles, opinions and fundamental beliefs to choose from."
"That this was not the case on this occasion is no discredit to Mr Bini Smaghi, but it is something we have to highlight."
"Thirdly, it has to be said that the European Central Bank plays a very important role, and does it very well, by virtue of its independence, and also as the euro’s guardian and the driving force behind it. We would urge Mr Bini Smaghi to join his fellow Executive Board members in upholding these principles."
"In this respect, the changes to the Stability and Growth Pact will give the European Central Bank an even more important role, in cooperation with the Commission."
"One thing I think we should do is to compare the two sets of statistics that we are given, in order to ensure that there are no discrepancies in the way countries are assessed;"
"I am also thinking here of the ECB’s public statements and assessments as guardian of price stability, as regards the size of the Member States’ budgets, the things they spend their budgets on and the breakdown of their tax receipts."
"What we need is a strong and independent Central Bank, enabling the euro to continue on its successful course."
". – In my opinion, Parliament should vote in favour of appointing Mr Smaghi to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), in line with the draft recommendation drawn up by Mrs Berès."
"Personally, I feel that I must point out the candidate’s timely support and defence of the Constitutional Treaty."
"His appointment offers us the opportunity to reiterate some of the aspects that have proved crucial in the European Central Bank’s approach to the EU’s economic situation and especially its contribution to a swift and solid recovery."
"Mr Smaghi’s appointment follows the Council’s decision that significantly amended the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact and that was intended to improve its procedures."
"The ECB is known to have initially been opposed to any changes in the regulations, and even went as far as to threaten to raise interest rates."
"It later came to accept the changes laid down by the Council, but always did so tentatively and conservatively."
"Whilst it is true that the Stability and Growth Pact comprises a pillar for preventing and a pillar for remedying, it is also true that this political, economic and financial instrument must be implemented across the board."
"It is unacceptable that so-called relevant factors and exceptional circumstances, now identified and formalised by the Council, should be reduced to small amendments to the regulations in force."
"The reading of the document adopted by the Council is clear and unequivocal, and indeed comprises substantial amendments to the model currently in force."
"To ignore this fact, or simply to reduce it to formalities and cosmetic amendments, is completely wrong."
"Despite all of the ECB’s efforts to control and keep a lid on prices, and its indisputable success in achieving this aim, the EU’s economy is a long way from showing clear signs of recovery and has certainly not managed to solve the main problem, which is unemployment."
"The International Monetary Fund indeed recently urged the ECB to reduce interest rates again."
"This forms part of the new framework adopted by the Council for supervising, monitoring and remedying fiscal imbalances."
"What is at stake is not wholesale budgetary deregulation, but the EU’s economic and social recovery, for which the ECB must take a great deal of credit."
"The ECB’s executive board must not overlook this inevitability and the newly-appointed board Member must ensure that it is on his political agenda."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor to explain why I voted against the appointment of Professor Bini Smaghi."
"Although he is a rigorous scholar recognised for being straightforward and highly competent, he has declared himself in favour of policies that are utterly unacceptable."
"At the end of the hearing he upheld the need for the ECB not to cut interest rates."
"He supported ratification of the Constitution, of course, because in fact it facilitates the work of the European Central Bank."
"For us, the ECB is the mother of all usury: it actually deprives the paper money that it allows to be printed of its exchange value and controls the interest rates applied by the Member States’ banks, thus subjecting consumers to extortionate terms."
"In addition, he said that he supports the Stability Pact, which limits the freedom of the Member States."
"Lorenzo Bini Smaghi has publicly stated that the institutions created by the Bretton-Woods Agreements – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – hold the stability of the international financial system among their rightful objectives, but he does not agree that, for the sake of such stability, they have contributed to poverty and a widening of the gap between rich and poor."
"In our view, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ECB represent the interests of a tiny minority of technocrats and of big transnational finance, which grows rich on financial speculation."
"These are institutions that have decreed the ruin of whole nations: just think of the case of Yugoslavia, first strangled by extortionate interest rates and then crushed, destroyed and dismembered."
"We were therefore certainly not voting against the person, who is someone we admire, but against an institution that we cannot accept and in fact positively condemn."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Bini Smaghi on his nomination."
"I look forward to working with him."
